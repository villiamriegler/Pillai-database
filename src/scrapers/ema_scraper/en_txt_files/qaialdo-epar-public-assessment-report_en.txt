2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is initiated when an 'index event' causes the pumping 
capacity of the heart to be impaired. Reduced pumping capacity of the heart results in compensatory 
activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which 
together is referred to as 'neurohormonal activation'. Drug therapy of heart failure is based on the use 
of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, beta blockers, and vasodilators. 
Spironolactone is used in the management of oedema associated with excessive aldosterone excretion 
such as idiopathic oedema and oedema accompanying cirrhosis of the liver, nephrotic syndrome, and 
heart failure, usually in conjunction with other diuretics. Spironolactone is a useful adjunct to thiazide 
therapy when diuresis is inadequate or reduction of potassium excretion is necessary. 
Spironolactone is used for the short-term preoperative treatment of primary hyperaldosteronism and 
for long-term maintenance therapy in patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas 
who are not candidates for surgery (e.g., adrenalectomy). 
This centralised application for a marketing authorisation concerns a hybrid application according to 
article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC for Qaialdo (spironolactone), 10 mg/ml oral suspension. The 
application has been submitted by the applicant Nova Laboratoires Ireland Ltd. 
The Reference medicinal product is Aldactone 100 mg film-coated tablets (MAA No: PA0822/110/003, 
Pfizer Healthcare Ireland) authorised since 1975. Compared to the reference medicinal product, 
Qaialdo  has a different pharmaceutical form (oral suspension) and strength. Qaialdo has the same 
therapeutic indications and route of administration as Aldactone. 
One bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed using the reference medicinal product, Aldactone 
100 mg, film coated tablets. The test product (oral spironolactone suspension 10 mg/ml, Batch 
number: NOVg110) and the reference product (Aldactone, Pfizer Healthcare, Ireland), Batch number: 
NOVPh113, sourced from Ireland) were compared in healthy males and females under fed conditions. 
(Study No. INV684 (0207FRM19). 
Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone. It acts primarily through the 
competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the 
distal convoluted renal tubule, where it combines with soluble cytoplasmic aldosterone receptors to 
form complexes which are inactive and which do not bind to nuclear-acetylated sites, thus preventing a 
chain of biochemical events leading to the synthesis of physiologically active proteins. Spironolactone 
causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. 
Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/175439/2023  
Page 10/38 
 
 
 
 
 
reduced Na+ reabsorption caused by spironolactone induces the electrical potential across the tubular 
epithelium to fall. Qaialdo oral suspension has been developed to substitute for oral tablet formulations 
of spironolactone, where an oral suspension is clinically beneficial/required to improve acceptability 
and compliance such as in young children who find swallowing tablets difficult, older patients who 
prefer liquid medicines and patients with dysphagia. It is presented as a ready to use oral suspension, 
and hence there is no need for reconstitution or special precautions in preparation of a dose for oral 
administration. The strength of the proposed liquid formulation of spironolactone is 10 mg in 1 mL. 
The posology is the same as that of Aldactone, specifically up to 400 mg/day depending on the 
indication. Additionally, two dosing syringes are provided for accurate measurement of the prescribed 
dose of the oral suspension. 
Proposed indications 
In the management of refractory oedema associated with congestive cardiac failure; hepatic cirrhosis 
with ascites and oedema, malignant ascites, nephrotic syndrome, diagnosis and treatment of primary 
aldosteronism, essential hypertension. 
Children should only be treated under guidance of a paediatric specialist. There is limited paediatric 
data available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Spironolactone should be taken with meals. 
To assist accurate and consistent dose delivery to the stomach, water should be taken after each dose 
of Spironolactone. 
Spironolactone is for oral use and requires redispersing (by shaking the bottle) prior to dosing. 
Two dosing syringes (a 1 ml syringe and a 5 ml syringe both graduated in 0.1 ml increments, allowing 
accurate and reproducible dosing in 1 mg increments) are provided for accurate measurement of the 
prescribed dose of the oral suspension. It is recommended that the healthcare professional advises the 
patient or carer which syringe to use to ensure that the correct volume is administered. 
In adults without swallowing difficulties, solid oral formulations may be more appropriate and 
convenient. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as an oral suspension containing 10 mg/ml of spironolactone as 
active substance. 
Other ingredients are: sodium benzoate (E 211), sucrose, sodium citrate (E 331), citric acid 
monohydrate (E 330), strawberry flavour liquid, masking flavour, polysorbate 80 (E 433), simeticone 
emulsion 30%, xanthan gum (E 415) and purified water. 
The product is available in amber type III glass bottles with tamper evident child-resistant closures 
(high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with expanded polyethylene liners), as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. Each pack contains one bottle with 150 mL of oral suspension, a low-density polyethylene

(LDPE) bottle adaptor and 2 dosing syringes (a 1 ml and a 5 ml syringe both graduated in 0.1 ml 
increments). The oral syringes and bottle adaptor are CE-marked. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of spironolactone is S-[(2′R)-3,5′-dioxo-3′,4′-dihydro-5′H-spiro[androst-4-ene-
17,2′-furan]-7α-yl] ethanethioate corresponding to the molecular formula C24H32O4S. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 416.57 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
Spironolactone is a white or yellowish-white powder, practically insoluble in water, but soluble in 
ethanol (96 per cent).  
Polymorphism has been observed for spironolactone.  
Spironolactone is a BCS Class II drug (low solubility/high permeability). As a result, particle size may 
influence solubility. The active substance is micronised to achieve a particle size distribution ensuring 
consistent performance in terms of product homogeneity and dissolution for the finished product oral 
suspension formulation.  
The manufacturer of spironolactone has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for the active substance in regard of compliance with Ph. Eur. monograph 0688, 
which has been provided within the Marketing Authorisation Application. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Spironolactone is supplied from a single manufacturer.  
The relevant information has been assessed by EDQM before issuing the CEP. 
The  container  closure  system  of  the  active  substance  (double  polyethylene  bags  placed  in  cardboard 
box) is covered by the CEP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175439/2023  
Page 12/38 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes the specification and methods of the Ph. Eur. Monograph 
0688, additional test in accordance with the CEP (residual solvents) and in-house test for particle size 
distribution. Tests are: identity, assay, related substances, specific optical rotation, free thiol 
compounds, loss on drying and sulphated ash (all Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction, Ph. Eur.). 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial batches of active substance were provided. The results were 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The compendial methods and the GC method for residual solvents were evaluated by EDQM in view of 
the CEP. The particle size distribution method has been adequately validated and described according to 
ICH Q2.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
As prescribed in the CEP, the re-test period of the substance is 5 years if stored in double PE bags, 
placed in a carboard box. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white to off-white viscous oral suspension containing 10 mg/ml of 
spironolactone. 
The aim of the product development was: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To produce a liquid formulation of spironolactone suitable for dosing to children, allowing 
precise dose adjustment using a graduated oral syringe. 
To produce a chemically and physically stable formulation. 
To ensure a pleasant taste of the formulation which is acceptable to the paediatric population. 
To ensure that the levels of preservatives are adequate but not excessive for paediatric use. 
To provide a pack optimised for the formulation. 
To design a manufacturing process capable of consistently meeting the required quality goals. 
The active substance spironolactone shows polymorphism. Data on formulation development studies 
are adequate.  
Spironolactone is known to be bitter tasting, therefore, an effective taste masking system was required 
in view of palatability for a paediatric population. The palatability of the proposed formulation was also 
assessed by a questionnaire following ingestion of the oral liquid during the bioequivalence study. 
The product development was carried out especially considering the requirements of the paediatric 
population. The proposed formulation contains no alcohol or colouring agents. No evidence of any 
Assessment report  
EMA/175439/2023  
Page 13/38 
 
 
 
 
 
incompatibility between the excipients or between the active substance and the excipients has been 
found.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards (except flavouring agents/ manufacturer specification and simethicone 30% emulsion/ USP). 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation contains the antimicrobial preservative sodium benzoate. Adequate data on 
preservative selection, justifying concentration and nature, has been provided. The preservative 
efficacy studies (in line with Ph. Eur. 5.1.3) along with the stability data demonstrate that the chosen 
preservative in the respective concentration is effective in preventing microbial growth.  
Preservative efficacy was confirmed via stability testing of unopened product, and via in-use testing of 
product from batches at the beginning and end of the shelf life.  
In order to respond to an MO on accuracy of dosing, the applicant has amended the syringe sizes 
which will be included in the product pack to a 1-mL syringe and a 5-mL syringe, both graduated with 
0.1 mL dose increments. This to achieve the necessary dosing accuracy for all intended patients, 
including those who require very low doses such as neonates. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. The method was found to 
be discriminatory for changes in sucrose content of the formulation and for changes in the polymorphic 
form of spironolactone.  
The formulation used in the bioequivalence (BE) study is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The bioequivalence (BE) study was performed between the proposed product and the reference 
product Aldactone 100 mg tablets. The results of the study indicate that the test product is equivalent 
to the reference product with respect to the extent of absorption of spironolactone, but not with 
respect to the rate of absorption. This might be due to the difference in formulations: the test product 
is an immediate release oral suspension, while the reference product is a film-coated tablet. Further 
discussion and conclusion on the clinical relevance of the results of the BE study can be found in the 
Clinical Pharmacology section of this report. 
Comparison of dissolution profiles of reference and test product was not provided, but since the 
products are not equivalent with respect to the rate of absorption, this is not relevant.  
The provided dissolution results for process validation batches, stability batches and the BE batch (all 
meeting the dissolution acceptance criteria) were considered sufficient to demonstrate consistency and 
reproducibility of the manufacturing process of this immediate release pharmaceutical form. 
The manufacturing process is a standard process which does not involve any novel steps.  
The primary packaging is an amber type III glass bottle with tamper evident child-resistant closure 
(HDPE with expanded polyethylene liner), as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The materials 
comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Each pack contains one bottle containing 150 mL of oral suspension, an LDPE bottle adaptor and 2 
dosing syringes (a 1 ml and a 5 ml syringe both graduated in 0.1 ml increments). Oral syringes and 
bottle adaptor are CE-marked. Compliance with EU Regulation 10/2011 is declared both for the oral 
syringes and for the bottle adaptor. The syringes have been assessed for dose accuracy and precision 
following the guidance in Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 and EMEA/CHMP/QWP/178621/2004 (Guideline on the 
suitability of the graduation of delivery devices for liquid dosage forms).

2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of a series of mixing and homogenisation steps followed by filling 
into the bottles. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Process validation 
on three commercial scale batches demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate 
for this manufacturing process of an oral suspension.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification(s)  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), spironolactone 
content  (HPLC/UPLC),  identification  of  spironolactone  (HPLC/UPLC,  DAD),  homogeneity  of  suspension 
(HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), microbial limits (total viable count, Ph. Eur.), and absence of specified 
micro-organisms (Ph. Eur.). 
The set of specification parameters and limits is adequate tests for the proposed pharmaceutical form 
and are justified based on compendial requirements, relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines, batch release 
and stability data. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay of active (spironolactone) and preservative (sodium benzoate) and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for seven commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. The 
finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional finished product release testing. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Three of these batches were identical to, and the 
Assessment report

Page 15/38 
 
 
 
other  batch  representative  of  those  proposed  for  marketing.  All  four  batches  were  packaged  in  the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  pH,  viscosity,  spironolactone  content,  degradation  products, 
sodium benzoate content, homogeneity of suspension, dissolution, microbial limits, and absence of E. 
coli.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  For  three  of  these  batches  the  stability 
protocol also included a preservative efficacy test. 
No  significant  changes  were  observed  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters,  even  under  accelerated 
conditions. 
The preservative efficacy test performed according to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 demonstrated that the preservative 
system provides adequate protection from adventitious microbial contamination or proliferation during 
long-term storage of the unopened product. 
Two commercial scale batches were subjected to an in-use stability study: one at the beginning of the 
shelf life, and one close to the end of the intended shelf-life. The study was conducted over 16 weeks. 
Bottles were stored at 15-25°C. On each working day the bottle was removed from storage, an aliquot 
of the suspension was removed using a syringe, then the bottle was returned to storage. This allowed 
the withdrawal of product on up to 80 occasions from a single bottle of product. All analytical and 
microbiological parameters remained within specification over the complete study, and preservative 
efficacy test was confirmed in-use at 12 weeks time-point.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results demonstrate that the product is slightly susceptible to 
photodegradation, and that the proposed amber glass bottles provide sufficient protection. 
Based on available stability data, for unopened product the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any 
special storage conditions, and for product after first opening the in-use period of 12 weeks, with 
storage conditions ‘Keep the bottle tightly closed and store below 25°C’, as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3 and 6.4), are acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant adequately responded to an MO on dosing 
accuracy by amending the administration syringes included in the pack. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental risk assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Qaialdo manufactured by Nova Laboratories Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all spironolactone containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In view of the data provided, the comprehensive justification for not providing a complete ERA report 
is accepted. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The application is acceptable from the non-clinical view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for oral suspension containing spironolactone. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design 
under fed conditions.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of spironolactone based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product.

FARMOS (Pty) Ltd prior to sample analysis. 
Assessment report

Samples were thawed and assayed in runs where the unknown samples were interspersed with 
calibration standards (STDs) and quality control (QC) samples, a blank extract (to monitor carry-over) 
and a zero sample (to monitor interference by the internal standard). The samples of all treatment 
periods of a particular participant were analysed together in one run. Each run included one standard 
calibration curve constructed from STDs from at least 6 different concentration levels, ranging from the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ), assayed in duplicate. 
The regression model that was determined and used during the method validation was applied. Quality 
control samples were assayed in duplicate using at least 3 different concentration levels (one at ~ 3 x 
LLOQ [QClow], one QC at mid-range (~ 50% of the ULOQ [QCmedium]) and one within ~ 20 - 25% of 
the ULOQ [QChigh]), or at least 5% of the number of study samples, whichever was higher. 
The parent analyte (spironolactone) and active metabolites (7α thiomethyl spironolactone, 6β hydroxy 
7α thiomethyl spironolactone and canrenone) were measured, however bioequivalence assessment 
was conducted only on the parent spironolactone. 
The bioanalytical method was calibrated over the range 3.13 – 400 ng/ml. 
Internal standard for spironolactone determination was SPIR-d7. Certificates of analysis were 
submitted. 
•  Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Primary pharmacokinetic variables were Cmax and AUC(0-t). 
Secondary pharmacokinetic variables were AUC(0-∞), tmax, λz, t½ 
•  Statistical methods   
The test product was compared to the reference product by means of statistical analysis with respect 
to the primary PK parameters for spironolactone using ANOVA with sequence, subject(sequence), 
product and period effects after logarithmic transformation of the data. Upon antilog transformation of 
the difference estimates of “test – reference” the geometric means ratio of the test and reference 
product ("test/reference"), as well as the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric 
mean ratio of the test and reference products ("test/reference") and the intra-subject Coefficient of 
variation percentage (CV%) were provided. 
Bioequivalence of the test and reference products was assessed on the basis of the 90% CIs for 
estimates of the geometric mean ratios between the primary PK parameters for spironolactone in 
relation to the conventional acceptance range of 70.00% to 143.00% for Cmax and 80.00% to 
125.00% for AUC(0-t).  
In addition, for exploratory purposes, the intra-subject (within-subject) variability between treatment 
periods were analysed separately for both the test and reference products. This variation was 
expressed with CV% derived from a similar model used to test for bioequivalence but selecting only 
data for one product at a time. 
All AUCs were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. 
Results 
Based  on  previously  conducted  PK  and  bioequivalence  studies  which  demonstrated  high  (>30%  CV) 
intra-subject  variability  in  Cmax,  spironolactone  was  assumed  to  be  a  highly  variable  drug.  Hence, 
bioequivalence  of  the  test  and  reference  products  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  90%  confidence

intervals  (CIs)  for  estimates  of  the  geometric  mean  ratios  between  the  primary  PK  parameters  for 
spironolactone in relation to the conventional acceptance range of 70.00% to 143.00% for Cmax and 
80.00% to 125.00% for AUC(0-t) following the guidance on bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
rev.1) in relation to high variable drug products.

Table 4: Intra-CV percentage between periods for spironolactone 
The intra-subject variability in Cmax was below the threshold for classification as a highly variable drug 
(<30% CV). Based on previously conducted PK and bioequivalence studies which demonstrated high 
(>30% CV) intra-subject variability in Cmax, the applicant assumed spironolactone to be a highly 
variable drug. It is likely that, unlike the previous studies, the replicate study design employed in the 
current investigation has allowed the intra-subject variability to be determined with greater precision. 
Palatability 
As part of the bioequivalence study described above, the palatability (taste, aftertaste, smell, texture, 
ease of use) of the test IMP was assessed by questionnaire following ingestion of the oral liquid. The 
questionnaire comprised of five questions with either yes/no or visual analogue scale (VAS) responses 
required. The VAS responses were captured as lengths in mm (out of a maximum of 100 mm).

Additional pharmacokinetic data 
To justify that the differences seen in Cmax do not have a clinically relevant impact, the applicant 
submitted further PK analyses, specifically comparison of Cmin and estimated average concentration at 
steady state between test and reference product. 
Although Cmin is not included in the bioequivalence criteria the mean concentrations at 12 hours (in 
the case of twice daily dosing) and 24 hours (once daily dosing) of spironolactone and the active 
metabolites (7α-thiomethyl-spironolactone, 6β- hydroxy-7α-thiomethyl-spironolactone and canrenone) 
are very similar following dosing with Aldactone and Spironolactone 10mg/ml oral suspension.

Table 6: Mean Cmin values for the tablet and liquid 
Values are geometric means. Extracted from Table 14.2.1.1 
The average concentration at steady state is a calculation of the total exposure over 1 dosing interval 
(i.e. AUC0-τ) divided by the time of the dosing interval. While concentrations rise and fall during a 
dosing interval at steady state, the Cave,ss does not change. The factors that control Cave,ss are the 
dose, the dosing interval, and the clearance. Thus, for the same Spironolactone 10 mg/mL oral 
suspension / Aldactone dose and dosing interval, and assuming clearance is the same for both 
formulations (since AUC estimates are the same), Cave,ss concentrations for both formulations will be 
the same. Lower doses and longer intervals will result in lower Cave,ss values, while higher doses and 
shorter intervals will give higher Cave,ss values. It should therefore be reassuring that the Cave,ss are 
essentially the same for the two formulations (Table 7).

•  Safety data 
No deaths or SAEs were reported during the study, and no AE was of severe intensity. One subject 
presenting with iron deficiency anaemia was withdrawn from the study prior to Treatment Period 4. 
The investigator regarded this AE as unlikely related to the IMP. Fourteen of the 36 subjects reported 
27 AEs. Ten of the events were considered by the investigator as possibly related to the IMP. Of these, 
2 events were considered of moderate intensity and 8 as mild in intensity. The most common IMP-
related AEs were headache (3 events experienced 3 by subjects) and somnolence (2 events 
experienced by 1 subject on 2 separate occasions), and all were mild in intensity. Other IMP related 
Assessment report

AEs included single events of dry eye (mild), eye pruritus (mild), nausea (moderate), vomiting 
(moderate) and hyperkalaemia (mild).  
Post-hoc population pharmacokinetics (popPK) modelling and analysis  
Based on the bioequivalence study, Qaialdo (Test, oral suspension) was shown to be bioequivalent to 
Aldactone (Reference, tablet) after single dosing with respect to total exposure (AUC0-t), but not with 
respect to Cmax. Mean Cmax for Qaialdo was 34% lower as compared to Cmax for Aldactone (point 
estimate 0.66; 90% CI 0.62-0.71), after single dosing. 
To address the concentration-time profiles at steady-state for spironolactone, the applicant has 
conducted a post-hoc population pharmacokinetics (popPK) modelling and analysis. 
Individual exposure variables of spironolactone and TMS at steady-state, namely AUC(0-tau)ss and 
Cmax,ss, were calculated using the developed PK model following once and twice daily dosing for 10 
days. Boxplots of simulated spironolactone and TMS AUC(0- tau)ss and Cmax,ss values are shown in 
Figure 2 - Figure 5 below, and are summarised in Table 8 - Table 11.

Results 
The assumption of linear pharmacokinetics is acceptable, and the population PK model appears fit-for-
purpose. The VPC plots, stratified by formulation, indicated that the popPK model is able to explain the 
central tendency well and overall variability of the observed PK data adequately.

The simulations show that total daily exposure for both regimens at steady state remains the same 
between both products, as is to be expected. Furthermore, the simulations show that mean Cmax for 
Qaialdo is 24% lower as compared to Aldactone after once daily dosing, and 22% lower after BID 
dosing. 
Although Cmin,ss was not calculated and had to be derived from the C-t plots, it seems to be similar 
for once daily and twice daily dosing for both products.  
Since the approved posology states that the dose can be divided for administration every 12h or 24h, 
it is clear that the efficacy is mainly driven by the total exposure (i.e. Cave,ss) and not by the shape of 
the curve (thus Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss). 
Therefore, it may be expected that the differences of approximately 20% in Cmax and Cmin at steady 
state between Qaialdo and Aldactone have no clinically relevant effect at steady state dosing. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This is an application for a hybrid medicinal product containing spironolactone. The reference medicinal 
product is Aldactone, the two products differ in pharmaceutical form (oral solution vs. film-coated 
tablet). To support this application, the applicant submitted a review of pre-clinical and clinical data as 
well as one bioequivalence study comparing Aldactone to Qaialdo. The study was a single-dose, open-
label, laboratory-blind, randomised, four period crossover, replicate study with orally administered 
spironolactone 100 mg conducted under fed conditions in at least 30 healthy males and females at a 
single study center. Based on previously conducted PK and bioequivalence studies which demonstrated 
high (>30% CV) intra-subject variability in Cmax, the applicant assumed spironolactone to be a highly 
variable drug. Hence, a modified acceptance range for the 90% confidence interval was proposed: 
70.00% - 143.00% for Cmax and 80.00% - 125.00% for AUC(0-t). The 90% CIs for AUC(0-t) were 
within the predefined bioequivalence limits (CI: 98% - 105%). However, the lower value of the 90% 
CIs for the Cmax extended below the predefined bioequivalence limit of 70.00% (CI: 62% - 71%). The 
lack of bioequivalence as shown with Cmax falling outside the already extended range was a major 
issue. 
The presented bioequivalence study did not demonstrate that spironolactone is a highly variable drug. 
The extended range of 70.00% to 143.00% CI for Cmax cannot be justified based on the results from 
the bioequivalence study, as the model CV between periods was for Cmax 24.65 % and 19.92 %. The 
extent of the widening should be defined based upon the within-subject variability seen in the 
bioequivalence study using scaled-average-bioequivalence (see CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1). The 
extended range of 70.00% to 143.00% CI for Cmax is therefore not acceptable.  
The applicant was expected to provide a proof that the absence of comparable bioavailability between 
Qaialdo and Aldactone in Cmax will not have an impact on the pharmacodynamic response with focus 
of discussion on Cmin and steady state concentration. The applicant has explained the differences in 
Cmax between Aldactone and Qaialdo by a different solubility. Additionally, it has been pointed out 
that the 12 h and 24 h Cmin after single dose administration is very similar between Aldactone and 
Qaialdo. The applicant also claims that based on the terminal half-life of spironolactone (4-5 h), 
significant accumulation of the drug is unlikely after a single administration. Further, the applicant 
states that with regard to the correlation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic response, 
Assessment report  
EMA/175439/2023  
Page 32/38 
 
 
 
average concentration at steady state (Cave,ss) is more important and shows that Cave,ss is similar 
between Aldactone and Qaialdo. These parameters are however only estimated by the applicant from 
AUC0-tau after a single dose. This approach is considered to be imprecise and may not correspond to 
the reality. The applicant also argues  the fact that since spironolactone has a slow onset of action, a 
mere difference in Cmax is unlikely to affect the pharmacodynamic response. Lastly, spironolactone is 
a prodrug, which is metabolised to 3 metabolites, for which the estimated Cave,ss and AUC0-τ values 
were also similar between the two formulations. In conclusion, the justification of absence of Cmax 
bioequivalence with an estimated Cave,ss was not accepted by CHMP due to reasons described above.  
The applicant was further asked to justify that the absence of comparability between Qaialdo and 
Aldactone in concentration-time (C-t) profile of spironolactone will not negatively affect the 
pharmacodynamic response to spironolactone. 
The applicant stated that Cave,ss is considered more important for the pharmacological effect than 
Cmax,ss or Cmin,ss. However, C-t profiles of spironolactone and its active metabolites for the oral 
tablet and suspension formulation under steady-state condition, using the single dose data and the 
superposition principle assuming linear pharmacokinetics, were not provided. This was required to be 
submitted for at least once-daily and twice-daily dosing, since spironolactone can be taken either as a 
single daily dose but also in divided doses. 
To further substantiate the statement of the applicant that Cave,ss is considered most important for 
the pharmacological effect, exposure-response relationships or impact of the posology allowing the 
daily dosage to be given at various divided doses on exposure-response relationships was requested  
to be discussed.  
To address the concentration-time profiles at steady-state for spironolactone, the applicant has 
conducted a post-hoc population pharmacokinetics (popPK) modelling and analysis. The assumption of 
linear pharmacokinetics is acceptable, and the population PK model appears fit-for-purpose as well 
given that simple superposition principle would also have been sufficient. The  visual predictive checks 
(VPC) plots, stratified by formulation, indicate that the popPK model is able to explain the central 
tendency well and overall variability of the observed PK data adequately. 
The simulations show that total daily exposure for both regimens at steady state remains the same 
between both products. Furthermore, the simulations show that mean Cmax for Qaialdo is 24% lower 
as compared to Aldactone after once daily dosing, and 22% lower after BID dosing. 
Although Cmin,ss was not calculated and had to be derived from the C-t plots, it seems to be similar 
for once daily and twice daily dosing for both products.  
Since the approved posology states that the dose can be divided for administration every 12h or 24h, 
it is clear that the efficacy is mainly driven by the total exposure (i.e. Cave,ss) and not by the shape of 
the curve (thus Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss). 
Therefore, it is  expected that the differences of approximately 20% in Cmax and Cmin at steady state 
between Qaialdo and Aldactone have no clinically relevant effect at steady state dosing. The issue with 
Cmax not falling within the bioequivalence margin is thus solved. Qaialdo can be considered as 
bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Aldactone. 
As Cmax of tested product was lower than Cmax of reference product, it is agreed that no safety issues 
are expected between products.

Besides the 5 ml syringe, the applicant will also be manufacturing a 1 ml syringe. Accuracy of 
administration with both syringes has been tested and confirmed, including the paediatric dosing. 
Although the study did not show variability needed for replicate design, this issue is not pursued 
further as use of non-replicate design would not change the conclusions of the study. 
2.4.3.1.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
There is a difference between bioavailability of Qaialdo and Aldactone due to the Cmax parameter not 
falling within the 80-125% confidence interval. Thus, the applicant was expected to provide a proof 
that the absence of comparable bioavailability between Qaialdo and Aldactone in Cmax will not have an 
impact on the pharmacodynamic response. 
The applicant states that with regard to the correlation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic 
response, average concentration at steady state (Cave,ss) is more important and shows that Cave,ss 
is similar between Aldactone and Qaialdo. These parameters are however only estimated by the 
applicant from AUC0-tau after a single dose. This approach might be imprecise and may not 
correspond to the reality but the applicant also arguments with the fact that since spironolactone has a 
slow onset of action, a mere difference in Cmax is unlikely to affect the pharmacodynamic response.  
The applicant was further asked to justify that the absence of comparability between Qaialdo and 
Aldactone in concentration-time (C-t) profile of spironolactone would not negatively affect the 
pharmacodynamic response to spironolactone. 
The applicant stated that Cave,ss was considered more important for the pharmacological effect than 
Cmax,ss or Cmin,ss. However, C-t profiles of spironolactone and its active metabolites for the oral tablet 
and suspension formulation under steady-state condition, using the single dose data and the 
superposition principle assuming linear pharmacokinetics, were not provided. This would have been  
required  for at least once-daily and twice-daily dosing, since spironolactone can be taken either as a 
single daily dose or in divided doses. 
To further substantiate the statement that Cave,ss is considered the most important for the 
pharmacological effect, exposure-response relationships or impact of the posology allowing the daily 
dosage to be given at various divided doses on exposure-response relationships was asked to be 
discussed as well. 
To address the concentration-time profiles at steady-state for spironolactone, the applicant has 
conducted a post-hoc population pharmacokinetics (popPK) modelling and analysis. The assumption of 
linear pharmacokinetics is acceptable, and the population PK model appears fit-for-purpose as well 
given that simple superposition principle would also have been sufficient. The VPC plots, stratified by 
formulation, indicate that the popPK model is able to explain the central tendency well and overall 
variability of the observed PK data adequately. 
The simulations show that total daily exposure for both regimens at steady state remains the same 
between both products, as is to be expected. Furthermore, the simulations show that mean Cmax for 
Qaialdo is 24% lower as compared to Aldactone after once daily dosing, and 22% lower after BID 
dosing.

Although Cmin,ss was not calculated and had to be derived from the C-t plots, it seems to be similar 
for once daily and twice daily dosing for both products.  
Since the approved posology states that the dose can be divided for administration every 12h or 24h, 
it is clear that the efficacy is mainly driven by the total exposure (i.e. Cave,ss) and not by the shape of 
the curve (thus Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss). 
Therefore, it may be expected that the differences of approximately 20% in Cmax and Cmin at steady 
state between Qaialdo and Aldactone have no clinically relevant effect at steady state dosing. The issue 
with Cmax not falling within the bioequivalence margin is thus solved. Qaialdo can therefore be 
considered as  bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Aldactone. 
To be in line with the current praxis on wording of the paediatric indication the applicant was requested 
to specify and justify the lower age limit in the indication. Although limited data exist for the use of 
spironolactone in paediatric population a lower age limit is not set in the reference product Aldactone 
and therefore Aldactone has no restrictions on use with regard to age.  As such no further data are 
needed to support the specification of paediatric population to neonates within the indication of 
Qaialdo. The oral suspension is particularly adapted for young children treatment. Consequently, the 
doses in children are clearly detailed in section 4.2 with dosage data for spironolactone from the WHO 
(WHO Model Formulary for Children, 2010) and Kindreformularium.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study and PopPK analysis, Qaialdo is considered bioequivalent 
with Aldactone.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of spironolactone (oral suspension). The reference product 
Aldactone 100 mg film-coated tablets is indicated for: 
In the management of refractory oedema associated with congestive cardiac failure; hepatic cirrhosis 
with ascites and oedema, malignant ascites, nephrotic syndrome, diagnosis and treatment of primary 
aldosteronism, essential hypertension. 
Children should only be treated under guidance of a paediatric specialist. There are limited paediatric 
data available. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application.  
From a clinical perspective, this application contains 1 bioequivalence study. 
The extension of CI range for Cmax to 70.00% - 143.00% cannot be justified based on the results 
from the bioequivalence study, as the model CV between periods was for Cmax 24.65 % and 19.92 %.  
The test formulation of Qaialdo did not meet the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the reference product. Specifically, the 90% confidence interval for the primary PK 
parameter Cmax was not contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 70.00% to 
143.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was thus not demonstrated. 
The surrogate parameter, average concentration at steady state, although similar between test and 
reference, was only estimated by the applicant from AUC0-tau after a single dose. This approach might 
be imprecise and may not correspond to the reality.  
The applicant was thus expected to provide additional information on concentration-time profiles.

The applicant has conducted a PopPK analysis, showing comparable concentration-time profiles at 
steady-state between Qaialdo and Aldactone for once and twice daily dosing. It can be thus assumed 
that the differences in Cmax will not have an impact on efficacy. 
Having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the 
product information. 
Based on the review of the submitted data, comparability of Qaialdo to reference product Aldactone 
has been concluded. A positive benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be 
concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Qaialdo is favourable in the following indication: 
In the management of refractory oedema associated with congestive cardiac failure; hepatic cirrhosis 
with ascites and oedema, malignant ascites, nephrotic syndrome, diagnosis and treatment of primary 
aldosteronism, essential hypertension. 
Neonates, children and adolescents should only be treated under guidance of a paediatric specialist. 
There is limited paediatric data available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

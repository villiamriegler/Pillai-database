On  16  September  1998,  the  European  Commission  authorised  changes  to  an  aspect  of  the 
labelling not connected to the SPC for Mirapexin, In accordance with Article 10(3) of Council 
Directive  No.  92/27/EEC  of  31  March  1992.  The  changes  concerned  the  wording  of  “Expiry 
date” and “Batch number” in the labelling. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL 
was updated. 
On  29  December  1998,  the  MAH  submitted  a  line-extension  application  in  accordance  with 
Article  2(1)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95  of  March  1995,  as  amended,  and 
Annex  II  thereof  for  a  new  0.35  mg  strength  of  pramipexole.  On  20  May  1999  the  CPMP 
adopted  a  positive  opinion  on  the  application.  Following  the  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  (USR) 
procedure for the already authorised strengths finalised on 15 July 1999, a revised opinion for 
the 0.35 mg strength was adopted by the CPMP on 29 July 1999 to include SPC and PL changes 
on  sudden  onset  of  sleep.  The  respective  Commission  Decision  to  authorise  the  0.35  mg 
strength was issued on 26 October 1999. 
On 25 June 1999, the MAH provided the EMEA with new information relating to sudden onset 
of  sleep  associated  with  pramipexole  administration.  This  information  related  to  a  total  of  19 
cases  of  sudden  onset  of  sleep  reported  in  the  US.  Fourteen  of  these  occurred  while  patients 
were driving resulting in 9 car accidents with minor injuries in some cases. The MAH requested 
on  14  July  1999  provisional  changes  to  prescribing  and  patient  information  through  a  rapid 
procedure. Warnings were introduced into sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 of the SPC through an 
USR procedure, which was finalised on 15 July 1999. The PL was amended accordingly. The 
MAH sent out a “Dear Doctor letter” to health professionals. 
On  7  July  1999,  the  MAH  requested  from  the  European  Commission  cancellation  of  the 
Marketing Authorisations for the 0.88 mg strengths of Mirapexin. The Commission authorised 
the withdrawal of this strength on 1 October 1999. 
In follow up to the USR, the MAH submitted a Type II variation in accordance with European 
Commission regulation (EC) No 542/95 on 23 July 1999. The MAH proposed also some minor 
format changes to SPC  and PL. An oral clarification with the company took place on 29 July 
1999 to address the quality and nature of the episodes of sudden onset of sleep and the adequacy 
of  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  product  information.  Following  the  hearing,  the  MAH 
proposed  to  further  strengthen  the  wording  of  the  warnings  and  CPMP  adopted  a  positive 
opinion on the application on 29 July 1999. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 
29 November 1999. 
On 29 February 2000 the MAH submitted an application for a Type II variation in accordance 
with Article 6 of European Commission regulation (EC) No 542/95. The MAH applied for an 
update of the SPC based on the data presented in the third Periodic Safety Update Report. The 
applicant  proposed  to  include  information  regarding  discontinuation  of  pramipexole  treatment 
and  requested  the  addition  of  reference  to  the  0.35  mg  strength  into  the  SPC.  Some  minor 
typographical corrections in the SPC and PL were also applied for. On 29 June 2000 the CPMP 
agreed  on  the  wording  to  be  implemented  in  the  SPC  and  adopted  a  positive  opinion  on  the 
Type II variation. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 20 October 2000. 
On  26  May  2000  the  MAH  submitted  to  the  EMEA  an  application  for  a  Type  I  variation  in 
accordance with Article 4 of European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, as amended. 
The scope of this variation was to extend the shelf life from 2 years to 3 years. The procedure 
started on 30 May 2000. The EMEA notified the European Commission on 16 June 2000 that 
the  variation  was  accepted.  Amendments  to  the  Annex  I  was  required  and  the  Commission 
Decision was issued on 27 July 2000.

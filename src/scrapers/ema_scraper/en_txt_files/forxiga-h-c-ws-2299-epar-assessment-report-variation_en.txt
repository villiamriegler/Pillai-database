2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dapagliflozin (FORXIGA/EDISTRIDE) is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2. 
Dapagliflozin is currently approved for the treatment of T2DM since 2012, HFrEF, and CKD. In addition, 
it is approved for type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japan. 
An indication for the treatment of HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) was based on positive results from the DAPA-
HF study (D1699C00001), which demonstrated superiority of dapagliflozin in reducing CV mortality, 
worsening of HF, and HF symptoms.  
This application is based on the single pivotal Phase III study DELIVER (D169CC00001), designed to 
extend the HF indication of dapagliflozin to include patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. 
To assess whether the treatment effect of dapagliflozin in patients with HF is modified by LVEF, and to 
provide a more precise estimate of the overall treatment effect on CV death, a pooled analysis of 
patient-level data from DELIVER and DAPA-HF is also presented.

2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The scope of this application is to extend the current indication “treatment of symptomatic chronic 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction” to include heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or 
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF > 40%). 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Heart Failure 
Forxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction. 
Epidemiology  
An estimated 64 million people are affected by HF worldwide (Groenewegen et al 2020, Lippi and 
Sanchis-Gomar 2020), with the prevalence of known HF at approximately 1% to 2% of the general 
adult population (Groenewegen et al 2020). HF with LVEF > 40% accounts for approximately half of all 
HF cases (Pfeffer et al 2019, Savarese and Lund 2017, Virani et al 2021). Of all hospitalisations in the 
Westernised countries, 1% to 4% are due to HF (Ponikowski et al 2016), with well over 1 million 
hospitalisations annually in the US and Europe (Ambrosy et al 2014). Readmissions after 
hospitalisation for LVEF > 40% are common, ranging from 28% to 45% within the first year (Cheng et 
al 2014, Cui et al 2020). HF with LVEF > 40% is associated with considerable mortality. Prognosis after 
hospitalisation for HF with LVEF > 40% is markedly poor, with 1-year and 5-year mortality estimated 
at 35% and 76%, respectively (Cheng et al 2014, Shah et al 2017) and have remained stable at a high 
level for the past 2 decades (Tsao et al 2018). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of HF varies according to geography. In Western-type and developed countries, coronary 
artery disease (CAD) and hypertension are predominant factors (GBD 2017). With regard to ischaemic 
aetiology, HFmrEF resembles HFrEF, with a higher frequency of underlying CAD compared to those 
with HFpEF (Koh et al 2017, Vedin et al 2017, Kapoor et al 2016). 
The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and not completely understood, but it is related to a range of 
abnormalities. These may include increased left ventricular (LV) mass, LV remodelling, or changes in 
myocyte structure, as well as diastolic dysfunction related to LV stiffness, interstitial fibrosis, and 
calcium abnormalities. Systolic function may also be affected despite maintenance of normal EF. 
Systemic and pulmonary vascular abnormalities include blunted increase in stroke rate, and increased 
intracardiac and pulse pressure (Butler et al 2014). 
Pathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnormalities of heart rhythm and 
conduction can also cause or contribute to HF (McDonagh et al 2021).

EMA/954956/2022

Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Heart failure is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal 
symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g., 
elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due to a 
structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures 
and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise (McDonagh et al 2021). 
Patients with signs and symptoms of HF are categorized, based on measurement of left-ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), as having HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF) (typically <40%) or HF with 
preserved LVEF (HFpEF). HFpEF is typically defined as LVEF ≥50%; HF with LVEF in the 40% to 49% 
may be characterized as HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) (Yancy et al 2013, Ponikowski 
et al 2016). 
The simplest terminology used to describe the severity of HF is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
functional classification. However, this relies solely on symptoms and there are many other better 
prognostic indicators in HF (Caraballo et al 2019). Importantly, patients with mild symptoms may still 
have a high risk of hospitalization and death (Solomon et al 2016). 
The diagnosis of HFmrEF requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of HF, and a mildly reduced 
EF (41–49%) The presence of elevated NPs (BNP ≥35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/mL) and other 
evidence of structural heart disease [e.g. increased left atrial (LA) size, LVH or echocardiographic 
measures of LV filling] make the diagnosis more likely but are not mandatory for diagnosis if there is 
certainty regarding the measurement of LVEF (McDonagh et al 2021). 
The diagnosis of HFpEF remains challenging. According to the ESC Guideline (McDonagh et al 2021), 
the diagnosis should include the following: 1) Symptoms and signs of HF, 2) An LVEF ≥50%, and 3) 
Objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with the presence of 
LV diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs. 
Management 
Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF). Diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or 
angiotensin II receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and beta-
blockers can improve symptoms and haemodynamics as well as reduce hospitalizations and mortality 
(Iwaz et al 2016). There is some evidence that hospitalization and survival rates for HFrEF but not 
HFpEF have improved over time, which may relate to the availability of effective treatments for HFrEF 
(Owan et al 2006, Steinberg et al 2012). 
With regards to heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), the ESC Guideline 
(McDonagh et al 2021) states that diuretics should be used to control congestion. No substantial 
prospective RCT has been performed exclusively in patients with HFmrEF. Although the guideline does 
not make any strong recommendations, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or angiotensin 
II receptor blockers-neprilysin inhibitor may be considered based on subgroup analysis of trials in 
HFpEF.  
There is a lack of approved pharmacotherapy indicated for heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) as reflected in the current HF treatment guidelines. The latest ESC guidelines state 
that no treatment has yet been shown, convincingly, to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 9/81 
 
 
 
HFpEF or HFmrEF (Ponikowski et al 2016, McDonagh et al 2021). However, recently (March 2022), 
another SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, was approved for the use in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. 
Considering that HF is a common and serious medical condition with a high risk of repeat 
hospitalisation for HF and a high mortality, there remains an unmet medical need for new treatment 
options that reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Dapagliflozin (FORXIGA/EDISTRIDE) is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.  
Dapagliflozin is currently approved for the treatment of T2DM since 2012, HFrEF, and CKD. In addition, 
it is approved for type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japan. 
An indication for the treatment of HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) was based on positive results from the DAPA-
HF study (D1699C00001), which demonstrated superiority of dapagliflozin in reducing CV mortality, 
worsening of HF, and HF symptoms.  
The primary effect of dapagliflozin—inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal kidney tubules—leads to 
changes in sodium, glucose, and fluid handling, which leads to a decrease in volume overload. This off-
loading of the heart leads to beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, which leads to improved diastolic 
parameters. The decongestive effect and reversal of some of the structural changes in the heart are 
the likely drivers of the benefit on HF events and mortality 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
This application is based on the single pivotal DELIVER study. DELIVER was a Phase III international, 
multi-centre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 6263 
patients (44% female) with HF and LVEF > 40%. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 
dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets versus placebo, given once daily, in reducing the composite of CV death or 
an HF event. Two hypotheses were tested for this primary objective simultaneously: in the full study 
population and in a subpopulation with LVEF < 60%. 
DELIVER and DAPA-HF were powered for the primary composite endpoint and not for individual 
components of the composite. A pooled analysis of patient-level data from DELIVER and DAPA-HF is 
included in this submission to assess whether the treatment effect of dapagliflozin in patients with HF 
is modified by LVEF, and to provide a more precise estimate of the treatment effect of dapagliflozin on 
CV death. 
Scientific advice was sought from EMA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/792395/2017) in 2017, much of which was 
focused on a pragmatic register-based study design to evaluate HF with LVEF > 40%. The MAH 
ultimately decided to perform a traditional randomised controlled trial instead and, in part, relied on 
relevant advice from the pragmatic design interaction, as well as previous advice from health authority 
interactions for DAPA-HF in 2016 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/336742/2016). 
Key Advice from the EMA/CHMP

• 
• 
Underscored the need to clarify the mechanism of action in HF with LVEF > 40%. 
Recommended strict inclusion criteria to define population, that characteristics of HF need to 
be clearly defined and that definitions could include the presence of structural heart disease or 
documented hospitalisation for HF.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the WSA. 
The WSA has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by that the new indication 
to include adult patients with heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
dapagliflozin containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The application is based on data from the single pivotal DELIVER study (D169CC00001). 
To assess whether the treatment effect of dapagliflozin is modified by LVEF and to provide a more 
precise estimate of CV death in patients with HF, a pooled analysis of patient-level data from DELIVER 
and DAPA-HF (D1699C00001) is also presented in this submission.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the WSA. 
The WSA has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies have been provided. The MAH has provided data from literature 
summarising the current knowledge on the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors when used in the 
treatment of heart failure. 
Mechanism of action 
Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the 
proximal kidney tubules with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary 
excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Therefore, dapagliflozin increases the delivery of sodium to 
the distal tubule, which increases tubuloglomerular feedback and reduces intraglomerular pressure, 
both in patients with T2DM and without diabetes (Cherney et al 2020). 
This primary mechanism of action in the kidneys—that dapagliflozin changes the handling of sodium, 
glucose, and fluid—leads to adaptations in the heart. 
A cardinal feature of HF, regardless of ejection fraction, is an increase in left ventricular filling 
pressures (i.e., increased preload). SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to reduce distal pulmonary artery 
pressure (which is directly related to left ventricular filling pressure), as measured by an implanted 
device both in the EMBRACE study, which included HF patients across the LVEF spectrum, with no 
treatment by LVEF interaction (Nassif et al 2021), and in a study including patients with HFrEF 
(Mullens et al 2020). Both studies provide direct evidence of a rapid-onset and sustained 
haemodynamic effect of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing left ventricular preload. 
This off-loading of the heart is a likely cause of the longer-term beneficial effects on cardiac 
remodelling that are evident with SGLT2 inhibition. Two randomised controlled trials have shown 
beneficial effects on remodelling, as assessed by left ventricular mass: DAPA-LVH, which included 
patients with T2DM and left ventricular hypertrophy (Brown et al 2020), and EMPA-HEART, which 
included patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease (Verma et al 2019). These findings of 
beneficial effects on remodelling from SGLT2 inhibition were further confirmed in an observational 
study that prospectively included mainly patients with HFpEF and T2DM (Soga et al 2018). 
An expected consequence of beneficial effects on remodelling is the improvement in diastolic 
parameters. Indeed, it was shown that dapagliflozin treatment is associated with improved diastolic 
parameters, as well as global longitudinal strain (Tanaka et al 2020). This was also confirmed in a 
large propensity-matched cohort study, in which treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with: 
(1) lower end-diastolic dimension, (2) lower left ventricular mass index, (3) improved LVEF, (4) 
improved global longitudinal strain, (5) lower mitral E/e’, and (6) lower pulmonary arterial pressure 
(Hwang et al 2020).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic studies have been provided. In the CHMP scientific advice, the MAH was 
requested to provide data in support of the mechanism of action for SGLT2 inhibitors when used in the 
treatment of heart failure. Data from the literature, summarising the current knowledge on the 
mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors when used in the treatment of heart failure have been 
provided. The MAH’s interpretation of these data is that the primary effect of dapagliflozin—inhibition 
of SGLT2 in the proximal kidney tubules—leads to changes in sodium, glucose, and fluid handling, 
which leads to a decrease in volume overload. This off-loading of the heart leads to beneficial effects 
on cardiac remodelling, which leads to improved diastolic parameters. The MAH concludes that the 
decongestive effect and reversal of some of the structural changes in the heart are the likely drivers of 
the benefit on HF events and mortality.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Published data supporting a plausible mechanism of action for SGLT2 inhibitors, when used in the 
treatment of heart failure, has been provided. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-ranging study has been performed with dapagliflozin in patients with HF because of 
lack of established biomarkers. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data previously showed that 
10 mg dose of dapagliflozin near maximally inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney. 
Furthermore, in the DAPA-HF study (D1699C00001) which included patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), 
the 10 mg dose was shown efficient in reducing CV mortality, worsening of HF, and HF symptoms. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
DELIVER - Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients with 
PReserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (D169CC00001) 
Methods 
DELIVER was an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase III study in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. DELIVER evaluated the effect 
of dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, given once daily, in reducing the composite of CV death 
or an HF event. All primary endpoint events were adjudicated. 
The study closure procedures were initiated when the predetermined number of primary endpoints 
(n = 1117) were predicted to have occurred, i.e., the PACD. 
There were no specific dietary or activity restrictions during the study. 
In addition to the full study population, data for the subpopulation with LVEF <60% is presented.

Figure 1 Study design 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria: 
1.  Male or female patients aged ≥ 40 years. 
2.  Documented diagnosis of symptomatic HF (NYHA class II to IV) at enrolment, and a medical 
history of typical symptoms/signs of HF ≥ 6 weeks before enrolment with at least intermittent 
need for diuretic treatment. 
3.  LVEF > 40% and evidence of structural heart disease (i.e., left ventricular hypertrophy or left atrial 
enlargement) documented by the most recent echocardiogram, and/or cardiac Magnetic Resonance 
within the last 12 months prior to enrolment. For patients with prior acute cardiac events or 
procedures that may reduce LVEF, e.g., as defined in exclusion criterion 6 (acute CV event within 
12 weeks prior to enrolment), qualifying cardiac imaging assessment at least 12 weeks following 
the procedure/event is required. 
4.  NT-pro BNP ≥ 300 pg/mL at Visit 1 for patients without ongoing atrial fibrillation/flutter. If ongoing 
atrial fibrillation/flutter at Visit 1, NT-pro BNP must be ≥ 600 pg/mL. 
5.  Patients may be ambulatory, or hospitalised; patients must be off intravenous HF therapy 
(including diuretics) for at least 12 hours prior to enrolment and 24 hours prior to randomisation. 
Key exclusion criteria were applied to limit bias, ensure patient safety, and reduce the risk of enrolling 
patients with alternative conditions that could account for the patient's HF symptoms and signs. Hence, 
patients with anaemia, hypothyroidism, and primary pulmonary hypertension or severe pulmonary 
disease were not eligible to participate in the study. Patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure 
< 95 mmHg) were excluded due to the blood pressure lowering effects of dapagliflozin. Patients with 
HF due to any of the following: known infiltrative cardiomyopathy (e.g., amyloid, sarcoid, lymphoma, 
endomyocardial fibrosis), active myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, known 
genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic 
right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, or uncorrected primary valvular disease were excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 14/81 
 
 
 
 
Patients with other conditions likely to prevent participation in the study or greatly limit life expectancy 
were also excluded as were patients with T1DM. 
Treatments 
No formal dose-ranging study has been performed with dapagliflozin in patients with HF because of 
lack of established biomarkers. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data previously showed that 
10 mg dose of dapagliflozin near maximally inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney.  
The 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin has demonstrated a favourable benefit/risk balance, with superior 
efficacy and comparable safety to the 5 mg dose, for the treatment of T2DM in an extensive clinical 
development programme. 
The high mortality and morbidity of HF supported studying the highest effective and maximum 
tolerated dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg), which was assumed to present the greatest benefit-risk in this 
patient population.  
Patients were treated according to local guideline-recommended therapy for HF symptoms and co-
morbidities. There are no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions between dapagliflozin and these 
background medications and hence, no changes in dose of dapagliflozin were required. 
At the time of study initiation, no pharmacological therapy was approved for HF with LVEF > 40%; 
therefore, placebo was selected as an appropriate comparator.

Sample size 
The study was event-driven. Originally, assuming a true HR of 0.80 between dapagliflozin and placebo, 
using a two-sided alpha of 5%, 844 primary endpoint events were targeted in order to provide a 
statistical power of 90% for the test of the primary endpoint. 
Assuming 20% of patients from the subacute subgroup with an annual event rate of 24% during the 
first year and 9% thereafter, the original sample size of 4700 patients was estimated to provide the 
required target number of 844 patients with a primary event during a recruitment period of 18 months 
and a minimum follow-up period of 15 months. 
Based on the ongoing blinded monitoring of event accrual and with an assumed proportion of 11% 
patients from the subacute subgroup, the sample size was increased from original 4700 to 
approximately 6100 randomised patients to obtain the increased target number of 1117 patients with 
a primary event. The recruitment period was anticipated to increase from the original 18 months to 26 
months and a minimum follow-up period of 13.5 months (total study duration 39 months). 
Assumptions of effect sizes were based on the empirical studies EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, 
TOPCAT, and I-PRESERVE. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation of patients was performed using an IxRS in balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 
balance between treatment groups (1:1). Randomisation was stratified in IxRS based on T2DM status 
(documented diagnosis of T2DM or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% [48 mmol/mol] shown at central laboratory test at 
enrolment) at the time of randomisation. 
The proportion of patients with T2DM and without diabetes was monitored for potential capping in 
order to ensure a minimum of 30% within each patient group. Randomisation was also continuously 
monitored for geographic region, LVEF category, NYHA class, subacute status, and atrial fibrillation 
status at enrolment, the results of which could have led to capping in the IxRS to avoid over- or 
underrepresentation of these patient subgroups. During the recruitment period, capping was only used 
twice in Japan for the atrial fibrillation subgroup. 
Blinding (masking) 
The blinding of treatment used a double-blind technique using a matching placebo (10mg). Individual 
treatment codes, indicating the randomised treatment for each patient, were available to the 
investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IxRS. Instructions for code breaking/unblinding were described 
in the IxRS user manual that were provided to each site.  
The randomisation code was not to be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The Investigator was

to document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to the 
patient to the MAH staff. 
The MAH and Investigators remained blinded to the results of the interim analysis. 
Statistical methods 
General 
DELIVER was an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase III study in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. DELIVER evaluated superiority 
of the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, given once daily, in reducing the composite 
of CV death or an HF event. 
Estimands 
The primary and secondary event-based objectives was evaluated under the treatment policy estimand 
including differences in outcomes over the entire study period until primary analysis censoring date 
(PACD) to reflect the effect of the initially assigned randomised study drug, irrespective of exposure to 
study drug, concomitant treatment as well as subsequent treatment after discontinuation of study 
drug. The analysis will be performed for the full analysis set including all events that occurred on or 
prior to PACD, including events following premature discontinuation of study treatment. 
The estimand for the change from baseline in KCCQ total symptom score at 8 months will employ a 
combination of a treatment policy strategy and a composite strategy. For the intercurrent event of 
death (due to any cause) prior to the KCCQ assessment at 8 months, a composite strategy was used, 
where death was considered unfavourable and represented by a lowest (worst) rank of a combined 
outcome variable. For all other types of intercurrent events, including but not limited to a premature 
discontinuation of randomised treatment, a treatment policy strategy was used. 
Analysis sets. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All patients who have been randomised to study treatment will be included in 
the full analysis set (FAS) irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the 
study.  Patients will be analysed according to their randomised IP assignment, irrespective of the 
treatment actually received. The FAS will be considered the primary analysis set for the intention to 
treat (ITT) analysis of primary and secondary variables and for the exploratory efficacy variables. 
Safety analysis set (SAS): All randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of randomised 
treatment will be included in the safety analysis set. Patients will be analysed according to the 
treatment actually received. The Safety analysis set will be considered the primary analysis set for all 
safety variables. 
Endpoints and Analysis 
Primary Endpoint. The primary efficacy variable was time from randomisation to the first occurrence of 
any event in the composite of CV death, hospitalisation for HF or an urgent HF visit, which was 
analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. The model was stratified by T2DM status at 
randomisation and included a factor for treatment group. The analysis of primary composite endpoint 
was based on the adjudicated events. 
Secondary Endpoints. Total number of HF events (first and recurrent) and CV death was analysed 
using the semi-parametric proportional rates model (known as the LWYY method) (Lin et al 2000).  
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 17/81 
 
 
 
Change from baseline at 8 months of the Total Symptom Score (TSS) of the Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) was transformed to a rank-based endpoint with fractional 
ranks, using the mean method for ties, and stratified by T2DM status at randomisation. This composite 
endpoint (including deaths as the worst outcomes) was analysed using rank based ANCOVA (Stokes et 
al 2012) and adjusted for ranked baseline KCCQ TSS value to test the null hypothesis of no difference 
in the distributions of ranked outcomes between treatment groups. 
Time to CV death and time to all-cause mortality were analysed using Cox regression in the same 
manner as the primary composite endpoint, with stratification for T2DM status at randomisation. 
Multiple Testing Procedure 
To control the overall type I error rate at 5% (two-sided) a closed testing procedure with a pre-
specified hierarchical ordering of the primary and secondary endpoints following the principles of 
alpha-splitting and alpha-recycling. The significance level was adjusted for one planned interim 
analysis of efficacy with alpha 0.2% allocated to the interim analysis and alpha 4.8% allocated to the 
final analysis. The primary endpoint was tested parallel in the full study population and in the 
subpopulation with LVEF < 60% with alpha split between the dual hypotheses. 
The primary and secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical sequence at a significance level of 
4.8% at the final analysis. Statistical significance was assessed simultaneously in 2 branches in the 
prespecified order of the endpoints and populations as specified in Figure 2. The total significance 
level was split for the dual primary analysis, allocating 3.8% to test the LVEF < 60% subpopulation 
(alpha 1) and 2.4% to test the full population (alpha 2) taking into account correlation between tests 
in the total and the subpopulation according to Spiessen and Debois (2010).

Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis assessing superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo was planned to be carried out 
when approximately 67% of the adjudicated primary events (approximately 748 events) had occurred. 
The MAH and Investigators remained blinded to the results. 
The interim analysis was carried out after the accrual of 70.9% (792 events) of the final target number 
of 1117 primary events. The primary composite endpoint was tested in the full study population at a 
nominal two-sided alpha level of 0.2% at the interim. If superiority was achieved for the primary 
endpoint, then the superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo on CV death was to be tested in the full study 
population at a two-sided level of 0.2%. The study continued as planned after the interim analysis. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary composite endpoint were performed for a list of 
characteristics, e.g., age, sex, race, region, NYHA, LVEF, for both full population and LVEF < 60% 
subpopulation. The subgroup analyses were repeated for CV death and the HF event (hospitalisation 
for HF and urgent HF visit) component of the primary composite endpoint. 
Missing Data and Imputation 
The time-to-first event analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression and the analysis of recurrent 
events assume that missing data is at random. Sensitivity analysis assuming a conservative missing-
not-at-random missing data process was performed (see sensitivity analysis below). 
The number of patients with missing vital status at 8 months was expected to be negligible. If a 
patient was known to have died prior to the 8-month assessment, the patient was considered to have 
a non-missing composite outcome and was assigned the worst rank. Patients who were alive at 8 
months and had missing baseline or 8-month KCCQ assessments had their missing KCCQ-TSS imputed 
using the multiple imputation under missing-at-random assumption. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary analysis: 1) adjudicating undetermined cause of 
death as CV deaths, 2) imputing missing data of time-to-event for patients with premature censoring 
including a tipping point analysis to assess violations of informative censoring (which was replaced by 
a “worst case” analysis post-hoc), and 3) censoring patients and events at the onset data of AE 
associated with a Covid-19 infection (MAR). 
In addition, various sensitivity analyses were performed on secondary endpoints, e.g., to evaluate any 
bias because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Potential bias because of competing risks of events (incl. HF 
events and CV death) included in the composite primary endpoint was assessed using a joint modelling 
approach (frailty model) (Rogers et al., 2016) for the analysis of individual components and non-
parametric estimates of HF event rates over time allowing for death as terminal event (Ghosh & Lin, 
2000). 
Governance 
The final Statistical Analysis Plan (V5.0, 2021-12-08) outlining all planned analyses was prepared 
before database lock on 2022-04-22 and unblinding (Last patient, last visit: 2022-03-27), while 
blinding was maintained during sample size re-estimation and interim analysis.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 6263 patients were randomised from 350 study sites in 20 countries. The median time in 
study until PACD was 28.0 months (range 0.1 to 42.1 months) and median time until last visit was 
28.5 months (range 0.1 to 42.2 months). There were 6211 patients (99.2%) with complete follow-up 
of the primary composite endpoint (Figure 3). A total of 18 patients withdrew consent, withdrawals 
were balanced between treatment groups. Vital status was unknown for 4 patients in total. The 
frequency of discontinuation of IP was low and balanced between treatment groups. The most common 
reasons for discontinuation of IP were patient decision in 481 cases (7.7%) and AE in 361 cases 
(5.8%).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original CSP was dated 24 April 2018. There were 3 amendments to the CSP: Version 2.0 was 
dated 9 May 2018, Version 3.0 was dated 16 December 2019, and Version 4.0 was dated 12 
November 2020. All protocol amendments were approved by AstraZeneca before being submitted to 
Health Authorities and/or an IRB/IEC. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were balanced between treatment groups with respect to frequency and 
type (Table 1). Overall, 3.7% of patients had at least one important protocol deviation. All the 
important protocol deviations were reviewed and agreed before clinical data lock. 
Table 1 Summary of Important Protocol Deviations (FAS) 
A total of 36 patients were randomised despite failing the inclusion criteria of LVEF > 40% and 
evidence of structural heart disease within the last 12 months prior to enrolment. Of these 36 patients, 
4 patients had LVEF ≤ 40%: 3 in the dapagliflozin group and 1 in the placebo group. 
A total of 46 patients were randomised despite failing the inclusion criteria of documented diagnosis of 
symptomatic HF (NYHA class II to IV) at enrolment, and a medical history of typical symptoms/signs of 
HF ≥ 6 weeks before enrolment with at least intermittent need for diuretic treatment. Of these 46 
patients, 2 patients (1 in each treatment group) did not have a documented diagnosis of symptomatic 
HF. 
A total of 140 patients (2.2%) were treated with open-label SGLT2 inhibitors during the study, of 
which 54 (0.9%) cases were classified as prohibited medication use (ie, taken concomitantly with the 
IP). Reported use of concomitant SGLT2 inhibitors was reviewed by the study teams/study physicians. 
Following review of the 54 cases, 52 cases were confirmed as prohibited medication use and reported 
as important protocol deviations. The cases of prohibited medication use were balanced between 
treatment groups. 
Protocol Deviations Related to COVID-19 
There were 2571 patients (41.1%) with at least one COVID-19 related non-important protocol 
deviation. The most common non-important protocol deviation was related to study procedures and

assessments. Only 5 patients (0.1%) had at least one important protocol deviation: 4 in the 
dapagliflozin group and 1 in the placebo group. 
Baseline data 
Demographic Characteristics 
In the full study population, patient demographic characteristics were balanced between treatment 
groups (Table 2). In total, 43.9% of patients were female. The mean age was 71.7 years. 
Assessment report

Page 23/81 
 
 
 
Table 2 Demographic Characteristics (FAS) 
In the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%, patient demographic characteristics were balanced between 
treatment groups, and were generally consistent with those of the full study population.

Baseline Patient Characteristics 
Baseline patient characteristics, including vital signs, were balanced between treatment groups. There 
were similar proportions of patients with T2DM (defined as medical history of T2DM): 44.7% in the 
dapagliflozin group and 44.9% in the placebo group. Mean body mass index was similar between 
treatment groups. 
Baseline Heart Failure Characteristics 
Most patients were diagnosed with HF < 5 years before enrolment. A total of 2539 patients (40.5%) 
had been hospitalised for HF prior to study enrolment. The subacute subgroup included 654 patients 
(10.4%). 
HF characteristics were balanced between treatment groups (Table 3). Overall, 4713 patients (75.3%) 
were classified as NYHA class II at enrolment. The median (IQR) LVEF was 54.0% (47.0% to 60.0%). 
The median (IQR) NT-proBNP was 1011.0 pg/mL (623.0 to 1751.0 pg/mL).

between treatment groups. 
Medical History 
The medical and relevant surgical history of the patients, as well as the smoking history, was balanced 
between treatment groups. Hypertension was reported by 89%, dyslipidaemia by 64%, coronary 
artery stenosis by 30%, CKD by 28%, valvular heart disease by 27%, myocardial infarction by 26% 
and stable angina pectoris by 21% of patients. 
Use of Concomitant Medication 
Concomitant Medication at Randomisation 
At randomisation, treatment of HF symptoms and co-morbidities was balanced between treatment 
groups. In total, 97.8% of patients were treated with a diuretic, most commonly a loop diuretic, 82.7% 
with a beta blocker, 77.2% with an ACEi/ARB/ARNI, and 42.6% with an MRA (Table 5).

Concomitant Medication after Randomisation 
The use of diuretics remained high and balanced between treatment groups throughout the study. The 
use of ACEi, ARB, ARNI, and MRA also remained balanced between treatment groups throughout the 
study. 
The use of prohibited medications was balanced between treatment groups. A total of 140 patients 
(2.2%) were treated with open-label SGLT2 inhibitors during the study, of which 54 cases (0.9%) were 
classified as prohibited medication use (i.e., taken concomitantly with the IP). Reported use of 
concomitant SGLT2 inhibitors was reviewed by the study teams/study physicians. Following review of 
the 54 cases, 52 cases were confirmed as prohibited medication use and reported as important 
protocol deviations. 
Study Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance was high and balanced between treatment groups. Compliance > 90% was 
observed in 90.3% of subjects in the dapagliflozin treated group and in 90.9% in the placebo treated 
group.

Summary of Demographic and Other Baseline Patient Characteristics in the Subpopulation 
with LVEF < 60% 
In the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%, treatment compliance was high and balanced between 
treatment groups, while the frequency of discontinuation of IP was low and balanced. Demographic 
and baseline patient characteristics, including background therapy and medical history, were balanced 
between treatment groups.  
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60% were 
generally consistent with those of the full study population, except for minor expected differences in 
the proportion of patients with myocardial infarction, stable angina pectoris, and coronary artery 
stenosis, which tended to be higher in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%.

Outcomes and estimation 
Summary of Testing Hierarchy and Overall Efficacy Results  
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of primary composite endpoint of CV 
death or an HF event in the full study population and in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60% (Table 7). 
Detailed results will be presented only for the full study population.  
Demonstration of superiority for the primary composite endpoint initiated sequential testing of 
secondary endpoints. An alpha of 2.4% and 3.8% was used to test the primary composite endpoint in 
the full study population and in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%, respectively. Since both primary 
null hypotheses were rejected, the subsequent hypotheses in each branch (Table 7) were tested at 
2.4%, in the order of the testing hierarchy. Further, because all hypotheses in branch II were rejected, 
alpha was recycled to branch I, where remaining unrejected hypotheses were re-tested at full alpha 
adjusted for interim analysis (i.e., 4.8%).

In the full study population, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of 
composite of CV death and recurrent HF events, and in providing symptom benefit as measured by 
KCCQ TSS. 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on primary composite endpoint was consistent across the key prespecified 
subgroups in the full study population, including those defined by baseline LVEF (≤ 49%, 50% to 59%, 
≥ 60%), age and sex. A nominal interaction p-value < 0.05 was observed for the subgroup analysis by 
median systolic BP (≤ 128.0 mmHg, > 128.0 mmHg), but the point estimates for both subgroups were 
below unity.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Composite of CV death or an HF Event 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of primary composite endpoint of CV 
death or an HF event (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73, 0.92], p = 0.0008) (Figure 5). There were 512 and 
610 patients with CV death or an HF event in the dapagliflozin group and in the placebo group, 
respectively, corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 7.8 and 9.6. Of a total of 1122 
patients with a composite event, 300 patients had CV death as their first event.  
A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the composite of CV death or an HF event is presented in Figure 5. The 
curves diverged early, and the separation was maintained throughout the study.

Results from analyses of individual components of the primary composite endpoint are summarised in 
Figure 6. All components individually contributed to the treatment effect.

Hospitalisation/Urgent HF Visit) and the Individual Components (FAS) 
The number of events for the individual components are the actual number of first events for each component and 
their sum exceeds the number of events for the composite endpoint. Event rates are presented as the number of 
subjects with event per 100 patient-years of follow-up. Hazard ratio for Dapa 10 mg vs placebo, CIs, and 2-sided 
p-value are calculated from Cox proportional hazards model (Wald statistic) stratified by T2DM status at 
randomisation. An HF event includes hospitalisations for HF and urgent HF visits.

Subpopulation with LVEF < 60% 
Consistent with the results in the full study population, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in 
reducing the incidence of primary composite endpoint of CV death or an HF event in the subpopulation 
with LVEF < 60% (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73, 0.95], p = 0.0085. 
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Variable 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results of primary composite 
endpoint. Results of the sensitivity analysis, in which deaths adjudicated as ‘undetermined cause of 
death’ were considered CV deaths and included as endpoint events, were consistent with those of the 
main analysis. 
Results of the COVID-19 sensitivity analysis, in which patients were censored at the onset date of the 
first AE associated with COVID-19 infection, were consistent with those of the main analysis.  
The extent of incomplete follow-up of the primary composite endpoint, defined in terms of incomplete 
event assessment or withdrawal of consent, was low and balanced between treatment groups. In the 
dapagliflozin group and in the placebo group, respectively, 0.9% and 0.7% of patients were censored

prior to PACD due to incomplete follow-up. Incomplete follow-up of the primary composite endpoint 
accounted for 0.5% of total patient time in both treatment groups. A tipping point analysis was 
prespecified to assess the robustness of the statistical significance of primary analysis with respect to 
prematurely censored patients. In light of the magnitude of the observed treatment effect and the low 
frequency of incomplete follow-up, the tipping point analysis was replaced by a post-hoc "worst case 
analysis". This rendered in total 29 new events in the dapagliflozin group. Patients in the placebo 
group censored before PACD were considered event-free until PACD. While this constitutes the most 
unfavourable scenario for dapagliflozin with regards to the outcome in the censored patients, the 
resulting treatment effect estimate remained statistically significant. 
Subpopulation with LVEF < 60% 
Results of the sensitivity analysis, in which deaths adjudicated as ‘undetermined cause of death’ were 
considered CV deaths and included as endpoint events, were consistent with those of the main analysis 
in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Composite of CV Death and Recurrent HF Events 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of composite of CV death and recurrent 
HF events (Table 8). There were 815 and 1057 events of the composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin 
group and in the placebo group, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 
11.8 and 15.3.

Hazard ratio for CV death as an individual component is derived from Cox proportional hazards regression. 
An HF event includes hospitalisations for HF and urgent HF visits. 
Event rates are presented as the number of events per 100 patient-years of follow-up. Rate ratio for Dapa 10 mg vs 
placebo, CI, and 2-sided p-value are calculated from the LWYY proportional rates model stratified by T2DM status at 
randomisation, with a factor for treatment group as a covariate. If HF events and CV death occurred on the same 
day, then only CV death is counted in this table.

Subpopulation with LVEF < 60% 
Consistent with the results in the full study population, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in 
reducing the incidence of composite of CV death and recurrent HF events in the subpopulation with 
LVEF < 60% (rate ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.65, 0.90], p = 0.0017). The numbers of patients with ≥ 1 and 
≥ 2 events of the composite endpoint were lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group. Results of a supportive analysis, using a joint frailty model, were consistent with the main 
analysis of the endpoint. 
A post-hoc analysis of composite of CV death and recurrent HF events showed consistent treatment 
effect in the complement subpopulation with LVEF ≥ 60%. 
Change from Baseline at 8 Months in the Total Symptom Score of KCCQ 
To mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the main analyses of KCCQ-TSS were 
conducted in patients who had the 8-month assessment (Visit 5) planned or performed prior to 
11 March 2020 (when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO).  
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in providing symptom benefit as measured by KCCQ-TSS 
(Table 9). A rank-based ANCOVA (including deaths as the worst outcomes) was used to analyse 
KCCQ-TSS. Both the symptom frequency and the symptom burden subdomains contributed to the 
overall treatment effect. Results of a sensitivity analysis with an alternative ranking of death were 
consistent with those of the main analysis.

The p-value is obtained from a rank-based ANCOVA adjusted for baseline KCCQ score, stratified by T2DM 
status at randomisation. 
Including subjects with the 8-month assessment (Visit 5) planned or performed prior to 11 March 2020, when 
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. Subjects with planned but not performed assessment prior to 
11 March 2020 were imputed. Change from baseline at the respective assessment time point is converted to ranks. 
Subjects who died prior to the assessment are assigned worst ranks. Among the deceased, the relative ranking is

The mean change in KCCQ-TSS from baseline at 8 months was 8.3 and 5.2 in the dapagliflozin group 
and in the placebo group, respectively.  
For the DELIVER study, the MAH extensively investigated the clinically meaningful individual levels of 
change from baseline at 8 months in KCCQ-TSS using an anchor-based approach, in accordance with 
the guidelines from the FDA workshop (see FDA 2019). The results of these responder analyses 
showed that a smaller proportion of patients in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group deteriorated by ≥ 5 points (reflecting moderate deterioration) or ≥ 14 points (reflecting large 
deterioration) on the KCCQ-TSS at 8 months (Table 10). The responder analysis of improvement did 
not show a significant difference between treatment groups.

Subpopulation with LVEF < 60% 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary composite endpoint was consistent across the prespecified 
subgroups in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60%. 
Impact of COVID-19 on DELIVER 
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In DELIVER, 
majority of patients (81.7%) were randomised prior to the start of the pandemic, whereas the majority 
of follow-up (75.9% of total patient-years until last visit) was during the pandemic phase.  
The results of the sensitivity analyses for the primary composite endpoint and the first secondary 
composite endpoint, in which patients were censored at the onset date of the first AE associated with 
COVID-19 infection, showed consistency with the main analyses. Therefore, the overall impact of 
COVID-19 pandemic on efficacy evaluation was assessed as low, and the COVID-19 pandemic was 
judged to not have meaningfully impacted the interpretation of results. 
Summary of main study 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled Analysis of DELIVER and DAPA-HF  
This section summarises the results from the pooled analysis of patient-level data from DELIVER and 
DAPA-HF.  
Primary Composite Endpoint of CV Death or an HF Event 
Treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in 
the primary composite endpoint of CV death or an HF event, when compared with placebo, in both 
DELIVER and DAPA-HF (Figure 12). This benefit was also observed for the individual components in 
both studies. An interaction p-value of 0.2970 for the primary composite endpoint provided no 
evidence of heterogeneity between studies. This supports the consistent treatment effect observed 
across the prespecified LVEF subgroups in both DELIVER and in DAPA-HF.

Definitions of the primary composite endpoints from each study are used. In DAPA-HF the primary composite 
endpoint included death with undetermined cause of death. Hazard ratio for Dapa 10 mg vs placebo, CIs, and

randomisation, and adjusted for history of hospitalisation for HF. The interaction p-value is calculated from the 
same model and including a term for the study by treatment interaction.

A fitted linear model, that includes the horizontal reference line of the overall treatment effect in the

CV Death and All-Cause Mortality 
The pooled analysis, using the respective study definitions of CV death, demonstrated a relative risk 
reduction of 15% (95% CI 4 to 25%, p = 0.0115) in CV death, with both studies contributing to the 
result, and with an interaction p-value of 0.5860, providing no evidence of heterogeneity between 
studies (Figure 14). Results of a sensitivity analysis, that included ‘undetermined cause of death’ as 
CV death in both studies, were consistent with those of the main analysis.

treatment effect by study (interaction p-value 0.2143). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were conducted in special populations. The DELIVER study included a large group of 
patients aged > 75 years with a maximum age of 99 years.

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of the clinical study 
DELIVER was an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase III study in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. DELIVER evaluated the effect 
of dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, given once daily, in reducing the composite of CV death 
or an HF event.  
No dose finding study has been performed. The dose of 10 mg was chosen, justified by data 
supporting that this dose maximally inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney. Previous experience has not shown 
any apparent difference in safety profile between doses. In the scientific advice given in 2017, the 
CHMP recommended that more than one dose should be investigated as “the Mode of Action for HF 
treatment has not been established, and the dose-effect relationship with regard to PD parameters is 
still uncertain”. Lower doses therefore could be efficacious in HF. The MAH has provided a summary of 
published data supporting a plausible mechanism of action for SGLT2 inhibitors when used in the 
treatment of heart failure, but this data does not provide any information on the dose-effect 
relationship. It should however be noted that only the 10 mg dose was investigated in the DAPA-HF 
study. The DAPA-HF study included patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF, i.e., a potentially 
more vulnerable population. In this study, dapagliflozin 10 mg dose was superior to placebo in 
reducing the incidence of the composite of CV death or a HF event with an acceptable safety profile. 
Thus, the choice of dose can be accepted. 
The inclusion criteria were adequate and aimed at including a population with symptomatic HF (NYHA 
class II to IV) and preserved LVEF (LVEF > 40%; HFpEF). Characteristics of HF were clearly defined in 
line with the given scientific advice. Exclusion criteria were adequate. In the scientific advice, it was 
suggested that for normotensive HFpEF patients the 5 mg doses could be more appropriate; lowering 
BP in these normotensive patients could be of concern. In this context, it should be noted that patients 
with SBP < 95 mmHg were not included due to the blood pressure lowering effect of dapagliflozin. 
Patients with eGFR <25 were also excluded. Known causes for HFpEF are infiltrative diseases, such as 
amyloidosis, however, patients with these diseases were excluded from participation in the study. The 
lack of data in this population has been reflected in the product information (section 4.4). 
Patients with T1DM were also excluded. Currently the recommendation not to use dapagliflozin in 
patients with T1DM is given in relation to the information on diabetic ketoacidosis in section 4.4. 
Taking into consideration that dapagliflozin is approved in other indications than the treatment of 
diabetes, i.e., HF and CKD, the warning against the use in T1DM has been included in the beginning of 
section 4.4. 
The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin 10 mg is superior to placebo in reducing 
the composite of CV death and HF events (hospitalisation for HF or urgent HF visit) and the primary 
variable was time from randomisation to the first event included in the composite endpoint. All primary 
endpoint events were adjudicated. The secondary endpoints included the composite of CV death and 
HF events (first and recurrent), change from baseline in the TSS of the KCCQ at 8 months, time to CV 
death and time to all-cause mortality. The objectives and endpoints are acceptable and in line with the 
“Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of chronic heart failure” 
(CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). Although the scientific advice recommended to consider all-cause death 
for the primary endpoint, the use of CV death has been accepted for the DAPA-HF trial. 
The statistical methods including study design and statistical analysis are in general considered 
adequate. The applicant has supported the results of the primary and secondary analysis sufficiently 
with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of results regarding any bias caused by intercurrent 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 48/81 
 
 
 
or competing events and missingness considering that such events were well balanced between 
treatment groups and missingness (due to incomplete follow-up) at a low level. The method used for 
alpha splitting between the total and subpopulation adjusting for the correlation is not well known and 
an analytical proof was not provided. Given the results in this study, there is, however, no concern for 
the robustness of the results. The subgroup analysis in the populations with LVEF<60%, which was 
included in the multiple testing procedure, and additional analysis in the complementary subgroup with 
LVEF ≥60% in the DELIVER study and pooled analysis in the DELIVER and DAPA-HF studies are 
considered sufficient to resolve concerns regarding differential treatment effects depending on LVEF. 
Concerns were raised regarding study integrity and the maintenance of blinding considering the interim 
analysis and the multiple amendments of the clinical study protocol and statistical analysis plan. On 
request, the MAH provided more detailed information on measures taken to maintain the blind of the 
study, as well as the timeline for changes to the CSP and the SAP in relation to the interim analysis. All 
the important changes were made before the DMC session for the interim analysis. The clarifications 
are deemed acceptable. 
The protocol was amended four times. With the second amendment the sample size was increased, 
and the recruitment period was extended. With the third amendment, changes were made to the 
endpoints and analyses: 1) Addition of urgent HF visits in addition to hospitalisations for HF to be 
evaluated for the first secondary endpoint. 2) Introduction of dual primary analysis (of the full study 
population and subpopulation with LVEF < 60%). 3) CV death was added as secondary objective. 4) 
The secondary objective (change in NYHA class) was moved to exploratory. None of the amendments 
are deemed to have affected the outcome or interpretation of the study. 
In total 3.7% of patients had an important protocol deviation, the patient being randomised without 
fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria was the most common. 36 patients were included without fulfilling 
the inclusion criterion of LVEF > 40% and evidence of structural heart disease within the last 12 
months prior to enrolment. Thus, the important protocol deviations were relatively few and balanced 
between groups and are therefore not considered to have affected the outcome or interpretation of the 
study. COVID-19 related protocol deviations were common (41.1% of patients) but only 0.1% had 
important protocol deviations. These protocol deviations are not considered to have affected the 
outcome of the study. 
Among the 10418 patients enrolled, 4155 were not randomised, the main reason being not eligible. 
The most common reason for not being eligible was failure to fulfil the NT-pro BNP criteria (3373 
subjects, 32.4%). This pattern was observed and discussed during the assessment of the DAPA-HF 
study. As in the DAPA-HF study, this criterion aimed at ensuring that the patients indeed had HF. The 
subgroup analysis show that the outcome was not affected by the level of NT-pro BNP, as was also 
observed in the DAPA-HF study. The observation is not considered to compromise the 
representativeness of the study population. The number of patients discontinuing treatment (in total 
886 patients) was balanced between groups, as was the reasons for discontinuation. Only 18 subjects 
withdrew consent (also balanced between groups), and vital status was known for all but four patients. 
Treatment compliance was high and balanced between treatment groups. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 6263 patients were randomised from 350 study sites in 20 countries. The median time in 
study until PACD was 28.0 months and median time until last visit was 28.5 months. The mean age of 
the study population was 71.7 years and 43.9% of patients were female. 48% of patients were 
recruited in Europe/Saudi Arabia (only 190 out of 3005 patients were recruited from Saudi Arabia).

Almost 45% of patients had a medical history of T2DM. About 75% of patients were in NYHA class II 
and about 24% were in NYHA class III. 30% of patients had a LVEF ≥ 60%. Most patients were 
diagnosed with HF < 5 years before enrolment and 40.5% of patients had been hospitalised for HF 
prior to study enrolment. The median LVEF was 54.0% and the median NT-proBNP was 1011.0 pg/mL. 
Four subjects had eGFR<25, i.e., had an eGFR below the cut-off in the exclusion criterion. Overall, 
49% had eGFR<60. The medical and relevant surgical history of the patients, as well as the smoking 
history, was balanced between treatment groups. Hypertension and CVD were commonly reported. 
The study population appears representative for the proposed target population. 
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics in the subpopulation with LVEF < 60% were 
generally balanced and consistent with those of the full study population. Compared to the full 
population where about 30% had a LVEF >60%, the proportion of patients with myocardial infarction, 
stable angina pectoris, and coronary artery stenosis tended to be higher in patients with LVEF <60%. 
Almost all patients (97.8%) were on diuretics at randomisation. The majority of patients (64.8%) were 
on dual combination therapy with ACEi/ARB/ARNI and a betablocker whereas 29.2% were on triple 
therapy with ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta blocker and MRA. The proportion of patients on ARNI (4.8%) was 
about half of that reported in the DAPA-HF study (10.7%). At the time of the initiation of the study, no 
medicinal product was approved for the treatment of HFpEF, but the high use of medication may be 
explained by the medical history of the patients, e.g., a high reporting of hypertension and CV 
diseases. During the study, no imbalances were observed with regards to the use of ACEi, ARB, ARNI, 
and MRA between groups. 2.2% of subjects were on concomitant SGLT2i during the study. Baseline 
treatment seems to have been adequate and according to treatment guidelines. 
The study met the primary endpoint as dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence 
of primary composite endpoint of CV death or an HF event (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73, 0.92], 
p = 0.0008). The event rates per 100 patient-years of 7.8 for dapagliflozin and 9.6 for placebo. All 
components of the composite endpoint contributed to the outcome, although CI overlapped for CV-
death and urgent HF visits. The performed sensitivity analyses are considered sufficient to support the 
robustness of the primary results considering the balance of intercurrent events between treatment 
arms and the balance and overall low frequency of incomplete follow-up.  
The outcome in the subgroup with LVEF < 60% was in line with that if the overall population. The 
sensitivity analysis is considered sufficient regarding the evaluation of bias caused by “undetermined 
cause of death”. No complementary analysis of the population with LVEF > 60% has been provided, 
however, the subgroup analysis by LVEF showed a comparable outcome in this group.  
The composite secondary endpoint of recurrent HF events and CV death was also met (RR 0.77 [95% 
CI 0.67, 0.89], p = 0.0003), again the outcome was mainly driven by the recurrent HF events. The 
outcome in the subgroup with LVEF < 60% was in line with that if the overall population.  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main analysis for the change from baseline in TSS of KCCQ was 
conducted in patients who had their 8-month assessment performed prior to 11 March 2020. After that 
time-point phone collection of KCCQ was introduced as an alternative solution. The change from 
baseline in KCCQ Scores was significantly greater in the dapagliflozin treated group (WR1.11 [95% CI 
1.03, 1.21], p = 0.0086). The responder analysis showed that the proportion of patients who 
experienced a moderate (≥ 5 points) or large (≥ 14 points) deterioration in KCCQ Scores was 
significantly lower in the dapagliflozin treated group (moderate: 24% vs 29% and large: 13.5% vs 
18.4%), whereas no differences were observed for patients reporting an improvement.  
CV deaths were numerically fewer in the dapagliflozin treated group (231 vs 261), but the difference 
was not statistically significant. The events of all-cause death were also numerically fewer in the 
dapagliflozin treated group (497 vs 526), but again the difference was not statistically significant.

Subgroup analysis of the primary composite endpoint showed that the outcome was consistent across 
all prespecified subgroups by LVEF, including the subgroup with LVEF > 60%, as well as across all 
prespecified demographic subgroups. The only divergent findings were observed in one very small 
subgroup, i.e., Black or African. The subgroup analysis performed on the subpopulation with LVEF 
<60% was consistent with the overall population.  
Analysis of the data to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic did not reveal any 
inconsistencies compared to the main analysis. 
No studies were conducted in special populations. The DELIVER study included a large group of 
patients aged ≥ 75 years (2587 patients, 41.4% of the study population) with a maximum age of 99 
years.  On request, the MAH provided a subgroup analysis for the age groups <65, 65-74, 75-84 and 
≥ 85 years, which showed that the outcome of the primary composite endpoint was consistent across 
the age groups. 
A pooled analysis of patient-level data from the two studies DELIVER and DAPA-HF was conducted. The 
studies were of similar design, but the DAPA-HF study included patients with reduced LVEF (<40%). 
There was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Analysis of the pooled data for the primary 
composite endpoint resulted in a HR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.72, 0.85). The analysis further showed a 
consistent effect over the entire range of LVEF observed at baseline, with a stable HR of about 0.8. In 
a subject level pooled analysis of the two studies, a significant effect on CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 
0.75, 0.96]) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.82, 0.99]) is observed. The effect on CV 
death was consistent across the range of observed LVEF at baseline. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
With this application the MAH seek to extend the heart failure indication to include patients with 
preserved LVEF to the currently approved heart failure indication. To support the claim, data from a 
large, well conducted study, DELIVER, has been submitted. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in 
reducing the incidence of primary composite endpoint of CV death or an HF event with a 18 % relative 
risk reduction (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73, 0.92], p = 0.0008). This is considered a clinically relevant 
effect. The effect was consistent across subgroups. A pooled analysis including data from DELIVER and 
the previously assessed study, DAPA-HF, showed a consistent effect irrespective of baseline LVEF. 
Furthermore, a subject level pooled analysis of the two studies showed a significant effect on CV and 
all-cause mortality. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Forxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction. The main evidence of efficacy and safety submitted to support the indication was the 
DAPA-HF study in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) 
and included subjects with and without T2DM. The current safety evaluation is based on data from the 
completed DELIVER study. The target population had a documented diagnosis of symptomatic HF with 
LVEF >40% in patients with T2DM and without diabetes.  
No subgroup analysis regarding the effect of T2DM has been provided in the DELIVER study; however, 
this was performed in the HF-DAPA study. In subjects with HFrEF, the safety profile with regards to 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 51/81 
 
 
 
 
SAEs did not differ in any substantial way between patients with and without diabetes and HbA1c was 
not reduced in non-diabetic subjects. Also, based on the mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is not 
expected to pose an unwarranted risk of hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes. 
Patient exposure 
In the DELIVER study, in total 6,253 patients were treated with dapagliflozin (n=3,126) or placebo 
(n=3,127). In the study, there were 6,426 patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin.  
Duration of exposure 
The duration of exposure ranged from 0 to 42.2 months (Table 14). The median duration of exposure 
to was similar between the dapagliflozin group (26.9 months) and the placebo group (27.0 months).

Interruptions of investigational product 
The proportions of patients with interruptions of IP were balanced between treatment groups: 
585 patients (18.7%) in the dapagliflozin group and 622 patients (19.9%) in the placebo group. Most 
patients had only one period of interruption of IP. The median number of days per interruption was 
11 days in the dapagliflozin group and 10 days in the placebo group. Reasons for interruption were 
comparable between treatment groups. The most common reason for interruption of IP was AE: 
426 patients (13.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 484 patients (15.5%) in the placebo group.  
The most common AE, by PT, that led to interruption of IP was cardiac failure: 46 patients (1.5%) in 
the dapagliflozin group and 64 patients (2.0%) in the placebo group.

Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics, including background therapy and medical history, 
were balanced between treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
An overall summary of AEs for patients on treatment and on and off treatment is presented in Table 
15. Non-serious AEs were only collected for the following reasons: DAE, Amputations, AEs leading to 
amputation, ‘Preceding events’, Potential DKA, Major hypoglycaemic events, Cardiac ischaemic events 
(MI, unstable angina) and stroke, and AEs leading to interruption of IP.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
During the on- and off-treatment period, the proportions of patients who had an AE with outcome of 
death were balanced between treatment groups: 507 patients (16.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 
529 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group. During the on-treatment period, there were 401 patients 
(12.8%) in the dapagliflozin group and 421 patients (13.5%) in the placebo group who had an AE with 
outcome of death. Deaths by SOC and PT were generally balanced between treatment groups. Most 
deaths occurred in the SOCs of cardiac disorders and infections and infestations in both treatment 
groups.  
On and off treatment, there were 132 AEs associated with COVID-19 infection with an outcome of 
death: 74 (2.4%) in the dapagliflozin group and 58 (1.9%) in the placebo group. The results from the 
on-treatment period were consistent with the results from the on- and off-treatment period.

Other serious adverse events 
On treatment, the proportions of patients with SAEs were balanced between treatment groups: 
1361 patients (43.5%) in the dapagliflozin group and 1423 patients (45.5%) in the placebo group. The 
3 most reported SAEs by PT, were cardiac failure, COVID-19, and pneumonia in both treatment groups 
(Table 16). The proportions of patients with SAEs in the SOC of infections and infestations were 
balanced between treatment groups. Number of subjects with SAEs, by system organ class and

leading to amputations, ’preceding events’, ischaemic cardiac events, strokes, Fournier’s gangrene, 
genital infections, and urinary tract infections were presented.  
Volume depletion 
On treatment, the proportions of patients with SAEs suggestive of volume depletion were low and 
balanced between treatment groups: 35 patients (1.1%) in the dapagliflozin group and 31 patients 
(1.0%) in the placebo group (Table 18). Three SAEs suggestive of volume depletion (2 patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 1 patient in the placebo group) were fatal. All 3 patients had multiple severe

underlying conditions and were on IP for at least one year before the fatal event occurred. The 3 most 
commonly reported SAEs suggestive of volume depletion by PT, were syncope, hypotension, and 
dehydration in both treatment groups. DAEs suggestive of volume depletion were few and numerically 
higher in the dapagliflozin group: 9 patients (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and 3 patients (0.1%) in 
the placebo group.

Diabetic ketoacidosis 
On treatment, there were 2 patients with definite DKA events in the dapagliflozin group compared with 
none in the placebo group. Both patients had T2DM and were treated with insulin; neither of them had 
a fatal outcome. None of the patients with DKA had an AE associated with COVID-19 infection.

Major hypoglycaemic events 
On treatment, the proportions of patients with major hypoglycaemic events were low and balanced 
between treatment groups: 6 patients (0.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 7 patients (0.2%) in the 
placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 0.1 and 0.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively (Table 
23). No major hypoglycaemic events were reported for patients without T2DM. 
Patients with major hypoglycaemic events in both treatment groups were treated with sulfonylureas or 
insulin, or in combination, at the time of the event, except for 1 patient in the placebo group who was 
only treated with biguanides.

Amputations and adverse events leading to amputation 
On and off treatment, the proportions of patients with amputations were balanced between treatment 
groups. There were 19 patients (0.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 26 patients (0.8%) in the 
placebo group who underwent at least one amputation, corresponding to event rates of 0.3 and 0.4 
per 100 patient-years, respectively. All but 4 patients in each treatment group had T2DM at baseline.

Most patients with surgical amputations had one amputation; all but one was lower limb amputations. 
The numbers of patients with major amputations (below knee and above knee) were the same in both 
treatment groups (8 patients in each treatment group) (Table 24).  
AEs leading to amputation were balanced between treatment groups. The most common AE, by PT, 
leading to amputation was osteomyelitis, occurring in 3 patients (0.1%) in the dapagliflozin group and 
6 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group.

Potential risk factor AEs for amputations affecting lower limbs (‘Preceding Events’) 
On and off treatment, the proportions of patients with ‘preceding events’ were balanced between 
treatment groups: 206 patients (6.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 218 patients (7.0%) in the 
placebo group. Of patients with ‘preceding events’, 18 patients (0.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 
25 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group had subsequent amputations.

Fournier’s gangrene 
SAEs or DAEs indicating genital area infections or necrotising fasciitis were identified based on a 
prespecified list of PTs. The identified events were then medically assessed by the MAH using pre-
defined criteria to confirm cases of Fournier’s gangrene. All assessments were made prior to unblinding 
of treatment allocation. 
On- and off-treatment, 4 SAEs were identified for internal blinded medical assessment: 1 patient in the 
dapagliflozin group and 3 patients in the placebo group. None of these events were confirmed as 
Fournier’s gangrene.

Genital infections 
On treatment, SAEs and DAEs of genital infections were rare. There were 2 SAEs of genital infection; 
1 patient in each treatment group. There were 3 patients with a DAE of genital infection in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with none in the placebo group. 
Urinary tract infections 
On treatment, the proportions of patients with SAEs and DAEs of urinary tract infections were balanced 
between treatment groups. There were 78 patients with SAEs of urinary tract infection: 41 (1.3%) in 
the dapagliflozin group and 37 (1.2%) in the placebo group. The most common SAE of urinary tract 
infection, by PT, was urinary tract infection, occurring in 30 patients (1.0%) in the dapagliflozin group 
and 32 patients (1.0%) in the placebo group. There were 22 patients with a DAE of urinary tract 
infection: 13 (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin group and 9 (0.3%) in the placebo group. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
Creatinine/ eGFR 
There was an initial slight increase in mean serum creatinine, which was more pronounced in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. At 24 months, the mean changes from baseline 
in serum creatinine were similar in both treatment groups (Table 26). In line with the findings for 
serum creatinine, there was an initial decrease in mean eGFR, which was more pronounced in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. At 24 months, change in eGFR from baseline 
was similar in both treatment groups (Table 27). 
There were more patients with a marked abnormality in serum creatinine (defined as ≥ 1.5 times 
baseline value) in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group, whereas the proportions 
of patients with a marked abnormality in serum creatinine (defined as ≥ 2 times baseline value) were 
balanced between treatment groups (Table 28).

Extrinsic factors 
No extrinsic factors were analysed in the DELIVER study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between dapagliflozin and other drugs or food were addressed in the original dapagliflozin 
T2DM clinical programme. For a summary, refer to the dapagliflozin product label. No new information 
is available on the potential impact on safety of such interactions in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The proportions of patients with DAEs were low and balanced between treatment groups: 182 patients 
(5.8%) in the dapagliflozin group and 181 patients (5.8%) in the placebo group (Table 37). DAEs by 
PT were distributed among many PTs. The most common AEs by PT, that led to permanent

Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant and nursing patients were excluded from participating in the DELIVER study. There were no 
pregnancies reported during the study.  
Overdose 
In DELIVER, an overdose was defined as the accidental or intentional suspected single intake of more 
than 50 tablets of 10 mg dapagliflozin tablets, or repeated intake of more than 10 tablets of 10 mg 
dapagliflozin tablets. No events of IP overdose were reported during the DELIVER study. 
Drug abuse 
The potential for drug abuse for dapagliflozin has not been studied. Based on its pharmacological 
properties, dapagliflozin is not likely to have a potential for drug abuse and no findings during the 
clinical study programme indicate that dapagliflozin induces drug abuse or dependence.

Withdrawal and rebound 
The effect of dapagliflozin withdrawal and rebound has not been studied. There is no evidence that 
suggests the potential for withdrawal or rebound. 
Post marketing experience 
Dapagliflozin was first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in Australia on 05 October 2012 
and it is currently approved in over 100 countries. Dapagliflozin is also approved for the treatment of 
HF with LVEF ≤ 40% in more than 100 countries and chronic kidney disease in more than 90 countries. 
Furthermore, it is approved for type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japan. 
Post-marketing experience in the approved indications is summarised in regular PBRERs that are 
submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide. The dapagliflozin PBRER with data lock 04 April 2022 
(dated 30 May 2022) included more than 24 million patient-years of post-marketing exposure 
(cumulative until 31 March 2022). At the data lock of the dapagliflozin PBRER, there was no new 
information to alter the overall positive benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin in the approved indications. 
Impact of Covid 19 
About 76% of the follow-up time of the study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 9.4% 
of all patients had at least one reported AE associated with COVID-19 infection, 10.0% in the 
dapagliflozin group and 8.8% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with any SAE associated 
with COVID-19 (10.0% vs 8.7%) and an COVID-19 infection associated AE with outcome death (2.4% 
vs 1.9%) was also numerically higher in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to have an impact on the interpretation of the safety 
results. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the DELIVER study, 3,126 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 6,426 PY 
regardless of interruptions (i.e., on and off treatment), with 2,682 subjects (86%) for at least 52 
weeks, 2,306 subjects (74%) for at least 1,5 years and 1,898 subjects (61%) for at least 2 years. The 
mean duration of exposure for dapagliflozin was 24.7 months, and the median duration of exposure 
was 26.9 months. The actual mean/median duration of exposure, excluding interruptions (i.e., on-
treatment) was similar to ‘on and off treatment’ with a total exposure of 6,372 PY for dapagliflozin. The 
median duration of follow-up was 28 months. 
Data collection in this study focused on serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation (DAEs) and 
AEs of special interest. 
On-treatment, the number of fatal cases (12.8% and 13.5%) and SAEs (43.5% and 45.5%) were 
balanced between dapagliflozin and placebo. The most frequently reported SAEs for dapagliflozin and 
placebo were in the SOC Infections and infestations (16.4% and 16.2%) and the SOC Cardiac 
disorders (18.5% and 21.2%). The most reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were cardiac 
failure (8.4% vs 11.0%), COVID-19 (5.3% vs 4.2%), pneumonia (3.1% vs 3.1%) and COVID-19 
pneumonia (2.5% vs 2.6%).

Urinary tract infections 
The incidence of SAEs (1.3% vs 1.2%) and DAEs (0.4% vs 0.3%) of UTIs for dapagliflozin vs placebo 
were balanced.   
Genital infections 
Two SAEs of genital infection one in each treatment group were reported. Three patients (0.1%), all in 
the dapagliflozin treatment group, had a DAE of genital infection.  
Volume depletion 
The incidence of SAEs suggestive of volume depletion was low and balanced for dapagliflozin (1.1%) 
and placebo (1.0%).  
Renal events  
The incidence of serious renal adverse events (1.8% and 2.2%) and the discontinuation rate or renal 
adverse events (0.7% and 0.6%) was balanced for dapagliflozin and placebo. The same pattern was 
observed for SAEs of acute kidney injury, i.e., the incidences was balanced for dapagliflozin (1.5%) 
and placebo (1.6%). 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
In the dapagliflozin group, 3 events (in 2 subjects) were adjudicated as a definite DKA and 2 events as 
a possible DKA. In the placebo group no event was adjudicated as a definite DKA and 2 events as a 
possible DKA. 
Major hypoglycaemic events 
In the DELIVER study, only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. On treatment, subjects with 
major hypoglycaemic events were balanced; 0.2% in the dapagliflozin (n=6) and placebo group (n=7), 
respectively. Four serious cases in the dapagliflozin group and one in the placebo group. No subject 
discontinued due to any major hypoglycaemic event. All patients with major hypoglycaemic events had 
T2DM at baseline. 
Amputations 
On- and off-treatment, the incidence of subjects who underwent at least one amputation was 0.6% 
(n=19) in the dapagliflozin group and 0.8% (n=26) in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates 
of 0.3 and 0.4 subjects per 100 patient-years, respectively. All subjects, except 4 patients in each 
treatment group, had T2DM at baseline. Most subjects with surgical amputations in the dapagliflozin 
group (63%) and the placebo group (58%) had one amputation; all but one (in the dapagliflozin 
group) was lower limb amputations. The numbers of patients with major amputations (below knee and 
above knee) were the same in both treatment groups (8 patients in each treatment group). 
The number of patients with any potential risk factor AE related to risk for lower limb amputation was 
6.6% for dapagliflozin and 7.0% for placebo. Of these patients, the number of patients who underwent 
subsequent amputations was 0.6% (n=18) in the dapagliflozin treatment group, and 0.8% (n=25) in 
the placebo group.  
Fournier’s gangrene 
On- and off-treatment, 4 subjects with SAE indicating genital area infections or necrotising fasciitis 
were identified: 1 (0.0%) in the dapagliflozin groups (1 anal abscess) and 3 (0.1%) in the placebo 
group (1 necrotising fasciitis, 1 testicular abscess and 1 vulval cellulitis). None of the events was 
confirmed by the Applicant as Fournier’s gangrene. 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 68/81 
 
 
 
Cardiac ischaemic events and stroke 
On treatment, the incidence of subjects with unstable angina (1.7% vs 2.2% for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo) or myocardial infarction AE (2.2% vs 2.3% for dapagliflozin vs placebo) were balanced or 
slightly higher for placebo compared with dapagliflozin. The incidence of subjects with any stroke AE 
was balanced for dapagliflozin (3.4%) and placebo (3.2%), respectively. 
Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
In the DELIVER study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The 
change in eGFR was after 1 month of treatment more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to 
placebo (-6.0% vs -0.7%); however, the difference between dapagliflozin and placebo was less 
noticeable at 24 months (-6.9% vs -5.3%). More patients in the dapagliflozin group (7.8%) than in the 
placebo group (5.7%) had a serum creatinine ≥1.5 times baseline value. The number of patients with 
serum creatinine ≥2 times baseline value was balanced between treatment groups (1.1% and 1.2%). 
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo; 
mean change from baseline up to 36 months of treatment was -2.45 kg (-3.0%) for dapagliflozin and -
0.27 kg (-0.3%) for placebo. 
A decrease in mean blood pressure was observed with dapagliflozin vs placebo at month 1 (mean 
changes of -2.3 mm Hg vs -0.4 mm Hg in SBP) and month 24 (mean changes of -1.1 mm Hg vs 0.3 
mm Hg in SBP). This is consistent with the known osmotic diuretic effect of dapagliflozin. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In the DELIVER study, 24% (n=1,502) were ≤65 years of age and 76% (n=4,751) were >65 years of 
age. About 38% (n=2,343) of the subjects were >75 years of age. A slightly higher reporting rate of 
SAEs, DAEs and AEs leading to interruptions were noted in the older age group, although the 
incidences between treatment groups were overall balanced or higher in the placebo groups. However, 
the incidence of any AE possibly related to IP was increased for dapagliflozin compared to placebo in 
subjects >65 years (9.3% vs 7.6%) and in subjects >75 years (11.0% vs 8.7%) but was balanced in 
subjects ≤65 years (6.9% vs 7.2%) and in subjects ≤75 years (7.3% vs 6.9%).  
Effect by renal function 
The incidence of subjects with any SAE and the incidence of subjects with an AE with fatal outcome 
was higher in the subgroup eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with the eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 
m2 and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroups; although, the incidences between treatment groups 
were balanced or higher in the placebo group.  
Overall, subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher incidence of volume depletion, renal 
events and events of lower limb amputation compared to subjects with eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m. There was no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with 
declining renal function; however, subjects with AEs leading to interruptions were more common in 
subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with dapagliflozin (20.1%) than in those on placebo 
(17.9%).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The DELIVER study provides information on subjects with heart failure and LVEF >40%. No new safety 
concerns arise from the provided data.  
The safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with HF and LVEF >40% appears to be in general similar 
to the one previously documented in patients with HF and LVEF <40% (HFrEF), with and without 
T2DM. No subgroup analysis regarding the effect of T2DM has been provided in the DELIVER study; 
however, this was performed in the HF-DAPA study. In subjects with HFrEF, the safety profile with 
regards to SAEs did not differ between patients with and without diabetes and HbA1c was not reduced 
in non-diabetic subjects. Based on the mechanism of action, it is not expected that dapagliflozin poses 
an unwarranted risk of hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes.  
In the overall population and in the additional subgroup analyses on renal function, the number of 
SAEs was balanced or lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group.  
The incidence of volume depletion, renal events and events of lower limb amputation increased with 
decreasing baseline eGFR. In the subgroup eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, more subjects interrupted 
treatment due to an AE in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. However, there was no 
indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal function.  
A slightly higher reporting rate of SAEs, DAEs and AEs leading to interruptions were noted in the older 
age groups, although the incidences between treatment groups were overall balanced or higher in the 
placebo groups. However, the incidence of any AE possibly related to IP was increased for dapagliflozin 
compared to placebo in older subjects (>65 years and >75 years) but was balanced in subjects ≤65 
years and ≤75 years. Elderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion and are more 
likely to have impaired renal function, and/or more likely to be treated with diuretics and with 
anti-hypertensive products. The present warning in section 4.4 regarding elderly is considered 
sufficient.

2.7.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to include 
information on the use of dapagliflozin in the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure.  
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The scope of this application is to extend the current indication “treatment of symptomatic chronic 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction” to include heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or 
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF > 40%). 
The claimed indication is: 
“Forxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction.” 
The prevalence of known HF is approximately 1% to 2% of the general adult population. HF with LVEF 
> 40% accounts for approximately half of all HF cases. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome consisting of 
cardinal symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by 
signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due 
to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart. 
Patients with signs and symptoms of HF are categorized, based on measurement of left-ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), as having HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF) (typically <40%) or HF with 
preserved LVEF (HFpEF). HFpEF is typically defined as LVEF ≥50%; HF with LVEF in the 40% to 49% 
may be characterized as HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF). Diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or 
angiotensin II receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and beta-
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 74/81 
 
 
 
blockers can improve symptoms and haemodynamics as well as reduce hospitalizations and mortality 
(Iwaz et al 2016). 
With regards to heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), the ESC Guideline 
(McDonagh et al 2021) states that diuretics should be used to control congestion. Although the 
guideline does not make any strong recommendations, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or 
angiotensin II receptor blockers-neprilysin inhibitor may be considered based on subgroup analysis of 
trials in HFpEF.  
Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, currently approved for the treatment of T2DM (since 2012), 
HFrEF, and CKD. The indication for the treatment of HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), approved in Nov 2020, was 
based on positive results from the DAPA-HF study (D1699C00001). 
There is a lack of approved pharmacotherapy indicated for heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) as reflected in the current HF treatment guidelines. However, recently (March 2022), 
another SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, was approved for the use in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. 
Considering that HF is a common and serious medical condition with a high risk of repeat 
hospitalisation for HF and a high mortality, there remains an unmet medical need for new treatment 
options that reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF and LVEF > 40%. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
DELIVER was a Phase III international, multi-centre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in 6263 patients (44% female) with HF and LVEF > 40%. The primary 
objective was to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets versus placebo, given once daily, in 
reducing the composite of CV death or an HF event (hospitalisation for HF or urgent HF visit). Two 
hypotheses were tested for this primary objective simultaneously: in the full study population and in a 
subpopulation with LVEF < 60%. The secondary endpoints included the composite of CV death and HF 
events (first and recurrent), change from baseline in the TSS of the KCCQ at 8 months, time to CV 
death and time to all-cause mortality. 
The median time in study until PACD was 28.0 months and median time until last visit was 
28.5 months. The mean age of the study population was 71.7 years and 43.9% of patients were 
female. 48% of patients were recruited in Europe/Saudi Arabia. Almost 45% of patients had a medical 
history of T2DM. About 75% of patients were in NYHA class II and about 24% were in NYHA class III. 
30% of patients had a LVEF ≥ 60%. Most patients were diagnosed with HF < 5 years before enrolment 
and 40.5% of patients had been hospitalised for HF prior to study enrolment. The median LVEF was 
54.0% and the median NT-proBNP was 1011.0 pg/mL. 
DELIVER and DAPA-HF, the latter being a study in patients with HF and reduced LVEF, were powered 
for the primary composite endpoint and not for individual components of the composite. A pooled 
analysis of patient-level data from DELIVER and DAPA-HF has been provided to assess whether the 
treatment effect of dapagliflozin in patients with HF is modified by LVEF, and to provide a more precise 
estimate of the treatment effect of dapagliflozin on CV death. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of primary composite endpoint of CV 
death or an HF event (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73, 0.92], p = 0.0008). The event rates per 100 patient

years of 7.8 for dapagliflozin and 9.6 for placebo. All components of the composite endpoint 
contributed to the outcome, although CI overlapped for CV-death and urgent HF visits.  
The composite secondary endpoint of recurrent HF events and CV death was also met (RR 0.77 [95% 
CI 0.67, 0.89], p = 0.0003), again the outcome was mainly driven by the recurrent HF events.  
The outcome in the subgroup with LVEF < 60% was in line with that if the overall population for the 
primary endpoint and the composite secondary endpoint.  
The change from baseline in KCCQ Scores was significantly greater in the dapagliflozin treated group 
(WR1.11 [95% CI 1.03, 1.21], p = 0.0086). The responder analysis showed that the proportion of 
patients who experienced a moderate (≥ 5 points) or large (≥ 14 points) deterioration in KCCQ Scores 
was significantly lower in the dapagliflozin treated group (moderate: 24% vs 29% and large: 13.5% vs 
18.4%), whereas no differences were observed for patients reporting an improvement.  
CV deaths were numerically fewer in the dapagliflozin treated group (231 vs 261), but the difference 
was not statistically significant. The events of all-cause death were also numerically fewer in the 
dapagliflozin treated group (497 vs 526), but again the difference was not statistically significant.  
Subgroup analysis of the primary composite endpoint showed that the outcome was consistent across 
all prespecified subgroups by LVEF as well as across all prespecified demographic subgroups. The only 
divergent findings were observed in one very small subgroup, i.e., Black or African. The subgroup 
analysis performed on the subpopulation with LVEF <60% was consistent with the overall population. 
An additional subgroup analysis by age (<65, 65-74, 75-84 and ≥ 85 years) showed consistent 
findings across age groups.  
Analysis of the data to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic did not reveal any 
inconsistencies compared to the main analysis. 
The pooled analysis of patient level data from the two studies DELIVER and DAPA HF showed a HR of 
0.78 (95% CI 0.72, 0.85) for the primary composite endpoint. The analysis further showed a 
consistent effect over the entire range of LVEF observed at baseline, with a stable HR of about 0.8.  
In the pooled analysis, a significant effect on CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.75, 0.96]) and all-cause 
mortality (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.82, 0.99]) is observed. The effect on CV death was consistent across the 
range of observed LVEF at baseline. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the CHMP scientific advice in 2017, the MAH was requested to provide data in support of the 
mechanism of action for SGLT2 inhibitors when used in the treatment of heart failure. No new data has 
been provided, instead the MAH refers to the literature. The MAH’s interpretation of these data is that 
the primary effect of dapagliflozin—inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal kidney tubules—leads to 
changes in sodium, glucose, and fluid handling, which leads to a decrease in volume overload. This off-
loading of the heart has beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, which leads to improved diastolic 
parameters. The decongestive effect and reversal of some of the structural changes in the heart are 
the likely drivers of the benefit on HF events and mortality. 
There is uncertainty with respect to patients with chronic heart failure and T1DM. These patients were 
not included in the study and no data on efficacy in the heart failure indication are available. B/R 
cannot be considered positive in this population due to the increased risk of DKA in this population. 
Therefore, treatment of these patients is not recommended, as reflected in the SmPC.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In DELIVER, 3,126 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 6,426 PY (on- and 
off-treatment) with 86% exposed for at least 52 weeks and 61% for at least 2 years. The mean and 
median duration of exposure was 24.7 months and 26.9 months, respectively. 
Data collection in this study focused on serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation (DAEs) and 
AEs of special interest. 
The number of fatal cases (12.8% and 13.5%) and SAEs (43.5% and 45.5%) were balanced between 
dapagliflozin and placebo. The most frequently reported SAEs for dapagliflozin and placebo were in the 
SOC Infections and infestations (16.4% and 16.2%) and the SOC Cardiac disorders (18.5% and 
21.2%). The most reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were cardiac failure (8.4% vs 11.0%), 
COVID-19 (5.3% vs 4.2%), pneumonia (3.1% vs 3.1%) and COVID-19 pneumonia (2.5% vs 2.6%). 
The incidence of SAEs (1.3% vs 1.2%) and DAEs (0.4% vs 0.3%) of urinary tract infections for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo were balanced.   
Two SAEs of genital infections one in each treatment group were reported. Three patients (0.1%), all 
in the dapagliflozin treatment group, had a DAE of genital infection.  
Frequencies of SAEs suggestive of volume depletion was low and balanced for dapagliflozin (1.1%) and 
placebo (1.0%).  
SAEs of renal adverse events (1.8% and 2.2%) and the discontinuation rate or renal adverse events 
(0.7% and 0.6%) was balanced for dapagliflozin and placebo. The same pattern was observed for SAEs 
of acute kidney injury, i.e., the incidences for dapagliflozin (1.5%) and placebo (1.6%) was balanced. 
In the dapagliflozin group, 3 events (in 2 subjects) were adjudicated as a definite diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA) and 2 events as a possible DKA. In the placebo group no event was adjudicated as a definite 
DKA and 2 events as a possible DKA. 
In the DELIVER study, only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. On treatment, subjects with 
major hypoglycaemic events were balanced; 0.2% in the dapagliflozin (n=6) and placebo group (n=7), 
respectively. Four serious cases in the dapagliflozin group and one in the placebo group. No subject 
discontinued due to any major hypoglycaemic event.  All patients with major hypoglycaemic events 
had T2DM at baseline. 
On- and off-treatment, the incidence of subjects who underwent at least one amputation was 0.6% 
(n=19) in the dapagliflozin group and 0.8% (n=26) in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates 
of 0.3 and 0.4 subjects per 100 patient-years, respectively. All subjects, except 4 patients in each 
treatment group, had T2DM at baseline. Most subjects with surgical amputations in the dapagliflozin 
group (63%) and the placebo group (58%) had one amputation; all but one (in the dapagliflozin 
group) was lower limb amputations.  
Cardiac ischaemic events and stroke 
The incidence of subjects with unstable angina (1.7% vs 2.2% for dapagliflozin vs placebo) or 
myocardial infarction AE (2.2% vs 2.3% for dapagliflozin vs placebo) were balanced or slightly higher 
for placebo compared with dapagliflozin. The incidence of subjects with any stroke AE was balanced for 
dapagliflozin (3.4%) and placebo (3.2%), respectively. 
Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
In the DELIVER study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The 
change in eGFR was after 1 month of treatment more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/954956/2022  
Page 77/81 
 
 
 
placebo (-6.0% vs -0.7%); however, the difference between dapagliflozin and placebo was less 
noticeable at 24 months (-6.9% vs -5.3%).  
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo; 
-1.3% vs 0.01% at 12months, -1.7% vs 0.1% at 24 months and -3.0% vs -0.3% at 36 months. 
A decrease in mean blood pressure was observed with dapagliflozin vs placebo at month 1 (mean 
changes of -2.3 mm Hg vs -0.4 mm Hg in SBP) and month 24 (mean changes of -1.1 mm Hg vs 0.3 
mm Hg in SBP). This is consistent with the known osmotic diuretic effect of dapagliflozin. 
Subgroups 
In the DELIVER study, 24% (n=1,502) were ≤65 years of age and 76% (n=4,751) were >65 years of 
age. About 38% (n=2,343) of the subjects were >75 years of age. A slightly higher reporting rate of 
SAEs, DAEs and AEs leading to interruptions were noted in the older age group, although the 
incidences between treatment groups were overall balanced or higher in the placebo groups. However, 
the incidence of any AE possibly related to IP was increased for dapagliflozin compared to placebo in 
subjects >65 years (9.3% vs 7.6%) and in subjects >75 years (11.0% vs 8.7%) but was balanced in 
subjects ≤65 years (6.9% vs 7.2%) and in subjects ≤75 years (7.3% vs 6.9%).  
The incidence of subjects with any SAE and with an AE with fatal outcome was higher in the subgroup 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with the eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroups; although, the incidences between treatment groups were balanced or 
higher in the placebo group. Overall, subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher incidence 
of volume depletion, renal events and events of lower limb amputation compared to subjects with 
eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m. Subjects with AEs leading to 
interruptions were more common in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with 
dapagliflozin (20.1%) than in those on placebo (17.9%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with HF and LVEF >40% appears to be in general similar 
to the one previously documented in patients with HF and LVEF ≤40% (HFrEF), with and without T2DM. 
In subjects with HFrEF, the safety profile with regards to SAEs did not differ in any substantial way 
between patients with and without diabetes and HbA1c was not reduced in non-diabetic subjects. 
Based on the mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose poses an unwarranted risk of 
hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes.  
In the subgroup eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, more subjects interrupted treatment due to an AE in the 
dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. However, there was no indication of a worsening of the 
safety profile with declining renal function.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
HF with LVEF > 40%, i.e., HFmrEF and HFpEF, is a common, serious, progressive condition 
characterised by frequent periods of hospitalisation and a high mortality. Currently, only one medicinal 
product (another SGLT2i) is approved for the treatment of HF patients with LVEF > 40%. Thus, new 
treatment options are needed. Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of CV death and HF worsening with 
18% compared to placebo in a population with HF and LVEF >40%. The pivotal study is considered to 
be of adequate design and conduct and the results with respect to reduced risk of CV death and 
worsening of HF are considered as robust and of clinical relevance. Subgroup analysis of the primary 
composite endpoint showed that the outcome was consistent across all prespecified subgroups by 
LVEF, including patients with LVEF >60% at baseline, as well as across all prespecified demographic 
subgroups. This includes a subgroup analysis by age (<65, 65-74, 75-84 and ≥ 85 years). The 
outcome across LVEF subgroups is further supported by data from a pooled analysis of the two studies 
DELIVER and DAPA HF, which showed a consistent effect over the entire range of LVEF observed at 
baseline. The pooled analysis also showed a significant effect on CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.75, 
0.96]) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.82, 0.99]).  
No new safety concerns arise from the provided data in patients with HF and LVEF >40%. The number 
of SAEs was balanced or lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There was 
no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with impaired renal function. A slightly higher 
reporting rate of SAEs, DAEs and AEs leading to interruptions were noted in the older age groups, 
although the incidences between treatment groups were overall balanced or higher in the placebo

groups. The incidence of any AE possibly related to IP was increased for dapagliflozin compared to 
placebo in older subjects (>65 years) but was balanced in subjects ≤65 years. The safety profile 
appears to be in general similar to that previously documented for dapagliflozin, including in patients 
with HF and LVEF <40% (HFrEF). No subgroup analysis regarding the effect of T2DM has been 
provided in the DELIVER study; however, this was performed in the HFrEF population (DAPA-HF 
study). In subjects with HFrEF, the safety profile with regards to SAEs did not differ in any substantial 
way between patients with and without diabetes and HbA1c was not reduced in non-diabetic subjects. 
Also, based on the mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose an unwarranted risk of 
hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The documented benefits in the study population included in the DELIVER trial are considered to be of 
clinical relevance and to outweigh risks. No new safety concerns arise from the provided data in 
patients with HF and LVEF >40%. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None.

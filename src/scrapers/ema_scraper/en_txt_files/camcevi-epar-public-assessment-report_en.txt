1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Accord Healthcare S.L.U. submitted on 6 March 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Camcevi, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 April 2018. The eligibility to the centralised procedure under 
Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of interest of patients at 
Community level. 
The applicant applied for the following indication 
CAMCEVI is indicated for the treatment of hormone dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the 
treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in 
combination with radiotherapy 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended- hybrid application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, an indirect 
comparison of own clinical data with the clinical data of the reference medicinal product Eligard and 
with appropriate own applicant’s non-clinical data. 
1.2.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. A class waiver (for sex hormones) and exemption from Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
requirements (due to Application type). 
1.3.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.3.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.  Scientific advice

Camcevi is indicated for the treatment of hormone dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the 
treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in 
combination with radiotherapy. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in men globally. Men aged 65 years or older are 
the major group at risk; other common risk factors include ethnicity, family history, dietary habits, 
smoking, and occupational exposure.  
Population-based screening of men aged between 55 and 69 years, using prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) testing, has been evaluated in randomised trials. After a median follow-up of 13 years, the 
European screening trial demonstrated a relative reduction in the risk of prostate cancer mortality of 
21% (29% if adjusted for non-compliance). However, 781 men needed to be invited for screening and 
27 patients needed to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. Risk-adapted early 
detection of prostate cancer using a baseline PSA level has also been evaluated in retrospective cohort 
studies. The baseline PSA at or before the age of 50 years is associated with the risk of prostate cancer 
mortality over the subsequent 25 years. The risk of clinically significant prostate cancer is related to 
age, ethnicity, family history, PSA level, free/total PSA ratio and findings on digital rectal examination 
(DRE) (ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline, Parker et al. 20151). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men (Bray 
et al, 2018). In Europe, the estimated number of new prostate cancer cases was approximately 
473,344 in 2020 and the number of deaths was approximately 108,088 in 2020 (GLOBOCAN, 2020).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer remain still unclear. Several factors have been 
identified to predispose for the development of prostate cancer including genetic predisposition, diet, 
infection, hormonal imbalance and toxins. In this context, it is not surprising that the incidence is 
increasing, particularly in Western countries. The majority of the cancers in the prostate are 
adenocarcinomas, which can be divided to subtypes based on histological and molecular features. 
Despite the heterogeneity seen in all cancer types, the role of androgens connects all the subtypes 
from localised to advanced prostate cancer. Thus, antiandrogen treatment (ADT) by surgical or 
chemical castration is the mainstay of treatment. The natural course of prostate cancer is the 
development from hormone-sensitive to hormone-refractory prostate cancer (i.e., castration-resistant 
prostate cancer)2. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
High-grade prostate cancer can occur in men with a ‘normal’ PSA level. After a previous negative 
biopsy, indications for repeated biopsies include a rising PSA, suspicious digital rectal examination 
(DRE), abnormal multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), atypical small acinar

proliferation or multifocal high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The most important prognostic 
factors are the stage, differentiation, and PSA level at diagnosis1. 
Localised disease should be classified as low-risk (T1-T2a and Gleason score (GS) ≤6 and PSA ≤10), 
intermediate-risk (T2b and/or GS7 and/or PSA 10-20) or high-risk (≥T2c or GS8-10 or PSA >20) as a 
guide to prognosis and therapy. The risk classification is based on TNM staging, Gleason score and PSA 
level. Gleason score is based upon the microscopic appearance ranging from 1 to 5 3. 
Clinical T stage should be evaluated by DRE. MRI provides more accurate T staging and can inform 
surgical technique, both with respect to nerve sparing and wide excision of areas of potential extra-
prostatic extension. Within the low-risk category, higher % positive cores, length of core involvement, 
PSA density and a lower f/t PSA ratio are associated with the risk of under-staging. Patients with 
intermediate- or high-risk disease should have nodal staging using computed tomography (CT), MRI, 
choline positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) or pelvic nodal dissection. Patients with 
intermediate- or high-risk disease should be staged for metastases. General health and co-morbidities 
should be assessed. Patients who are not suitable for treatment with curative intent, by virtue of poor 
general health, do not normally require staging investigations (ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline, Parker 
et al. 20151). 
2.1.4.  Management 
Therapeutic choice for the treatment of prostate cancer is determined based on age, tumour grade and 
stage as well as other medical conditions. There is no consensus regarding optimum management of 
localised disease. Patients should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of the different 
options. In localised disease, patients can be treated with radiotherapy, surgery or active surveillance. 
In conjunction with radiation and chemotherapy, hormonal therapy is widely used in the treatment of 
prostate cancer patients (Parker et al., 20151). Evidence suggests that disease progression of prostate 
cancer is highly dependent on androgen levels. Long-term hormonal control helps to alleviate the 
growth of proliferating prostate cancer cells and may be beneficial to patient survival (Sasse et al., 
20124; Tamburrino et al., 20125). 
On this basis, the ADT has been the mainstay of hormonal treatment for prostate cancer over the 
years. Various types of pharmaceutical agents have been developed for medical androgen deprivation, 
including GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, oestrogen agonists, anti-androgens and androgen 
pathway inhibitors and androgen inhibitors (Hoda et al., 20176). 
The leuprorelin-based hormonal ADT is the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced and metastatic 
prostate cancer, as well as for the adjuvant treatment of patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk 
localised prostate cancer. Leuprorelin ADT has been shown to improve quality of life and prolong life in 
prostate carcinoma patients (Hoda et al., 20175; Sethi and Sanfilippo, 20097). 
Clinical pharmacological properties and efficacy and safety of leuprorelin in ADT in neoadjuvant or 
palliative prostate cancer treatment have been well characterised (Hoda et al., 20175; Sethi and 
Sanfilippo, 20096), and leuprorelin clinical practice experience comprises about three decades, with the

first leuprorelin 1-mg products required to be injected at a daily basis, followed by more convenient 
leuprorelin depot forms during the last 20 years. 
2.2.  About the product 
This is a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for a leuprorelin mesilate injectable suspension 
(LMIS) 50 mg, containing leuprorelin mesilate equivalent to 42 mg leuprorelin (Camcevi 42 mg), 
supplied as ready-to-use drug product in contrast to the available products requiring pre-mixing prior 
subcutaneous injection. The LMIS 50 mg is proposed for the treatment of hormone-dependent 
advanced prostate cancer and for the treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone 
dependent prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy. LMIS 50 mg is foreseen for a single 
subcutaneous injection every six months, likewise other approved leuprorelin-containing depot 
formulations of comparable leuprorelin strength (e.g., the reference product Eligard 45 mg). 
Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. Leuprorelin is a synthetic 
nonapeptide analogue of naturally occurring GnRH that, when given continuously at therapeutic doses, 
inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion and suppresses testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis. The 
analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. Initial administration of leuprorelin 
causes an increase in gonadotropin levels (LH, FSH), which can last for several weeks, leading to a 
transient rise in gonadal steroid production during that time (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in 
males, and oestrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). For this reason, the concomitant use of 
an anti-androgen is recommended in male patients as anti-androgen flare protection. With continuous 
administration, there is eventual suppression of gonadotropin release within 2 to 4 weeks. In males, 
testosterone is reduced to castrate levels (below the castrate threshold or ≤ 50 ng/dL). Upon removal 
of the drug, this effect is reversible. The biological effect of the GnRH agonist leuprorelin is time- and 
not concentration-dependent, and PK profiles among different leuprorelin forms may vary as long as 
serum leuprorelin levels are maintained within an established therapeutic range (0.2 to 2.0 ng/mL) to 
produce affective serum testosterone suppression. 
LMIS 50 mg differs from currently approved leuprorelin products in the salt used for the proposed drug 
product, mesilate instead of acetate. LMIS 50 mg is a pre-mixed product containing leuprorelin 
mesilate equivalent to 42 mg leuprorelin, which is formulated in a solution of N-methylpyrrolidone 
(NMP) and poly (D,L-lactide, PLA). The difference in salt weight has been accounted for so that the free 
base equivalent is the same between the proposed LMIS 50 mg product and the currently approved 45 
mg leuprorelin acetate products. 
The LMIS 50 mg delivery system resembles the gel-based delivery system (Atrigel) used for a 
marketed product Eligard depot formulations globally. The gel based leuprorelin formulations deliver 
the drug by using a biodegradable polymer of D,L-lactide-co-glycolide dissolved in N-
methylpyrrolidone. The Atrigel delivery system was developed to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile leading to reliable and sustained testosterone suppression. However, in contrast to currently 
approved depot / prolonged-release leuprorelin products, which require reconstitution prior to use, 
LMIS 50 mg will be supplied as ready-to-use drug product (no premixing will be required prior to SC 
injection), pre-filled in a single, sterile syringe. 
The MAA for LMIS 50 mg was submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC using Eligard 45 
mg as a reference product and is intended to be used in the same indications as the reference product.

2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No Scientific Advice from CHMP was given for this procedure.  
In the EU, only national scientific advice was sought at the German Federal Institute for Drugs and 
Medical Devices (BfArM) in January 2017. This Scientific Advice (SA) was particularly on non-clinical 
and clinical development and the bridging concept to Eligard 45 mg. The hybrid application under 
Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC with the reference product Eligard and the clinical development 
study design were considered acceptable provided that the bridging can be shown. Regarding the 
proposed safety data, the final safety data generated from the pivotal Phase 3 trial was considered 
essential with special emphasis on local or administration site adverse events and reactions (Refer to 
Section Clinical safety). Other questions concerned toxico-pharmacological development and chemical, 
pharmaceutical and biological development. The applicant followed this national SA considerably well 
taking into consideration that the advice was rather straightforward leaving the scientific bridging to be 
constructed by the applicant. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

Figure 1. Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of leuprorelin was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, ultraviolet 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and circular 
dichroism. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder 
diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to off-white hygroscopic powder. It is a freely soluble substance across 
physiological pH ranges. Leuprorelin mesilate is a stable salt form of leuprorelin. 
Leuprorelin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of nine chiral centres. The provided 
characterisation data in section confirm that the active substance manufacturing process produces a 
single enantiomer of desired enantiomeric purity. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral 
UPLC and specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for leuprorelin. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised by solid phase peptide synthesis using commercially available 
protected amino acids as building blocks. Quality of amino acids is controlled by suitable specifications.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. A single ASMF is used to support this Marketing 
Authorisation Application. 
The active substance manufacturing process consists of the following main process steps: solid-phase 
peptide synthesis, cleavage of the peptide from the resin and deprotection, amidation, trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) salt formation, purification, salt-exchange, evaporation and lyophilisation.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered 
acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities, including potential genotoxic impurities, were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.

The primary packaging of the active substance complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (mass spectrometry, 
UPLC), solubility (in house), amino acid analysis (in house), assay (UPLC), purity (UPLC), alkyl 
methanesulfonates (GC), acid content (IC), residual solvents (HS-GC), water content (KF), specific 
rotation (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological 
examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification of leuprorelin mesilate follows the principles of Ph. Eur. monograph of leuprorelin and 
USP monograph of leuprolide acetate. Total impurities and bacterial endotoxins have tighter limits than 
compendial leuprorelin. As the substance is a mesilate salt, limits have been set for acid content, ratio 
of methanesulfonic acid to peptide, and alkyl methanesulfonates as per ICH M7 guidance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (-20 ± 5ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (5 ± 3ºC) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. 
The samples were tested for all stability indicating parameters included in the specification. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The results show 
that the active substance is sensitive to light under direct exposure while the sample packed in the 
proposed container closure system is resistant to the photolytic effect. 
Forced degradation studies were performed to evaluate the suitability of the analytical methods as 
stability indicating. The peptide was exposed to acid, base, oxidation and thermal conditions. The 
results show that analytical methods used for assay and purity testing are stability indicating.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period under recommended storage 
conditions in the proposed container.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Camcevi is presented as a sterile prolonged-release suspension for subcutaneous injection. It is an off-
white to pale yellow viscous and opalescent product, free from visible particles and foreign matter with 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 13/87 
 
 
 
potential air bubbles, contained in a 1 ml long-barrel, colourless to pale yellow plastic pre-filled syringe 
closed with a grey elastomeric tip cap and a plunger. The sterilised, pre-filled and capped syringe is co-
packed with a sterile, capped needle and placed in secondary packaging consisting of a thermoformed 
blister. The blister is placed together with a non-sterile Point-Lok needle protection device and package 
leaflet in a cardboard carton. The hypodermic needle is classified into Class IIa according to the 
Medical Device Directive (MDD 93/42/EEC) and is CE-marked. A valid Declaration of Conformity has 
been presented. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to result in a product similar to the reference product 
Eligard 45 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, and to have enhanced stability to allow the 
product to be pre-filled into a single, ready-to use syringe for easier administration. The development 
included the device constituents (i.e., sterile pre-fillable syringe and sterile, capped, hypodermic thin-
wall needle) in establishing design requirements for Camcevi. 
The applicant has applied quality by design (QbD) principles in the development of the finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces have been claimed for the manufacturing 
process of the finished product. Risk assessments have been used throughout the QbD approach to 
identify potential critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs), and to 
determine which studies are necessary to achieve product and process understanding.   
Three excipients are used in the finished product formulation of Camcevi. The compendial excipients 
are N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and nitrogen. The non-compendial excipient is poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA). 
None of the excipients are of human or animal origin or is a novel excipient; e.g., PLA is present in 
Leuprorelin Hexal, DE/H/1681/0002 and NMP is present in Eligard, DE/H/058/003. 
Satisfactory description of the analytical procedures and validation data have been provided for the 
non-compendial excipient, PLA. The specifications have been properly justified based on development 
studies and applicable guidance and compendial methods. 
The excipient functions, their CMAs, as well as their compatibility with the active substance have been 
sufficiently discussed. NMP is Class 2 solvent with a PDE of 5.3 mg/day (ICH Q3C) but, it is used also 
in other medicinal products authorised in the EU with similar or higher concentration, and the applicant 
has adequately justified the use of NMP in Camcevi (see also non-clinical part of this assessment 
report). 
The impact of the CMAs on Camcevi CQAs has been evaluated using prior knowledge or by conducting 
specific studies.  
The risk assessment results as well as the control strategy for the components are endorsed as all 
CMAs that could affect the finished product CQAs are controlled in the raw material specifications. 
A non-compendial method has been developed for accelerated in vitro release for quality control 
purposes only, as in vitro-in vivo correlation cannot be established for Camcevi. Acceptable 
specification limits have been established based on the results obtained for the batches used in the 
clinical trials. Furthermore, discriminatory nature of the method has been adequately demonstrated. 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: weighing, compounding, filtration, 
degassing, filling, and terminal sterilisation by gamma irradiation. The sterilisation is performed with a 
minimum absorbed dose of 25 kGy, which is considered as a standard acceptable sterilisation dose 
according to the Ph. Eur. Possible impact of the sterilisation process on the finished product has been 
sufficiently investigated.  
The manufacturing process development has been extensively described and actual CPPs have been 
identified through a second design of experiments (DoE) study, in which sensitivity of the finished 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 14/87 
 
 
 
product CQAs to deliberate changes of the potential CPP levels was investigated. This study has been 
performed by the finished product manufacturer using industrial equipment intended to be used for 
Camcevi commercial batches. 
The functional relationships and process understanding obtained during development have been 
utilised in establishing a control strategy, which consists of control of material attributes, control of the 
critical process parameters, IPCs, and release and stability testing of the finished product. Based on 
the specifications established for all components and the finished product, and the process validation 
performed with three consecutive production scale batches, the proposed control strategy is endorsed. 
The primary packaging is cyclic olefin copolymer pre-filled syringe closed with bromobutyl elastomeric 
grey tip cap. The container closure system has been described in sufficient detail and the risk 
assessment approach and the conclusions are endorsed. Relevant studies concerning functionality of 
the system and compatibility have been conducted. The suitability of the container closure system for 
its intended use has been adequately demonstrated through development and stability studies. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements 
The formulation of the batches used in clinical trials is the same as proposed for the intended 
commercial formulation.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  main  steps:  weighing/compounding,  filtration, 
degassing, filling, terminal sterilisation by gamma irradiation, visual inspection and secondary packaging. 
The manufacturing process has been described including process parameters, in-process controls, 
irradiation procedure, and equipment. Process hold times have been defined and verified in the process 
validation studies for commercial production. The critical process parameters, in-process controls, and 
their ranges follow the development studies presented in section P.2 of the dossier and are supported 
by process validation studies. There are no intermediates in the manufacturing of the finished product. 
Process validation results have been requested by CHMP during procedure as a Major Objection. In 
response, the manufacturing process has been validated with three consecutive, production scale 
batches. The validation followed the submitted protocol. The process validation data demonstrates that 
the manufacturing process is robust and reproducible. The predetermined quality attributes as well as 
in-process controls met their acceptance criteria. The ranges and values selected for the processing 
parameters are acceptable to support the commercial production.  
The sterilisation of the finished product occurs at a different facility from the site responsible for the 
finished product manufacturer, and it has been shown that the transport conditions do not affect the 
integrity of the syringes, and therefore, can be considered validated. The suitability of product 
sterilisation by gamma irradiation has been shown by satisfactory physical and microbiological 
challenge qualification data. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance, identification (UHPLC, UV), deliverable weight in container (in house), 
content uniformity (UHPLC), residual alkyl mesylates (GC-MS), degradation products (UHPLC), water 
content (KF), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), average molecular weight by weight of polymer by GPC-RI 
(in house), average molecular weight by number of polymer GPC-RI (in house), polydispersity by GPC-
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 15/87 
 
 
 
RI (in house), breakloose force (in house), glide force (in house), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), accelerated release in vitro (in house), and assay (UHLPC). 
The proposed acceptance criteria for the quality attributes are sufficiently justified and acceptable. The 
specification limits are either in accordance with the Ph. Eur. requirements or they are based on 
development studies, batch analysis data, and stability data. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed considering 
requirements specified in the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided on three pilot and six commercial scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability  
Stability data from three pilot scale and three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for 
up to 24 months under long term conditions (5 ± 3ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
The samples were tested for all stability indicating parameters included in the specification. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The stability study results show that the finished product is sensitive to heat  
Due to the heat sensitivity of the finished product the proposed storage condition of 5 ± 3°C is 
acceptable.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products and the results show that the finished product is sensitive to light. 
Therefore, the proposed storage statement “Store in the original package in order to protect from 
light” is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 16/87 
 
 
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and storage conditions of ‘Store in a 
refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Store in the original package in order to protect from light.’ as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a product similar to the reference product 
Eligard 45 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, and to have enhanced stability to allow the 
product to be pre-filled into a single, ready-to use syringe for easier administration. 
During the procedure a multidisciplinary major objection on the bridging between the reference 
product EU-Eligard and Camcevi has been resolved, as well as major objections on proposed 
specifications for polymer molecular weight and in vitro accelerated release, and missing process 
validation data. All MOs were resolved by the provision the requested information. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The expected pharmacological effect of Camcevi 42 mg (also LMIS 50 mg), an initial rise in serum 
testosterone level followed by a continuous suppression of the serum testosterone level below normal 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022

levels, was demonstrated by several single dose subcutaneous (SC) PK/PD studies in male rats. In 
these studies, different depot formulations of leuprorelin mesilate including formulations from early 
phase formulation development, but also nonclinical and clinical batches were tested. In the submitted 
pharmacological study, 4 different leuprorelin mesilate depot formulations were compared to a single 
SC dose of the leuprorelin acetate reference drug, Eligard (US sourced), and vehicle in male Sprague 
Dawley rats. A single SC dose of approximately 10.8–12.0 mg leuprorelin mesilate/animal in Camcevi 
formulations and 9.6 mg leuprorelin acetate/animal in Eligard was injected and animals were observed 
for 196 days. Mean testosterone levels transiently increased before decreasing below the level of the 
vehicle control group by Day 7 for all tested leuprorelin formulations. Testosterone levels of rats in all 
leuprorelin mesilate groups were decreased to close to human castration level (0.5 ng/mL) or below 
from Day 28 until the end of the study. Comparable suppression of serum testosterone levels between 
Camcevi and Eligard (US sourced) at equal dose levels were also shown in GLP compliant single dose 
SC toxicity studies in rats with follow up periods up to 6 months. These studies utilised a Camcevi 
batch, which was manufactured using the same process as for the GMP clinical batch. 
2.5.2.1.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies, Safety pharmacology programme, 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology or pharmadynamic drug interaction studies were 
not performed. These studies are not required since there is very long clinical experience with leuprorelin 
in the proposed indication, which supersedes animal data and any new findings are not expected. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has developed a leuprorelin mesilate ready-to-use injectable suspension (Camcevi 42 
mg). Camcevi 42 mg is a pre-mixed product containing leuprorelin mesilate equivalent to 42 mg 
leuprorelin, which is formulated in a solution of NMP and PLA. The proposed product is formulated to 
control and sustain the release of the bioactive leuprorelin over a 6-month period after a single SC 
administration. 
The free base equivalent is the same between the proposed Camcevi 42 mg product and the currently 
approved 45 mg leuprorelin acetate product Eligard 45 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection 
(Eligard 45 mg), which is used as a reference product in this hybrid application.  
During formulation development a 28-week single subcutaneous dose PD/PK comparison study 
between four different Camcevi 42 mg candidate depot formulations and the reference product Eligard 
45 mg was performed in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. A 6-month PK/PD study following a single 
subcutaneous dose of various preliminary “Design of Experiment (DoE) batches was conducted in male 
SD rats. A comparative 6-month PK/PD study in male SD rats after a single subcutaneous dose of aged 
versus new Camcevi 42 mg batches were performed.  
Additional PK/PD data were collected from 28-day non-GLP compliant and pivotal GLP_compliant 3- 
and 6-month single subcutaneous dose toxicity studies in rats. The LC-MS/MS method was developed 
and validated for the simultaneous determination of leuprorelin and testosterone in rat serum. 
No studies were conducted to evaluate biodistribution of leuprorelin mesilate. One literature report on 
biodistribution of leuprorelin acetate-loaded liposomes labelled with technetium-99m in Ehrlich ascites 
tumour bearing mice was referenced. This study showed that labelled leuprorelin after intravenous 
injection was rapidly distributed into the heart, lung, liver and spleen. However, the results of 
distribution study using leuprorelin acetate-loaded liposomes may not be comparable to distribution of 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022

leuprorelin mesilate from sustained release solution formulated with NMP and PLA administered by 
subcutaneous route. 
No metabolism studies were conducted with Camcevi 42 mg product or leuprorelin mesilate. According 
to published literature in rats and dogs, 14C-labeled leuprorelin was metabolised by circulating 
peptidases to smaller peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a 
dipeptide (Metabolite IV, pGlu1-His2-OH). Using mouse kidney preparations in vitro, two metabolites 
were detected, the major one being the pentapeptide M–I (Tyr5- D-Leu6-Leu7-Arg8-Pro9-NHC2H5) 
and the minor metabolite, the tripeptide M–III (pGlu1-His2-Trp3-OH).The major metabolite, M-1 
pentapeptide has been identified in both animals and human.  
Two lactide-dependent impurities A and B were adequately qualified. The in vitro stability of leuprorelin 
D,L lactide acetate was assessed in comparison to leuprorelin mesilate in whole blood and serum of 
rats (Sprague-Dawley) and humans. Leuprorelin mesilate was stable in all tested matrices with 
predicted half-life longer than 231 minutes. Leuprorelin-D, L lactide acetate was unstable in all 
matrices. The half-life in serum was less than 10 minutes and less than 30 minutes in whole blood. 
No excretion studies were conducted with Camcevi 42 mg or leuprorelin mesilate. Published literature 
suggests that small amounts of leuprorelin and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in the urine. 
No studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been conducted with Camcevi 42 mg or leuprorelin 
mesilate. Leuprorelin is a peptide that is primary degraded by peptidase enzymes without participation 
of  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  in  metabolism.  During  the  long-term  clinical  use  no  relevant  PK  drug 
interactions have been reported nor are expected. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity studies  
In order to support clinical use and the marketing authorisation application of Camcevi 42 mg, an 
abbreviated nonclinical programme was completed including a comparative 28-day single dose SC 
toxicity study in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (non-GLP compliant) and comparative pivotal GLP 
compliant 3- and 6-month single dose subcutaneous toxicity studies in male SD rats.  
The same batch of Camcevi 42 mg was used in all three studies (Batch number CC0442, which was 
manufactured using the same process as for the GMP clinical batch). The Taiwanese test facility that 
conducted two pivotal single dose subcutaneous toxicity studies in rats that are included in the MAA 
was not part of an EU or an OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) accepted GLP monitoring 
programme in the period in which the test facility was used.  
US-sourced Eligard 45 mg was used as a reference product in the toxicity studies. In addition to three 
own toxicity studies, SmPC text of Eligard 45 mg and publically available literature was used to provide 
additional safety information. 
All three studies used the same dose groups: Grp 1) sham control (saline), Grp 2) vehicle control 
(Camcevi vehicle), Grp 3) Camcevi - 6.8 mg/animal of leuprorelin mesilate, Grp 4) Camcevi - 20.3 
mg/animal of leuprorelin mesilate, Grp 5) Camcevi - 33.8 mg/animal of leuprorelin mesilate, and Grp 
6) Eligard - 30.0 mg/animal of leuprorelin acetate. Expressed in amount of leuprorelin base, animals 
from groups 3-6 received a dose of 5.8, 17.4 29.0 and 28.0 mg/animal, respectively.  Considering rats 
with 250 g body weight, these doses of leuprorelin correspond to 23.2, 69.6, 116 and 112 mg/kg of 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 19/87 
 
 
 
 
leuprorelin, respectively. For comparison, the clinical dose of 42 mg given to a patient with 60 kg body 
weight corresponds to 0.7 mg/kg of leuprorelin. 
In a 28-day single SC dose-range finding study in male SD rats (non-GLP), the primary target 
organs of leuprorelin were testes and epididymides, affecting prostate/seminal vesicles. Changes 
related to the reduced testosterone level included reduced red blood cell levels and increased 
prothrombin time.  
In a pivotal 3-month single dose SC toxicity study there was no significant difference in systemic 
drug exposure between Camcevi 42 mg and Eligard 45 mg in male rats. SC injection of Camcevi 42 mg 
and Eligard 45 mg induced initial increase of serum testosterone during 3 days or less at all groups 
(Groups 3 – 6) followed by reduction of serum testosterone. Serum testosterone level was below 
castrate level (≤ 0.5 ng/mL) during the last 2 months or more of the 3-month implantation period with 
sporadic higher level than castrate level but at or below 0.8 ng/mL. The following Camcevi 42 mg-
related changes were noted: a) shortening of prothrombin time (PT); b) reduced size and/or weights of 
kidney and male sex organs (testes, epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles); and c) hyperplasia 
in pituitary, which were also noted in the Eligard 45 mg group. Shortened PT (9 to 12% compared to 
vehicle control group) was noted in all Camcevi 42 mg groups with a dose dependent manner and in 
Eligard 45 mg group with similar severity. Changes in testes and epididymides were considered to be 
primary changes that caused secondary changes in prostate and seminal vesicles. The NOAEL of 
Camcevi 42 mg was below 6.8 mg leuprorelin mesilate/animal since pituitary hyperplasia was still 
noted at this level. Male SD rats of 7 weeks old at the first dosing were used. At this age the rats are 
sexually but not socially matured, and this age of rats corresponds to very young human. From 
anatomical and physiological point of view, the older rats may have been a better animal model of the 
older men, the main target patients of the product. 
In a pivotal 6-month single SC dose toxicity study in male rats, the Cmax and AUC0-182day of 
leuprorelin increased proportional to dose in the Camcevi 42 mg treated groups. Both Camcevi 42 mg 
and Eligard 45 mg reduced serum testosterone levels to the castrate level (≤ 0.5 ng/mL) starting on 
Dosing Days 15 and 22 and similarly lower serum testosterone levels were maintained until 
termination on Dosing day 183. Leuprorelin caused significant changes in the pituitary characterised 
histologically as focal hyperplasia and/or adenoma that contributed to the gross findings (enlargement, 
nodule and masses) and increased weight. There was apparently higher incidence of pituitary 
adenomas in animals treated with Camcevi compared to Eligard. The number of animals with pituitary 
adenomas in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (corresponding to sham control, vehicle control, Camcevi 6.8 
mg/animal, Camcevi 20.3 mg/animal, Camcevi 33.8 mg/mal and Eligard 30.0 mg/animal, respectively) 
were 0, 0, 8, 5, 8 and 4, respectively. It is reported in the literature that focal hyperplasia in the 
pituitary is the precursor of adenoma in rat brain. The pituitary changes led to worsened clinical 
condition of three animals seen as decreased activity and dehydration. One animal was sacrificed 
before scheduled termination due to these clinical signs. As a result of reduced testosterone levels, 
reduced weights of size in male sex organs, germ cell depletion in testis, reduced luminal sperm in 
epididymis and decreased luminal secretions in prostate and seminal vesicles were observed. Reduced 
weight in the heart, liver and kidney without related gross and histopathologic findings were evident. 
Coagulation changes characterised as shortened PT (-21 to -24%) without changes in activated partial 
prothrombin time were observed. The NOAEL was below 6.8 mg leuprorelin mesilate/animal since the 
pituitary changes such as hyperplasia or adenoma noted at this level and higher were considered to be 
adverse. Also in this long-term study very young, though sexually matured rats (9 weeks age at the 
start of the study) were used.

Repeat dose toxicity 
No  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  with  Camcevi  42  mg.  To  prove  the  absence  of 
genotoxicity the SmPC of Eligard was referred to. 
Reproduction toxicity, Fertility and early embryonic development 
Studies evaluating effects on fertility and early embryonic development with Camcevi 42 mg have not 
been performed.  
Separate studies evaluating effects of Camcevi 42 mg on embryo-foetal development have not been 
conducted. Camcevi 42 mg is contraindicated in women. No studies evaluating effects of Camcevi 42 
mg on pre- and postnatal development (including maternal function) have been performed. Camcevi 
42 mg is contraindicated in paediatric patients, therefore no studies in juvenile animals have been 
conducted.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance assessment was performed in single-dose subcutaneous 6-month toxicity study in rats. 
No significant differences in histopathological findings in injection site were evident between Camcevi 
42 mg and Eligard 45 mg.  
Other toxicity studies 
The proposed Camcevi 42 mg formulation contains the solvent N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Each single 
sterile, pre-filled syringe contains 139.40 mg NMP/syringe (37.68%) as a solvent.. The published 
preclinical studies have shown that following intravenous or intraperitoneal administration the 
substance was extensively distributed to all major organs and the highest accumulation was detected 
in the liver, muscle, intestines, fat tissue and testicles. The no observed adverse events levels 
(NOAELs) of NMP in rodent repeat-dose toxicity studies were significantly higher on mg/kg basis than 
the amount of NMP in a single Camcevi 42 mg dose. No comparison between animal and human NMP 
exposures was made. In the literature there are reports showing that the ability to accumulate NMP 
and/or its metabolites in testes and seminal vesicles may be the reason for fertility impairment in male 
rats observed after repeated oral exposure to this compound (Sitarek and Stetkiewicz 2008, Sitarek 
and Kilanowicz 2006). ICH Q3C classifies NMP as Class II solvent and limits its use with PDE of 5.3 
mg/day due adverse neurodevelopmental effects after in utero exposure to this chemical. A separate 
risk assessment for use of NMP at the level present in Camcevi 42 mg and specially, for potential NMP-
related gonadotoxicity in Camcevi 42 mg was provided. No risk for male reproductive toxicity is 
anticipated with the current level of use of NMP in the drug product Camcevi 42 mg due to a rapid 
elimination of NMP and once in six-month dosing of the product. The Camcevi-related effects on male 
reproductive organs are consistent with the expected pharmacology of leuprorelin, the reduction of the 
testosterone level. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Leuprorelin is a synthetic nonapeptide, which is degraded to inactive peptide fragments prior to 
excretion in small amount in the urine. In line with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1; leuprorelin is 
readily biodegradable and therefore it is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has developed a leuprorelin mesilate injectable suspension 50 mg. Camcevi 42 mg (LMIS 
50 mg) prolonged-release suspension for injection is indicated for the treatment of advanced prostate 
cancer.  
The legal basis of this marketing authorisation application is a hybrid application. Since a clinical 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic bridge was established between Camcevi 42 mg and different 
leuprorelin medicinal products from the EU and USA, rely on relevant information presented in the 
SmPC of the proposed reference medicinal product EU-Eligard can be acceptable. In order to further 
support the marketing authorisation application of Camcevi 42 mg the published literature was 
reviewed for additional supportive information.  To obtain a complete and current update on the 
published literature covering any significant findings obtained of the leuprorelin, repeated searches in a 
variety of classified databases were performed (up to October 2020). Amongst the 493 publications 
found, 15 selected articles showing the anti-tumor effects of the leuprorelin especially for the prostate 
cancer, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology (antigenicity) of leuprorelin were included in the respective 
updated sections in Module 2.4 Non-clinical Overview.  
A very restricted nonclinical programme with the Camcevi 42 mg was conducted. No separate 
absorption studies were performed. Several studies were conducted to characterise the PK/PD 
relationship during Camcevi 42 mg formulation development and to demonstrate durable 
pharmacological efficacy in terms of reducing the testosterone level to castrate levels. No studies on 
secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamics interactions were 
conducted, which is acceptable as leuprorelin is a well-established compound in the proposed 
indication. 
No studies on distribution, metabolism, excretion or pharmacokinetic drug interaction were conducted. 
Given its decades of use in the proposed indication, sufficient clinical information is available which 
supersedes animal data. A study in mice showed that radiolabelled leuprorelin after intravenous 
injection was rapidly distributed into the heart, lung, liver and spleen. However, there are no 
experimental data available on distribution of leuprorelin mesilate from sustained release solution 
formulated with the excipients NMP and PLA and administered by subcutaneous route.  
Three single dose SC toxicity studies in male SD rats were performed: non-GLP 28-day single dose 
range-finding study, followed by GLP 3-month single dose and 6-month single dose toxicity studies. 
Very young, though sexually mature rats were used in the toxicity studies instead of more mature 
males.  According to the applicant this allowed the comparison to the broad database of historical 
control values supporting the determination of drug toxicities which are dependent on the ability to 
distinguish spontaneous events from the toxicological ones. Variability between the individual aged rats 
and the lack or little historical control data would require the use of higher number of animals per 
group in the GLP toxicity study. In both 3- and 6-month toxicity studies leuprorelin showed expected 
toxicities which were related to the pharmacological action of this class of compounds and which were 
comparable to similar medicinal drug products such as Eligard.  
All three studies used the same dose groups. Expressed in amount of leuprorelin base, animals from 
groups 3-6 received a dose of 5.8, 17.4 29.0 and 28.0 mg/animal, respectively. Considering rats with 
250 g body weight, these doses of leuprorelin correspond to 23.2, 69.6, 116 and 112 mg/kg of 
leuprorelin, respectively. For comparison, the clinical dose of 42 mg given a patient with 60 kg body 
weight corresponds to 0.7 mg/kg of leuprorelin. A main reason for the dose selection was to achieve 
systemic exposures of leuprorelin in rat toxicity studies which were sufficiently above systemic 
exposures in patients. Moreover, for a very viscous formulation such as Camcevi 42 mg, it was not 
possible to inject very small volumes or weights. In addition, very small volumes were not considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 22/87 
 
 
 
adequate for depot formation, as a result, sustained release property could not be well maintained to 
mimic human applications. The margins derived from comparison of systemic exposure in animals 
compared to systemic exposures in humans ranged from 0.3 to 3 in terms of Cmax and from 1 to 17 in 
terms of AUC, which confirms adequacy of selected doses to evaluate potential toxicities of Camcevi 42 
mg. 
The two pivotal long-term (3 and 6 months) toxicity studies have a GLP compliance issue. According to 
the information provided in the EMA Non-clinical studies GLP compliance (Annex to the cover letter) 
the test facility located in Taiwan was not part of an EU or an OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) 
accepted GLP monitoring programme in the period in which the test facility was used. However, as a 
hybrid application is in question, a GLP inspection was not considered necessary, and referring to the 
non-clinical data of the reference medicinal product is sufficient. 
No repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted. Camcevi 42 mg is prolonged-release product and 
effects of continuous release of leuprorelin were observed for up to 6 months in male rats. It is agreed 
that repeat-dose study would not have provided any new relevant information about the product’s 
safety.  
No genotoxicity studies were performed. References to the SmPC of Eligard 45 mg, which informs 
about the absence of mutagenicity of leuprorelin in in vitro and in vivo assays, were made. No 
carcinogenicity studies have been performed with Camcevi 42 mg. However, leuprorelin containing 
medicinal products have been in clinical use for decades and formulation changes in Camcevi 42 mg 
(excipients, salt, etc.) do not constitute any additional carcinogenic risk. Thus, using weight of 
evidence approach, it is considered acceptable to refer to the data and SmPC of the reference 
medicinal product. 
In the 6-month single-dose SC study the number of animals with pituitary adenomas in groups 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5 and 6 (corresponding to sham control, vehicle control, Camcevi 6.8 mg/animal, Camcevi 20.3 
mg/animal, Camcevi 33.8 mg/animal and Eligard 30.0 mg/animal, respectively) were 0, 0, 8, 5, 8 and 
4, respectively. It is reported in the literature that focal hyperplasia in the pituitary is the precursor of 
adenoma in rat brain. The combined incidence of pituitary hyperplasia and adenoma in the Camcevi-
treated groups was comparable to the Eligard-treated group and thus, the risk to develop adenoma 
due to leuprorelin exposure is considered the same between the two products.  
No published study related to leuprorelin’s antigenicity could be identified in the literature search. 
However, information on animal studies evaluating the antigenicity of leuprorelin was found in a 
Canadian Product monograph and a Public Assessment Report for a leuprorelin containing medicinal 
product. Based on the provided data leuprorelin does not have antigenic potential.  
There are no studies evaluating effects on fertility, early embryonic development and embryo-foetal 
development. The information concerning adverse effects of leuprorelin on the reproductive system, 
particularly impairing male fertility are reflected in SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 in alignment with the 
reference product.  
The proposed Camcevi 42 mg formulation contains the solvent NMP. The reported preclinical studies in 
the literature have shown that following intravenous or intraperitoneal administration the substance 
extensively distributed to all major organs and the highest accumulation was detected in the liver, 
muscle, intestines, fat tissue and testicles. The NOAELs of NMP in rodent repeat-dose toxicity studies 
were significantly higher on mg/kg basis than the amount of NMP in a single Camcevi 42 mg dose. No 
comparison between animal and human NMP exposures was made. In the literature there are reports 
showing that the ability to accumulate NMP and/or its metabolites in testes and seminal vesicles may 
be the reason for fertility impairment in male rats observed after repeated exposure to this compound. 
In addition, changes in testes and epididymides were reported in long-term single dose toxicity studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022

in rats with Camcevi 42 mg.  A separate risk assessment for use of NMP at the level present in 
Camcevi 42 mg and specially, for potential NMP-related gonadotoxicity in Camcevi 42 mg was provided 
during the procedure. No risk for male reproductive toxicity is anticipated with the current level of use 
of NMP in the drug product Camcevi 42 mg due to a rapid elimination of NMP and once in six-month 
dosing of the product. The effects on male reproductive organs following long-term Camcevi 42 mg 
exposure in rats are consistent with the expected pharmacology of leuprorelin, the reduction of the 
testosterone level.   
Leuprorelin is a synthetic nonapeptide, which is degraded to inactive peptide fragments by circulating 
peptidase enzymes prior to excretion in the urine. No specific ERA studies are required for the active 
substance leuprorelin. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical package is considered adequate to support a hybrid application. The relevant 
sections of the SmPC are aligned with the reference product.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of leuprorelin has been investigated in the clinical Study FP01C-13-001. Patients 
with advanced prostate cancer in need of androgen ablation were included in this Phase 3, multicentre, 
uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm, 12-month study. The study included two parts (Part I: n=33, Part 
II: n=104). One hundred thirty one (131) male subjects had evaluable PK data. The majority of the 
patients were white (90%) with a mean age of 71 years, with a mean body weight of 86 kg and a 
baseline serum testosterone level of 4.72 ng/mL. Serum concentrations of leuprorelin, testosterone 
(PD measurement) and LH (PD measurement) were analysed using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical 
methods. 
Pharmacokinetics of leuprorelin after LMIS 50 mg was characterised by two phases and rapid increase 
of serum leuprorelin concentrations. Peak concentrations of about 90 ng/mL were reached about 2-4 
hours after injection. After the rapid burst concentrations declined rapidly during the next three days 
after dosing. In Part I mean concentrations of 3.18 and 4.23 ng/mL on Day 3 and Day 171 following 
the first and second doses were observed, respectively. The corresponding mean concentrations in Part 
II, Day 3 and Day 171 were 3.78 ng/mL and 3.94 ng/mL following the first and second doses, 
respectively. Mean serum concentrations at plateau phase through the six-month dosing interval 
ranged between 0.370 to 2.97 ng/mL. Although a slight increase in leuprorelin concentrations was 
observed 2-3 months after dosing of LMIS 50 mg, the concentrations remained within the therapeutic 
window and are minor compared to the peak concentrations observed right after dosing.  
Modelling 
LMIS is a depot formulation from which leuprorelin is released slowly over 6 months. The reference 
product is Eligard 45 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. No formal bioequivalence 
studies between Eligard and LMIS have been conducted. However, two modelling reports were included 
in the MAA, Study FSEE-CSC-100 and Study FSEE-PMX-FP001-1605.  
The objective of FSEE-CSC-100 was to compare the levels of leuprorelin data obtained following 
administration of a repeated LMIS 50 mg dose in Study FP01C-13-001 to steady-state levels of 
leuprorelin following repeated 1 mg intravenous injection of Lupron data obtained from the literature. 
Based on the comparison, the exposure to leuprorelin at steady state was approximately five times 
higher for Lupron than from LMIS. The overall exposure (AUC0-6mon) of leuprorelin was significantly 
lower for LMIS 50 mg, as well as the absolute Cmax. 
The objective of FSEE-PMX-FP001-16 report was to compare the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics in humans following administration of LMIS and other subcutaneous leuprorelin 
acetate formulation.LMIS 50 mg was compared with the marketed depot products, namely US-sourced 
Eligard 45 mg 6M, US-sourced Eligard 22.5 mg 3M (2 consecutive injections of Eligard 3M), EU-sourced 
Lucrin 22.5 and 30 mg 6M and six consecutive injections of US-sourced Eligard 7.5mg 1M.  
The simulation studies provide support for linking the LMIS to the clinical results of marketed depot 
formulations, and to the original nonclinical and clinical results of Lupron 1 mg IV formulation. The 
simulation studies did not, however, establish bioequivalence to any of the compared products. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 25/87 
 
 
 
 
 
Differences in analytical methods, clinical trial design and conduct of the studies and subject 
demographics were limitations to this literature-based bridging exercise. 
The comparison exercise was considered valuable for the bridging of safety, both to the IV formulation 
and to the depot formulations. For Lupron 1mg IV formulation, both the Cmax and the AUC0-6 mon are 
much higher than they are for LMIS 50 mg, and therefore safety can be bridged from Lupron 1mg.  
The data used for simulations for Eligard and Lupron are from FDA approval packages. Data for Lucrin 
is obtained from an assessment report of Netherlands Medicines Evaluation Board. 
Absorption  
Leuprorelin is released continuously by the third day after dosing with steady serum concentrations 
("plateau" phase) through the 24-week (approximately 6-month) dosing interval (mean concentration: 
0.370 to 2.97 ng/mL). 
Peak leuprorelin concentrations occurred about 2 to 4 hours after the LMIS injection. Three days after 
the dose mean leuprorelin levels were approximately 2 to 4 ng/ml, thereafter they declined even 
further. After the initial burst, the drug substance was released slowly from the polymer complex for 
six months. Six months after the injection leuprorelin concentrations were still sustained within the 
levels of 0.2-2 ng/ml.  
Distribution 
The  distribution  of  leuprorelin  after  subcutaneous  administration  of  LMIS  50  mg  has  not  been 
investigated in the current documentation. 
Elimination 
Elimination and excretion of leuprorelin following subcutaneous administration of LMIS 50 mg have not 
been specifically investigated, and no drug excretion study was conducted with leuprorelin. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
In the clinical study FP1C-13-001 LMIS 50 mg was administered as two injections six months apart 
from each other to patients with advanced prostate carcinoma.  
The mean Cmax value of serum leuprorelin was around 94-100 ng/mL and it was reached after 
approximately 2-4 hours after the first and the second dose of LMIS 50 mg injections. The 
concentrations declined rapidly after reaching the peak and the mean level of 3.18-4.23 ng/ml was 
seen three days after dosing. The concentrations declined further after this and the mean plasma 
concentrations at 4 weeks were 1.04-2.4 ng/ml. However, in some subjects leuprorelin concentrations 
increased again 2 or 3 months after dosing.

Special populations 
Over 90 % of the patients included in the clinical studies were white (Caucasians). Only few patients 
with other ethnic background were studied. The plasma concentration data between white, black, Asian 
and other are similar. 
Serum leuprorelin concentrations were decreased in patients over 100 kg. Overall serum leuprorelin 
exposure over the first four weeks following LMIS 50 mg administration was decreased by 42%, while 
exposure over six months was decreased by 20% in subjects >100 kg compared to subjects <75 kg. 
Significant differences related to subjects’ body weight were observed for serum leuprorelin peak 
concentration and exposure during the first 4 weeks post-dose (p ≤ 0.03).

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Leuprorelin is a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of naturally occurring GnRH that, when given 
continuously at therapeutic doses, inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion and suppresses testicular 
and ovarian steroidogenesis. Initial administration of leuprorelin causes an increase in gonadotropin 
levels (LH, FSH, leading to a transient rise in gonadal steroid production). For this reason, the 
concomitant use of an anti-androgen is recommended in male patients as anti-androgen flare 
protection. With continuous administration, there is eventual suppression of gonadotropin release 
within 2 to 4 weeks. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels (below the castrate threshold 
or ≤ 50 ng/dL). Upon removal of the drug, this effect is reversible. The biological effect of the GnRH 
agonist leuprorelin is time- and not concentration-dependent.  
LMIS 50 mg is supplied as a ready-to-use pre-filled syringe. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Independent pharmacodynamics (PD) studies were not performed for the current hybrid application 
since the PD of leuprorelin are known and several leuprorelin-containing products are available in EU. 
However, the Phase 3 evidence of comparative efficacy was primarily based on testosterone level and 
secondarily on PSA and LH level measurements. For further evaluation of these aspects, see Section on 
Clinical efficacy. 
Profiles for testosterone after administration of LMIS 50 mg depo, and after administration of Eligard 
45 mg depot are shown below.

The time to reach the Leuprolide therapeutic window (0.2 – 2 ng/mL) for LMIS 50 mg and Eligard 45 mg 
was 9.8 and 5.1 days, respectively. The time to reach the castration threshold (0.5 ng/mL) for LMIS 50 
mg and Eligard 45 mg was 20.2 and 19.1 days, respectively. See Figure 6.

Figure 6. Mean testosterone profile after administration of LMIS 50 mg 6M and Eligard 45 
mg 6M formulations 
The observed acute increases of serum testosterone concentration were associated with rapid 
increases in serum leuprorelin concentrations. Mean serum testosterone concentration increased from 
a mean baseline value of 380 and 492 ng/dL to a peak of 562 and 739 ng/dL within 2 days during this 
initial phase for the Part I and II of Study FP01C-13-001, respectively. With continuous serum 
leuprorelin exposure, the high mean serum testosterone concentration decreased over-time to reach a 
very low plateau concentration (approximately Week 4) that was maintained through the end of the 
study. At the end of each dosing period (24 weeks, approximately 6 months after each injection), the 
majority of subjects had quantifiable leuprorelin concentrations (Study FP01C-13-001). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of leuprorelin has been investigated in one clinical study after LMIS 50 mg (Study 
FP01C-13-001). Patients with advanced prostate cancer in need of androgen ablation were included in 
a Phase 3, multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm, 12-month study performed in two Parts 
(Part I: n=33, Part II: n= 104). One hundred thirty one (131) male subjects had evaluable PK data. 
The study indicates that PK of leuprorelin was characterised by two phases and rapid increase of serum 
leuprorelin concentrations. Peak concentrations of about 90 ng/mL were reached about 2-4 hours after 
injection. After the initial burst, concentrations declined rapidly during the next three days after dosing. 
Thereafter the drug substance was released slowly from the polymer complex for 6 months reaching 
mean plateau serum concentrations of 0.370 to 2.97 ng/ml through the 24-week (approximately 6-
month) dosing interval. Six months after the injection leuprorelin concentrations were sustained within 
the levels 0.2-2 ng/ml. 
No formal bioequivalence studies between LMIS 50 mg and the reference product Eligard 45 mg 
powder and solvent for solution for injection have been conducted. A comparison of LMIS 50 mg with 
data of the marketed leuprorelin depot products, namely Eligard 45 mg 6M, Eligard 22.5 mg 3M (2 
consecutive injections of Eligard 3M), Lucrin 22.5 and 30 mg 6M and six consecutive injections of 
Eligard 7.5mg 1M was conducted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 31/87 
 
 
 
 
 
Leuprorelin concentrations after repeated LMIS 50 mg dose were also compared to simulated steady-
state levels of leuprorelin following repeated daily 1 mg intravenous injection of Lupron obtained from 
the literature.  
The comparisons were considered valuable for the bridging of safety, both to the IV formulation and to 
the depot formulations. The data used in the simulations of Eligard and Lupron were obtained from 
FDA Approval Package. The data for Lucrin were from Netherlands Medicines Evaluation Board 
assessment report. The marketing authorisation for US- and EU-Eligard is based on the same clinical 
studies, and the dissolution profiles of the EU-and US-sourced Eligard are similar so the PK data of US-
sourced Eligard 45 mg 6M can be compared with LMIS 50 mg.    
Bioanalytics 
Three bioanalytical methods were used for determination of leuprorelin, testosterone and luteinising 
hormone in serum samples from clinical studies. A LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography with tandem 
mass spectrometry) bioanalytical method used for determination of the concentration of leuprorelin in 
human serum. LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was also used for determination of testosterone in 
serum. For determination of luteinising hormone (LH) in human serum a commercial 
chemiluminescense ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) method was used. The analytical 
methods used are acceptable. 
Distribution 
The proposed SmPC text is according to the reference product Eligard and is as follows: 
• 
The  mean  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  of  leuprorelin  following  intravenous  bolus 
administration  to  healthy  male  volunteers  was  27  litres.  In-vitro  binding  to  human  plasma 
proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. 
The volume of distribution estimated after subcutaneous injection has not been stated in the SmPC. 
Elimination  
The proposed text to the SmPC is based on published data and is as follows: 
In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprorelin acetate administered intravenously revealed 
that the mean systemic clearance was 8.34 l/h, with a terminal elimination half- life of approximately 
three hours based on a two-compartment model. No excretion studies have been conducted with 
leuprorelin 
The pharmacokinetic section of SmPC resembles the product information for the reference product 
Eligard. The figures for absorption are taken from the clinical study FP01C-13-001 Part II.  
PK in target population  
LMIS 50 mg has been administered as two injections 6 months apart from each other to patients with 
advanced prostate carcinoma. The peak concentrations (Cmax) about 90 ng/ml (arithmetic mean) and 
median Tmax 3.67 hours were similar between the two periods. The concentrations declined rapidly 
after reaching the peak and the mean level of 3.18-4.23 ng/ml was seen three days after dosing. The 
concentrations declined further after this and the mean plasma concentrations 4 weeks were 1.04-2.4 
ng/ml. However, in some subjects leuprorelin concentrations increased again 2 or 3 months after 
dosing but the second peaks are mostly within the therapeutic dose range. The total exposure of 
leuprorelin at 6 months (AUC0-6mon), average concentration at 6 months and total exposure over 4-
week dosing (AUCwk4) were significantly increased in Period 2 compared to Period 1. However, the 
concentrations decreased to similar levels 6 months after dosing in both Period 1 and Period 2; thus, 
Assessment report

no accumulation is expected. The moderate to high intra- and inter-subject variability in PK parameters 
is not expected to have any effect on PD endpoints, given the wide therapeutic index of leuprorelin.

Serum leuprorelin concentrations are decreased in patients over 100 kg. However, leuprorelin 
concentrations are within the therapeutic dose range and testosterone levels are below the castrate 
level in all weight groups, so efficacy is achieved also in patients >100 kg with LMIS 50 mg dose.  
Age increased the exposure of leuprorelin. Exposure measured as AUC0-6mon and concentrations six 
months after dosing were about two-fold in patients over 79 years compared to patients under 60 
years. However, the Cmax and AUC parameters observed in the elderly are below the Cmax and AUC 
observed after Lupron 1 mg IV administration, and safety has been established for Lupron 1mg. 
Therefore, no safety issues arising from leuprorelin overexposure are foreseen for the elderly.   
Pharmacokinetics has not been investigated in subjects with impaired renal or impaired hepatic 
function. LMIS treatment is intended for men. PK data in women and children are not available as LMIS 
is contraindicated in women and children. 
Interactions 
No interactions studies have been performed with LMIS. No pharmacokinetic based interactions are 
expected as leuprorelin is degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes and the drug 
is only about 43-49% bound to plasma proteins. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Contrary to the results on the evaluation of the primary endpoint where testosterone levels below 50 
ng/mL were obtained in a similar magnitude and time points as the reference product and literature 
values, the same appears not to be translated to PSA levels. In several of the time points measured 
PSA levels remained above the threshold of 4 ng/mL. Furthermore, 6 months after administration of 
the second dose of LMIS 50 mg, a rise in mean serum PSA levels was observed from Day 252 to Day 
336 and did not reach PSA nadirs as low as evidenced in the referenced studies. Additionally, 
percentage of change in PSA level from baseline to Day 336 was higher for Eligard than for LMIS (97% 
and 89%, respectively).  
It is pharmacologically and therapeutically plausible that the higher PSA nadir obtained in study FP01C-
13-001 (>4ng/mL), and the rise in PSA levels in the end of the follow-up period, was based on the 
higher PSA levels at baseline compared to the Eligard and other studies, as well as differences in 
patient recruitment leading to patients with higher disease severities and the existence of castration 
resistant prostate cancer patients contributing to higher mean PSA levels at the end of the follow-up 
period.   
Details for the first days after the first dose of Eligard 45 mg were provided (data not shown). After the 
first dose of LMIS 50 mg or Eligard 45 mg, the Cmax of the mean profiles were 95.4 and 79.5 ng/mL, 
respectively. Cmax occurred at 4 hours post dose for both formulations. After Cmax, leuprorelin 
concentrations declined in a similar fashion to comparable concentrations at 24 hours.  
Discrepancies in the sampling time points between Eligard and LMIS were justified by the sampling 
points chosen in order to support the objectives of the clinical study, namely (1) To determine the 
safety and tolerability of LMIS 50 mg for up to 1 year of exposure following 2 subcutaneous doses 
given at 6 months apart in subjects with advanced prostate carcinoma; (2) To establish the efficacy of 
LMIS 50 mg for up to 1 year following 2 subcutaneous doses given at 6 months apart in subjects with 
advanced prostate carcinoma, as determined by the magnitude and duration of suppression of serum

testosterone levels; (3) To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of serum leuprorelin following 2 
subcutaneous injections of LMIS 50 mg given 6 months apart.  
A rise in leuprorelin LMIS at the end of study days 308-336 was apparent when compared to Eligard. 
This rise was coincident to a rise in testosterone levels as well as PSA levels. In order to fully 
characterize the pharmacodynamic effect of LMIS and provide bridging with Eligard, the applicant 
showed a graphical representation of the mean time-matched concentrations of leuprorelin and 
testosterone obtained from ADPC (Analysis Dataset of Pharmacokinetic Concentrations) of the main 
Phase 3 Study FP01C-13-001 and from Eligard 45 mg monograph. Concentrations of testosterone were 
then plotted against their time-matched leuprolide concentrations along with a linear regression (data 
not shown). The applicant provided a graphical representation in which both LMIS 50 mg and Eligard 
45 mg appear to follow the same concentration-effect relationship. The approach was considered to 
adequately address the issues; 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of leuprorelin has been investigated in one clinical study. The applicant has shown 
that the clinical study in the marketing authorisation documentation for EU- and US-Eligard is the 
same, allowing the bridging and making acceptable the use of Pre-clinical and clinical data of EU-
Eligard as reference for Camcevi. Being the leuprorelin exposure, following LMIS 50 mg administration, 
lower than after Lupron 1 mg IV formulation safety can be bridged from Lupron 1 mg.  
Bridging of efficacy is supported by the similarity between the PK profiles obtained with LMIS 50 mg 
and the literature-derived PK profiles obtained for Eligard 45 mg and other products.  Similarity is 
further supported by a comparison of PD data (testosterone and PSA concentrations) between LMIS 50 
mg and Eligard 45 mg.  
The currently presented Clinical Pharmacology information is adequate to support the registration of 
Camcevi for the same indications as Eligard. The relevant sections of the SmPC are aligned with the 
reference product.

Figure 7. Study design and schedule for assessments (Study FP01C-13-001) 
*The first 10 (of the 33) subjects served as a “sentinel” group for safety purposes and the IDMC conducted interim safety reviews 
for these subjects at the end of Week 2, Week 4 (Month 1), Week 12 (Month 3), and Week 24 (Month 6). These 4 interim safety 
reviews were performed in addition to the interim review of safety data, serum leuprorelin concentrations, and serum testosterone 
suppression status scheduled for the first 30 subjects following their Day 28 assessments in Part I. 
** If ≥ 90% of Part I subjects (ie ≥ 27 of the 30 subjects) achieved suppression of serum testosterone to castrated levels within 4 
weeks (approximately 1 month) of the initial dose and demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability, then Part II study was 
opened and enrolled approximately 100 subjects. 
Methods 
This study was conducted in two parts. 
Part I included the first 30 subjects, who had more frequent monitoring for safety. Once ≥90% of the 
30 subjects achieved suppression of serum testosterone concentrations to castration levels (≤50 
ng/dL) within 28 days of the initial dose, with acceptable safety and tolerability, Part II was opened, 
and the rest of the subjects were enrolled.  
At the end of 24 weeks (Day 168), subjects in both Parts I and II who had tolerated LMIS 50 mg and 
shown castrate levels of serum testosterone concentrations (≤50 ng/dL) were dosed the second time 
with LMIS 50 mg, and were followed for tolerability, safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and ancillary 
clinical and laboratory markers for an additional 24 weeks observation period. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of serum leuprorelin concentrations and pharmacodynamics assessments 
of serum testosterone concentrations using a validated LC/MS/MS method were performed. For 
subjects in Part I, serum samples were collected on Day 0 (prior to dosing, and hours 2, 4, 8 post-
dosing), Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 (Week 24: prior to dosing and hours 2, 4, 8 
post-dosing), days 169, 170, 171, 196, 224, 252, 280, 308, and 336 (Week 48). Part II subjects had 
collection of blood samples at the same time points as above except that 2 and 8 hours post-dosing 
samples on Day 0 and Day 168 were not collected. For the PK/PD blood samples from Day 7 to Day 
28, a ± 1 day window was allowed. From Week 8 (Day 56) to Week 20 (Day 140), a ± 3 day window 
was allowed. On Day 168 through Day 171, a ± 1 day window was allowed. From Day 196 through 
Day 308, a ± 3 day window was allowed. For the Day 336 visit, a ± 5 day window was allowed.

Treatments 
Camcevi is administer as a single subcutaneous injection of LMIS 50 mg every 24 weeks 
(approximately 6 months; over the course of 2 doses on Day 1 and Day 168). Two segments were 
conducted. 
In Part I, approximately 30 patients were enrolled, dosed once with LMIS 50 mg, and observed for at 
least 4 weeks (approximately 1 month, Day 28). The first 10 (of the 30) patients served as a “sentinel” 
group for safety purposes in which more frequent monitoring of safety endpoints and serum 
testosterone concentrations were scheduled. These interim safety analyses were performed by the 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) for the first 10 patients at the end of Week 2, Week 4 
(approximately 1 month), Week 12 (approximately 3 months), and Week 24 (approximately 6 month). 
Patients enrolled in Part I also had another interim evaluation of safety. During this safety evaluation, 
enrolment was suspended until the safety evaluation had been completed. If ≥ 90% of Part I patients (
≥ 27 out of 33 patients) were to achieve suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels (≤ 50 
ng/dL) within 4 weeks (approximately 1 month; by Day 28) of the initial dose and the LMIS 50 mg was 
found to be tolerable and safe, Part II would begin and therefore the remaining patients were enrolled. 
At the end of Week 24 (approximately 6 months, Day 168), patients in both Parts I and II who 
Assessment report

tolerated LMIS 50 mg and showed a castrate serum testosterone level were dosed the second time 
with LMIS 50 mg. After the second administration of LMIS 50 mg by SC injection, patients were 
followed for safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and ancillary clinical and laboratory 
markers for an additional 24 weeks. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the safety and tolerability of LMIS 50 mg for up to one year of exposure following 
two subcutaneous doses given at 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) apart in patients with 
advanced prostate carcinoma; 
To establish the efficacy of LMIS 50 mg for up to one year following two subcutaneous doses 
given at six months apart in patients with advanced prostate carcinoma, as determined by the 
magnitude and duration of suppression of serum testosterone levels; 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of serum leuprorelin following two subcutaneous 
injections of LMIS 50 mg given approximately six months apart. 
The secondary objective: 
• 
To characterize the effects of LMIS 50 mg on the ancillary laboratory markers of serum PSA 
and LH. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
•  Primary endpoints:To determine the safety and tolerability of LMIS 50 mg by: symptoms (by 
AUA Symptom Score qsheet, complete blood count with platelets, clinical chemistries (K, Na, 
Mg, Ca and P), urinalysis,   serum glucose, lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglycerides) and HgbA1c 
lead resting electrocardiograms (ECGs) per the Investigator’s judgment. 
• 
• 
To determine the percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone concentration suppressed 
to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) by Day 28 ± 1 (day) following the first injection of LMIS 50 mg 
and the percentage of subjects with serum testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 
through Day 336 (remaining duration of the study). 
To determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of leuprorelin by full pharmacokinetic profiles from 
serum leuprorelin concentrations in Part I subjects will be performed. Additional serum 
leuprorelin concentration data will be collected during Part II. The pharmacokinetic behavior of 
leuprorelin will be determined on a more limited basis for subjects in Part II. 
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects exhibiting post-suppression excursions of serum testosterone to > 
50 ng/dL, either through “breakthrough” (i.e., episodes unrelated to LMIS 50 mg dosing), or 
through the “acute-on-chronic” phenomenon (i.e., related to the second dose of LMIS 50 mg). 
Effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels. 
Effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum LH levels. 
Sample size  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 38/87 
 
 
 
 
 
A sample size of 120 patients was estimated to achieve the 85% power to detect a difference of 
0.0700 using a one-sided binomial test. A pre-specified interim analysis of efficacy was performed after 
100 patients had completed the Day 28 assessment and a sample size reassessment was carried out to 
determine whether additional patients needed to be enrolled. The estimated conditional power was 
99.07%. Thus, the trial continued as planned with the current sample size. A total of 137 patients were 
enrolled in the study at the end. If ≥ 90% of Part I subjects (ie ≥ 27 of the 30 subjects) achieved 
suppression of serum testosterone to castrated levels within 4 weeks (approximately 1 month) of the 
initial dose and demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability, then Part II study was opened and 
enrolled approximately 100 subjects 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label, single arm study and therefore no blinding procedure was performed. 
Statistical method 
Analysis populations: 
Three populations were analysed in this study: ITT, PP, and safety populations.  
−  The ITT population was defined as any subject who received at least one dose of LMIS 50 mg.  
−  The PP population was defined as subjects who received 2 doses of LMIS 50 mg and met the 
inclusion/exclusion requirements of the protocol without major protocol deviations.  
−  The safety population was defined as any subject who received a dose of LMIS 50 mg. 
All 137 subjects were included in the ITT and safety populations. Thirteen subjects were excluded from 
the PP population due to major protocol deviations or because they did not receive the second dose of 
LMIS 50 mg, leaving 124 subjects in the PP population for the efficacy analysis. 
Description of statistical methods: 
1.  The ITT (N=137) and PP (N=124) populations were used in the efficacy analyses. Any subject 
receiving a dose of LMIS 50 mg was included in the safety analysis. 
2.  For descriptive statistics, continuous variables were presented as number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, range, Hodges-Lehmann estimator and 95% CI. Categorical 
variables were presented by frequency and percentage. Changes from baseline were tested by 
a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables using a significance level 
of 0.05. 
3.  For efficacy endpoints, the percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone of ≤ 50 ng/dL 
(castrate level) by Day 28 ± 1(day) was analysed using a standard large sample approximation 
to a Binomial distribution. The percentage of subjects with testosterone suppression (≤ 50 
ng/dL) from Day 28 through Day 336 was analysed using a Kaplan-Meier approach. The 
duration of time to an event was summarised by Kaplan-Meier plot, and presented as event 
number, percentage, 95% confidence interval for percentage, mean, median and 95% 
confidence interval for median. The subjects exhibiting post-suppression excursions of serum 
testosterone to > 50 ng/dL, either through “breakthrough”, or through the “acute-on-chronic” 
excursions, were presented as a count, percentage and 95% Cl. The serum PSA levels and 
serum LH levels during the study were summarised by descriptive statistics, and the change 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 39/87 
 
 
 
 
 
from baseline was summarised descriptively and a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
was used with significance level of 0.05. 
4.  For safety endpoints, change of continuous variables including bone and urinary pain 
measurement (by VAS scale), urinary signs and symptoms (by AUA Symptom Score sheet), 
vital signs and lab data were summarised descriptively and a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-
rank test was used at a significance level of 0.05. The transition matrix for categorical variables 
was presented. 
5.  Adverse events were coded with MedDRA and a summary frequency table of adverse events 
was provided. The severity and relationship to study medication of adverse events were 
summarised as well. Furthermore, if any serious adverse events occurred, the brief summary 
about serious adverse events was described and listed in tables. 
6.  For pharmacokinetic parameters, arithmetic means, standard deviations and coefficients of 
variation were calculated. 
Sensitivity analyses: 
The analyses for the efficacy endpoints were performed in the ITT population and the PP population. 
The sensitivity analyses for the duration of serum testosterone levels ≤50 ng/dL were performed, in 
which patients missing testosterone level at any visit were censored for the analysis of duration time of 
subject with a serum testosterone of ≤50 ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336. Subjects were 
censored at the last testosterone measurement before the first missing visit if no prior escape 
occurred; otherwise, subjects were considered to have an event at the escape visit. If a subject 
maintained suppression from Day 28 through Day 336 and completed the study without missing any 
testosterone tests, the subject was censored at the EOS visit.  
The sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to determine whether 
censoring for any missing data would affect the analysis of duration time of subject with a serum 
testosterone of ≤50 ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336. The subject was censored at the last 
testosterone measurement before the first missing visit if no prior escape occurred. The subject was 
considered having event at the escape visit otherwise. If a subject maintained suppression from Day 
28 through Day 336 and completed the study without missing any testosterone tests, the subject was 
censored at the EOS visit. Additionally, given that the missing testosterone value might have not been 
missing at random (MAR), a sensitivity analysis of duration time of subject with a serum testosterone 
levels of ≤50 ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336 was performed for the subset of subjects who 
completed the study and did not have any testosterone data missing beyond visit Day 28 through visit 
Day 336. 
The analysis with censoring for any missing data was performed for patients in the ITT as well as the 
PP population. 
Post hoc analyses: 
The post hoc analysis was performed in the subjects with elevated PSA at baseline. 
Handling of dropouts and missing data: 
For missing data related to a safety or efficacy endpoints, no method of imputation was applied. For 
the primary efficacy endpoint, the drop-out and missing values were handled by the censoring rules 
suggested by the FDA, see Table 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 40/87 
 
 
 
Table 4. Censoring rules (Study FP01C-13-001) 
Escape was defined as a serum testosterone level greater than 50 ng/dL from Day 28 (V9) to Day 336 (V23/EOS). 
The data of subjects with suppressions on Day 28 visit were handled based on the above censoring rules and the data 
of  subjects  without  suppression  on  Day  28  visit  or  subjects  with  missing  testosterone  value  on  Day  28  visit  were 
analysed as events on Day 28.

First subject was enrolled 12-Aug-2014. 
Last subject completed last visit 02-Sep-2016. 
Of the 137 enrolled subjects, 15 (10.9%) subjects did not complete the study. 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended four times.  The original protocol was dated 24-Mar-2014 and the 
latest version 1.4 was dated 14-Oct-2015. The applicant submitted the protocol versions and 
descriptions of the protocol amendments. The amendments concerned various sections including 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and statistical analyses. The applicant stated, that no changes were 
made in the conduct of the study or planned analyses and the study was performed in accordance of 
the study protocol FP01C-13-001 version 1.4, dated October 14, 2015. 
Protocol deviations 
All together 452 protocol deviations were reported, of which 14 incidences in eleven patients were 
reported as major deviations. The major deviations comprised improper storage of four IP packages, 
but these were not used in patients. Major deviations occurring in patients included SAEs not reported 
(2), incorrect kit of IP (2), patient not attending visits (2), unacceptable medications used (4), PK-
samples not conducted properly (2) and serum creatinine increase (1). Thirteen subjects were

The percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone of ≤ 50 ng/dL (castrate level) by Day 28 was 
98.5% (135/137 subjects) in the ITT population and 99.2% (123/124 subjects) in the PP population, 
see Table 7. Two subjects did not reach the castrated level of mean serum testosterone by Day 28 
(V9).  
Table 7. Summary of subjects with a serum testosterone of ≤ 50 ng/dL by 28 Days (ITT and 
PP populations, Study FP01C-13-001) 
Most subjects had a serum testosterone of ≤50 ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336, except for four 
subjects. Two subjects escaped on Day 28 (V9), one subject escaped on Day 169 (V15) and the other 
subject escaped on Day 170 (V16). No unexpected findings based on these patient narratives were 
found. The remaining subjects had a serum testosterone of ≤50 ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336. 
The percentage of subjects with castrate level testosterone from Day 28 through Day 336 was 
analysed using the Kaplan-Meier approach, in which an event was defined as occurring in subjects with 
a serum testosterone level > 50 ng/dL at or before Day 336. The percentage of subjects with 
testosterone suppression during this period was 97.0% (133/137 subjects) in the ITT population and 
97.6% (121/124 subjects) in the PP population, see Table 8.

At 7–8 weeks after the first injection, the mean serum testosterone level reached a plateau of 
approximately 10 ng/dL. Serum testosterone remained at this level until the end of the study at 
Week 48 (Day 336). Transient increase in mean serum testosterone levels occurred within 24 to 72 
hours following the administration of the second dose of LMIS 50 mg (“acute-on-chronic” 
phenomenon). This transient increase in serum testosterone level was back to the castration levels by 
Day 196 (V18), and remained below the castration levels until the end of study (Day 336/V23). The 
primary endpoint results are shown in Table 9 and Figure 9. Serum testosterone levels over time 
(Study FP01C-13-001).

The administration of LMIS 50 mg achieved the therapeutic goal of suppressing the serum testosterone 
to castrated level in 98% subjects on Day 28 and the suppression rate was maintained at 97% at the 
end of this study.

Sensitivity analysis: 
The sensitivity analyses showed that the suppression rate for sensitivity analysis was 97.0% (95% CI: 
92.2-98.9) for the ITT population, 97.6% (95% CI: 92.7- 99.2) for the PP population, and 97.4% 
(95% CI: 92.3-99.2) for completed cases. All lower 95% confidence interval bounds for the 
suppression rate were greater than 90%. Refer to Table 9 
Table  10.  Summary  of  sensitivity  analysis  for  patients  with  testosterone  suppression  ≤  50 
ng/dL from Day 28 through Day 336 (IIT, PP populations and completed cases, Study FP01C-
13-001). 
Secondary endpoints: 
The proportion of subjects exhibiting post-suppression excursions of serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL 
The number of subjects who returned at each visit depended on whether there was missing serum 
testosterone value at the scheduled visit.

One subject dropped out before Day 56 (V10). Two subjects) did not reach castration on Day 28 (V9).  
In the ITT population (137 subjects), there were 134 subjects eligible for this endpoint analysis on Day 
56 (V10). The total number of subjects who reached castration on Day 28 and had non-missing serum 
testosterone values at scheduled visits taken was 100%. 
Two subjects exhibited post-suppression elevated castrate levels of testosterone (> 50 ng/dL) during 
the study. Both were due to the acute-on-chronic surge following the second administration of LMIS 
50 mg. One subject in both the ITT and PP populations was observed with mean serum testosterone 
level > 50 ng/dL on Day 169 (V15). His serum testosterone was 53.9 ng/dL on Day 169 (V15), 61.4 
ng/dL on Day 170 (V16), and 59.7 ng/dL on Day 171 (V17). His serum testosterone level was below 
the castrated level (13.2 ng/dL) on V18 (Day 196). The other subject in both the ITT and PP 
populations exhibited post-suppression excursion on Day 170 (V16) with serum testosterone level 54.7 
ng/dL. His serum testosterone level was 30.4 ng/dL on Day 171 (V17). All the above excursions of 
serum testosterone occurred after administering the second dose of LMIS 50 mg, which may be 
attributed to the mild surge effect of LH. The percentage of subjects exhibiting post-suppression 
elevation of serum testosterone was 0% in both ITT and PP populations at the end of the study 
(Day 336). Based on more detailed data provided during the procedure, only very slight and transient 
testosterone level breakthroughs were observed in these two patients and also the LH levels  were 
suppressed. The elevations of testosterone levels following the second dose of LMIS 50 mg were 
concluded to be related to the acute-on-chronic excursion of LH. 
The efficacy of two separate doses of LMIS 50 mg was further analysed by examining the percentage 
of subjects with the serum testosterone less than 20 ng/dL on Day 28 and Day 336. 
The percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL (castrate level) by Day 28 was 
98.5% (135/137) in the ITT population. Of 135 subjects who achieved the castrated level serum 
testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dL), 95 subjects (95/135, 70.4%) achieved serum testosterone level < 20 
ng/dL on Day 28. 
On Day 336, all subjects who completed the study (122/122) achieved castrated serum testosterone 
level (≤ 50 ng/dL), among which 117 subjects (117/122, 95.9%) achieved serum testosterone level < 
20 ng/dL using the more stringent criteria. 
The first dose of LMIS 50 mg reduced the serum testosterone to lower than the castrate level (< 20 
ng/dL) in 70% subjects on Day 28. The suppressed serum testosterone level (< 20 ng/dL) was 
maintained to the end of study (Day 336) after the second injection of LMIS 50 mg on Day 168 in 
more than 95% subjects who completed the study. 
Effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels 
The administration of LMIS 50 mg reduced the serum PSA levels after the first injection, and the effect 
remained until the end of the study in majority of the patients. The applicant reported a mild rebound 
in PSA levels, which was observed from Day 252 to Day 336 (V23/EOS). Refer to Table 11, Table 12 
and Figure 11.

Table 13. Summary of PSA for patients with elevated PSA at baseline (ITT Population, Study 
FP01C-13-001) 
Six subjects did not have PSA values available at the end of study. Three PC patients did not receive 
the 2nd dose of LMIS 50 mg for the following reasons: death in one patient, consent withdrawal and 
refusal to return for the early-termination visit in one patient, and withdrawal due to serious adverse 
event occurrence before receiving the 2nd dose of LMIS 50 mg in one patient. The other 3 patients 
received the 2nd dose of LMIS 50 mg but did not have the PSA level measurement for the following 
reasons: death in two PC patients and loss to follow up in one patient after V20. The patient 
characteristics and laboratory values of patients without PSA at the end of study did not show any 
unexpected findings.  
Effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum LH levels 
Serum LH levels were determined in two different laboratories to exclude the possibility that data 
variation resulted from different laboratory procedures. The administration of LMIS 50 mg reduced the 
serum LH levels after the first injection, and the effect remained until the end of the study. An acute 
and transient increase of mean serum LH levels was observed after each administration of the LMIS 
50 mg and a slight increase in mean LH level was observed at the end of study on Day 336. Refer to 
Table 14 and Table 15, and Figure 12 and Figure 13

Of 131 PC patients with LH measurements available at End of Study (EOS), 19 patients had increasing 
LH levels by EOS, when compared to the previous visit. Three patients withdrew from the study and 
did not receive the second dose of Camcevi, of which two did not achieve either of the efficacy 
endpoints (serum testosterone levels < 50 ng/dL or PSA < 4 ng/mL on Day 336).  The other 17 PC 
patients with increased LH levels toward the end of study or early termination all achieved the 
castrated serum testosterone levels below 20 ng/dL and with PSA levels < 4 ng/mL. The mild LH 
elevation toward the EOS or ET in this subset of subjects did not cause testosterone or PSA increase.  
No apparent trend with regard to cancer staging, age or body weight was observed between the 
increasing LH levels by EOS.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses: 
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the 131 patients in the PK population (refer to Section 3.3.3 of 
this OV). Analyses included race, Asian vs Non-Asian patients, age, and body weight. 
Ethnicity 
Median serum testosterone concentration vs. time profiles after subcutaneous administration of LMIS 
50 mg on Day 0 and Day 168 by race are presented in Figure 14. These profiles were similar among 
races with Day 28 levels < 0.5 ng/mL.

Median serum testosterone concentration vs time after a single subcutaneous dose of LMIS 50 mg (Day 0) or multiple doses (Day 
168) by race (semi log scale) 
Serum testosterone levels were compared among Asian and non-Asian subjects ( 
Figure 15). Median serum testosterone concentration time profiles were lower in Asian subjects 
compared to non Asian subjects. Both groups’ median profiles reached the 0.5 ng/mL target levels of 
testosterone (castrate level) by Day 28, and the level of testosterone remained low until the end of the 
study (Day 336).

or multiple doses in Asian and non-Asian (semi-log scale) 
Median serum testosterone concentration-time profiles were lower in Asian patients compared to 
non-Asian patients at baseline, at D28 and at D336 (EOS), likely attributable to a very limited sample 
size of Asian subjects (5 patients).

Age 
Comparison of testosterone levels by age categories (<60, 60–69, 70–79, or >79 years old) are 
presented in  
Figure 16. Median concentration time profiles for testosterone were comparable among age categories. 
A similar relationship was observed between serum testosterone concentration levels and age as was 
seen for serum leuprorelin concentrations.

Concerning efficacy, the level of serum testosterone and PSA suppression was not related to age, and 
not impaired by renal impairment/failure in those 5 PC patients with renal impairment/failure.

Detailed analysis by body weight was requested and the results showed that leuprorelin concentrations 
were within the therapeutic dose range and testosterone levels were below the castrate level in all 
weight groups, pointing towards that efficacy is achieved also in patients >100 kg with LMIS 50 mg 
dose.

Analysis 
description 
Statistical methods: %patients TES ≤ 50 ng/dL (D28) was analysed using standard large 
sample approximation to a binomial distribution. %patients TES ≤ 50 ng/dL (D336) was 
analysed using a Kaplan-Meier approach. The duration of time to an event was summarised 
by Kaplan-Meier plot, and presented as event number, percentage, 95% CI for percentage, 
mean, median and 95% CI for median. %patients TES > 50 ng/dL were presented as a 
count, percentage and 95% Cl. PSA and LH levels were summarised by descriptive statistics, 
and the change from baseline was summarised descriptively and a paired t-test or Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test was used with significance level of 0.05. 
Secondary analysis 
The definition of population is the same as in primary analysis. 
1. %patients TES > 50 ng/dL: Though 2 patients exhibited the post-suppression excursion 
of serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL after achieving castration level on Day 28, which were 
due to acute-on-chronic surge following second LMIS 50 mg administration, the % of patients 
exhibiting post-suppression excursion of serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL was 0% in both 
ITT and PP populations at the end of study (Day 336/V23). 
2. Effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels 
Mean baseline of PSA levels in ITT were 84.747±382.4744 ng/mL on Day 0 (V2), and it 
decreased to 21.709±80.9601 ng/mL on Day 28 (V9), 5.017±18.4060 ng/mL on Day 84 
(V11). It appeared to approach the normal level on Day 168 (V14) with mean PSA level of 
2.577±7.5404 ng/mL. A slight increase of mean PSA levels was observed on Day 252 (V20) 
with a mean PSA level of 3.545±13.0604 ng/mL and this increase was also observed at the 
end of study on Day 336 (V23/EOS) with a mean PSA level of 12.837±65.5957 ng/mL. A 
similar effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels was observed in PP. 
Administration of LMIS 50 mg significantly reduced the serum PSA levels from Day 28 until 
the end of study. Although a mild rebound in PSA levels was observed from Day 252 to Day 
336 (V23/EOS), the mean serum PSA levels remained low and significantly lower than the 
baseline value. 
3. LH levels: In ITT, mean LH level at baseline was 5.125±3.0421 IU/L and as expected an

acute increase of mean serum LH level to 16.813±8.0169 IU/L on Day 1 (V3) was observed 
after the first administration of LMIS 50 mg. A rapid decrease of serum LH levels was 
observed on Day 2 (V4) with a mean level of 10.8721±4.39251. The serum LH levels 
continued to decrease from Day 3 (V5) with mean LH level of 9.170±3.7546 until it 
approached a plateau on Day 140 (V13) with mean LH level of 0.09146±0.116426. On Day 
168 (V14), the mean serum LH level was 0.10699±0.251897 IU/L and a slight increase of 
serum LH level to 0.14016±0.252015 IU/L was observed again on Day 169 (V15) after the 
second administration of LMIS 50 mg. Continuous decrease of mean serum LH level was 
observed subsequently from Day 170 (V16, 0.13081±0.232549 IU/L) until Day 308 (V22, 
0.07420±0.103575 IU/L). A slight increase in mean LH level was observed at the end of 
study on Day 336 (V23/EOS, 0.10650±0.256015 IU/L). 
Similar results of serum LH level were observed in PP. 
Administration of LMIS 50 mg significantly reduced the serum LH levels after its first 
injection and this effect remained until the end of study.

2.6.5.4.  Supportive study(ies) 
Efficacy results from the published literature: 
Five studies from the published literature were identified in support of 6-month leuprorelin depot forms 
in the treatment of prostate cancer, including the main study supporting efficacy and safety of Eligard 
45 mg (Crawford et al., 20068). The published clinical studies on leuprorelin 6-month were selected as 
being relevant for the applicant’s clinical Study FP01C-13-001, corresponding in design and 
methodology with the comparable studies retrieved. These published efficacy and safety studies of 
leuprorelin 6-month depot in prostate cancer were conducted with either Atrigel or Eligard.  
All studies evaluated the pharmacodynamic efficacy of 2 doses of 45 mg leuprorelin acetate depot for 
12 months (48 weeks). A suppression in testosterone to below castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) was 
reported in all studies in at least 93% of patients (Crawford et al., 2006⁠; Spitz et al., 20129⁠; Mostafa 
et al., 2014⁠10; Shore et al., 201711). The highest percentage reported was 99%, where 102 of 
103 patients were below castrate levels (Crawford et al., 2006). For studies that used a more rigorous 
threshold of ≤ 20 ng/dL, 86.0% to 94.1% of patients were suppressed to below these levels through 
the end of the 1-year study (Crawford et al., 2006⁠; Spitz et al., 2012⁠; Shore et al., 2017). The 
percentage of patients with suppression of testosterone below castrate levels in the published literature 
is similar to the results obtained in the Sponsor-conducted Study FP01C-13-001. Refer to Table 17

Usability of Pre Filled Syringe (PFS) : 
The applicant submitted usability data including use-related risk analysis (URRA), Threshold analysis 
and a review of Phase III study data during the MAA evaluation procedure. The provided data 
supported safe and effective use of Camcevi PFS device in the intended use environment. Due to fewer 
preparatory steps (lack of reconstitution/mixing steps) before injection, it can be presumed that 
handling errors will occur less likely with Camcevi PFScompared to Eligard.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal efficacy study (FP01C-13-001) conducted with LMIS 50 mg, was a single clinical Phase 3, 
uncontrolled, multicentre, open-label, single-arm, 12-month, two-part PK, safety and PD/efficacy study 
performed in 137 male patients with prostate carcinoma in need for androgen deprivation therapy 
(male adult patients with histologically confirmed prostate carcinoma, baseline morning serum 
testosterone level > 150 ng/dL, ECOG performance ≤ 2). Patients were scheduled to receive two doses 
of LMIS 50 mg, 6 months apart. The study was conducted in USA, Europe, and Taiwan. The study was 
conducted in 2 parts. Part I included the first 30 subjects, who had more frequent monitoring for 
safety. Once ≥90% of the 30 subjects achieved suppression of serum testosterone concentrations to 
castration levels (≤50 ng/dL) within 28 days of the initial dose, with acceptable safety and tolerability, 
Part II was opened, and the rest of the subjects were enrolled.  
In terms of clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety, the applicant relies on data of the reference 
product Eligard 45 mg, which was approved in EU in Germany first in 2006. The MAA for LMIS 50 mg 
(Camcevi 42 mg) was submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. For the marketing 
authorisation approval of this hybrid application, the bridging between LMIS 50 mg and the EU-sourced 
reference product Eligard 45 mg is needed. As the same clinical study (Study AGL-0205) was the 
pivotal registration study for Eligard 45 mg to support both the New Drug Application (NDA) in the US 
and MAA in Europe through a mutual recognition procedure, and Germany (BfArM) serving as RMS in 
the original submission of Eligard 45mg. it is agreed that a bridging of LMIS 50 mg data to Eligard 
45mg data can be made based on pharmacodynamic response, i.e., suppression of testosterone levels.  
The bridging can also be supported by non-clinical findings and clinical pharmacokinetic findings. In 
addition, the in vitro release data can only be considered as supportive for the bridge due to the 
complex formulation of the products.  
A review of published literature for the efficacy and safety of 6-month leuprorelin depot forms in 
palliative treatment of prostate cancer was included. Five non-comparative, open-label studies were 
identified, all of which evaluated at least PD on serum testosterone levels over 12 months as per 
effects of two injections of 45-mg leuprorelin acetate depot forms. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the suppression of serum testosterone levels below castrate levels 
(≤ 50 ng/dL) by Day 28 ± 1(day) following the first injection of LMIS 50 mg and the percentage of 
patients with serum testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from Day 28 through Day 336 (remaining 
duration of the study). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included post-suppression elevation of serum testosterone 
(> 50 ng/dL), serum PSA levels, and serum LH levels. PSA and LH are considered additional 
assessments of efficacy, as PSA is a marker for prostate cancer and LH production is upstream of 
testosterone. 
Clinical study design and endpoints are acceptable for documenting the biological activity and safety of 
the proposed formulation of leuprorelin. For demonstration of a bridge between LMIS 50mg and EU-
Eligard 50mg, the performance of a single arm study is acceptable, provided that the bridge to the 
reference product data is  shown.  
On the clinical efficacy side, the main purpose of the trial was to demonstrate the biologic activity and 
safety of LMAS 50mg. Baseline clinical characteristic and detailed staging information of patients in the 
LMIS main study compared with those of the studies of the comparator Eligard, mainly the pivotal 
Eligard 45 mg study (Crawford et al., 2006) to justify the bridging of the LMIS 50 mg clinical data to 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 64/87 
 
 
 
Eligard 45 mg clinical data were presented. The data provided for the purpose of demonstration of a 
bridge between LMIS 50mg and EU-Eligard 45 mg is considered acceptable. 
Based on data provided, it can be concluded that the inclusion and exclusion criteria in LMIS 50mg and 
Eligard 45 mg studies are relatively similar. With very broad inclusion criteria, and also taking into 
consideration the prostate cancer treatment developments over time, it is well understood that patient 
characteristics included in these two studies may vary, which can be seen while comparing the baseline 
characteristics of the patients in these two studies. The baseline classification of the patients in the 
LMIS 50 mg study is hampered by the lack of Gleason score, which was not collected in the study, and 
by missing staging information in a substantial number of patients. Even though the multiple issues 
concerning the comparability of the patient populations in these two studies could not be fully clarified, 
they were not pursued further as they do not impact the validity of the results.   
The study was conducted in two parts as described above. Continuous variables were described using 
descriptive statistics. For missing data, no method of imputation was applied. The paired T test or 
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test the change from baseline. No adjustments for covariates 
were performed in this study. No multiple comparisons were performed. 
A sample size of 120 patients was estimated to achieve the 85% power to detect a difference of 
0.0700 using a one-sided binomial test. A pre-specified interim analysis of efficacy was performed after 
100 patients had completed the Day 28 assessment and a sample size reassessment was carried out to 
determine whether additional patients needed to be enrolled. The estimated conditional power was 
99.07%. Thus, the trial continued as planned with the current sample size. A total of 137 patients were 
enrolled in the study at the end. 
Three populations were analysed: ITT, PP, and safety populations.  
The definitions of analysis populations follow the conventions in clinical trials, and as such are 
considered acceptable. For missing data related to a safety or efficacy endpoint, no method of 
imputation was applied. For the primary efficacy endpoint, the drop-out and missing values were 
handled by specific censoring rules. Sensitivity analyses were performed for serum testosterone levels 
≤50 ng/dL and post hoc analysis was performed in the patients with elevated PSA at baseline. 
Of the 137 patients enrolled in the study, 122 completed the study treatment. In total, 15 patients 
discontinued study, the most common reasons being an AE (n=5), withdrawal of the consent (n=3) or 
use of prohibited medication (n=4). One patient discontinued due to lack of efficacy, one due to 
disease progression (PSA increase) and one patient was lost to follow-up. In general, the numbers or 
discontinued patients were considered to be acceptable, and the reasons for discontinuations typical 
for the study population. The discontinuations are not expected to influence efficacy conclusions as 
efficacy analyses were performed both with ITT and PP population. 
The study protocol was amended four times. The original Protocol was dated 24-Mar-2014 and the 
latest version 1.4 was dated 14-Oct-2015. The applicant submitted the protocol versions and 
descriptions of the protocol amendments. The amendments concerned various sections including 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and statistical analyses. The applicant states, that no changes were 
made in the conduct of the study or planned analyses and the study was performed in accordance of 
the study protocol FP01C-13-001 version 1.4, dated October 14, 2015, which can be accepted. 
All together 452 protocol deviations were reported, of which 14 incidences in eleven patients were 
reported as major deviations. As the efficacy analyses were performed both with ITT and PP 
populations, the major deviations did not affect the efficacy results. The deviations were mainly 
considered procedural deviations and related to Good Clinical Practice compliance, or related to the use 
of prohibited medicines. As such these major deviations are not considered to affect the efficacy or 
safety assessment of LMIS 50 mg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 65/87 
 
 
 
The minor deviations comprised missing information in reporting of, e.g., VAS scale, incorrect sampling 
time, incorrect measuring of, e.g., ECG and temperature, and unperformed biochemistry sampling. 
Also, some of the PK, testosterone and LH samples were frozen or defrosted before analysis or study 
visits were conducted on incorrect days. 
Five interim safety reviews and one interim analysis of efficacy were conducted during this study, 
which were overseen by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and an independent 
statistical centre (ISC). The interim analysis was not intended for use in a decision to stopping the trial 
and claiming that statistical significance has been achieved, but rather to guarantee that study’s 
statistical power would be achieved. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The Part I and Part II populations were comparable and the differences observed were not clinically 
relevant. 
Baseline characteristics 
Despite uncertainties as to the actual numbers of patients with different disease extent classification of 
the included population, it is assumed that these uncertainties, do not present significant bias on the 
primary endpoint estimates. 
There were 83.2% (114/137) patients with Grade 0, 16.1% (22/137) patients with Grade 1, and 0.7% 
(1/137) patient with Grade 2 ECOG performance status. Thus, the majority of the patients were in 
good fit with relatively little symptoms.  The population included represented a subset of patients for 
whom leuprorelin was indicated as a therapeutic approach. 
Therapies that were allowed during the study were acceptable as part of good care and they are not 
considered to affect the efficacy results. The majority of the patients had some current medical 
condition, which covered common cardiovascular diseases and other conditions reflecting the 
population seen in clinical practice. 
The presented tumours histories covered common localised tumours in men. The most common 
previous treatments included radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy and antiandrogen therapy, as 
expected. Also, treatment of previous cancer other than prostate cancer were reported. About 55% of 
subjects in the study had received prior treatment with different therapies and combination of 
therapies, whereas about 45% had not received any treatment for their PC. Thus, the majority of the 
patients had received previous treatment for their prostate cancer with curative intent, which has 
affected the course of the prostate cancer and possibly the response to the antiandrogen therapy with 
LMIS 50 mg.  
Radiotherapy to the prostate as part of a multimodality assessment was not explored even though as a 
bridge is requested for this indication.  On the same lines, “receipt of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, 
cryotherapy, radiotherapy, or anti-androgen therapy concomitantly, or within 8 weeks prior to 
Screening Visit, for treatment of carcinoma of the prostate” was not allowed according to exclusion 
criteria, which raised concerns about potential under-treatment of patients. Exclusion of these 
treatments was considered by the applicant as pertinent to prevent potential bias in the efficacy 
assessment for LMIS 50 mg alone in reducing testosterone and PSA levels in PC patients who are 
received other therapies This rationale can be followed and the explanations are considered acceptable.  
Primary endpoint of testosterone levels 
The primary efficacy endpoint was to determine the percentage of patients with a serum testosterone 
concentration suppressed to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) by Day 28 ± 1 (day) following the first 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 66/87 
 
 
 
injection of LMIS 50 mg and the percentage of patients with serum testosterone suppression (≤ 50 
ng/dL) from Day 28 through Day 336 (remaining duration of the study).  
The efficacy endpoints were designed to be in line with the reference product Eligard 45 mg. The 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint revealed that the percentage of patients with a serum 
testosterone of ≤ 50 ng/dL (castrate level) by Day 28 was 98.5% in the ITT population and 99.2% in 
the PP population with LMIS 50 mg. The percentage of patients with testosterone suppression from 
Day 28 through Day 336 was 97.0% in the ITT population and 97.6% in the PP population. These 
results, as well as those based on evaluation of secondary endpoints, can be considered to be similar 
to those obtained with Eligard 45 mg, even though the evaluation is hampered by the lack of 
comparative data. However, based on the totality of evidence, the selected bridging approach of LMIS 
50 mg to Eligard 45 mg without comparative data can be considered acceptable.  
There were two patients who did not reach the castrate levels on Day 28 of which one due to lack of 
efficacy (did not receive the second dose) and the other one completed the study achieving castrate 
levels at later time point Day 56 (received the second dose). Other two patients, , experienced post-
suppression excursions of testosterone to >50 ng/dL, following the second dose of LMIS 50 mg, which 
were concluded to be related to the acute-on-chronic excursion of LH. In addition to these episodes, no 
other elevations were reported. The testosterone surge (flare) did not appear to be associated with 
significantly increased PSA, disease progression, or adverse events. Based on the narratives of these 
cases No unexpected findings were found.  
Subgroup analyses on the effect of cancer stage, time from diagnosis to date of informed consent, 
body weight and age to the serum testosterone levels and the suppression rate were performed. 
However, as there were only a limited number of patients, who did not reach the castrate levels, no 
conclusions based on these subgroup analyses could be made.   
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients exhibiting post-suppression excursions of 
serum testosterone to > 50 ng/dL, either through “breakthrough” (i.e., episodes unrelated to LMIS 
50 mg dosing), or through the “acute-on-chronic” phenomenon (i.e., related to the second dose of 
LMIS 50 mg). No “breakthrough” episodes were reported. Two patients exhibited post-suppression 
elevated castrate levels of testosterone (> 50 ng/dL) during the study. As for the primary endpoint 
results, also the secondary endpoint results were comparable with the reference product.  
Regarding the more stringent suppression level of testosterone, LMIS 50 mg and Eligard 45 mg were 
comparable towards the EOS.  
PSA levels  
The administration of LMIS 50 mg reduced the serum PSA levels after the first injection compared to 
the baseline level until the end of the study in ITT and PP populations. In the ITT population, mean 
baseline of PSA levels were 84.747±382.4744 ng/mL on Day 0, and level decreased to 2.577±7.5404 
ng/mL by Day 168 after the first dose. The range of PSA was considerably wide from baseline (0.06-
2748.44), to Day 28 (0.06-525.91), to Day 168 (0.06-56.56), and to EOS Day 226 (0.06-318.05). 
A similar effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels was observed in the PP population. The mean 
baseline PSA levels were 70.240±333.4071 ng/mL on Day 0 and 2.641±7.6833 ng/mL at Day 168 
after the first dose. The range of PSA was similarly wide from baseline (0.06-2748.44), to Day 28 
(0.06-635.79),), to Day 168 (0.06-56.56), and to EOS Day 226 (0.06-644.57). 
Overall, the discrepancy between the mean and median levels underline the wide range of PSA levels, 
which in turn reflect the heterogeneity in the tumour biology and the prostate cancer trajectory of the 
study population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 67/87 
 
 
 
However, an increase of mean PSA levels was observed from Day 252 onwards with a mean PSA level 
of 3.545±13.0604 ng/mL and with increasing levels towards EOS on Day 336 with a mean PSA level of 
12.837±65.5957 ng/mL in ITT population. A similar effect of LMIS 50 mg on serum PSA levels was 
observed in the PP population. An increase of mean PSA levels was observed on Day 252 with mean 
PSA level 3.620±13.2136 ng/mL on Day 252 and at EOS on Day 336 with mean PSA level of 
7.972±37.1654 ng/mL. This PSA increase ranged from slight (without clinical relevance) to significant 
increase. For Eligard 45 mg, PSA steadily decreased and by EOS only 4 of 103 (2.9%) patients had 
elevated PSA level. 
The applicant reported this result as a mild rebound in PSA levels from Day 252 to Day 336 
(V23/EOS). Transient rise (“bounce”) of PSA after prostate surgery and radiotherapy is a common 
phenomenon and it is not connected to worsening of the prognosis of prostate cancer. Some studies 
refer that this post-treatment brief rise is connected to improved prognosis. The current understanding 
is that the brief rise of PSA results from the release of PSA from destroyed cancer cells or from normal 
prostate tissue exposed to radiotherapy. This brief rise can occur up to 1-3 years after the given 
radiotherapy, which fits to the mechanism of action of radiotherapy (direct and indirect action of 
radiation on the DNA molecules). However, this is not the case in the elevations of PSA in the current 
study.  
The rise in PSA levels for the EOS raised concerns about efficacy.  
As discussed in detail in the pharmacodynamic section, the rise in the PSA levels towards the end of 
study may be related to the higher PSA levels at baseline compared to the Eligard and other studies, 
as well as the slightly different patient populations included in these two studies. However, due to lack 
of comparative data, no conclusions based on PSA levels can be made. Nevertheless, the results 
concerning the primary endpoint, i.e., the testosterone suppression, was similar with LMIS and Eligard 
irrespective of these difference in the PSA values. 
LH levels 
The administration of LMIS 50 mg with six months dosing interval reduced the serum LH levels below 
the baseline after the first injection, and this effect remained until the end of the study. However, two 
types of increase in the LH levels were observed; transient increase following every injection of LMIS 
50 mg and slight increase towards the end of the study. The same transient increase in mean LH levels 
was observed also following Eligard 45 mg. A continuous decrease of mean serum LH level was 
observed subsequently from Day 170 until Day 308 and the increase occurred thereafter towards the 
end of study on Day 336 observed both in ITT and PP populations as well as in the BA Lab and PRL 
Lab. Thus, a slight increase in mean LH level was observed at EOS on Day 336 in 17 patients with 
available data and in three cases LH level increased > 1.0 IU/L. 
The mild LH elevation toward the EOS or ET in this subset of subjects did not cause testosterone or 
PSA increase.  No apparent trend with regard to cancer staging, age or body weight was observed 
between the increasing LH levels by EOS.  
Ancillary analyses and supportive studies 
The comparison of serum testosterone levels between different races showed similar PK-profiles. 
However, median serum testosterone concentration-time profiles were lower in Asian patients 
compared to non-Asian patients. Both groups’ median profiles reached the 0.50 ng/mL target levels of 
testosterone (castrate level) by Day 28, and the level of testosterone remained low until the end of the 
study (Day 336). . As there were only five Asian patients, no conclusions based on these low numbers 
can be made.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 68/87 
 
 
 
Median concentration-time profiles for testosterone were comparable among age categories (< 60, 
60-69, 70–79, or > 79 years old). A similar trend as seen with age and leuprorelin concentration was 
seen for age and testosterone concentration, so that higher age led to higher leuprorelin 
concentrations and further to lower testosterone concentrations. The mean testosterone concentrations 
levels were below the castrate level in all patient groups through the study period. The effect of LMIS 
50mg to suppress serum testosterone and PSA levels was not related to age. Concentration time 
profiles for testosterone were comparable among body weight categories (< 75, 75–84, 85–100, or 
> 100 kg). Yet, a trend is seen, that higher body weight results in higher testosterone levels.  
The effects of LMIS 50 mg to suppress serum testosterone and PSA levels were not impaired by the 
renal impairment/failure in those 5 PC patients with renal impairment/failure. These low numbers of 
patients with renal impairment do not allow meaningful conclusions.  
Five studies from the published literature were identified in support of 6-month leuprorelin depot 
formulations in the treatment of prostate cancer, including the main study supporting efficacy and 
safety of Eligard 45 mg. The applicant provided a short summary of conclusions and deemed results of 
the current pivotal Phase 3 study to be similar to the results found in the published literature which can 
be agreed.  broadly agreed. The selection of the studies is considered acceptable.  
LMIS 50 mg is supplied in a sterile, ready-to-use single syringe. The applicant provided data that 
supported safe and effective use of PFS in the intended use environment.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant has conducted a single clinical Phase 3 trial with LMIS 50 mg, which was an uncontrolled, 
multicentre, open-label, single-arm, 12-month, two-part PK, safety and PD/efficacy study in 137 males 
with prostate carcinoma in need for androgen deprivation therapy. In terms of clinical pharmacology, 
efficacy and safety, the submission relies on data from the reference product Eligard 45 mg, which in 
EU was first approved in Germany in 2006.  
Based on the information that the same clinical study for Eligard 45 mg was used to support the New 
Drug Application (NDA) in the US, and MAA in Europe through a mutual recognition procedure and 
Germany serving as Reference Member State it is accepted that a bridging of LMIS 50 mg data to 
Eligard 45mg data can be made.  
The bridging is based on pharmacodynamic responses of testosterone suppression, and comparison of 
in vitro release characteristics of EU-sourced Eligard 45mg and LMIS 50mg; non-clinical findings and 
clinical pharmacokinetic findings are considered supportive.  
The study population appears to be rather heterogeneous with regards to the prostate cancer disease 
extent and previous anticancer treatments. However, since the study was designed to assess 
pharmacodynamic endpoints, the inclusion of heterogenous PC patients, in need for LHRH-targeted 
medications, is acceptable for the purpose of this procedure.  
The efficacy endpoints were designed to be in line with the reference product Eligard 45 mg. Overall, 
the study met the primary and secondary endpoints and the results were comparable with the 
reference product. 
The observed changes in the serum testosterone, LH and PSA levels towards the end of study were 
relatively infrequent, and based on data presented can be mainly deemed to be related to patient-
related reasons and not due to loss of efficacy towards the end of the 6 months dosing interval. The 
lacking baseline staging information in a large number of patients raises concerns about study conduct,

but is not expected to jeopardize the primary endpoint assessment, i.e., the testosterone suppression 
levels. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Safety data for this application come from the pivotal study FP01C-13-001 where safety and 
tolerability of LMIS 50 mg were listed as primary endpoint. Complementarily, publications from other 
trials and FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) data have been submitted. In addition to data 
from the FAERS database (which is considered only supportive), the EU data originating from the 
EudraVigilance were provided (See “Published literature and databases”). The primary outcome 
measures for the FP01C-13-001-EX were AEs, clinically significant changes in ECGs and laboratory 
parameters (haematology, biochemistry and urinanalysis).  
The formulation of LMIS 50 mg contains N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and poly (D,L-lactide) (PLA) as 
excipients. Both of these are already contained in medicinal products for parenteral use in the EU.  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In Study FP01C-13-001, 137 patients were exposed to LMIS 50 mg and 128 patients received 2 doses. 
Almost 90% of enrolled patients were white. 
Two PK studies were performed during the clinical development programme. Study FSEE-CSC-100 
included patients from Study FP01C-13-001, and Study FSEE-PMX-FP001-1605 included data from 
FP01C-13-001 as well as from Eligard 45 mg reports. The safety findings of the PK analyses performed 
by the applicant are included in FP01C-13-001 safety data. 
Overall, 95.6% of patients used concomitant medications (data not shown). 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Study FP01C-13-001 began with 30 patients undergoing frequent safety monitoring (Part I). In 
addition, the first 10 patients of this group were under more frequent monitoring for safety endpoints.  
Eventually, 33 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in Part I. Of them four patients did not complete 
the study (12%), due to protocol deviation, disease progression, withdrawal of consent due to lack of 
efficacy or withdrawal of consent. Eventually altogether 137 patients were enrolled, 122 completed the 
study and 15 withdrew (11%), with the most common reason for withdrawal an AE (5 patients). Other 
reasons were lack of efficacy (1), lost to follow-up (1), disease progression (1), withdrew consent (3), 
treated with prohibited medications due to medical need (3) or taking Humalog 18 units TID (1).

Summary of the TEAEs is presented in Table 18 
Table 18. Summary of TEAEs and drug related AEs (ADRs) in Study FP01C-13-001 
In FP01C-13-001, most common TEAEs are presented in Table 19 by PT and with ≥5% incidence. 
When the ≥5% limit is omitted, the most common TEAEs were hot flush and flushing (50,4%), 
hypertension and essential hypertension (15,3%), pain in extremity (9.5%) with possibly related 
TEAEs (bone pain 2.9%, musculoskeletal pain 2.9%, myalgia 0.7%), injection site pain (7.3%), 
arthralgia (6.6%), fatigue (6.6%) with related asthenia (3,6%), nocturia (5.8%) with possibly related 
TEAEs of micturition urgency (3,6%) and pollakiuria (1,5%), back pain (5.1%) and the possibly related 
TEAEs listed earlier (e.g. bone pain), and nasopharyngitis (5.1%) with possibly related TEAEs (localised 
infection 1,5% and sinusitis 4,4%). Slight differences for the percentages are noted in the two most 
common AEs (flushing and hypertension), which is related to differences in categorisation. Thus, the 
spectrum of TEAEs is in general the same with and without the 5% limit.

Table 19. Incidence of TEAEs ≥ 5% by PT in Study FP01C-13-001 
Initially 15 events of QTcF increases in nine patients were identified in the main study, none in the 
extension study. The applicant included a separate ECG report in which measurements of ECGs and 
case re-evaluations were made by a cardiologist. In nine of the 15 events alternate explanations for QT 
prolongation were present (QT prolonged at baseline/screening, a QT prolonging drug newly added or 
ventricular pacing). Thus, six QT prolongation events could be associated to leuprolide treatment. Five 
of these were eliminated by ECG re-measurement. Of note, re-assessments were performed only on 
cases with QTc prolongation.  
The most common TEAEs that became more frequent during the safety extension period compared 
with the main study were acute kidney injury, blood triglycerides increased, dehydration, dizziness, 
fall, and fatigue (Table 20). These occurred in 2 patients each (6.67%). In total, acute kidney injury 
occurred in 3/137 (2,2%) of the patients in FP01C-13-001 and in 2/30 in extension study (6.7%), 
which is more frequent than usually seen in relation to ADT use (e.g., about 5/1000 in Lapi et al. 
201312; no mention in the Eligard SmPC).  
The AEs that remained the most prominent during the extension period were hypertension and 
dizziness.  
Only one drug related AE, a moderate neutropenia, was reported during FP01C-13-001-EX. However, 
neutropenia is not a listed reaction to leuprorelin-containing medicinal products for injection. The last 
dose of LMIS for this patient was given 5.5 months before the neutropenia occurred and the patient 
was using clopidrogel which has neutropenia as a rare ADR. Thus, no safety signal arose from this 
case.

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In Study FP01C-13-001, SAEs occurred in 20 patients (14.6%) and the most common SAE was 
subdural haematoma in two patients (1.5%) (Table 21). Only three SAEs were drug-related: blurred 
vision, left hip fracture, and myocardial infarction.  
Concerning cardiac disorders, there were four SAEs in three patients (angina pectoris 2, myocardial 
infarction 1, atrial fibrillation 1), not deemed related to LMIS.  
Altogether four fractures were reported, three in the main study and one in the extension study, in 
three patients. Thus, the frequencies of fractures as 3/137 (2,2%) and 1/30 (3,3%) are in line with 
those detected in ADT treated men with prostate cancer (e.g., SmPC for Eligard).  
During the safety extension period, there were seven new SAEs reported in four patients. None was 
related to LMIS 50 mg. No deaths occurred during the extension study. 
In the literature-based data, cardiac events were highlighted among the SAEs. These occurred, 
however, often in patients with medical history of significant risk factors. In total, 26 deaths were 
reported in two publications with no details from 25 cases. 
For the SAEs and deaths identified in the FAERS database: See section “Published literature and 
databases”.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the main study, clinically significant changes in biochemical parameters were reported in three 
patients. None of these findings was found to be related to the dosing of LMIS 50 mg. During the 
safety extension, one patient had a clinically significant case of lower than normal neutrophil counts 
that was possibly related to study drug, and two patients had clinically significant abnormalities in 
biochemical assessment. In the literature, anaemia, including serious cases, was reported as AEs of 
interest and with incidence “common” (the frequency mentioned also in the proposed SmPC) although, 
only two of the anaemia AEs were considered treatment-related. In study FP01C-13-001 no cases of 
anaemia were reported.  
Blood Chemistry 
Three patients had clinically significant increases in blood glucose levels: two in the main study and 
one in the safety extension. One normalised by the end of the study and the other patients had pre-
existing conditions (diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia). History or presence of Type I or Type II 
diabetes mellitus (unless only oral hypoglycaemic required) were criteria for exclusion, which let 
advanced diabetes mellitus with several oral antidiabetic drugs in their regimen to enter the study. In 
Study FP01C-13-001, there were AEs related to diabetes mellitus including a severe case of diabetic 
foot (a long-term complication of diabetes mellitus). HgbA1c was monitored during the safety 
extension period only. This information is reflected in the SmPC: “Hyperglycaemia and an increased 
risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycaemia may 
represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. 
Monitor blood glucose and/or HgbA1c periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage 
with current practice for treatment of hyperglycaemia or diabetes”.  
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
The PK of LMIS 50 mg in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment has not been investigated. 
Camcevi 42 mg is contraindicated in women and paediatric patients. 
Safety data for patients older (≥ 75 years) were submitted during the procedure: As the main trial had 
no upper limit for age, the trial had a fairly large proportion of aged patients of ≥75 years of age 
(37,2%). The overall incidence of TEAEs was 68,6% in <65 years (overall population in this age group 
35 patients), 84,3% in 65-74 years (51 patients), 91,1% in 75-84 years (45 patients) and 100% in 
>84 years (six patients).  
In general, the spectrum of the most frequent AEs in aged patients did not significantly differ from 
those detected in younger patients. Furthermore, some detected differences may be related to the 
small number of patients. Regarding AEs of special interest, only fatigue increased systematically with 
growing age  
In the main study and its extension there were no patients with bodyweight <40 kg. 17 patients 
weighed more than 100 kg in these studies. In these patients with the 10% cut-off the most common 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 75/87 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs were hot flush (58.8%), followed by hypertension (23.5%), back pain (11.8%), fatigue 
(11.8%), and nocturia (11.8%). Here the small number of patients and the cut-off of 10% can be 
partly related to differences in TEAE frequencies when compared to the whole study population.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
No information available which is acceptable.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
NO new drug-drug interaction studies were provided which is acceptable.  
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were 15 (10.9%) discontinued subjects. Of the 15 discontinued subjects 5 subjects (5/137, 
3.6%) discontinued the study due to experiencing the following adverse events: acute kidney injury, 
atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, death, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, and metastatic 
prostate cancer.  
Published literature and databases 
To complement this application publications from other trials and FAERS data were included.  
A PubMed search for years 1986-2019 was run and re-run as of October 2020. Initial search included 
the terms “leuprolide” or “leuprorelin”, “6 month”, “study” and was then narrowed down to restrict to 
“prostate”. The re-run omitted the term leuprolide as it did not provide additional hits. Publication 
language was restricted to English. The initial search resulted in more than 180 hits and the re-run in 
207 hits. Major new publications suitable for comparison with the main study FP01C-13-001 were not 
identified. 
The FAERS data presented in the submitted material are from the year 2017 only. According to the 
applicant, the rational for this approach was to capture AEs not included in the most recent labelling 
updates. In this MAA, Eligard SmPC from year 2019 is used.  
The applicant described that technically “leuprorelin or Lupron or Eligard” was used as the keyword for 
“DRUGNAME” with the option “ps” (primary suspect) picked. This would exclude events where there 
are several drugs involved in the causality and where leuprorelin is included but not as the primary 
suspect (e.g. drug-drug interactions with substrates known to prolong QT interval). 
The most common AE presented originating from the FAERS data was death. For the period concerned 
(Q1/2017 through Q4/2017), ‘death’ is listed as the most commonly reported AE (190 events, 
corresponding to an event frequency of 14.8% based on total number of events reported). When cases 
with a reported outcome of death were collected, the overall cases of death amounted to 302 deaths, 
corresponding to a frequency of 23.5% based on total number of cases reported. However, prostate 
cancer is serious disease and the cases identified in FAERS data were subjects of at least 60 years of 
age. Thus, these events can be related to e.g. progression of metastatic prostate cancer or to causes 
related to comorbidities in this aged population.  
Many of the most common AE types related to leuprorelin use in the FAERS data are about the 
technical issues with the existing products. The use of prefilled syringe suggested for Camcevi was 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 76/87 
 
 
 
 
created to address this medical need. With a pre-filled syringe medication errors are expected to be 
rarer. 
Otherwise (despite deaths and medication errors) the reported AEs do not differ remarkably from those 
presented for FP01C-13-001. 
Findings from the Eudravigilance data from January 2017 to September 2020 were provided. Mirroring 
to the total number of cases in EEA sources (n=4966), e.g. the frequency of fatal AEs (n=1140) as 
22,9% is comparable to FAERS data from 2017. Divided by the year of EudraVigilance gateway receipt 
the proportion of deaths as the fatal AE has increased from 54,1% (2017) to 73,5% (2020 up to end of 
September). However, the total number of different fatal AEs varies by each year and does not show a 
growing trend. Almost all were spontaneous reports and a majority were unconfirmed and did not 
contain additional details. Similarly, the total number of non-fatal but serious AEs varies by each year 
and does not show a growing trend.  
Post marketing experience 
LMIS 50 mg has not been approved or marketed anywhere in the world, nor has it been withdrawn 
from marketing / registration in any country. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Leuprorelin has been on the EU market for more than 30 years, and the reference product Eligard 
45 mg for more than 10 years. LMIS 50 mg formulation contains NMP as an excipient. As the dose of 
NMP is of the same order of magnitude (139.40 mg of NMP in LMIS 50 mg and 165 mg of NMP in 
Eligard) of Eligard and the dosing interval is the same (once in 6 months), this is considered 
acceptable. 
The applicant has submitted data from a new Phase 3 trial (FP01C-13-001) with a safety extension 
(FP01C-13-001-EX). In addition, two PK analyses were performed. Complementarily, publications from 
PubMed up to October 2020 and FAERS data have been submitted. In addition, the applicant provided 
EU data originating from EudraVigilance from January 2017 to September 2020.  
In Study FP01C-13-001, 137 patients were exposed to LMIS 50 mg and 128 patients received the 
planned two doses. The safety findings of the PK analyses performed by the applicant are included in 
FP01C-13-001 safety data. Healthy volunteers have been mentioned in relation to one publication 
Study FP01C-13-001 began with the intention of enrolling 30 patients for frequent safety monitoring 
(Part I). In addition, the first 10 patients were under more frequent monitoring of safety endpoints. 
Eventually, 33 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in Part I.  Of these 12% did not complete the 
study when the proportion of not completing the study was 11% in the whole 137 patient population.  
To evaluate whether the risk for post-dose AEs is related to higher serum concentrations of leuprolide 
mesilate, the graphs plotting the individual time-concentration profiles for the first three days after 
dosing with the time of any AEs occurring for each individual during this time period were presented 
(data not shown). No direct association between serum concentration and timing of AEs was detected.  
In FP01C-13-001, most common TEAEs were hot flush (48.9%), hypertension (14.6%), pain in 
extremity (9.5%), injection site pain (7.3%), arthralgia (6.6%), fatigue (6.6%), nocturia (5.8%), back 
pain (5.1%), and nasopharyngitis (5.1%) (by PT and with ≥5% incidence). When the 5% limit is 
omitted the spectrum of the TEAEs is similar and the spectrum of TEAEs is typical to the applied 
treatment and to the treated patient population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 77/87 
 
 
 
The most common TEAEs that became more frequent during the safety extension period compared 
with the main study were acute kidney injury, blood triglycerides increased, dehydration, dizziness, 
fall, and fatigue. These occurred in two patients each. In total, acute kidney injury occurred in in 3/137 
(2,2%) patients in the main study and in 2/30 in extension study (6.7%), which is much more than 
usually seen in relation to ADT use. However, these were not regarded as drug-related and the 
patients had clear risk factors for renal failure. The AEs that remained the most prominent during the 
extension period were hypertension and dizziness. Only one drug related AE, a moderate neutropenia, 
was reported during FP01C-13-001-EX. The mention about leuprorelin having minor influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines in the proposed SmPC section 4.7 is endorsed.  
Hypertension was a relatively frequent TEAE in the main study and in its extension. However, the 
applicant’s justifications with reference to Eudravigilance and published data for not upgrading this 
from uncommon to common ADR in SmPC are supported. Also the cardiac SAEs (four in three patients) 
in the main study have other plausible background factors. Furthermore, the suggested SmPC includes 
an overarching warning for cardiovascular diseases in 4.4., along the lines of Eligard.  
SAEs occurred in 20 patients (14.6%) and the most common SAE was subdural hematoma (1.5%, two 
patients) in Study FP01C-13-001. Only three SAEs were drug-related: blurred vision, left hip fracture, 
and myocardial infarction. The narratives of these cases contain only limited information. No detailed 
information about the SAEs are given, e.g., whether the myocardial infarction was related to QT 
prolongation. Altogether four fractures were reported, three in the main study and one in the extension 
study, in three patients. Thus the frequencies of fractures as 3/137 (2,2%) and 1/30 (3,3%) are in line 
with those detected in ADT treated men with prostate cancer (e.g., SmPC for Eligard).  
Of three deaths in the main trial none was related to the use of LMIS 50 mg. During the safety 
extension period, there were seven new SAEs reported in four patients. None of these SAEs was 
related to LMIS 50 mg. A case of blurred vision was concomitantly diagnosed with a cataract and 
hyperopia. However, impaired vision is a listed reaction for leuprorelin-containing medicinal products 
for injection and relationship between LMIS 50 mg is possible. No deaths occurred during the extension 
study. In the literature-based data, cardiac events were highlighted among the SAEs. These occurred, 
however, often in patients with medical history of significant risk factors. 
In the main study, only few clinically significant changes in biochemical parameters were reported, and 
none of these were found to be related to the dosing of LMIS 50 mg. During the safety extension, one 
patient had a clinically significant case of lower than normal neutrophil counts that was possibly related 
to study drug, and two patients had clinically significant abnormalities in biochemical assessment. In 
the literature, anaemia, including serious cases, was reported with incidence “common” (the frequency 
mentioned also in the SmPC). This differs from FP01C-13-001 where no cases of anaemia were 
reported. However, only two of the anaemia AEs in the literature were considered treatment-related. 
Clinically significant changes in ECG recordings were reported. It is known that spontaneous and 
induced hypotestosteronaemia is associated with an increase in QTc. Overall, nine patients had 
15 outlier QTcF responses: QTcF ≥ 500 msec, or QTcF ≥ 480 msec with dQTcF ≥ 60 msec, or both. 
Leuprorelin treatment was initially regarded as the probable cause of QT prolongation in five patients. 
However, after a post hoc ECG analysis, only 1 case of QT prolongation was ascribed to leuprorelin 
therapy. The proposed SmPC section 4.4 warns about QT prolongation in patients with a history of or 
risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that might 
prolong the QT interval. The SmPC text is complemented with “Periodic monitoring of 
electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered” which is endorsed. 
Update of the frequency of QT prolongation from “not known” to “uncommon” is included in the 
SmPC’s 4.8. ADT table.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 78/87 
 
 
 
Drug-drug interactions known to prolong QT interval or to induce Torsade de pointes are adequately 
described in the proposed SmPC (in line with the reference product). 
Reported local skin reactions to the injection were mild or moderate in severity and were resolved by 
the end of study.  
In patients receiving a GnRH agonist, blood glucose and/or HgbA1c should be monitored periodically. 
This issue is handled in the SmPC, which is acceptable. HgbA1c was monitored during the safety 
extension period only. History or presence of Type I or Type II diabetes mellitus (unless only oral 
hypoglycaemic required) were criteria for exclusion, which let patients with advanced diabetes mellitus 
with several oral antidiabetic drugs in their regimen to enter the study. It is notable that in Study 
FP01C-13-001, there were AEs related to diabetes mellitus including a severe case of diabetic foot (a 
long-term complication of diabetes mellitus). 
According to the proposed SmPC, contraindications include patients who previously underwent 
orchiectomy, and as sole treatment in patients with spinal cord compression or evidence of spinal 
metastases. In addition, LMIS 50 mg is proposed to be contraindicated in women and paediatric 
patients. 
The intended indication is prostate cancer, thus no between-gender differences (AEs in women) or risk 
of adverse pregnancy outcomes are applicable, neither are the AEs in paediatric population. The 
SmPC’s section 4.6 “Fertility, pregnancy and lactation” has been updated to reflect that ”Camcevi is 
contraindicated in women. Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprorelin may 
impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3).”  
As the main trial had no upper limit for age, it can be expected that with rising age also the frequency 
of AEs rises as the comorbidity burden typically increases. In general, the spectrum of the most 
frequent AEs in aged patients did not significantly differ from what was detected in younger patients. 
Furthermore, some detected differences may be related to the small number of patients. Regarding 
AEs of special interest, only fatigue increased systematically with growing age. The body weight 
typically decreases with growing age. However, it is not known whether this is related to the AEs seen. 
Leuprorelin concentrations increase with age but are still within the therapeutic dose range. These 
findings do not indicate any new safety concerns.  
Safety data in patients with renal impairment / renal failure and in patients with hepatic impairment 
were provided. For renal function data for BUN, serum creatinine and estimated CrCl values was 
provided for 5 patients who developed renal impairment during the study. No new safety concerns 
emerged from these. The applicant also reported in FP01C-13-001 and FP01C-13-001-EX studies 3 AEs 
of hepatic disorder and 5 patients with abnormalities in ALT and AST levels, all < 8 x UL. These did not 
raise new safety concerns.  
Common role of acute kidney injuries, dehydration, dizziness, falls, and fatigue not only as separate 
events but as a phenomenon where the clustering of these different AE types may be in relation to 
each other (in the whole safety population and separately in different special populations, e.g., elderly) 
were presented but no obvious interactions could be detected from the different TEAEs (acute kidney 
injury, dizziness, dehydration, falls, fatigue). The low number of patients with very high age together 
with low number of some of the events precluded firm conclusions.  
In the main study and its extension there were no patients with bodyweight <40 kg. 17 patients 
weighed more than 100 kg in these studies. In these patients with the 10% cut-off the most common 
TEAEs were hot flush (58.8%), followed by hypertension (23.5%), back pain (11.8%), fatigue 
(11.8%), and nocturia (11.8%). Here the small number of patients and the cut-off of 10% can be 
partly related to differences in TEAE frequencies when compared to the whole study population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022  
Page 79/87 
 
 
 
Generally, the co-medications and presumed comorbidities are in line with what would be expected for 
this population. 
According to current scientific knowledge, this peptide does not raise immunological safety concerns. 
In relation to the amount of patients experiencing AEs (83.2%), the amount of patients discontinuing 
the study (3.6%) was low implying relatively good tolerability. 
LMIS 50 mg has not been approved or marketed anywhere. Concerning other marketed leuprorelin 
products, the presented post-marketing data were scarce. The FAERS data presented contains 
voluntary reports from populations of uncertain size, and thus it is difficult to reliably estimate the 
frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. For the period concerned (Q1/2017 
through Q4/2017), ‘death’ is listed as the most commonly reported AE (190 events, corresponding to 
an event frequency of 14.8% based on total number of events reported). When cases with a reported 
outcome as death were collected, the overall cases of death amounted to 302 deaths, corresponding to 
a frequency of 23.5% based on total number of cases reported. However, prostate cancer is serious 
disease and the cases identified in FAERS data were subjects of at least 60 years of age. Thus, these 
events can be related to e.g. progression of metastatic prostate cancer or to causes related to 
comorbidities in this aged population.  
Eudravigilance data from January 2017 to September 2020 (n=4966) showed e.g. the frequency of 
fatal AEs (n=1140) as 22,9% which is comparable to FAERS data from 2017. For death as the most 
common AE it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the role of leuprorelin treatment, due to the 
limited amount of case details. As prostate cancer is a serious disease the most plausible explanation 
in fatal cases could be disease progression in metastatic stage and also the typical comorbidity burden 
these patients tend to have. Divided by the year of EudraVigilance gateway receipt, the proportion of 
deaths as the fatal AE has increased from 54,1% (20117) to 73,5% (2020 up to end of September). 
However, the total number of fatal AEs varies by each year and does not show a growing trend. From 
the 721 cases reported as death in the fatal AEs, one MAH has reported 95% of them, almost all were 
spontaneous reports and a majority were unconfirmed and did not contain additional details. Similarly, 
the total number of non-fatal but serious AEs varies by each year and does not show a growing trend. 
The spectrum of these AEs is as expected and mirrors the findings in the main study and clinical 
experience. On the whole, the retrieved data did not give rise to previously unknown safety concerns.  
Results from a comprehensive literature search including Phase 4 studies about post-marketing safety 
of 6-month leuprorelin depot forms using PubMed and Google Scholar with a search up to October 202 
were presented with the search string Leuprolide/Leuprorelin AND English AND Clinical Trial, Phase IV. 
However, no publications were found, nor by adding ‘post marketing’. Adding “Case reports”, 461 
publications were retrieved. The applicant did not bundle these into main themes but presented some 
examples (e.g. pituitary apoplexy, convulsions and interstitial lung disease, which are included in the 
proposed SmPC for Camcevi). The contents of these case reports are likely to be highly variable and 
also mirror the high prevalence of prostate cancer. Based on  the long clinical use of leuprorelin 
products and the cases presented no additional measures are suggested.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The application is based mainly on data from one Phase 3 trial. The AEs were mostly in line with the 
previous experience with leuprorelin products. The medication errors may be less frequent with this 
new product, but class type effects, such as risk of QT prolongation, remain as safety concerns to be 
closely monitored.

3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Camcevi is indicated for the treatment of hormone-dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the 
treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer in 
combination with radiotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
This marketing authorisation application is for a leuprorelin mesilate injectable suspension (LMIS) 50 
mg, containing leuprorelin mesilate equivalent to 42 mg leuprorelin (Camcevi 42 mg), supplied as 
ready-to-use drug product in contrast to the available products requiring pre-mixing prior 
subcutaneous injection.  
LMIS 50 mg is the first ready-to-use leuprorelin prolonged-release pharmaceutical form for 6-month 
dosing intervals. The product was developed to address the respective medical need in leuprorelin-
based androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as handling errors with depot formulations were frequently 
reported leading to the ongoing referral procedure (refer to EMA/316598/2019). 
Camcevi does not provide a novel therapeutic approach nor address an unmet medical need. In this 
indication several other pharmaceutical products are available, e.g., other leuprorelin formulations, 
triptorelin, goserelin, which are also endorsed by several international therapeutic guidelines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical study supporting this application for LMIS 50 mg is the Phase 3 study FP01C-13-001, which 
is a completed, uncontrolled, multicentre, open-label, single-arm, 12-month, two-part PK, safety and 
PD/efficacy study conducted in 137 males with prostate carcinoma in need of androgen deprivation 
therapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Leuprorelin has been on the EU market for more than 30 years, and the reference product Eligard 
45 mg for more than 10 years. 
In the LMIS 50 mg clinical study, the percentage of subjects with a serum testosterone of ≤50 ng/dL 
(castrate level) by Day 28 was 98.5% (135/137 subjects) in the ITT population and 99.2% 
(123/124 subjects) in the PP population. The percentage of subjects with testosterone suppression 
from Day 28 through Day 336 was 97.0% (133/137 subjects) in the ITT population and 97.6% 
(121/124 subjects) in the PP population. Thus, the primary efficacy endpoint of serum testosterone 
concentration suppression below castrate level was met and was comparable to those of the reference 
product Eligard 50 mg and the results in published literature. 
The percentage of subjects with a more stringent serum testosterone level ≤20 ng/dL by Day 28 was 
70.4% (95/135) in the ITT population. On Day 336, of the subjects who completed the study, 95.9% 
(117/122) achieved serum testosterone level <20 ng/dL. Regarding the more stringent castration

level, the serum testosterone concentration suppression was comparable to the results in the published 
literature. 
The serum PSA levels decreased along the two doses of LMIS 50 mg until the end of the study in 
majority of the cases in both ITT and PP Populations (at baseline median 8.3 ng/mL, range 0.06-
2748.4 and at end of study (EOS) median 0.23 ng/mL, range 0.06-633.5 in the ITT population). 
The serum LH levels followed the known course of acute and transient increase after the first dose of 
LMIS 50 mg decreasing thereafter below the baseline except for the slight and transient increase after 
the second dose decreasing thereafter to low level until the EOS. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No comparative studies or bioequivalence studies have been performed, and only published data on 
Eligard 50 mg is used as a reference. 
The clinical characteristics of patients included in the clinical studies for LMIS 50 mg and Eligard 45 mg 
differ to some extent from each other e.g., by stage distribution, even though the inclusion criteria 
were relatively similar. However, this is not expected to hamper the assessment of the primary 
endpoint, i.e., the testosterone suppression, but may have influence on secondary endpoints, e.g., PSA 
levels.  
The PSA recurrence was reported in a subset of patients with slight to significant increases of mean 
PSA levels towards the end of the study. Due to lack of information (PSA values) it is not possible to 
deem how many patients actually developed castration resistant disease during the study.  
Median serum testosterone concentration-time profiles were lower in Asian subjects compared to 
non-Asian subjects. However, there were only five Asian patients, and no conclusions based on these 
few patients can be drawn.  
The efficacy (and safety) data in patients with renal impairment/insufficiency and treated with LMIS 50 
mg is very limited. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the main FP01C-13-001 study, the AEs were reported at a rate consistent with those reported in the 
labelling of Eligard 45 mg (SmPC Eligard, 2019) and in the published literature: the most common 
TEAEs were hot flush (48.9%), hypertension (14.6%), pain in extremity (9.5%), injection site pain 
(7.3%), arthralgia (6.6%), fatigue (6.6%), nocturia (5.8%), back pain (5.1%), and nasopharyngitis 
(5.1%), and the most common drug related AEs were hot flush (48.2%), injection site pain (7.3%) 
and fatigue (5.8%). Reported local skin reactions to the injection were mild or moderate in severity 
and were resolved by the end of study. The most common drug-related AEs were hot flush, injection 
site pain, and fatigue. With regard to the severity of reported AEs, most AEs were mild or moderate. 
The most common TEAEs that became more frequent during the safety extension period compared 
with the main study were acute kidney injury, blood triglycerides increased, dehydration, dizziness, 
fall, and fatigue, which occurred in two patients each (6.67%). The AEs that remained the most 
prominent during the extension period were hypertension and dizziness. 
In addition, acute kidney injury was seen in 2.19% and 6.67% in Studies FP01C-13-001 and FP01C-
13-001-EX, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567396/2022

Overall, nine patients had 15 outlier QTcF responses (QTcF ≥ 500 msec, or QTcF ≥ 480 msec with 
dQTcF ≥ 60 msec, or both); leuprorelin treatment was initially regarded as the probable cause in five 
patients. However, after reanalysis only 1 case was ascribed to leuprorelin therapy.  
SAEs occurred in 20 patients (14.6%), and no more than three of the SAEs were drug-related. In 
addition, there were three deaths of which none was drug-related. No deaths occurred during the 
extension study. 
Treatment was discontinued in 10.9% of subjects. Of the discontinued subjects 3.6% discontinued the 
study due to adverse events. 
In the literature-based data, cardiac events were highlighted among the SAEs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No comparative PD/efficacy/safety studies were performed with LMIS 50 mg, which hampers 
assessments. The study population was rather heterogeneous regarding previous medical histories, 
prostate cancer disease extent, previous anticancer therapies and regarding prostate cancer trajectory. 
Due to limited study size, definitive conclusions about safety findings in special populations are difficult 
to make. However, taking into account the long clinical use of leuprorelin products, these issues will 
not be pursued further.  
The safety data in patients with renal impairment/insufficiency and treated with LMIS 50 mg is very 
limited. 
The higher than expected number of acute kidney injury cases can be related to enrolment of patients 
with risk factors for renal failure. However, these were not regarded as drug-related. 
No cases of anaemia were reported in the main study, although in the literature, anaemia, including 
serious cases, was reported with incidence “common”. The narratives of the SAEs contain only limited 
information. 
No safety data is available on the use of Camcevi when used in association with prostatic irradiation, as 
prostatic radiotherapy was listed among contraindications. Further, no data on administration errors 
when compared to other formulations of Leuprorelin were provided.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The clinical benefit of the new leuprorelin mesilate formulation is the new simpler method of 
administration. The active substance leuprorelin mesilate has the same therapeutic targets as all 
leuprorelin acetate formulations already on market. 
A single-arm clinical study (FP01C-13-001) was conducted with LMIS 50 mg for evaluation of the PK, 
PD, efficacy, and safety. No bioequivalence study was conducted.  
The essential bridge demonstrating that the effect of LMIS 50 mg on the biological markers (i.e., 
suppression of testosterone levels testosterone, LH and PSA), typical of ADT was similar to that 
described in the published literature/clinical studies on Eligard45 mg has been made. The bridging was 
supported by the non-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic findings.  
The in vitro release data can only be considered as supportive for the bridge due to the complex 
formulation of the products. 
Concomitant treatment with radiation therapy other than for pain control was not allowed. Such design 
choices limit inference on relative efficacy, safety or commodity of Camcevi when compared to other 
commercially available formulations of leuprorelin.

Easy administration of the depot injection can be of help in avoiding medication errors (probably 
mainly leading to insufficient dosages). However, the absence of comparative data limits the safety 
inference for LMIS 50 mg in particular on-site administration-related adverse events and 
administration errors. Yet, as was verified in the trial. no difference will be expected on the adverse 
event profile attributable to the imposed modification of the hormonal milieu of patients.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
This hybrid application for LMIS 50 mg is based on bridging to the reference product (EU) Eligard 45 
mg. 
The PK simulations indicate that use of LMIS 50 does not result in intolerable exposures or peak 
concentrations. The PK-profile of LMIS 50 mg seems comparable with the referenced leuprorelin depot 
formulations. In the clinical study of LMIS 50, the efficacy endpoints (the biomarkers indicating 
successful ADT) have been met.   
The safety profile seems comparable to the RefMP and with published literature. Some class effects, 
such as QT prolongation remain as safety issues to be monitored. No entirely new safety concerns 
have been identified. 
The bridge built between the reference product EU-Eligard 45 mg and LMIS 50 mg to allow reference 
to the originator’s pre-clinical and clinical data has been deemed acceptable.   
Based on information provided it can be summarised that the administration of LMIS 50 mg resulted in 
suppression of testosterone below the castrate levels. The pharmacodynamic results obtained with 
LMIS 50 mg were comparable to those obtained by Eligard 45 mg.  
The provided real-time in vitro release data can only be considered as supportive for the bridge 
between LMIS 50 mg and the reference medicinal product EU-Eligard 45 mg due the complex 
formulation of the products; the serum concentrations of leuprorelin were similar after s.c. 
administration of LMIS 50 mg (#FP01C-13-001) and Eligard 45 mg (published data for #AGL-0205), 
which is considered as supportive data for the bridge. 
In conclusion, bridging has been sufficiently demonstrated based on the pharmacodynamic responses 
of testosterone suppression, supported by in vitro release characteristics, non-clinical findings, and 
clinical pharmacokinetic findings.  
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Leuprorelin mesilate 50 mg for the treatment for the treatment of hormone 
dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced 
hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

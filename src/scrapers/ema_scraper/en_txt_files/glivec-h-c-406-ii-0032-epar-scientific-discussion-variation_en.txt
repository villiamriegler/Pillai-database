SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
Imatinib  is  a  protein-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  which  inhibits  the  Abl  tyrosine  kinase  at  the  in  vitro, 
cellular and in vivo level. The compound specifically inhibits proliferation of v-ABL and BCR-ABL 
expressing  cells.  In  addition,  imatinib  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
receptors  (PDGFR)  α  and  β,  c-kit,  the  receptor  for  stem  cell  factors  (SCF),  c-Fms,  the  receptor  for 
macrophage-stimulatin factors (M-CSF), as well as the ABL and Arg PTK. Imitanib also inhibits the 
cell signalling events mediated by activation of BCR-ABL, c-Kit and the PDGF receptors. 
This is an extension of the indications for Glivec, to include: 
“Adult  patients  with  myelodysplastic  syndrom/myeloproliferative  diseases  (MDS/MPD) 
associated with PDGFR gene rearrangements” 
The proposed posology would be 400 mg daily, the recommended dose for patients in chronic phase 
CML  and  GIST.  Dose  escalations  up  to  800  mg/day  are  foreseen  in  the  indications  currently 
authorised, but are not considered for the proposed new indication.  
The  COMP  granted  Glivec the  orphan  status  for MDS/MPD on 10 November  2005. A Commission 
Decision was issued on 23 December 2005. 
3.2.  2.   Toxico-pharmacological aspects  
A  detailed  knowledge  of  imatinib  is  available,  and  a  plausible  and  well  characterised    biological 
mechanism  is  available.  The  growth  inhibition  potency  of  Imatinib  in  cell  lines  expressing  ETV6-
PDGFRB  is  equivalent  to  those  expressing  ABL  (Carroll  M,  Ohno-Jones  S,  Tamura  S,  et  al.  CGP 
57148  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  inhibits  the  growth  of  cell  expressing  BCR-ABL,  TEL-ABL  and 
TEL-PDGFR fusion proteins. Blood 1997; 90:4947-52). There are also positive data on animal models 
with  the  specific  molecular  abnormality,  which  fit  with  the  proposed  mechanism  of  the  drug  action 
(Tomasson MH, Williams IR, Hasserjian R, et al. TEL/PDGFbR induces hematologic malignacies in 
mice that respond to a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Blood 1999; 93:1707-14). 
3.   Clinical aspects 
The  new  WHO  classification  includes  myeloid  disorders  that  have  both  dysplastic  and  proliferative 
features at the time of initial presentation and that are difficult to assign to either the myelodysplastic 
or myeloproliferative group of diseases. The  3  major disorders that constitute this group are chronic 
myelomonocytic  leukaemia  (CMML),  atypical  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (aCML)  and  juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Myeloid disease that shows features of both MDS and MPD but 
does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  any  of  the  3  major  MDS/MPD  entities  is  designated  as 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative  disease,  unclassifiable  (MD/MPD-U).  The  FAB  classification 
system for acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was replaced 
by  the  WHO  classification  for  leukaemias  and  lymphomas  during  the  main  study  submitted.  A  new 
category,  MDS/MPD,  emerged.  CMML  was  previously  classified  as  a  myelodysplastic  syndrome 
under the FAB scheme; however the WHO classification removed CMML from MDS, placing it in the 
new  category  MDS/MPD.  JMML  is  not  discussed  in  this  report,  as  the  applicant  only  claims  the 
indication in adults. 
Although  they  are  rare,  several  translocations  have  been  identified  in  CMML  and  aCML  patients. 
t(5;12) (q31;p12) and t(5;10)(q33;q22), which result in fusion proteins that enhance the tyrosine kinase 
activity of the receptor, PDGFRβ, and may lead to abnormal activation of the RAS pathway, as well as 
abnormal  regulation  of  other  signal  transduction  pathway.  The  most  common  abnormality  is  the 
t(5;12)(q31-33;p13),  which  fuses  the  ETV6/TEL  gene  to  the  PDGFRβ.  Other  reported  cytogenetic 
abnormalities involve the locus of PDGFRα.

Even though myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder associated with t (5;12) (q31;p12), has been 
claimed  to  be  a  unique  entity  by  some,  it  has  not  been  recognised  as  such,  and  most  patients  are 
reported to have CMML. It is usually accompanied by marked eosinophilia. Cases with eosinophilia 
associated with other rearrangements of the TEL gene have also been reported. 
Survival  times  vary  markedly  for  patients  with  MDS/MPD,  and  can  range  from  months  to  years, 
depending on the individual disease. The survival of patients with CMML is reported to vary from 1 to 
more than  100  months,  but the  median  survival time  in  most  series is 12-40  months. Progression to 
acute leukaemia occurs in approximately 15-30 % of cases. Median survival times reported for aCML 
are less than 20 months. The prognosis for MDS/MPD U is not known. Several prognostic factors for 
both aCML and CMML have been identified. The percentage of blood and bone marrow blasts are the 
most  important  factors  in  determining  survival.  The  specific  course  of  haematological  diseases 
associated  to  PDGFR  rearrangements  is  even  harder  to  predict.  In  a  series  of  34  cases  associated  to 
PDGFR  rearrangements  with  a  myeloproliferative  disorder  that,  according  to  the  authors,  could  be 
classified in the category of MP/MDS, only a minority of patients transformed to acute leukaemia with 
a variable latency.  
The incidence of MDS/MPD is not well known either, and it varies regarding the specific subgroup. 
There are no reliable incidence  data for CMML,  because  in  some  epidemiologic  surveys, CMML is 
grouped with CML and in others as a MDS. It can range from as many as 3/100,000 individuals over 
the  age  of  60  annually  for  the  most  common  disorder,  CMML,  to  as  few  as  0.13/100,000  children 
from  0-14  years  of  age  annually  for  JMML.  aCML  is  a  recently  defined  entity,  and  reliable  data 
concerning its incidence are not available. However, in some series, it is reported to be only 1-2 cases 
for every 100 cases of Ph+, BCR/ABL+ CML. The incidence of MDS/MPD U is unknown. Regarding 
the incidence of MDS/MPD associated  with  PDGFR rearrangement, data are  even  scarcer, probably 
because  cytogenetics  or  FISH  are  not  always  determined.  The  translocation  with  t(5;12)  (q31;p12) 
seems to occur in fewer than 1-2 % patients with CMML. Cytogenetics abnormalities, including +8, 
+13,  del  (20q),  i(17q)  and  del  (12p),  are  found  in  up  to  80%  of    patients  with  aCML,  but  none  is 
specific.    The  incidence  of  PDGFR  rearrangements  in  aCML  is  unknown,  although  sporadic  cases 
have been reported in the literature. 
The median age at diagnosis of CMML is 65 to 75 years, with a male predominance of 1.5 to 3.1. In 
the few series reported to date, the median age at diagnosis for aCML is in the seventh or eight decade 
of life. 
Due  to  the  recent  creation  of  the  WHO  classification,  no  chemotherapy  is  yet  authorised  for  the 
MDS/MPD  indication  or  for  MDS/MPD  associated  with  PDGFR  rearrangements.  Treatments  are 
usually tailored depending on patient’s characteristics. Bone marrow transplantation appears to be the 
only  current  treatment  that  alters  the  natural  course  of  CMML.  Various  chemotherapy  regimens  for 
CMML  have  been  used  with  only  modest  success.  Hydroxyurea  is  used  in  CMML  to  control 
hematopoietic proliferation, especially when a rapid decline in leucocytes is required. Median actuarial 
survival  for  hydroxiurea  (major  endpoint)  was  20  months  in  a  randomized  controlled  trial  against 
etoposide (versus 9 months). Response to treatment was seen in 60% of the patients in the hydroxiurea 
arm. Several clinical trials with 5-azacitidine, etoposide, topotecan, idarubicin, in particular indications 
such as CMML or aCML have been or are being performed (including an ongoing phase II study with 
imatinib  currently  enrolling  patients  with  CMML).  In  a  clinical  trial,  25  patients  with  CMML  were 
treated with topotecan. Complete haematological remissions were induced in 28% of patients. Toxic 
effects  were  significant,  and  the  median  duration  of  remission  was  8  months.  In  a  follow-up  study, 
where topotecan was used in combination with cytarabine, the combination regimen induced complete 
remission in 44% of patients with CMML; median duration of complete response was 50 weeks, and 
patients required monthly maintenance therapy. The optimal treatment for aCML is uncertain because 
of  its  rare  incidence.  Treatment  with  hydroxyurea  may  lead  to  short-lived  partial  remissions,  and  it 
only responds poorly to interferon-α.

A  pharmacokinetic  study  report  related  to  the  correlation  between  clinical  response  and  plasma 
exposure was provided. Due to the limited sample size per indication the correlation between clinical 
response  and  plasma  exposure  was  carried  out  by  using  the  clinical  responses  pooled  together  from 
patients in different indications and the plasma AUC or trough exposure following the first dose and at 
steady  state.  Unfortunately,  due  to  the  amount  of  missing  data  no  clear  correlation  between  clinical 
response and imatinib plasma exposure was observed in the present study. 
3. 2.   Clinical efficacy 
The extension of indication is mainly based on a subset of the results of study B2225, which included 
185  patients  with  various  malignancies  possibly  associated  with  imatinib-sensitive  kinases,  out  of 
which  7  patients  were  classified  as  presenting  a  “Myeloproliferative  disorder”  and  the  information 
collected from 24 patients obtained from the literature (13 published case reports and a clinical study).  
An ongoing phase II study (AUS19) is currently enrolling patients with CMML.  
Study  B2225  was  an  open-label,  non-randomized,  uncontrolled,  single  arm  study  evaluating  the 
efficacy and  safety in patients suffering from  different life-threatening  diseases associated  with Abl, 
Kit  or  PDGFR  PTK  and  refractory  to  standard  therapeutic  options  or  for  which  no  conventional 
therapies of definitive benefit existed. 
Methods 
Patients were eligible to receive imatinib treatment in this study, provided they had a malignant, life-
threatening disease (solid or haematological malignancies) and the disease was refractory to standard 
therapeutic options or no conventional therapies of definitive benefit existed. No specific target groups 
are further described in the inclusion criteria obtained from the clinical study report or study protocol. 
As stated in the clinical study report, this trial was intended to establish proof of concept of activity of 
imatinib to support hypotheses for future clinical trials. Small cohorts of patients were initially treated 
and  then expanded if  clinical benefit was observed.  Five  to ten patients per indication, condition, or 
disease were to be initially enrolled. If evaluation of the results of the first five patients suggested a 
positive effect of imatinib, additional patients with the same disease could be enrolled into the study in 
order to enable adequate evaluation of imatinib effects. 
Patients  with  myeloproliferative  diseases  became  a  target  group.  The  FAB  classification  system  for 
acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was replaced during the 
study  for  the  WHO  classification  for  leukaemias  and  lymphomas.  The  category,  to  which  the 
indication pursued by the MAH belongs (MD/MPD), emerged from this revision. 
As stated in the clinical study report, experimental confirmation of imatinib-sensitive target expression 
was planned to be confirmed before study entry when possible.

All safety and efficacy evaluations were performed on patients who received at least one dose of study 
medication. 
Due to the exploratory design of the study, the analysis is only descriptive. 
 The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  the  preliminary  assessment  of  imatinib  activity.  Primary 
evidence of activity was recorded as the investigator’s assessment of a patient’s tumour response. The 
clinical  trial  did  not  specifically  distinguish  between  haematological  (blood  count  and  bone  marrow 
assessments) and cytogenetic response as primary or secondary efficacy end-point, but haematological 
response was always used as primary end-point. Specific criteria to determine the efficacy of imatinib 
on  MDS/MPD  patients  were  not  prospectively  defined.  The  response  to  treatment  was  assessed  as 
normalization of the blood count and of bone marrow appearance – a classical definition -, as well as 
cytogenetic analysis, but no definition of efficacy assessment parameters is provided.  
Still regarding the primary objectives, according to the study report, all evaluations for an individual 
patient were made according to planned criteria and preferably by the same technique and radiologist.  
Secondary  objectives  included  assessing  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  imatinib  in  these  populations, 
and to evaluate pharmacokinetic profile of imatinib in selected patients. Where feasible, it was planned 
to  assess  the  functional  significance  of  relevant  signal-transduction  components.  The  defined 
secondary endpoint in study B2225 was the ECOG status.

Details  of  the  history  of  patients  with  myeloproliferative  diseases  are  limited  due  to  missing  data. 
Information  regarding  initial  stage  of  the  disease  at  diagnosis  is  lacking  in  6  out  of  the  7  patients, 
while  there  is  information  lacking  in  5  out  of  the  7  patients  regarding  time  since  first  recurrence  or 
progression and time since most recent recurrence or progression.  
No  prior  surgical  procedure  (including  biopsy),  was  performed  on  patients  with  myeloproliferative 
symptoms.  
Prior antineoplastic medications are reported in 5 patients (5 patients had received hydroxicarbamide- 
adjuvant or therapeutic setting-, one patient had received busulfan and one patient had received alpha-
interferon). Prior antineoplastic radiotherapy is reported in a single patient.  
Dosing and exposure. 
Patients with myeloproliferative symptoms received an initial dose of 400 mg daily and treatment was 
continued  for  as  long  as,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  the  patient  derived  benefit  from  therapy 
and in the absence of any safety concern. The mean dose in the myeloproliferative disorder group was 
433.1 ± 275.36 (median 395.7, ranging 50.8-880.5). One patient started treatment at 800 mg daily and 
required  a  dose  reduction  to  200  mg.  The  dose  was  escalated  to  1000  mg  from  400  mg  in  200  mg 
increases  in  one  patient  and  to  800  mg  in  another  patient.  The  recommended  starting  dose  was 
changed in amendment 01 from 400 mg to 800 mg/daily, with no specific mention to malignancy.   
The  duration  of  exposure  was  under  5  months  in  2  patients;  between  5-15  months  in  2  patients; 
between 20-25 months is 2 patients and over 25 months in one patient.  
Regarding the whole population of the study, dosing errors affected 37 patients (20%), including one 
patient belonging to the myeloproliferative disease group. 
Efficacy results 
Activity  was  assessed  by  evaluating  changes  in  blood  counts  (haematological  response).The  best 
overall  responses  for  patients  with  MDS/MPD  and  best  haematological  response  and  duration  of 
response are summarised in tables 3 and 4. 
As it has been already mentioned, complete response was not prospectively defined.

In  the  group  of  seven  patients  with  MDS/MPD,  response  was  not  assessable  in  2  patients.  The 
peripheral blood count of patient 201/089 never normalized throughout the treatment and the patient 
was  finally  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  pancytopenia.  Patient  901/139  was  withdrawn 
because of unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Of the other patients, one experienced PD, one patient had 
PR and the remaining 3 patients achieved a CR, for an overall response rate of 57% (95% C.I. 18 – 
90). 
Three patients had PDGFR rearrangements, all of which had a  haematological response (2CR and 1 
PR). 
The median duration of therapy was 12.9 months with a range of 24 days to 812 days. All responding 
patients were still on treatment and in response at the last visit.  
In the MDS/MPD population of patients, the ECOG performance status did not change substantially, 
with  two  patients  having  worsened  ECOG  at  the  end  of  the  study  and  two  patients  improving  their 
ECOG at the end of study from 1 and 3 respectively to ECOG 0. 
Cytogenetic response was not evaluated in study B2225. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The  new  indication  application  only  includes  the  treatment  of  adults.  No  children  were  included  in 
study B2225.  
The  case  of  a  two  2-year  old  girl  with  a  MD/MPD  with  t(1:5)(q23:q33)  refractory  to  etoposide, 
cytarabine and interferon is reported. Complete haematological and cytogenetic response are reported.  
The  case  of  another  2-year  old  girl  with  aCML  is  reported.  A  translocation  t(5:12)(q33:p13)  was 
reported.  Only  partial  responses  had  been  obtained  by  other  treatments  (hydroxiurea).  Complete 
haematological  response  is  reported  and  bone  marrow  transplant  was  performed.  The  girl  died  of 
transplant-related complications.  
OTHER SOURCES OF EFFICACY DATA 
In  addition  to  the  clinical  study  described,  the  MAH  has  submitted  13  published  case  reports  and  a 
clinical study including a total of 24 patients (6 classified as MDS/MPD, 4 classified as CMML and 11 
classified as aCML). 
The  published  case  reports,  as  well  as  the  clinical  study,  did  not  specifically  distinguish  between 
haematological  and  cytogenetic  response  as  primary  or  secondary  efficacy  end-point,  but 
haematological response was always used as primary end-point. 
The  response  to  treatment  was  not  only  assessed  as  normalization  of  the  blood  count  and  of  bone 
marrow  appearance,  but  also  as  cytogenetic  analysis,  FISH  analysis  for  detection  of  PDGFR 
rearrangement and PCR analysis for its characterization.

Apperley et al. (2002) provide information about four patients; two of these patients (number 2 and 4 of the publication) are 
presented in study B2225. 
The  specific  diagnosis  of  the  patients  included  under  the  category  MDS/MPD  by  the  applicant  are 
chronic myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myeloproliferative disease, which are not specified in 
accordance with the current WHO classification.  
The durability of response is not fully characterized in all case reports, and it is not described in others. 
It seems to range between 18 months (Levine et. Al.) and 5 months (Grand et al.). The available data 
do not seem different among different case reports. 
Complete haematological response was achieved by 11 out of 24 patients. Eleven patients presented 
PDGFR rearrangements, 9 of them achieved a complete haematological response, 1 achieved a partial 
haematological response and results are unavailable by one of them.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The results obtained from the pooled population including the patients from study B2225 and from the 
published evidence, are a complete haematological response rate of 45% (95% CI 27-64), 14 out of 31 
patients;  (52%  including  partial  responses)  and  a  complete  cytogenetic  response  of  29%  (39% 
including major and partial responses). Of note, two out of these 14 patients were children, however, a 
paediatric indication has not been applied for.  
If the evaluation is limited to patients with known PDGFR gene re-arrangement or with a translocation 
known  to  be  linked  to  a  PDGFR  gene  re-arrangement,  the  benefit  is  higher:  all  13  patients  (100%) 
with  known  PDGFR  gene  re-arrangement  achieved  a  haematological  response  either  complete  (11 
patients) or partial (2 patients) and 11 out of the 11 patients (100%) who had a cytogenetic evaluation 
show a response, complete in 9, major in one and partial in another patient, a rarely if ever observed 
response rate. Again, two of these patients need to be excluded from the analysis (the two children).  
Cytogenetic response was not evaluated in the company’s study, but a complete cytogenetic response 
is reported in the two cases published by Apperley et al (2002). Considering the 31 patients treated, 12 
(39%)  achieved  a  cytogenetic  response  (two  of  them  were  children),  which  was  complete  in  nine 
patients (29%). 
To address the risk of a publication bias, a Meta-analysis Report of published papers and Study B2225 
efficacy  data  was  performed,  as  recommended  by  the  EMEA  at  the  pre-submission  meeting  on 
scientific advice (2004). Different descriptive analyses as well as statistical models were provided with 
data  for  study  B2225  and  pooled  data  for  published  results  up  to  October  2005  on  rare  malignant 
diseases treated with imatinib. Results from trial B2225 were not pooled with the published data. The 
pooled assessments (obtained via the adoption of Bayesian meta-analysis models) were presented side 
by  side  with  the  data  collected  from  the  trial.  The  results  from  trial  B2225  in  Myeloproliferative 
disease  group,  although  slightly  lower,  could  be  considered  consistent  with  the  published  results. 
However,  according  to  the  funnel  plot  provided,  the  possible  effect  of  a  publication  bias  can  not  be 
discharged. The upper limit of the 95 % CI for overall efficacy rate of the study B2225 (best scenario 
for  the  sponsor’s  trial)  is  below  the  point  estimate  of  the  overall  globally  pooled  estimate  for  the 
published data, indicating that any conclusion with regard to the similitude of the results could not be 
supported from the results of the report. 
Supplementary published data 
Further  prospective  clinical  data  from  published  studies  were  provided  to  confirm  the  preliminary 
results from the phase II, exploratory study B2225.  
The following new data has been supplied in this response document: 
-  A manuscript recently published in Blood (David et al. Blood. 2006 Sep 7; [Epub ahead of print]), 
which  provides  information  from  7  new  patients  with  Philadelphia  negative  CMPDs  and 
reciprocal translocations involving PDGFR. Additionally, updates on 5 of their patients and on 8 
other  patients  treated  at  different  institutions,  all  of  which  had  been  included  in  the  original 
submission, are included in this manuscript.  
David’s  patients  had  been  treated  with  imatinib  for  a  median  of  47  months  (range  0.1-60  months). 
Eleven  out  of  these  12  patients  presented  a  normalization  of  blood  count  and  ten  had  a  cytogenetic 
response with a decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by RT-PCR. According to 
the authors, haematological responses have been sustained for a median of 49 months (range 19-60) 
and cytogenetical responses are reported to last for a median of 47 months (range 16-59). The median 
OS from diagnosis was 65 months (range 25-234). 
Seven  out  of  the  8  patients  treated  at  other  institutions,  were  reported  to  achieve  haematological 
remissions or complete responses, which last in 6 of them (follow-up ranging from 6 to 38 months). 
One  of  these  patients  died  after  bone  marrow  transplant  after  achieving  a  complete  cytogenetic 
response  and  another  failed  to  respond  to  imatinib  but  achieved  a  durable  complete  haematological 
response while on hydroxiurea. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Results  from  4  patients  with  CMML  with  PDGFR  rearrangements  from  ongoing  study 
CSTI571AUS19  have  also  been  reported.  Of  these  four  patients,  two  of  them  responded  to 
imatinib, one responded for only two months and had his CMML progress to acute leukaemia and 
the fourth patient never responded. 
Due to the rarity of the disease, the MAH proposes to set up a global registry in order to monitor the 
efficacy,  long  term  impact  and  safety  of  imatinib  in  this  subset  of  patients.  Responses  would  be 
characterised  by  peripheral  blood  count  normalisation,  bone  marrow  evaluation,  cytogenetic 
abnormalities and RNA transcripts by RT-PCR. 
The MAH commits to submit longer term follow-up data on all patients to the CHMP, as it becomes 
available. 
Clinical safety 
The  application  for  this  new  indication  is  based  on  study  B2225,  which  included  185  patients  with 
various  malignancies  possibly  associated  with  imatinib-sensitive  kinases  (45  of  them  suffered  an 
haematological  malignancy,  out  of  which  7  patients  were  classified  as  presenting  a 
“Myeloproliferative  disorder”, ).  Additional evidence, a  clinical study  and  13  published  case reports 
(24 patients more), have been presented for this indication. 
Due  to  the  few  patients  with  myeloproliferative  disease  and  the  well  established  safety  profile  of  a 
drug approved since 2001 in myeloid hematological malignancies and solid tumours; the safety of the 
whole  population  enrolled  will  be  considered,  as  well  as  the  safety  of  the  7  patients  with 
myeloproliferative  disease  enrolled.  Regardless  of  the  possibility  of  bias  in  the  case  reports,  the 
available information was taken into account. 
Safety  was  assessed  by  collecting  reports  of  deaths,  SAEs  and  AEs,  laboratory  data  (standard 
hematology,  biochemistry  and  urinalysis)  and  data  on  vital  signs,  weight,  ECG  and  physical 
examinations.  Safety  variables  consisted  of  AEs  related  or  not  to  study  drugs  and  of  laboratory 
parameters, classified according to NCI common toxicity criteria. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  185  patients  suffering  from  different  diseases  associated  with  ABL,  Kit  or  PDGFR  PTK 
were  treated  with  imatinib  in  study  B2225  at  doses  between  200  and  1000  mg  daily.  Twenty-five 
patients were treated for more than 1 year and seven patients for more than 2 years. Patient exposure is 
summarised in the following table.

Withdrawals and dose reductions 
Out  of  7  patients  with  MDS/MPD,  treatment  was  completed  in  three  patients,  was  discontinued  in 
three  patients  and  was  still  ongoing  at  cut-off  date  in  one  of  them.  The  reasons  for  discontinuing 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment  were  unsatisfactory  response  in  one  patient  and  drug-related  AEs  in  two  of  them.  One  of 
these  patients  presented  a  grade  1  pancytopenia.  This  patient  also  developed  a  grade  3  neutropenia. 
The  other  patient  developed  a  grade  4  arthralgia  and  grade  2  cramps  suspected  to  be  related  to  the 
study drug. 
Considering all patients from study B2225, out of the 40 patients (21.6%) who discontinued the drug 
due to AEs, 21 (11.4%) did so because of drug-related events, of CTC grade 3 or 4 in severity in 11 
cases (6%).  
The most frequent AEs leading to dose adjustment were gastrointestinal AEs, both in the solid tumor 
and hematological malignancies (nausea in 21.4% and 15.6% of cases, vomiting in 17.1% and 8.9%, 
diarrhea in 7.1% and 4.4%, respectively). Rash also induced dose reductions in 7.9% of the patients 
with solid tumors while neutropenia (8.9%) and anemia (6.7%) were the other two leading causes of 
dose adjustment in patients with hematological malignancies. 
Adverse events 
Pooling of data was not performed with results of other studies. All patients exposed to more than 1 
dose of study treatment were pooled to examine the incidence rate of deaths and SAEs, the affected 
body systems, type of underlying event and suspected drug relatedness. 
All patients, both in the haematology and in the solid tumour group, experienced at least one AE.  
All patients in the haematology group and 91.5 % (128 patients) in the solid tumour group experienced 
an “AE suspected to be drug related”.

In  the  overall  population  of  185,  four  patients  experienced  drug-related  vascular  events  (2.2%),  all 
CTC  grade  1  in  severity.  Cardiac  disorders  were  considered  SAEs  in  four  cases  (2.2%).  No 
cardiovascular disorder was reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease. 
Renal and urogenital system 
A total of three patients (1.6%) experienced AEs that were considered drug-related, and in two cases 
(1.0%)  were  of  CTC  grade  3  or  4  severity.  In  one  case  treatment  was  withdrawn  because  of  drug-
related grade 3 creatinine increase.  
One MDS/MPD patient presented a grade 2 renal tubular disorder, which was considered unrelated to 
the study drug but was classified as an SAE. 
Hepatic system 
Three patients (1.6%) were withdrawn from treatment because of elevated liver enzymes, considered 
drug-related in two cases. No SAE affecting the hepatobiliary system was reported. No hepatic system 
disorders were observed in patients belonging to the myeloproliferative group. 
Blood and lymphatic system 
The frequency of AEs was higher in the haematological malignancies group than in the solid tumour 
group. A total of 35 AEs were considered drug-related, most of them grade 1 or 2. The most frequent 
grade  3  haematological  AE  was  lymphocytopenia  (11.9%)  and  the  most  frequent  grade  4 
haematological  AE  was  neutropenia  (2.7%).  Neutropenia  (grade  3  or  4)  was  more  common  in 
10 
 
 
 
haematological malignancies (8.8% vs. 3.5% in solid tumours), while grade 3 lymphopenia was more 
evenly distributed (15.6% vs. 10.7% in solid tumours).  
Haematological  AEs  led  to  drug  discontinuation  in  four  cases,  in  one  case  for  grade  3  drug-related 
granulocytopenia, in one case for grade 3 drug-related anaemias and in one patient for grade 1 drug-
related pancytopenia. Blood and lymphatic disorders were considered SAEs in 11 patients. 
Four  MDS/MPD  patients  presented  six  haematological  AEs;  of  those,  two  were  SAEs:  one  patient 
presented a grade 2 anaemia and another patient presented a grade 3 febrile neutropenia, although both 
were considered unrelated to the study drug. 
Gastrointestinal system 
A  total  136  patients  (73.5%)  experienced  gastrointestinal  system  disorders  of  any  cause,  the  most 
frequently observed being nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. Of those, 13 patients (7.0%) experienced 
grade 3 AEs and one patient grade 4 severity. A total of 27 patients experienced SAEs involving this 
system organ class. 
Six patients with myeloproliferative disease presented gastrointestinal AE. All of them were grade 1 or 
2 and none led to drug discontinuation. 
Nervous system 
A total of 37 patients (20.0%) experienced AEs that were considered drug-related; all grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There  were  23  deaths  (12.4%)  reported  in  the  overall  population  enrolled  in  study  B2225  during 
treatment  or  up  to  28  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  None  of  these  deaths  were 
considered to be related to study drug. 
No  patient  with  MDS/MPD  died  on  study.  A  patient  died  of  pseudomona  aeruginosa  infection 
approximately 3 months later.  
A total of 79 patients (42.7%) experienced at least one SAE, the most frequent being gastrointestinal 
(27 patients – 14.6%) or respiratory (26 patients – 14.1%).  
No treatment related SAEs were reported in the seven MDS/MPD patients enrolled in Study B2225. 
Four  patients  experienced  non  related,  non  fatal  SAEs.  Patient  201/004  had  a  pseudomonas  wound 
infection,  patient  201/089  had  fever,  skin  rash,  fungal  infection  and  renal  tubular  damage,  patient 
801/45 had a gluteal abscess and febrile neutropenia and patient 901/139 had a left pre-tibial laceration 
and anemia, as seen in Study B2225. 
As expected from a short-term follow up, no second malignancies were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
Most of the chemistry abnormalities were CTC grade 3 with four instances of CTC grade 4 events in 
the overall population: two cases for creatinine (1%), one for alkaline phosphatase (0.5%) and one for 
AST (0.5%).  There  was no difference between the two main  populations of patients in frequency of 
events regardless of CTC grade, with the exception of creatinine increase, which was more severe in 
patients  with  solid  tumors  (two  CTC  grade  4  instances)  than  in  patients  with  hematological 
malignancies (two CTC grade 3 instances). 
In MD/MPD patients, there was only one instance of CTC grade 3 ALT increase. 
Five  patients  (2.7%)  were  withdrawn  from  study  because  of  laboratory  abnormalities  or  because  of 
events  related  to  laboratory  abnormalities.  One  patient  was  prematurely  withdrawn  from  treatment 
following  grade  3  elevation  of  creatinine  which  was  suspected  to  be  drug  induced;  another  patient 
presented  anemia  and  recurrence  of  hypoalbuminemia,  which  the  investigator  suspected  to  be  drug 
related; and three patients were prematurely withdrawn because of elevated liver function tests, in two 
of these cases it was considered to be drug related.

Safety in special populations 
Women  of  child-bearing  potential  were  advised  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  and  to  use  effective 
contraception during treatment (study B2225). No cases of pregnancies were reported, nor were there 
cases of partners of male patients becoming pregnant. 
Among  the  published  case  reports  submitted  as  evidence  for  the  indication  of  MDS/MPD,  two  case 
reports describe the use of imatinib in two 2-year old girls. In both case reports, information is focused 
on efficacy and further patient safety data are not provided.  
Other sources of data 
The  applicant  provided  a  summary  of  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSUR).  On  the  basis  of  the 
CHMP assessment on the PSUR 6, received in September 2005, the following signals should continue 
to be monitored: myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral ischemia, Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
pulmonary  hypertension,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  worsening  of  ulcerative  colitis  and  Chron’s 
disease,  deafness,  hypoacusia,  thrombocythemia,  hemolytic  anemia,  disseminated  intravascular 
coagulation,  Parkinson’s  disease,  suicide  attempt,  nephrolithiasis/renal  colic,  scleroderma,  glucose 
metabolism  disorders,  and  arthritis.  In  addition,  a  culmulative  review  of 
the  cases  of 
cardiomegaly/cardiomyopathy,  hepatic  necrosis/cirrhosis, 
rhabdomyolysis/myopathy/  myositis, 
nephritic syndrome, hydronephrosis, proteinuria, cataracts, blindness and allergic reactions should be 
included in the next PSUR. 
Results from a preclinical rat carcinogenicity study have been included in a preclinical safety update 
of  the  SPC.  The  analysis  of  clinical  safety  data  from  clinical  trials  and  spontaneous  adverse  event 
reports  have  not  provided  evidence  for  an  increased  overall  incidence  of  malignancies  or  in  the 
incidence of bladder, kidney or prostate tumors in patients treated with imatinib compared to that of 
the general population. 
Out  of  the  14  cases  of  MDS/MPD  reported  in  the  literature,  three  patients  (21%)  experienced  AEs, 
with  one  patient  described  by  Vizmanos  et  al  (2004)  not  tolerating  the  400 mg/day  dose  (AE  not 
specified),  one  patient  described  by  Pardanani  et  al  (2003a)  as  experiencing  profound  fatigue  and 
weight loss when treated with 400 mg/day imatinib  and one patient described by Grand et al (2004) 
developing CTC grade 4 neutropenia after 36 days of treatment while receiving 400 mg/day imatinib. 
This  event  evolved  in  four  episodes  of  transient  cytopenia  despite  dose  reduction  to  300 mg/day. 
Imatinib  might  have  played  a  role  in  the  neutropenia  and  transient  cytopenia  in  the  later  case.  No 
further  safety observations were  reported  in the  other published cases. An  overview  of the  safety of 
imatinib in 48 patients with a variety of hematological malignancies expressing either Kit or PDGFR 
including ten patients with MDS/MPD is given in Cortes et al (2003). The authors report that the most 
common side effect was fatigue (n = 30, 63%), CTC grade 3 in one case (2%). Other toxicities (≥ CTC 
grade 3) included bone pain, fluid retention (two cases each, 4%), nausea and dyspepsia in 1 case each 
(2%). The overall rate of adverse event is not provided. 
Three cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated with the initiation 
of  imatinib  therapy  in  patients  with  hypereosinophilic  syndrome  (HES)  and  cardiac  involvement 
(Pardanani et al, 2003a, Pitini et al 2003b). This is particularly important since MDS/MPD associated 
with PDGFR rearrangements frequently associates with eosinophilia. The condition was reported to be 
reversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily 
holding of imatinib. No cases as such were reported in study B2225 MDS/MPD patients. 
Overall discussion and Benefit-risk assessment 
The  proposed  indication  affects  a  malignant  disease  with  limited  therapeutic  options.  Bone  marrow 
transplant  is  the  only  treatment  that  can  change  the  natural  course  of  the  disease.  Median  survival 
times in most series are 20-40 months. In this context, imatinib might be useful in patients that cannot 
benefit from a bone marrow transplant in the short term (e.g. induce remissions that could allow for a 
subsequent transplant with an acceptable safety profile). 
The  initial  dossier  presented  for  the  indication  of  imatinib  in  this  population  was  only  supported  by 
study  B2225,  a  phase  II,  exploratory,  open  label  study  (which  included  4  patients  with  a 
myeloproliferative  disease  and  a  PDGFR  rearrangement).  The  applicant  provided  11  publications, 
12 
 
including data from 12 patients as supportive evidence. The CHMP was particularly concerned by the 
extremely low quality of data from study B2225, the possibility of publication bias, the lack of long-
term  follow  up  and  the  absence  of  control  data  in  a  disease  with  an  extremely  variable  prognosis 
(survival  has  been  reported  to  range  from  1  to  more  than  a  150  months,  although  median  survival 
times are 20-40 months). 
The  clinical  trial  and  the  rest  of  the  evidence  presented  are  interesting,  and  the  results  obtained  are 
quite promising. As expected from such a small sample size, there is a marked heterogeneity among 
patients  (i.e.  age  20-86).  The  overall  response  rate  is  very  good,  57%,  but,  as  expected  from  such  a 
sample  size,  the  CI  are  too  wide  (95%  C.I.  18  –  90).  Even  though  the  primary  specifications  and 
definitions  were  vague  in  the  clinical  trial,  there  is  certain  uniformity  across  the  studies  and  case 
reports.  The  same  subrogate  primary  endpoint  is  used  in  the  publications  and  in  the  clinical  trial 
B2225,  and  there  is  a  secondary  endpoint  (cytogenetic  response),  which  is  present  in  some 
publications. In them, the patients are as heterogeneous as those of the clinical trial and for the most 
part,  they  were  refractory  to  first  line  treatments.  The  results  obtained  are  also  very  positive, 
particularly  regarding  cytogenetic  response,  seem  in  line  with  the  clinical  trial  findings  and  are 
consistent  with  the  biological  rationale  of  imatinib.  Nevertheless,  whether  these  results  are 
accompanied by survival benefit will need to be proved and the durability of the response remains also 
to be determined. 
Usual concerns intrinsic to this kind of evidence are present. A metanalysis performed by the applicant 
could not exclude the possibility of publication bias.  
The initial data provided did not allow to firmly establishing the effect of imatinib in the treatment of 
MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR rearrangements in terms of meaningful variables for the patient. 
In addition, due to the new WHO classification to which this indication applies, the comparison with 
historical controls might be misleading.  
The MAH acknowledged the exploratory nature of study B2225 and supplemented the dossier with a 
publication  which  includes  data  from  8  new  patients  and  longer  follow  ups  from  patients  already 
included  in  the  original  submission.  Response  rates  in  these  patients  are  compelling  and  similar  to 
those,  which  had  been  previously  reported.  Results  from  4  patients  with  CMML  with  PDGFR 
rearrangements from ongoing study CSTI571AUS19 are also provided in this document. 
The MAH proposed to set up a global registry in order to monitor the efficacy, long term impact and 
safety of imatinib in this subset of patients and compromises to submit longer term follow-up data on 
all  patients,  as  they  become  available.  Responses  would  be  characterised  by  peripheral  blood  count 
normalisation, bone marrow evaluation, cytogenetic abnormalities and RNA transcripts by RT-PCR.   
It is acknowledged that a registry might be the only way for data collection in a prospectively planned 
and  standardised  manner.  Imatinib’s  well-known  safety  profile,  the  strong  biological  basis,  the 
observed high response rates, the apparent durability of the response, the limited therapeutic options 
and the sometimes aggressive course of the disease are recognised and may outweigh the uncertainty 
about the true effect size. 
No  new  AE  were  identified  that  had  not  been  previously  described  and  imatinib  can  generally  be 
considered well tolerated. However, cardiogenic shock and left ventricular dysfunction is a potential 
adverse  event  in  patients  with  MDS/MPD  associated  with  PDGFR  rearrangements,  which  is 
frequently  accompanied  by  eosinophilia.  These  events  in  patients  with  MDS/MPD  associated  with 
PDGFR and eosinophilia will be specifically monitored. 
Even  though  MDS/MPD  is  a  heterogeneous  group  of  diseases  with  differential  characteristics  and 
diverse  prognosis,  PDGFR  is  an  interesting  potential  target  for  those  patients  with  MDS/MPD 
associated  with  PDGR  rearrangements.  This  possibility  is  especially  appealing  due  to  the  limited 
number  of  treatments  (especially  when  bone  marrow  transplant  is  not  an  option),  the  observed  high 
response rates, the apparent durability of response, the sometimes aggressive course of the disease and 
Glivec’s well-known and well-tolerated safety profile.

Although  no  robust  data  are  available  for  MDS/MPD  associated  with  PDGFR  rearrangements,  it 
seems clear that it is  an  extremely infrequent  disease in which  a  traditional  approach of randomised 
controlled trials is not feasible.  
In the context of a widely available medication, a registry, as proposed by the applicant, might be the 
only way to obtain data collection in a prospectively and standardised manner. 
Despite  the  limited  data  available,  imatinib  in  the  treatment  of  MDS/MPS  with  PDGFR 
rearrangements provides an acceptable benefit-risk profile. The MAH commits to provide additional

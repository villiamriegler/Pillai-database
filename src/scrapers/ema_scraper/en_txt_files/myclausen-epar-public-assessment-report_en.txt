2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Myclausen 500 mg film coated tablet is a generic medicinal product containing mycophenolate mofetil 
as active substance. 
The active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid (MPA), is a selective, 
noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, resulting in a potent 
inhibition of guanosine nucleotide synthesis. Due to its potent cytostatic effect on lymphocytes, the 
indication is in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant 
rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
The efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in randomised, double-blind 
comparative studies in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants, for 
prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection. A summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of 
CellCept. Since this is a generic application the pivotal basis is the demonstration of bioequivalence 
with the reference medicinal product. 
The indication proposed for mycophenolate mofetil is the same as authorized for the reference 
medicinal product CellCept. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Myclausen is presented as immediate release film coated tablets, containing 500 mg of mycophenolate 
mofetil as the active substance. 
Other ingredients are defined in the SPC section 6.1. 
The tablets are packaged in PVC/Alu blister packs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of mycophenolate mofetil is 2-(Morpholin-4-yl)ethyl (4E)-6-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxy-
7-methyl-3-oxo-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yl)-4-methylhex-4-enoate.  It  is  a  white  to  off-white,  not 
hygroscopic  crystalline  powder,  practically  insoluble  in  water.  Its  apparent  partition  coefficient  in  1-
octanol/water (pH 7.4) is 238. Its pKa is reported to be 5.6 for the morpholino group and 8.5 fior the 
mycophenolate moiety. It does not show polymorphism.  
Mycophenolate mofetil is described in Ph Eur. 
Manufacture 
A Certificate of Suitability (CEP) granted by the EDQM has been presented covering the manufacturing 
of the active substance  
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/592514/2010 
Page 5/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specification 
Mycophenolate mofetil is described in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur). The specification of the 
active substance as set up by the drug product manufacturer includes tests and limits for appearance, 
appearance of solution solubility, melting point, identity, assay, related substances, heavy metals, loss 
on drying, sulphated ash, residual solvents, particle size and microbial contamination. 
The drug substance specification of the drug product manufacturer is identical to the Ph. Eur. with 
additional requirements for residual solvents (Ph. Eur.), particle size (sieving) and microbial 
contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
Analytical test results of three batches of active substance have been presented and all comply with 
the specifications. 
Stability 
Mycophenolate mofetil is described in the Ph.Eur. and the provided CEP includes the re-test period. 
Therefore no further information is required. 
The re-test period and storage conditions of the drug substance are accepted.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
2.2.3.  Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The main objective of the formulation development work was to develop a formulation that is 
comparable in performance to the reference product Cellcept 
A discriminatory dissolution method for the determination of the release profile for release and stability 
purposes was developed.  
The active substance particle size has been shown to have no significant effect in dissolution. 
Comparative dissolution of two batches of reference products and one batch of Myclausen 
demonstrated that more than 85% of the drug substance is dissolved in 15 minutes, therefore the 
dissolution profiles can be considered as similar. 
Myclausen 500 mg tablets were manufactured by wet granulation. The process was developed and 
optimized based on experience gained during manufacturing of pilot and full scale batches. The 
different choices leading to the final manufacturing process were described.  
Comparative impurity profiles between the test and innovator batches are within the specification 
All the excipients used in the manufacture of Myclausen are well known and widely used as 
pharmaceutical excipients. Most of the excipients are described in the Ph. Eur. No formal study of 
compatibility between the excipients and active substance was conducted but no compatibility issue 
was observed during stability studies

Adventitious agents 
There is no BSE/TSE risk associated by any of the materials used since none of them are on animal 
origin. 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is a wet granulation process followed by coating of the tablets and 
packaging.  
Prospective process validation was performed by testing three consecutive batches of Myclausen 500 
mg film-coated tablets. All relevant and critical steps are controlled and well described. 
Product Specification 
The release and shelf life specification of Myclausen includes tests and limits for appearance (visually), 
identification of drug substance (HPLC, UV-at release only), identification of titanium dioxide (chemical 
reaction-at release only), loss on drying (Ph.Eur.-end of shelf life only) uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph.Eur.), disintegration (Ph.Eur.-end of shelf life only), dissolution (Ph.Eur.), assay (Ph.Eur.), related 
substances (Ph.Eur.), residual solvents (Ph.Eur.-at release only) and microbiological contamination 
(Ph.Eur.). 
Full analytical testing as per the proposed drug product specifications was performed on six production 
scaled batches. All batches comply with the proposed release specifications.  
Stability of the Product 
Three full scale batches were put on long-term (25±2°C/60±5%RH) intermediate (30±2°C/65±5%RH) 
and accelerated (40±2°C/75±5%RH) stability testing conditions packaged in the material proposed for 
the marketed product. 
Stability data were presented for up to 18 months under long term and intermediate conditions and up 
to six months under accelerated. No specific trends or significant changes were observed for any of the 
tested parameters. 
Further supportive data were presented from two batches stored for up to 12 months under long-term 
and  up  to  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions,  and  from  three  pilot  batches  from  a  different 
manufacturing site stored for 36 months under long-term conditions. 
Photostability testing of Myclausen 500 mg film-coated tablets was accomplished according to the ICH 
Guidance for Industry, Q1B. Exposed samples and dark controls were tested. No difference was found 
between them. 
In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion and Conclusions on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and 
drug  product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn 
lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the 
clinic.

2.3.  Non-Clinical aspects 
No non-clinical data were submitted with this application. The applicant provided an acceptable 
description of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of mofetil 
mycophenolate based on published literature obtained through up-to-date literature searches. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. No further studies 
are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided. An overview based on a 
literature review is thus appropriate. 
An Environmental Risk Assessment has been submitted by the applicant. Myclausen is a generic 
product, which is deemed interchangeable with already marketed products, and is unlikely to increase 
the combined sales volumes of mycophenolate mofetil-containing products thus not having an adverse 
effect on the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical Aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an abridged application for film-coated tablets containing 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil. To 
support the marketing authorisation application, the applicant has submitted reports on two 
bioequivalence studies (study no 411-87-06-02-0001, a single dose, randomised, open-label, two-way 
crossover study under fasting conditions and study no 3668, a single dose, randomised, open-label, 4-
period, 2-sequence, replicate crossover study under fasting conditions). The details of this study are 
summarised in Table 1. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil based on published literature; this was considered 
acceptable. The SPC is in line with the SPC of the reference product.  
For the clinical assessment the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EPW/QWP/1401/98) in its current version as well as the Questions & Answers 
on the Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular 
relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The CHMP has requested a routine GCP inspection of the clinical and bioanalytical facility of study 
3668, which has taken place from 23 – 26 February 2010. The general GCP compliant outcome of the 
inspection raises no concerns on the reliability of the submitted study data. Trial data are considered 
as trustworthy and are recommended as acceptable.

Methods 
Study design  
The study was a monocentric, open, randomized, single dose, two period crossover trial in healthy 
volunteers with a wash period of 7 days between the two periods.  
Each study period lasted 4 days for each volunteer. Following a 12 hours overnight stay (day 0) and 
further 12 hours confinement (day 1) in the volunteer unit of the clinical centre, the volunteers 
reported as out-subjects on day 2 (24 and 36 hours post dose) and day 3 (48 hours post dose) in each 
study period for the respective blood sampling (pre-dose and 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, 1h, 1:30, 2h, 3h, 4h, 
5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 24h, 36h, and 48 hours post dose with separation of plasma). 
Volunteers swallowed under fasting conditions (at least 10 hours overnight fasting) in the morning on 
day 1 in each period of the study either 1 film-coated tablet of the test product or 1 film-coated tablet 
of the reference drug always with 240 ml water. The volunteers fasted from food and beverages other 
than water, from 9 p.m. on the evening before dosing until lunchtime on the following day, 
approximately 4 hours post dose. Water was to be provided ad libitum until 1 hour before the drug 
administration on day 1 in each study period. Water was allowed again from 3 hours after drug 
CHMP Assessment report

administration on day 1 in each study period. The total intake of water on day 1 of dosing later than 3 
hours after drug administration was at least 1.5 liters. Concomitant medication was generally not 
allowed for the duration of the trial.  
The wash-out phase between both study periods was 7 days.  
The study protocol was signed on 25 June 2008. Final approval from the ethics review committee was 
received on 08 July 2008. The final study report was dated 24 June 2009.

Pharmacokinetic Variables  
All pharmacokinetic variables were determined in a model-independent way (using SAS Version 9.2). 
Determination was made for the active metabolite mycophenolic acid only. 
AUC was calculated according to the linear trapezoidal method. The highest concentration really 
measured and the time at which it has been registered after each dose in any given volunteer was 
regarded as Cmax and tmax respectively. The t½ had to be determined by means of a linear 
regression using the terminal elimination phase of the drug and a semilogarithmic presentation.  
The primary endpoints in the present trial were AUC0-tlast and Cmax of mycophenolic acid. These 
endpoints had to undergo descriptive and comparative statistical evaluation. Secondary endpoint 
was tmax of mycophenolic acid and had to undergo descriptive statistical evaluation together with the 
additional endpoints (AUC0-inf, MRT, and t½ of mycophenolic acid). 
Statistical methods   
For pharmacokinetic endpoints: 
• parametric method (ANOVA-log) for AUC0-tlast and Cmax of mycophenolic acid 
• covariates in the model: sequence, treatment, period, volunteer within sequence 
• non-parametric method (Hauschke et al. 1990) tmax of mycophenolic acid 
• 90% confidence interval for the ratios (test vs. reference) for AUC0-tlast and Cmax of mycophenolic 
acid 
For evaluation of safety: 
• descriptive statistical evaluation only. 
Bioequivalence: 
The 90% confidence intervals of log-transformed values were calculated for the intra-individual ratio 
test vs. reference for AUC0-tlast and Cmax of mycophenolic acid and then compared to the pre-defined 
(in study protocol) acceptance limits for AUC0-tlast (80 - 125 %) and for Cmax (80 - 125 %). The 
90% confidence interval was calculated for the intra-individual ratio for the difference of tmax (test-
reference) and descriptively assessed. 
Results 
A total number of 72 volunteers completed the trial according to the protocol. The samples of 72 
volunteers were analyzed and 72 volunteers were subject to statistical evaluation. There were no drop-
outs. 
The endpoints of the analysis of mycophenolic acid after an oral single dose of 1 film-coated tablet 
(=500 mg mycophenolate mofetil) of the test preparation who were subject to pharmacokinetic and 
statistical evaluation are summarized in Table 3.

The 90% confidence interval for the ratio test/reference of AUC0-tlast for mycophenolic acid calculated 
by means of the parametric method (ANOVA-log) was between 1.0277 and 1.0992 and thus within the 
acceptance limits (80 – 125 % for log-transformed values).  
The 90% confidence interval for the ratio test/reference of Cmax for mycophenolic acid calculated by 
means of the parametric method (ANOVA-log) was between 1.0431 and 1.3473, and thus outside the 
acceptance range (80 - 125 % for log-transformed values). 
Therefore, bioequivalence has not been demonstrated between the reference and test product in this 
study. 
The  applicant  performed  an  evaluation  of  these  study  results  and  identified  a  group  of  volunteers  in 
which both products performed in an almost identical manner in terms of AUC and Cmax (more than 
50 % of the subjects), and another group in which the Cmax of the reference product was registered 
later  and  was  lower  when  compared  with  the  test  product  (43  %  of  subjects).  Since  the  latter  cases 
were  accompanied  by  a  prolonged  lag  time  and  by  altogether  lower  drug  concentrations,  the  clinical 
results and pharmaceutical data were examined and compared for the reference product. The applicant 
suggested that in volunteers with a later Cmax, tablets or partly dissolved tablet aggregates from one 
or  both  formulations  reached  the  duodenum  before  being  completely  dissolved.  The  resulting 
concentration vs. time curve that would be lower (regarding Cmax) and shifted to the right (regarding 
Tmax), as the dissolution rate and extent at higher pH values (as observed in the duodenum and small 
intestine)  would  be  slower  and  less  complete.  A  further  evaluation  of  the  dissolution  of  both  study 
batches (test and reference) revealed no plausible in vitro explanation for the results observed in vivo; 
more than 85% of the drug substance was dissolved within 15 minutes. Also both products had very 
short  disintegration  times.  Based  on  this  the  MAH  concluded  that  no  further  pharmaceutical 
development was to be carried out on the test product. 
The  protocol  design  for  Study  411-87-06-02-0001  had  however  several  shortcomings,  which  were 
improved and/or addressed in the protocol design for a new study (Study 3668; see below). The MAH 
concluded that only the second trial (Study No. 3668) should be regarded as the pivotal and relevant 
trial for the assessment of the present application.

Study 3668 
Methods  
Study design  
This  was  a  four-period,  two-sequence,  replicate  crossover  (reference-test-reference-test),  open  label, 
single  dose  bioequivalence  study  of  Mycophenolate  Mofetil  500mg  tablets  versus  CellCept  500mg 
tablets in healthy, non-smoking male subjects under fasting conditions. 
Subjects were admitted to the clinic the day before dosing, and remained until the 24 hour post-dose 
blood draw of each period, at which time they were allowed to leave the clinic and after which they 
were required to return for subsequent blood draws. Following an overnight fast, subjects received 1 
tablet of the test product or 1 tablet of the reference product on Day 1 of each study period. Water 
was provided ad libitum until 1 hour pre-dose and after 1 hour post-dose. The only fluid intake allowed 
during this time was 240 mL of ambient temperature dosing water. The subjects fasted overnight for 
at least 10 hours before drug administration. No food was allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. At 
4.5, 9.5, and 13.5 hours post-dose, standardized meals and beverages were provided to the subjects. 
All meals and beverages were free of alcohol, grapefruit products, xanthines and caffeine and were 
identical for all study periods. No concomitant medications were permitted during the study. 
During each study period, 21 blood samples were collected from each subject, for pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analyses. Over the course of the entire study, approximately 544.5 mL of blood was 
collected from each subject. Blood samples were collected from each subject at the following 
timepoints: 0 (pre-dose), and at 0.17 (10 minutes), 0.25 (15 minutes), 0.33 (20 minutes), 0.5 (30 
minutes), 0.67 (40 minutes), 0.83 (50 minutes), 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 
48 hours post-dose. 
There was a 1-week washout period between study treatments. 
The clinical part of the study was undertaken between 29 April 2009 and 20 May 2009. The analytical 
portion of study 3668 was conducted from May 26, 2009 to June 8, 2009.  
The study protocol was signed on 11 March 2009. Final approval from the ethics review 
committee was received on 06 March 2009. The final study report was dated 05 August 2009.

Analytical methods   
Mycophenolate  mofetil  and  its  metabolite  were  analysed  by  HPLC  with  Electrospray  Ionization.  The 
analytes were separated by reverse phase chromatography. The method was adequately validated. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  mycophenolic  acid  derived  for  both  treatments  using  standard, 
non-compartmental methods (using SAS Version 9.1) were: 
Primary parameters: 
- AUC0-t = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to time of last measurable 
concentration,    calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule 
- AUC0-inf = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity 
- Cmax = maximum plasma concentration observed after dosing 
Secondary parameters: 
- Tmax = time occurrence of Cmax 
- Kel = first order terminal elimination rate constant 
- t½ = terminal half-life 
Statistical methods   
Descriptive  statistics  was  calculated  for  plasma  concentrations  and  for  all  PK  parameters 
(mycophenolate  mofetil  and  mycophenolic  acid).  Individual  and  mean  plasma  concentration  versus 
time  curves  were  plotted  on  linear  and  semi-logarithmic  scales.  Plasma  concentration  versus  time 
curves were labelled appropriately. Using Mixed procedures in SAS, ANOVA was performed on natural 
logarithmic  (ln)  transformed  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax  and  on  untransformed  parameters 
t½, Kel and Tmax at the significance level of 0.05. The intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV) within 
test  and  reference  formulation  was  calculated  for  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  and  Cmax  using  the  ANOVA

residual error. The ratio (Test/Reference) of geometric LSMs along with the 90% CI was also calculated 
according  to  the  following  comparison:  Test  (Mycophenolate  Mofetil  500  mg  Tablets)  versus  – 
Reference (CellCept® 500 mg Tablets).  
The bioequivalence assessment was based on the metabolite, mycophenolic acid. The applicant argued 
that  as  the  parent  compound  exhibits  a  high  degree  of  pre-systemic  metabolism  to  the  active 
metabolite, mycophenolic acid, it is unlikely that the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound can be 
adequately characterized. Bioequivalence was determined if the 90% CI for the ratio (Test/Reference) 
of geometric LSMs is within the range of 80.00% to 125.00% for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and 
Cmax. 
Results 
44 healthy male volunteers were dosed in Period I of the study, 39 of whom completed the study. One 
subject withdrew because of an adverse event (AE; flu), 1 subject was dismissed because the Principal 
Investigator felt it was in his best interests (hemoglobin level outside of the acceptable range), 1 
subject was dismissed because of administrative reasons (positive nicotine screen at Period IV check-
in) and 2 subjects withdrew for personal reasons. 
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for mycophenolic acid are summarized in table 5.

The statistical results indicated that test/reference geometric mean ratios and the 90% confidence 
intervals for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax of mycophenolic acid were within the 80.00% - 125.00% 
range. 
Therefore, bioequivalence was established between the test formulation and the reference product 
under single-dose, fasting conditions. 
Safety data  
Study 411-87-06-02-0001  
No serious adverse events were registered in the course of the trial. A total number of three non-
serious adverse events were registered in three volunteers. Two adverse events occurred in two 
subjects after administration of the test product, the other one after exposure to the reference 
formulation.  
All three adverse events were headache. A causal relationship is possible. Headache is a common 
adverse event of mycophenolate mofetil use.  
Study 3668  
No serious adverse events were registered in the course of the trial. Nineteen subjects experienced a 
total of 35 adverse events during the study. The most frequent adverse events are expressed as 
fractions, relative to the total number of adverse events experienced after each treatment. After 
treatment with CellCept® 500 mg Tablets, the most frequent adverse event was headache (3/6). After 
treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil 500 mg Tablets, the most adverse events were the following: 
dizziness (2/17) and headache (2/17). At the end-of-study examination, the most frequent adverse 
events were the following: blood creatinine increased (2/11) and blood urea increased (2/11). No 
adverse event was reported more than once after the post-study examination (1 adverse event total). 
Nineteen adverse events were “possibly” related to the study drug. All subjects who experienced 
adverse events during this study recovered completely.  
The observations in healthy volunteers did not differ from the known safety profile of mycophenolate 
mofetil.

2.4.4.  Discussion and Conclusion on Clinical aspects 
In this dossier, two bioequivalence trials were presented. Mycophenolic acid was the analyte measured 
in both trials which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. In the first trial, study No. 411-87-06-02-
0001,  AUC  was  within  the  bioequivalence  limits  (80%  to  125%)  but  not  the  Cmax.  The  second  trial, 
study  No.  3668,  with  a  replicate  cross-over  design  showed  BE  for  both  AUC  and  Cmax.  In  their 
responses to the LoOI, the Applicant presented a well researched analysis of possible reasons for the 
divergent results of the two submitted bioequivalence studies. 
The Applicant further investigated if differences in the dissolution profiles and disintegration times for 
the test and reference products could be responsible for the observed differences in Cmax. This 
possibility was excluded, and therefore there was no need to reformulate the test product. Protocol 
design aspects comparing the two trials were discussed in detail. From the comparative analysis it was 
concluded that the improved design, stricter standardisation and higher number of blood sampling 
points implemented in the second BE study could have contributed to the convincing demonstration of 
bioequivalence. It is therefore supported that study 3668 can be regarded as the pivotal trial in this 
generic application. 
Furthermore, as requested by CHMP, the Applicant presented a combined analysis of PK data from 
both studies. This analysis resulted in 90% confidence intervals for AUC and Cmax which were contained 
in the acceptance range of 80%-125%. As there was a significant treatment-by-study interaction, the 
additional value of these results over the single studies may be regarded as limited. Nevertheless, due 
to the rationale provided above, it is supported that study 3668 can be regarded as the pivotal trial. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
PSUR 
According  to  Volume  9-Pharmacovigilance  1.4.2.5.2,  less  frequent  PSURs  than  customary  for  new 
medicinal  products  are  appropriate.  The  PSUR  submission  schedule  should  follow  the  PSUR  schedule 
for the reference products. 
Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 1.2 presented in 
Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst 
the product is on the market. 
Risk Management Plan 
The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring 
specific risk minimization activities have been identified.

User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use 
2.6.  Benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
This application concerns a generic version of mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The reference product 
Cellcept is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute 
transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. No nonclinical 
studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented. From a clinical perspective, this 
application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the 
efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The pivotal basis form bioequivalence studies with a four-period, two-sequence, replicate crossover, 
open label design (study 3668). The study design was considered adequate; a single dose fasting 
study was appropriate as there is no food effect on the bioavailability of mycophenolate mofetil. 
Mycophenolic acid was the analyte for the bioequivalence assessment which was considered 
acceptable. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were 
adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
adequate. 
The test formulation of Myclausen met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with the reference product. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 
125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.7.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio  of  Myclausen  in  combination  with  ciclosporin  and  corticosteroids  for  the  prophylaxis  of  acute 
transplant  rejections  in  patients  receiving  allogeneic  renal,  cardiac  or  hepatic  transplants  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

1.  Introduction 
On 16 September 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Novothirteen (F13CD-
3835), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study F13CD3835 is a stand-alone study. 
These data are also submitted as part of the safety extension study of the phase 3b study F13CD-
3760. 
The MAH stated that F13CD 3835 is not part of the agreed PIP for Novothirteen. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The MAH states that the formulation of the study drug administered was identical to that licensed for 
commercial use. 
The trial product is rFXIII. The manufacturing process involves the expression of FXIII as a soluble 
protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using recombinant DNA technology. The purified protein is 
supplied as inactive FXIII [A2] homodimer, identical to endogenous human FXIII. The product is 
supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder for i.v. injection, available in single use vials of 2505 IU (15 
mg) per vial. The trial product was reconstituted with sterile water (3.2 mL sterile water per vial) and 
then further diluted with saline (6.0 mL 0.9% w/v sodium chloride). The final concentration was 300 
IU/mL. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
• 
Clinical study F13CD-3835 “ A Multi-Centre, Multinational, Open-Label, Single-Arm and Multiple 
Dosing Trial on Safety and Efficacy of Monthly Replacement Therapy with Recombinant Factor XIII 
(rFXIII) in Paediatric Subjects with Congenital Factor XIII A-subunit Deficiency”.  
The trial enrolled paediatric subjects between the age of 1 and 6 years with congenital F XIII A 
subunit-deficiency witch have completed the PK study F13CD-3760. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study F13CD-3835 “A Multi-Centre, Multinational, Open-Label, Single-Arm and Multiple Dosing 
Trial on Safety and Efficacy of Monthly Replacement Therapy with Recombinant Factor XIII (rFXIII) in 
Paediatric Subjects with Congenital Factor XIII A-subunit Deficiency”.

Description 
The study was a multinational, open label, single arm and multiple dosing trial designed to provide 
information on the long term safety and efficacy profile of 35UI/Kg rFXIII every 28 days in paediatric 
subjects between the age of 1 and 6 years old, with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. The trial 
enrolled subjects who had completed the pharmacokinetic trial F13CD-3760.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives: To evaluate the long term safety of monthly replacement with rFXIII when used for 
prevention of bleeding episodes in paediatric subjects with congenital FXIIIA-subunit deficiency.  
Secondary objectives: To investigate the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII when 
used for prevention of bleeding episodes in paediatric subjects with congenital FXIIIa-subunit 
deficiency. 
Assessor’s comment: Primary and secondary objectives are acceptable.  
Study design 
The trial was performed as a multi-centre, multi-national, open label, single arm and multiple dosing 
phase 3b trial to provide information on the long term safety and efficacy profile of rFXIII in paediatric 
subjects between the age of 1 and 6 years, with congenital FXIIIA-subunit-deficiency.  
The trial enrolled subjects with diagnosis of congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency who had completed 
the pharmacokinetic trial F13CD-3760. The trial started with a combined screening, dosing and 
assessment visit (visit 1). Visit 1 occurred on the same day as the end of trial visit in the F13CD-3760 
trial. During the trial period, the subject received rFXIII every four weeks 
(28 ± 2 days) either at the clinic during the first year or as home treatment after one year, and only if 
allowed according to local regulations. 
The treatment interval was reduced to less than every four weeks, if deemed necessary by the 
investigator and sponsor, in case any spontaneous treatment-requiring bleed occurred and if relevant 
laboratory parameters supported this. 
The minimum trial participation was 52 weeks for each subject. Beyond 52 weeks, subjects could 
continue in the trial until rFXIII became commercially available in their respective country (for use in 
children between the ages of 1 and 6 years old) up to a maximum of approximately 3.5 years if rFXIII 
was unavailable. That means the planned length of trial participation for each subject was variable, but 
was between 1 and approximately 3.5 years

Study population /Sample size 
Paediatric subjects between the age of 1 and 6 years with congenital F XIII A subunit-deficiency witch 
have completed the PK study F13CD-3760. The planned number of subjects was 6. All 6 subjects who 
were screened were exposed to the trial drug and analysed as part of Full Analysis Set (FAS) and 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS). 
The inclusion criteria for this trial were: 
 Informed consent obtained before any trial related activities. (Trial-related activities are any 
procedure that would not have been performed during normal management of the subject.) 
Previous participation (means up to and including end of trial visit) in F13CD-3760 
The exclusion criteria: 
Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product or related products

dysfunction 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable. 
Treatments 
The reconstituted trial product was administered as a slow intravenous injection of 35 UI/Kg rFXIII as 
a rate not to exceed 1-2ml/min). This dose was administered as preventive treatment of bleeding 
episodes and identical to the dose administered in F13CD-3760. The administration of rFXIII started at 
the clinic at visit 1. The dosing schedule was every fourth week.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Criteria for evaluation-safety  
• 
Primary safety endpoints: Treatment-emergent adverse events.  
•  Secondary safety endpoints: Antibody and inhibitor development, clinical laboratory 
parameters, physical examination and vital signs 
Criteria for evaluation efficacy 
•  Rate (number per subject year) of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a FXIII 
containing  
•  Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy of RFXIII treatment.  
Assessor comments: Primary and secondary endpoints are considered correct.

Statistical Methods 
Primary endpoints analyses:  
The AEs and SAEs reported during the trial period were summarized by frequency of events and 
frequency of subjects with any event. Similar summaries cross-classified by severity and by causal 
relation to trial product were also made. Furthermore, listings were provided displaying all AEs and 
SAEs reported during the trial period including pertinent clinical information. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints analyses:  
The planned analysis included evaluation of the number of bleeding episodes requiring treatment by a 
Poisson model (log-link) where age at baseline was a covariate and the log individual observation time 
during the treatment period was used as an offset. Therefore, the length of time under observation for 
a subject who withdrew before the end of the trial was also taken into account in this model. Over-
dispersion was to be estimated by Pearson’s chi-square statistic divided by its degrees of freedom.  
The rate (number per subject year) of spontaneous, traumatic and intracranial “bleeding episodes 
requiring treatment” with FXIII-containing products during the rFXIII treatment period was tabulated 
and listed. The number of bleeding episodes and number of subjects withdrawn from the trial due to 
lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment were tabulated and listed. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
6 subjects were included.  
5 patients between 2-11 years 
1 children toddler between 28 days and 23 months.  
The study was a multinational, open label, single arm and multiple dosing trial designed to provide 
information on the long term safety and efficacy profile of 35UI/Kg rFXIII every 28 days in paediatric 
subjects between the age of 1 and 6 years old, with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of the subjects was 3.0 years (range: 1 to 4 years). Five subjects were children (2–11 
years) and 1 was an infant/toddler (28 days–23 months) according to EudraCT age grouping. Half of 
the subjects were female. Subjects were from the UK (N=3), the US (2), and IS (1). Three (3) 
subjects were Asian, 2 were White, and 1 was Black/African 
American. The mean weight (SD) of subjects was 16.6 kg (3.5) and the mean height (SD) was 98.9 
cm (8.3). The mean BMI (SD) of subjects was 16.8 kg/m2 (1.7) and the range was 15kg/m2 to 19 
kg/m2. The baseline demographics and other characteristics are shown in the table below:

Efficacy results 
At the end of this single-arm safety extension trial in which 6 subjects between the ages of 1 and 6 
years old with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency received 35 IU/kg rFXIII every 28 days for up to 
3.5 years, the following efficacy findings were concluded: 
There were no bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a haemostatic agent during the trial. 
No subjects withdrew from the trial due to lack of rFXIII treatment efficacy. 
There were 14 non-treatment-requiring bleeding episodes in 5 subjects. 
As additional information, mean profile of rFXIII activity (IU/ml) are provided (shown in the table 
below) 
FXIII activity levels were evaluated 30 minutes pre-dosing and one hour post-dosing.

Assessor’s comments:  
Efficacy results are satisfactory. 
However, It seems that appendix 16.2.is missing. Indeed, it is important to know the 
circumstances per subjects of the 14 non treatment requiring bleeding episodes (spontaneous 
or induced by trauma, bleeding localization, intensity, etc…).  
Therefore, the company should provide the data detailed per subject.  
Safety results 
At the end of this single-arm safety extension trial in which 6 subjects between the ages of 1 and 6 
years old with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency received 35 IU/kg rFXIII every 28 days for up to 
3.5 years, the following safety findings were concluded: 
rFXIII Dosing 
All 6 subjects were exposed to rFXIII, with a sum of 214 doses of rFXIII 35 IU/kg over a sum of 198.9 
months (mean doses: 35.7(8.6)). The overall mean rFXIII dose (SD) consumed was 35.1 IU/kg (0.2), 
with a range of 34.9–35.4 IU/kg.

Adverse events 
All  AEs  in  the  trial  were treatment-emergent.  There were  100  AEs  in  the  6  patients,  93  were  mild,  7 
were moderate and none were severe.  
The most frequently reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (7 events in 3 subjects), fall (7 
events in 3 subjects), rhinorrhoea (7 events in 2 subjects), and pyrexia (6 events in 4 subjects). Two 
AEs (lymphopenia and gastroenteritis) in 2 subjects were assessed as probably or possibly related to 
rFXIII by the investigator. 
Two  SAEs  were  reported  in  1  subject  and  concerned  2  head  injuries  caused  by  falls  during  play. 
Neither event was assessed as related to rFXIII by the investigator. 
There were 6 MESIs reported in 4 subjects. Of these, 1 was administration of an incorrect dose, 2 were 
infusion site extravasation (with a temporary drug  withdrawal for 1 of the 2  patients), 3 rashes were 
reported by the same subject on different occasions. All MESIs were assessed as unrelated to rFXIII by 
the investigator and all subjects recovered from these events. 
No  thromboembolic  events,  allergic  reactions,  or  deaths  occurred  in  the  trial.  None  of  the  AEs  in  the 
trial led to withdrawal. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH should provide the case report for the patient who experienced a gastroenteritis and explain 
the causality assessment. 
Concerning  one  patient,  the  investigator  assessed  all  3  rashes  as  unlikely  related  to  NovoThirteen, 
however  due  to  temporal  relationship  the  sponsor  assessed  the  third  event  rash  as  possible  since  it 
happened  in  the  evening  of  the  dosing  day.  The  2  previous  rashes  happened  nearly  1  month  after 
dosing. IgG and IgE laboratory testings were not performed. However, the patient had rash history and 
a viral cause seems more plausible. The same patient also experienced an infusion site extravasation, 
the investigator assessed the event as unlikely related.  
One patient experienced extravasation at NovoThirteen infusion that was assessed as unlikely related 
by  the  investigator.  Infusion  was  stopped  (leaving  0.4  ml)  and  the  extravasation  recovered. 
NovoThirteen was withdrawn temporarily.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
No antibodies against rFXIII were detected in any subjects during the trial. 
There  were  no  clinically  significant  abnormalities  as  assessed  by  the  investigator  regarding 
haematology, biochemistry, coagulation parameters, or clot solubility laboratory evaluations.  
The  majority  of  the  physical  examination  findings  were  not  assessed  as  clinically  significant  by  the 
investigator and did not raise any safety concerns. 
As for vital signs, the mean pulse (mean [SD]) was slightly higher than the reference range at baseline 
(113.2 beats per minute [10.6]) but decreased to within the normal range by the end of the trial (94.0 
beats per minute [16.8]). There were no apparent changes in mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure 
during the trial.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Conclusion on efficacy 
It should be highlighted that efficacy results do not provide new information and are in concordance 
with those of the pivotal study (F13CD-3760).  
However, the number of subjects is very limited and do not permit to have meaningful conclusions.  
To complete the data, the applicant should provide the circumstances of non-treatment requiring 
bleeding episodes per subjects. (Appendix 16.2.6).  
Safety 
No new safety data rise from these study results that would change the safety profile. Once-monthly 
rFXIII  was  well  tolerated  in  6  paediatric  subjects  treated  from  1.8  to  3.5  years  for  a  total  of  16.6 
subject years. There were no thromboembolic events, possibly or probably related allergic reactions or 
antibodies  against  rFXIII.  Two  adverse  events  of  lymphopenia  and  gastroenteritis  were  assessed  as 
possibly  or  probably  related  to  NovoThirteen.  However,  one  patient  experienced  3  rashes  of  which  1 
was initially considered as possible by the sponsor only, but a viral etiology seemed more likely. 
None  of  the  AEs  in  the  trial  led  to  withdrawal  but  one  drug  temporary  withdrawal  was  necessary  for 
one patient who experienced extravasation at infusion. 
No new safety information is deemed necessary for implementation in the PI. 
The MAH should however provide complementary information as requested. 
3.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH should provide the case report for the patient who experienced a gastroenteritis and 
explain the causality assessment. 
2.  The MAH should provide the Appendix 16.2.6 where non treatment requiring bleeding episodes 
per subjects are described.  
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH should provide the case report for the patient who experienced a gastroenteritis and 
explain the causality assessment. 
MAH’s response: 
As  this  is  a  non-serious  adverse  event,  then  no  specific  safety  case  report  is  available.  The  adverse 
event form for this adverse event was provided by the MAH. 
The  case  concerned  a  3-year  old  girl  who  experienced  a  mild,  non-serious  adverse  event  of 
gastroenteritis. She has recovered from the adverse event and the rFXIII dose was not changed as a 
consequence  of  the  adverse  event.  The  adverse  event  was  assessed  to  be  probably  related  by  the 
investigator.  Based  on  the  medical  history  of  the  patient,  temporal  relationship  (22  days  after  rFXIII 
Novothirteen 
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dosing), the severity and seriousness of the event as well as young age of the patient, Novo Nordisk 
does not consider this specific case to be of any safety concern. 
Assessor’s comment 
The  non  serious  event  of  gastroenteritis  (vomiting)  observed  in  a  3  year  old  child  22  days  after  last 
dose,  was  ticked  as  probably  related  to  NovoThirteen  by  the  investigator.  However  the  assessor 
concurs  with  the  MAH’s  opinion  that  this  case  does  not  raise  any  concern.  This  event  seems  unlikely 
related to NovoThirteen.  
2.  The MAH should provide the Appendix 16.2.6 where non treatment requiring bleeding episodes 
per subjects are described.  
MAH’s response: 
The Appendix 16.2.6 was provided.  
Assessor’s comment:  
14 non treatment requiring bleeding episodes happened in the 6 subjects in which 11 were traumatic. 
These  circumstances  seem  normal  in  view  of  the  age  of  children  and  do  not  suggest  a  product 
inefficiency.  
4.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
All the issues are considered resolved.

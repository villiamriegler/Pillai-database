3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Tygacil  (tigecycline)  belongs  to  the  glycylcycline  class  of  antimicrobial  agents.  As  a  bacteriostatic 
agent, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, it inhibits the growth of multiple resistant gram-
positive,  gram-negative,  anaerobic,  and  atypical  bacteria, 
including  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus.  
It  was  authorized  in  the  EU  through  the  centralized  procedure  on  24  April  2006  and  is  currently 
approved for the following indications: 
• Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI), excluding diabetic foot infections 
• Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
A  variation  application  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indications  to  include  treatment  of  community 
acquired pneumonia (CAP) was withdrawn in the EU in April 2008. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  was  renewed  by  the  European  Commission  on  6  May  2011  following  a 
positive  CHMP  Opinion  of  17  February  2011.  As  a  consequence  of  the  benefit-risk  assessment  the 
indications have been restricted by adding the following wording in section 4.1 of the Tygacil SmPC: 
“Tygacil  should  be  used  only  in  situations  where  it  is  known  or  suspected  that  other  alternatives  are 
not suitable (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).”

Tygacil is available in single-dose 5-mL glass vials containing 50 mg lyophilized powder for infusion.  
This  type  II  variation  application  initially  aimed  to  update  section  5.2  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) with PK information for Tygacil in the paediatric population following a request 
from  CHMP  of  20  January  2011.  The  PK  information  to  be  added  originated  from  the  completed 
paediatric  studies  3074K4-2207-WW  and  3074A1-110-US,  both  previously  submitted  and  assessed. 
(study 2207 was submitted to the EMA in April 2010, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No. 1901/2006,  study 3074A1-110-US was provided in the FU2 052.1.) 
However, in its Request for Supplementary Information adopted on 23 June 2011, CHMP requested the 
MAH to also update sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the Tygacil SmPC with safety information in the paediatric 
population originating from the same two paediatric studies mentioned above.  
This variation was classified as follows:

3.2.  Clinical aspects 
The  MAH  conducted  and  completed  two  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric 
population: study 3074A1-110-US (study 110) and study 3074K4-2207-WW (study 2207).  
Study  3074A1-110-US  was an open label, single, ascending dose study  conducted in children aged 
8-16  years  and  aiming  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety/tolerability  of  single 
intravenous doses (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) of tigecycline.  The Clinical Study Report (CSR-
53874) containing the study results was provided and assessed with the responses to the first Request 
for Supplementary Information to the P46 052 procedure (FU2 056.1). At the time when the Paediatric 
Investigation Plan for tigecycline was agreed with the PDCO, this study was already completed.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  single  doses  of 
tigecycline administered as an IV infusion to children.  The secondary objective was to determine the 
PK of single ascending doses of tigecycline in children.  Each subject participated in the study for up to 
6 days, including a 3-day screening period, followed by a minimum 12-hour inpatient period and a 2-
day follow-up period. 
50  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study;  25  subjects  were  enrolled,  and  24  subjects 
completed the study and were included in the analysis.  Six dose groups were planned, but the study 
was stopped (as per study protocol) after 2 subjects in the 1 mg/kg dose group (ages 8 to 11 years) 
vomited.  The final dose  group planned (2  mg/kg  dose  in subjects ages 8 to 11 years) was  omitted, 
and the remainder of the 1 mg/kg dose group (ages 8 to 11 years) did not complete the study.   
For more details on the study design and its results please refer to the Rapporteur assessment report 
of procedure P46 052 from 5 July 2010 (Attachment 5).

Tigecycline administered to children showed initially high concentrations, followed by rapid distribution 
and slower elimination.  Similar to adults, CLr was relatively small compared with total CL. As has been 
reported for other medications, including antibiotics, in older children, CL and Vss values were lower, 
even  when  normalized  for  weight.    The  younger  children  also  had  shorter  t½  values  compared  with 
older children and adults.   
The clinical efficacy of tigecycline appears to be most closely related to the AUC to MIC ratio and so a 
reasonable dose to use in children would be one that would result in the AUC observed in adults.  The 
MAH also presented individual listings on the PK parameters. After the recommended dose of 100 mg 
loading and 50 mg every 12 hours, the AUC0 24h observed in adults was approximately 5.0 mg•h/L; 
thus for AUC0-12H, the target would be 2.5 mg•h/L.  As may be seen in Figure 1-2, children less than 
12 years of age appear to need higher doses than children older than 12 years of age.  For almost all 
children ages 12 years and older, a dose of 1 mg/kg would be expected to produce exposures of 2.5 
mg•h/L or higher.  Given that most children ages 12 years and older weigh at least 50 kg, the adult 
dose of 50 mg every 12 hours would be expected to provide appropriate exposure. 
Figure  1-2:  Age  Versus  Simulated  Tigecycline  Dose  Needed  to  Cause  AUC  of  2.5  mgh/L:  Study 
3074A1-110-US 
In children less than 12 years of age, a 50-mg dose would be too much, given the smaller size of such 
children.  Simulating exposures based upon the children studied, 1-mg/kg doses would be expected to 
result in a median AUC of 3.2 mg•h/L (range: 1.4-10.5 mg•h/L).  In children ages 12 years and older, 
doses  shown  to  be  effective  in  adults  (a  100-mg  loading  dose  followed  by  50  mg  every  12  hours) 
would be predicted to provide a similar exposure to what was observed in adults.  In children ages 8 to

11 years, doses of 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 50 mg) every 12 hours would be predicted to provide a 
similar exposure to what was observed in adults.   
The approved dose regimen for adults with cSSTI or cIAI is an initial loading dose of 100 mg followed 
by  50  mg  every  12  hours  for  5  to  14  days.  The  AUC0-24h  observed  in  adults  is  approximately  5.0 
mg•h/L; thus, for AUC 0-12h, the target would be 2.5 mg•h/L. Dose reduction is considered necessary 
only for patients with severe hepatic impairment (C-P C), who receive 25 mg every 12 hours following 
the 100 mg loading dose.  
The reasons for omitting the loading dose in children are: first, the apparently long half-life observed in 
adults is misleading and does not reflect the effective half-life governing the amount of accumulation 
observed with multiple doses.  Second, the pharmacodynamic parameter predictive of clinical efficacy 
is  AUC/MIC,  which  is  achieved  with  the  first  dose,  and  does  not  suggest  that  a  loading  dose  would 
provide  additional  effectiveness;  and  third,  the  dosing  regimen  in  children  is  anticipated  to  be  more 
complex than in adults and a loading dose is likely to increase the complexity further increasing dosing 
errors, and finally a loading dose is likely to result in tolerability issues in children.  With regard to the 
tolerability  issues,  it  was  shown,  in  an  integrated  study  of  data  from  adult  subjects,  both  healthy 
volunteers and patients with cSSSI, that higher doses and exposures were associated with decreased 
tolerability  compared  with  lower  doses    Population  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic  analyses  of

and  subjects.    Wyeth  Research,  RPT-54411,  2004;  Rubino  CM,  Forrest  A,  Bhavnani  S,  et  al.  
Toxicodynamic  analysis  in  patients  with  hospital-  or  community-acquired  pneumonia.    47th  ICAAC 
2007;Abstract A-584). The PDCO agreed that the loading dose in paediatric studies can be omitted. 
The MAH initial proposal for dose recommendation based on the results of this study was to administer 
50 mg every 12 hours (the same as the adult maintenance dose) to children aged 12 to 17 years old, 
and 1 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours to patients 8 to 11 years old. However, 
CHMP  could  not  agree  on  this  (please  refer  to  section  “Discussions,  conclusions  and  Benefit  /  Risk 
Assessment”).  
Safety 
Eight    subjects  (32%)  had  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  the  most  frequent  of  which 
were nausea (12%), vomiting (16%), and headache (8%), with the nausea and vomiting occurring in 
the higher dose  groups (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) and  considered to be possibly related to tigecycline.  
No deaths occurred during the study.  One subject had an SAE, vomiting with associated dehydration, 
which  resolved  during  a  brief  period  of  hospitalization;  and  1  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study 
because of a mild injection site reaction. 
Study 3074K4-2207-WW 
This  was  a  phase  2,  multicentre,  open-label,  ascending  multiple-dose  study  to  assess  the 
pharmacokinetics,  safety  and  tolerability  of  tigecycline  in  paediatric  patients  from  8  to  less  than  12 
years of age with selected serious infections: complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI), complicated 
skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is part of the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed with the  PDCO and  for which a positive opinion was issued 
by the EMA in May 2009 (date of last modification of the agreed PIP). 
Eligible subjects received intravenous (IV) tigecycline at a dosage of 0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours infused over approximately 30 minutes. Omitting the loading 
dose  for  the  paediatric  population  was  considered  acceptable  for  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO) 
mainly  due  to  tolerability  issues.  All  subjects  received  IV  tigecycline  for  a  minimum  of  3  days  to  a 
CHMP variation assessment report P46 052

maximum  of  14  consecutive  days.  On  or  after  day  4,  it  was  possible  to  switch  to  oral  antibiotics  (IV 
plus  oral  switch).  Escalation  to  the  next  dose  cohort  occurred  only  after  the  following:  1)  safety  and 
tolerability  data  at  the  preceding  dose  through  the  last  day  of  therapy  (tigecycline  LDOT)  had  been 
reviewed  by the sponsor, 2) at least 5 of  the  6 properly processed PK samples were received by the 
central  laboratory  from  at  least  12  subjects  (“PK  evaluable”),  and  3)  all  available  efficacy  data  were 
reviewed. 
For details on the design and results of the study please refer to the Rapporteur assessment report of 
procedure P46 052 from 5 July 2010 (Attachment 5). 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  consisted  of  59  subjects  who  were  screened  and  randomized  to 
treatment. Of these subjects, 58 subjects received at least 1 dose of tigecycline and were included in 
the  modified  intent-to-treat  (mITT)  population.  The  disposition  of  subjects  by  treatment  group  and 
diagnosis in the mITT population is provided in the following table: 
Overall, 53 subjects had serum tigecycline concentrations determined. Of these subjects, 47 subjects 
had an adequate number of PK samples to be included in the PK evaluable population: 16 subjects in 
the 0.75 mg/kg treatment group; 18 subjects in the 1 mg/kg treatment group; and 13 subjects were 
in the 1.25 mg/kg treatment group. 
Tigecycline  serum  concentrations  from  a  total  of  53  children  were  collected  after  multiple  doses  of 
0.75, 1 and 1.25 mg/kg. Mean ± standard error (SE) concentrations for each dosing group are shown 
in Figure 11-1.

Although concentration data were available, PK parameters could not be determined for 7 children (one 
child  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group,  one  child  in  the  1-mg/kg  group,  and  five  children  in  the  1.25-mg/kg 
group). When Cmax and tmax could be reliably determined, they were. The resulting mean ± SD PK 
parameters determined in the 47 children who were PK evaluable are shown in Table 4-2.

Steady-state tigecycline AUC0-24h versus dose in adults and pediatric subjects is shown in Figure 11-
2.  As  may  be  seen  in  the  figure,  the  AUC0-24h  is  slightly  higher  in  children  in  the  1.25-mg/kg 
treatment  groups,  and  slightly  lower  in  children  in  the  1-mg/kg  treatment  group  than  the  AUC0-24h 
observed in adult subjects with cSSSI or cIAI participating in phase 2 and 3 studies. 
The selection of 1.2 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg per dose) BID as dosing recommendation for children 8 
to 11 years old for phase 3 trials is based on the results plotted in the figure above. As AUC/MIC ratio 
is  the  PK/PD  index  that  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this 
approach was acceptable.  
Plotting weight, body surface area (BSA) or body mass index (BMI) versus  Clearance (CL) shows that 
smaller children have lower CL than larger children, but when weight, BSA, or BMI are plotted against 
Weight-Normalised  Clearance  (CLW),  the  apparent  relationship  between  size  and  CL  goes  away, 
supporting the choice of dosing based on weight for children as may be seen in Supportive Figure 7.1 
and Supportive Figure 7.2, showing weight vs CL and CLW respectively.

The percent target attainment values are shown in Table 4-3. A dose of 1.2 mg/kg, with a maximum 
dose  of  50  mg,  matches  most  closely  the  %  target  attainment  predicted  from  adults  participating  in 
clinical trials.

Although  the  MAH  conclusion  was  that  1.2  mg/kg  twice  daily    would  be  an  appropriate  dose  to  be 
tested in further clinical studies in children the CHMP was not convinced and the MAH was requested to 
address  several  other  issues  (please  refer  to  section  “Discussions,  conclusions  and  Benefit  /  Risk 
Assessment”).   
Safety 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event Data (TEAEs) 
An AE was considered treatment emergent if it emerged during the on-therapy period but was absent 
before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs that 
occurred  within  5  days  after  the  last  test  article  administration  were  attributed  to  the  on-therapy 
period. 
Overall,  44  (75.9%)  subjects  were  reported  with  1  or  more  TEAEs.  TEAEs  were  most  commonly 
associated with the digestive system. The most frequently occurring TEAE was nausea, reported in 28 
(48.3%) subjects overall, and in a significantly higher percentage of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group 
(60.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6%; p=0.018), and in the 1 mg/kg group (61.9%) 
compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6%; p=0.009). Vomiting was the second mostly frequently 
reported  TEAE,  reported  in  27  (46.6%)  subjects  overall.  Vomiting  was  reported  in  the  0.75-mg/kg 
group in 5 children (29%) while in the 1-mg/kg and 1.25-mg/kg groups these figures were 11 (52.4%) 
and 11 (50%), respectively.  
Nine  subjects with CAP  (47.4%)  were reported  with 1  or  more  TEAEs. The most frequently occurring 
TEAE  was nausea, reported in 8 (42.1%)  subjects overall, and in a significantly higher percentage of 
subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (100.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (14.3%; p=0.015). 
Vomiting,  reported  in  5  (26.3%)  subjects  overall,  was  reported  significantly  more  frequently  in  the 
1.25-mg/kg group (75.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (0%; p=0.024). 
Twenty  (20,  83.3%)  subjects  with  cIAI  were  reported  with  1  or  more  TEAEs.  The  most  frequently 
occurring  AEs  were  vomiting,  reported  in  15  (62.5%)  subjects  overall,  and  nausea,  reported  in  9 
(37.5%) subjects overall.  
One  (1)  or  more  TEAEs  were  reported  in  all  15  subjects  with  cSSSI  (100%).  TEAEs  were  most 
commonly  associated  with  the  digestive  system.  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  were  nausea, 
reported in 11 (73.3%) subjects overall, and vomiting, reported in 7 (46.7%) subjects overall. Nausea 
was  reported  significantly  more  frequently  in  the  1-mg/kg  group  (100%)  compared  with  the  0.75-
mg/kg group (25.0%; p=0.024). 
Overall, significantly more subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg (60.0%) and 1-mg/kg (61.9%) groups reported 
TEAEs  of  nausea  compared  with  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group  (17.6%;  p=0.018  and  p=0.009, 
respectively).  Among  subjects  with  CAP,  significantly  more  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group 
compared  with  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group  reported  TEAEs  of  nausea  (100%  versus  14.3%,

p=0.015) and vomiting (75.0% versus 0%, p=0.024). Among subjects with cSSSI, significantly more 
subjects in the 1-mg/kg group reported TEAEs of nausea (100%) compared with subjects in the 0.75-
mg/kg  group  (25.0%,  p=0.024).  Among  subjects  with  cIAI,  there  were  no  significant  differences 
between treatment groups in the incidences of nausea or vomiting. 
The  incidences  of  nausea  and  vomiting  across  treatment  groups  is  summarized  overall  and  by 
diagnosis in Table 10-2 below. 
Deaths 
No subjects died during the study. 
Serious Adverse Events 
A summary of SAEs by body system and diagnosis is provided in Table 10-3 below. A total of 3 (5.2%) 
subjects were reported with SAEs during the study. No SAEs were reported in subjects with CAP. One 
(1;  4.2%)  subject  with  cIAI  receiving  0.75  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  an  SAE  of  postoperative  wound 
infection. Two (2; 13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had  SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE 
of  anal  fistula  and  1  subject  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group  had  an  SAE  of  abdominal  pain.  All  SAEs  were 
resolved.

A  summary  of  AEs  resulting  in  withdrawal  from  the  study  is  provided  in  Table  10-4  overall  and  by 
diagnosis. Overall, 2 (3.4%) subjects were withdrawn from the study because of AEs. Among subjects 
with  cIAI,  1  subject  in  the  1-mg/kg  group  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  AEs  of 
pancreatitis,  blood  amylase  increased,  and  lipase  increased,  and  1  subject  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group 
was withdrawn from the study because of an AE of lipase increased.

Additionally,  three  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  post-operative  wound  infection 
(cIAI, 0.75 mg/kg group), anal fistula (cSSTI, 1 mg/kg group) and severe abdominal pain (cSSTI, 1.25 
mg/kg group.  
Comparison between the two PK studies 
A  comparison  of  the  study  designs  and  observed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  was  requested  by  the 
CHMP and is shown in Table 8-1.

The pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the children age 8 to 11 years were comparable between 
the 2 studies. Study 110-US was a small study and enrolled only 7 children aged 8 to 11, one of whom 
had a very high Cmax (19980 ng/mL) that may have been due to a contaminated sample. Three (3) of 
the 16 children aged 12 to 16 years had very high Cmax values as well, leading to the highly variable 
estimates of Cmax. The AUC values observed in the 8 to 11 year olds were comparable when the high 
values were excluded. 
The CHMP also requested the MAH to provide  a population pharmacokinetic analysis with the two PK 
studies  conducted  in  the  paediatric  population.  A  model  of  tigecycline  pharmacokinetics  was  derived 
from the pooled data. The pharmacokinetic data were best described using a linear two compartment 
model with an effect of weight on clearance. No other covariates were identified as being predictive of 
tigecycline pharmacokinetics. The data were variable, particularly peak concentrations which gave rise 
to  high  residual  variability  in  the  final  model.  The  model  under-predicts  Cmax,  i.e.  the  experimental 
Cmax concentrations are higher than those predicted by the model.  The evaluation of the final model 
showed no overall bias or substantial model misspecification.   
The  identification  of  weight  on  clearance  is  supportive  of  a  weight  based  dose  regimen  for  the 
paediatric population although the relationship between weight and clearance (and hence AUC) is not 
linear. According to the MAH, paediatric subjects receiving 1 mg/kg doses would be predicted to show 
increasing exposure of approximately 40%, over the range of body weights of 20 to 50 kg, followed by 
gradually decreasing exposure due to the dose capping at 50 mg.  
In the answers to CHMP’s second RSI, the MAH has clarified clarified that the simulated mean AUC0-
24h following a dose of 0.75 mg/kg is below the adult AUC0-24h target of 5 mg•h/L while for the dose 
of 1.2 mg/kg the mean values are usually above this target and has confirmed that 1.2 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum of 50 mg twice daily) administered every 12 hours infused over 30 to 60 minutes is the dose 
to be further tested in children and adolescents 8 to less than 18 years old. The CHMP considered this 
to  be  acceptable,  although  modelling  and  simulation  along  with  the  safety  data  may  have  supported

the 1 mg/kg dose, but agreed that appropriate measures were already agreed with the PDCO to be put 
in  place  in  the  planned  phase  3  studies  in  children  (DSMB,  stopping  rules)  to  limit  the  exposure  of 
children to inappropriate doses.  
Changes to the Product Information 
Following the assessment of CHMP the MAH agreed to update the Tygacil SmPC as follows: 
Section 4.2 
[…]  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tygacil in children below 18 years have not yet been established  No data 
are  available  (see  sections  5.2  and  4.4).  (see  section  4.4).  Only  pharmacokinetic  data  are  available 
(see section 5.2). 
Section 4.8 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
Very  limited  safety  data  were  available  from  a  multiple  dose  PK  study  (see  section  5.2).  No  new  or 
unexpected safety concerns were observed with tigecycline in this study. 
Section 5.2. 
Paediatric Population 
The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in patients less than 18 years of age has not been established (see 
section 4.2). The safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the paediatric population 8 to <18 years of age 
have not been established. 
Tigecycline pharmacokinetics was investigated in two studies. The first study enrolled children aged 8-
16 years (n=24) who received single doses of tigecycline (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg, with no dose limitation) 
administered intravenously over 30 minutes. The second study was performed in children aged 8 to 11 
years  (n=47)  who  received  multiple  doses  of  tigecycline  (0.75,  1,  or  1.25  mg/kg  up  to  a  maximum 
dose  of  50  mg)  every  12  hours  administered  intravenously  over  30  minutes.  No  loading  dose  was 
administered in these studies. The pharmacokinetic parameters may be observed in the table below. 
The  target  AUC0-12h  in  adults  after  the  recommended  dose  of  100  mg  loading  and  50  mg  every  12 
hours, was approximately 2500 ng•h/mL.

Discussions, conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
This  type  II  variation  initially  aimed  at  amending  section  5.2  of  the  approved  SmPC  for  Tygacil  by 
providing  PK  data  on  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  and  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  in 
January  2011,  during  the  assessment  of  study  3074K4-2207-WW.  The  initial  proposal  made  by  the 
MAH  to  update  section  5.2  of  the  Tygacil  SmPC  was  not  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  CHMP 
adopted on 23 June 2011 a RSI requesting the MAH to also update sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
with a summary of the safety data of the paediatric PK studies. 
The  MAH  initial  proposal  for  dose  recommendation  based  on  the  results  of  3074A1-110-US  study  for 
the planned phase 3 trials in children was to administer 50 mg every 12 hours (the same as the adult 
maintenance  dose)  to children aged 12 to  17 years  old, and 1 mg/kg (up to  a maximum dose  of 50 
mg) every 12 hours to patients 8 to 11 years old. However, the CHMP could not agree on this due to 
the following issues: 
-  there were only 8 subjects aged 8-11 years enrolled of which two received the 1 mg/kg dose and the 
other six received 0.5 mg/kg. The observed Cmax  and AUCs were lower with  1 mg/kg than  with 0.5 
mg/kg  in  this  age  group  (see  table  above),  but  this  observation  is  not  explored  (e.g.  in  terms  of 
subject  demographics)  in  the  study  report.  Because  the  differences  in  CL  and  weight-normalized  CL 
values  were  greater  than  the  change  in  weight-normalized  Vss  values,  the  λz  was  also  higher  in 
younger  children  and  so  t½  was  longer.  Age,  weight  and  BMI  were  significant  factors  for  weight-
normalised clearance, but not for weight-normalised Vss, in the univariate regression model analyses. 
- for the US children enrolled in this study the mean weight in the 8-11 years group was around 50 kg 
(max 64 kg) and the mean weight in the older subjects was 60-70 kg. Also, the modelling suggested 
that in those  aged 8-11 years 1 mg/kg every  12 hours would give a median  AUC  of  3.2 mg•h/L  but 
with a range from 1.4-10.5 mg•h/L. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  evidence  to  support  the  dose  regimen  proposed  for  future 
trials  enrolling  children  aged  <  12  years  and/or  <  50  kg  was  weak  and  needed  much  more 
investigation. As a consequence, the MAH performed study 3074K4-2207-WW (study 2207) in children 
from 8 to less than 12 years old. The CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal not to develop a specific 
formulation  for  the  paediatric  population,  but  to  use  the  one  currently  marketed  for  adults  in  study 
2207. 
Regarding  study  2207,  although  the  MAH  conclusion  was  that  1.2  mg/kg  twice  daily    would  be  an 
appropriate dose to be tested in further clinical studies in children the CHMP was not convinced and the 
MAH  was  requested  to  address  several  issues.  First,  the  issue  of  the  linearity  of  Cmax,  as  this  PK 
parameter increases more than proportionally with higher doses (e.g. from a mean of 456 ng/ml in the 
0.75  mg/kg  group  to  2599  ng/ml  in  the  1.25  mg/kg  group).  The  appropriateness  of  normalising 
clearance by body weight, i.e. weight-normalized clearance (CLW) was consequently raised by CHMP, 
taking  into  account  the  lack  of  proportionality  in  Cmax  and  other  issues  related  to  the  calculation  of 
AUC0-24h  such  as  the  lack  of  sampling  times  at  12  hours  (as  AUC0-24h  was  calculated  by  doubling  the 
AUCτ).  Similarly,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  the  individual  clearance  values  (CL)  by  dosing 
group and overall, and plots of weight, BMI and age vs. CL and CLW by dosing group. Furthermore, a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of both paediatric trials was requested by CHMP.  
According  to  the  information  provided  by  the  MAH  in  its  responses  to  the  first  CHMP  RSI,  no  firm 
conclusion  on  linearity  could  be  drawn  based  on  the  Cmax  values  reported  from  study  2207,  due  to 
sample timing issues. As Cmax values higher than expected have been observed in both paediatric PK

trials,    incomplete  distribution  as  a  consequence  of  the  short  time  of  infusion  could  also  be  an 
alternative explanation. The CHMP considered that it was advisable to prolong the time of infusion to 
60  minutes  in  further  paediatric  trials.  Additional  data  provided  in  response  to  the  CHMP  questions 
suggested  that  clearance  is  not  dependent  on  the  dose  administered,  but  is  mainly  related  to  body 
weight  (i.e.  in  smaller  children  clearance  is  lower),  although  the  variability  in  clearance  explained  by 
body weight seems limited, while no influence of age or dose is observed (within the narrow age range 
and dosing regimens studied in study 2207).  
From  a safety perspective  CHMP  agreed that  no new safety signals have  arisen with regards  to  what 
had  been  observed  in  adults  with  the  exception  of  QTc  prolongation  in  a  child  in  the  1-mg/kg  group 
that has been reported as probably related to tigecycline. At CHMP request, the MAH provided the case 
narrative. As QTc prolongation is considered as a potential risk in the safety specifications of the Risk 
Management Plan of Tygacil, the CHMP agreed that no further actions were necessary as this adverse 
event is reviewed in the PSURs. 
The  MAH  performed  an  exposure-safety  relationship  analysis  and  concluded  that  there  is  no 
contribution of tigecycline Cmax or AUC0-24h to the occurrence of nausea or vomiting. However, CHMP 
considers that what the raw data show is that nausea and vomiting are dose-dependent.   
Based  on  the  data  presented  by  the  MAH  the  CHMP  agreed  to  the  inclusion  of  the  above 
pharmacokinetic and safety data from the PK paediatric trials in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Tygacil 
SmPC. 
Considering  the  newly  available  data  on  the  adverse  events  from  the  above  paediatric  studies  in 
connection with an appropriate update of the Product information to reflect them, the CHMP considered 
that the benefit–risk remains positive. 
4.  Conclusion 
On  21  July  2011  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
 
To update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Tygacil SmPC with paediatric PK and safety information 
based  on  the  assessment  of  paediatric  studies  3074K4-2207-WW  and  3074A1-110-US,  both 
previously submitted and assessed. This variation was requested by the CHMP on 20 January 2011.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The  EPAR  will  be  updated  following  Commission  Decision  for  this  variation.  In  particular  the  EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
EPAR scope: 
To  update  sections  4.2,  4.8  and  5.2  of  the  Tygacil  SmPC  with  paediatric  PK  and  safety  information 
based on the results of paediatric studies 3074K4-2207-WW and 3074A1-110-US, both submitted and 
assessed in previous procedures. This variation was requested by the CHMP on 20 January 2011.  
Summary / scientific discussion: 
Additional data from an open label, single, ascending dose study conducted in children aged 8-16 years 
and  aiming  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety/tolerability  of  single  intravenous  doses

(0.5  mg/kg,  1  mg/kg  and  2  mg/kg)  of  tigecycline  and  a  phase  2,  multicentre,  open-label,  ascending 
multiple-dose study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tigecycline in paediatric 
patients  from  8  to  less  than  12  years  of  age  with  selected  serious  infections:  complicated 
intraabdominal infections (cIAI), complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community 
acquired pneumonia(CAP) lead to an update of the Tygacil SmpC with a synopsis of the PK parameters 
from  the two studies and  with the information  that  the safety data observed in the multiple-dose  PK 
study, (although limited due to the small number of children enrolled and to the fact that 3 doses were 
tested)  was  consistent  with  the  type  of  adverse  events  already  reported  by  adult  patients  such  as 
nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis etc. Overall, the CHMP agreed that safety and efficacy of tigecycline in 
children needs to be demonstrated and agreed to include the new paediatric data in the Tygacil SmPC.

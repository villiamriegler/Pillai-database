Introduction 
Eurartesim is an anti-malarial agent for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria in adults, children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more. The approved 
Eurartesim formulation is a conventional fixed combination immediate release film-coated tablet 
containing Piperaquine Tetraphosphate (PQP) and Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) as drug substances in the 
strength combinations 320mg/40mg and 160mg/20mg intended for adult (adult presentation) and 
children between 5 and 25 kg (paediatric presentation), respectively. 
Since small children are not able to swallow tablets, a commitment was undertaken by the Applicant to 
develop a more suitable formulation for more easy and accurate drug administration in paediatric 
patients. The pharmaceutical and clinical development of a paediatric formulation has been discussed 
and approved by the PDCO within a PIP procedure (EMEA-000153-PIP01-07). 
At the time of the approval of Eurartesim (October 2011), the PIP was not finalized yet; therefore, the 
completion of the paediatric plan was included in the list of post-approval obligations reported in the 
Risk Management Plan. 
Originally, the study proposed in the approved PIP was an open-label study to evaluate 
pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy of two strength oral dispersible tablets (80/10 and 160/20 mg 
PQP/DHA), in 200 paediatric patients aged 6-12 months with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. 
According to the commitment undertaken within the RMP, the protocol synopsis for the clinical study, 
already approved by the PDCO, was submitted to the CHMP in April 2012. 
The Assessment Report received from CHMP in August 2012 included the following comment: 
‘The formulation to be used in this study is different to the one approved. Since the applicant proposes 
to replace the film-coated tablets with the dispersible tablets in this age group, it is not clear how 
these formulations will be compared to justify the PK characteristics and dosing schedule. If aiming to 
bridge to the original clinical studies, an additional group taking the conventional film-coated tablet 
would be expected. The applicant should justify the lack of such a group and demonstrate how this 
issue will be addressed.’ 
Following this request, the MAH modified the study design by adding a group of 100 children taking the 
conventional treatment (crushed film coated tablets) and introducing a PK/PD analysis aiming to bridge 
to the original clinical studies carried out with the film-coated tablets in paediatric population. 
A request for modification of the approved PIP was then submitted to include the changes strongly 
recommended by the CHMP as well as postponement of the timelines for completion of the study. The 
RfM of the PIP was finally approved in August 2016 with the commitment to submit the study report to 
the CHMP and the PDCO as soon as finalised. 
The approved study is coded ST3073-ST3074-DM12002 and titled “A phase II, open-label, multicentre, 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and safety study of a new paediatric Eurartesim dispersible 
formulation and crushed film coated Eurartesim tablet, in infant patients with Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria”. 
The study started on November 2013, the in vivo phase was completed on 02 June 2015 (last patient 
out), the database freeze occurred on 11 December 2015, due to the complexity to retrieve all the 
study documents, filter papers and blood smear for central readings from African sites and finally to 
obtain the centralised readings. The bioanalytical report was issued on 12 November 2015, the 
statistical analytical report for efficacy and safety data was issued on 31 May 2016, the PK/PD analysis

report was issued on 8 November 2016, and finally the integrated clinical study report was issued on 
27 January 2017. 
On 3 February 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Eurartesim, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study ST3073-ST3074-DM-12-002 “a phase II, open-label, pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamics and safety study of a new paediatric Eurartesim dispersible formulation and 
crushed film coated Eurartesim tablet, in infant patients with Plasmodium falciparum Malaria” is part of 
a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package 
(i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by December 2017. A line listing of all the 
concerned studies is annexed. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Eurartesim new paediatric pharmaceutical Formulation 
The new paediatric formulation used in this study is a water dispersible tablet. The pharmaceutical 
development of this formulation was conducted taking into consideration the chemical-physical 
properties of both APIs present in the fixed combination. In order to guarantee an acceptable 
palatability for children, the first step of the dispersible tablet development was to mask the bitter 
taste of piperaquine. This was achieved by microencapsulation of piperaquine particles and addition of 
a flavouring agent. The microencapsulation process consists in applying a thin polymeric coating 
material to the small particles in a uniform and reproducible way: ethylcellulose was used as the 
coating agent. 
As a second step, the two active substances (PQP and DHA) were separated into two distinct layers to 
form a bilayer tablet, to avoid enhancing degradation of dihydroartemisinin due to the presence of 
water and phosphoric acid contained in PQP. 
An industrial scale batch of the bilayer dispersible tablets has been used in this study. 
CHMP comments: 
No module 3 has been provided with the current submission. The applicant should clarify whether this 
has  been  previously  submitted  and  assessed.  Information  on  CMC,  qualitative  and  quantitative 
composition, manufacturing process as well as in-vitro dissolution results needs to be provided. 
The  MAH  should  also  clarify  if  both  strengths  of  the  dispersible  formulation  were  produced  at  the 
industrial batch size. The batch size for each of the formulations should be presented.

Malaria 
Description 
Study Title 
A phase II, open-label, multicentre, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and safety study of a new 
paediatric Eurartesim dispersible formulation and crushed film coated Eurartesim tablet, in infant 
patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 
Methods 
Study Design  
The present study was a randomized open label study of 300 children (aged 6 to 12 months); a 
comparison between the approved tablet, crushed and administered with water, and the dispersible 
tablet was conducted in order to evaluate population pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety 
parameters. It was multi-centre, with all centres in Africa. The first patient was enrolled on 12 
November 2013 and the last patient completed on 02 June 2015. 
The two arms were allocated with a ratio of 2:1 (dispersible vs crushed film coated formulations). 
Study Objectives 
Primary Objective: To assess the PK of the Eurartesim (PQP/DHA) new water dispersible formulation, 
film coated tablet and crushed film coated tablet in venous blood samples during and after a 
therapeutic course of Eurartesim in paediatric population. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of Eurartesim in treating uncomplicated malaria episodes and its ability 
in protecting patients from reinfections and/or recrudescence. 
To assess the PK/PD relationship of Eurartesim in malaria patients. 
To evaluate safety and tolerability of Eurartesim in infants.  
Methodology 
A seven-sites phase II, randomised, open label, two-arm parallel group study. Three-hundred sub-
Saharan African (from 6 to ≤ 12 months of age) infants visiting the study clinics and for whom a 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/103576/2018

diagnosis of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (according to the WHO criteria) had to be confirmed 
by a microscopic parasitological diagnosis and quantitative parasitaemia, and whose parents or 
guardians signed informed consent were included in the study. Two hundred children had to be treated 
with Eurartesim dispersible tablet formulations (strength according to body weight), while one hundred 
children had to be treated with crushed film-coated tablet. An allocation ratio of 2:1 (dispersible versus 
crushed film coated formulation) was applied. Data coming from the group administered with the 
crushed film coated formulation had to be utilised to strengthen the population pharmacokinetic model 
built up on data coming from the film coated formulation. Dispersible tablets or crushed film-coated 
tablets were administered for three days (study Days 0, 1 and 2) under supervision. Follow-up visits 
on study Days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 were conducted as out-patients.

Efficacy: Thick and thin blood smears to verify the presence of P. falciparum and to calculate the 
asexual and sexual parasite density. PCR to genotype P. falciparum. 
Safety: Haematology & biochemistry, ECG, vital signs, patient symptoms & physical examination, 
adverse events (AEs). 
Study population 
The analysis populations were as follows: 
PK population: The pharmacokinetic analysis population included all the data from samplings taken 
under regular treatment course with no major PK specific protocol violations (e.g. use of not permitted 
concomitant medication, violation of major inclusion/exclusion criteria). The PK population has been 
used for the PK analysis. 
ITT population: The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population included all patients taking at least one dose of 
the study drug. This population has been used for the Efficacy and Safety analysis. As for the Safety 
data presentation, it has been referenced as Safety Population. 
PP population: The Per Protocol (PP) population included all patients who took the complete treatment 
and who did not meet any major protocol violations. The PP population has been used for the Efficacy 
analysis and the PK/PD analysis. 
Dose justification 
Each patient received a specific amount of drug according to his/her body weight once a day for three 
consecutive days. 
The daily dose was to be re-administered in case of vomiting within 30 minutes from the drug 
administration, while half dose was re-administered in case of vomiting occurring between 30 and 60 
minutes after the drug administration. In case of repeated vomiting the drug was not be re-
administered more than once and another drug for malaria treatment (rescue treatment) was adopted. 
Formulations used 
The new Paediatric eurartesim dispersible tablet formulation was provided in two different strengths: 
80/10 or 160/20 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP)/dihydroartemisinin (DHA) while the film coated 
tablet was a 160/20 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP) /dihydroartemisinin (DHA) formulation. 
Due to possible food interaction, the first dose of eurartesim was administered as soon as the patient 
was randomized in the study and preferably no food was administered in the following three hours. For 
the second and the third drug administration the child was to be fed three hours before the scheduled 
drug intake. Those infants still requiring breast feeding received only maternal milk. 
Concomitant Treatments

No other investigational drugs were allowed during the study. 
Rescue treatments 
Patients with treatment failure were to be treated and followed up as per local guidelines for malaria 
treatment till full recovery. 
Study procedures 
All the children from Day 0 (the day of the first study drug intake) to Day 3 remained admitted at the 
study clinic under supervision. Blood samples were collected over 72 h and then on Days 7, 14 and 21, 
according to the sparse blood sampling collections.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments: 
In order to minimize the blood sampling in infants, patients were randomly divided into 10 blood 
sampling groups for both treatments (water dispersible and crushed film coated tablet) and only 2 
blood draws (1,5 mL each) per group were taken. The pharmacokinetic assessment was performed 
using analysis population PK approach because of the sparse sampling. 
Based on previous clinical PK data, optimal sampling design was performed by using the appropriate 
software (e.g.ADAPT5, WinPOPT, PFIM, etc.). The D-optimal design option was used to determine the 
optimal sampling design. 
The blood sampling time scheme presented for both DHA and PQ were not exactly the ones that were 
minimizing the objective function because some of them were below the quantitation limit, others were 
rounded to comply with the outpatient study visits. 
Blood sampling for PK analysis of DHA in plasma collected as follows: 
Safety and Tolerability 
-  Blood samples collected for Haematology, biochemistry (BUN, Glucose, Creatinine, ALT/AST, 
Total Bilirubine, electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Cl) 
- 
ECGs (triplicate readings) on Day 0 (at screening), single ECG on D2 (i.e. before the last drug 
administration) as well as triplicate ECG on Day 2 (i.e. 4 - 6 hours after the last drug 
administration). 
- 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events recording collected at Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 7, 
Day 14 (±1), Day 21 (-1), Day 28 (±3) and Day 42  
Efficacy assessments 
-  Day 28 PCR-corrected Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR). 
- 
 Day 28 Crude (PCR-uncorrected) ACPR.

Sample size: 
The sample size for the target population PK study was estimated on the basis of the previous PK study 
in which 10 children per group for a total of 3 groups of blood sampling (5 blood samples per children 
per group) were included. Due to blood sampling limit of two blood samples per child, ten groups of 30 
children each (20 children receiving the dispersible formulation and 10 children receiving the crushed 
film coated tablets in accordance to a 2:1 ratio of dispersible vs crushed formulations) were necessary 
to define the DHA and PQ PK profiles, according to a very sparse sampling scheme.

Demographic Characteristics 
Subjects were generally in balance across the groups. Physical examination findings showed that lung 
abnormalities were reported as the most frequent abnormalities (33% in the PQP/DHA dispersible 
formulation group, 23% in the PQP/DHA crushed formulation group) followed by abdomen (14% in 
both groups), ears, nose and throat (9% in the PQP/DHA dispersible formulation group, 5% in the 
PQP/DHA crushed formulation group) and skin abnormalities (7% in the PQP/DHA dispersible 
formulation group, 5% in the PQP/DHA crushed formulation group). Nearly half of all patients had 
fever reported as other findings in the physical examination. Most of these clinical features were 
consistent with acute malaria. 
Antipyretic drugs were the most frequent previous medications: 15% and 7% of patients in the 
PQP/DHA dispersible and PQP/DHA crushed formulation groups, respectively, received paracetamol. 
Antipyretic and antiinfective agents were the most frequent concomitant medications. In addition, 
patients experiencing malaria recurrences were treated with antimalarial drugs. 
Treatment compliance was ensured by the study nurse or investigator supervising dose administration 
and observing patients for one hour after dosing. A patient was compliant with treatment if 100% of 
study medication was taken. Patients who vomited after first treatment intake but did not vomit again 
after re-dosing were counted as having assumed the treatment as scheduled. Patients who vomited 
after re-dosing or experienced an ETF before the third dose (in the first two days of treatment) were 
categorised as not taking the required percentage of treatment. 
One-hundred eighty-nine (189) patients (95.0%) in the PQP/DHA dispersible formulation group and 95 
patients (96.0%) in the PQP/DHA crushed formulation group were compliant to study treatment for ITT 
population, while for the PP population, the compliers were 172 (99.4%) in the PQP/DHA dispersible 
formulation group and 84 (100.0%) in the DHA/ PQP crushed formulation group. The only patient 
experiencing an ETF after the first drug intake (because of signs of severe malaria) and not having 
reached 100% compliance was included in the PP population although the 100% compliance was 
requested as criterion for inclusion; in fact, the patient reached a clinical endpoint. This decision was 
taken to maintain a conservative approach for the analysis of efficacy.

PK AND PK/PD RESULTS: 
DHA population PK modelling: The final model for DHA was a 1- compartment PK model with 2 zero 
order absorption processes and 2 lag times. 
PQ population PK modelling: The final model for PQ in plasma was a 3-compartment PK model with a 
lag time, and zero order absorption. The figure below presents the PK model for PQ. Enterohepatic 
recycling was fitted by adding an additional lag time for the emptying of the gallbladder with a dose 
equal to the amount of drug excreted since last gallbladder emptying. 
PK/ PD modelling: The final PK/PD model was a 1-compartment model with a parasite growing rate, 
and killing rate as a function of DHA and PQ concentration. The figure below presents the model for 
parasite count as a function of DHA and PQ cincentrations. An Onset of effect parameter was used to 
model the delay between the appearance of DHA and PQ in plasma and the killing effect of the drug. 
DHA killing rate was modeled with an Emax function and the PQ killing rate was modeled with a 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

sigmoidal Emax function. Antagonism between the effects of DHA and PQ incorporated into the model. 
A mixture model with two groups was included in the model for the parameter DHAmax since it had a 
bimodal distribution probably due to a different parasite population with different resistance to the 
effect of DHA. It was estimated that approximately 57% of the parasite population developed some 
resistance to the effect of DHA. 
The DHA PK model predicted that Frel was higher in patients than in healthy volunteers, (253%). The 
Frel was also influenced by the formulation being lower for the water dispersible formulation compared 
to the old formulation (73%). 
The first zero order adsorption process accounted for the absorption of about 31-32% of DHA dose. 
The lag time associated with the first zero order was approximately 19.6 and 14 minutes for the old 
and new formulation, respectively, and decreased to 9.7 minutes when the old formulation was 
crushed. 
The duration of the first zero order adsorption (Tk0_1) process for a typical child under fed condition 
increased to 42 and 35.3 minutes for the old and new formulation, respectively compared to adult 
(22.2 and 18.7 minutes, for the old and new formulation, respectively). Either in adults or in children 
TK¬01 was slower under fed condition. 
The DHA model predicted that the second zero order adsorption process (Tk0_2) was influenced only 
by food, being slower when Eurartesim was administered under fed condition (1 h 26 min and 2 h 11 
min under fasting and fed condition respectively). CL/F and Vc/F were not influenced by any covariate; 
they were typically 3.08 L/h/kg and 4.30 L/kg, respectively. The residual variability of DHA model was 
28.8%. 
The PQ PK model predicted that Frel was lower in patients than in healthy volunteers, (58.8%). Frel for 
the first PQ dose was 80.6% compared to the subsequent PQ doses. Only under fed condition, PQ Frel 
was influenced by the formulation, being 179, 111 and 89.7% with the film coated tablet, the crushed 
film coated tablet and the water dispersible formulation, respectively. 
The PQ PK model predicted that lag time associated with the zero order process was longer with the 
film coated tablet (46 min) compared to the crushed tabled (13 min) or the water dispersible 
formulation (20 min). In addition, PQ lag time was influenced by the food. 
The PQ duration of the zero order adsorption (Tk0) process was longer in patients that in healthy 
volunteers (2.9 h vs 3.8 h), for both Tk0 was shorter with crushed tablet (2.2 and 2.9 h in healthy 
volunteers and patients, respectively). The formulation did not influenced the Tk0 duration.

By the model, the PQ CL/F was predicted higher in healthy subjects than in patients (0.845 L/h/kg vs 
0.608 L/h/kg). Furthermore, the apparent distributional clearance between the central and peripheral 2 
compartments (CLdt/F) was influenced by the sex being lower for female than male (1.02 vs 1.34 
L/h/kg). 
All the other PK parameters for PQ were not influenced by any covariate. they were typically 3.08 
L/h/kg and 4.30 L/kg, respectively. The typical value for Vc/F, CLd/F, Vp/F, and Vdt/F were 25.2 L/kg, 
3.80 L/h/kg, 43.6 L/kg, and 464 L/kg, respectively. The Tgall emptying for a typical subject was 
estimated to be approximate 1.5 hour after the lag time. The residual variability of this model was 
32.2%. 
A PK/PD model was developed to describe the parasite count as a function of the PK of PQ and DHA 
plasma concentration. The PK/PD model predicted in vivo IC50 for DHA and PQ similar to those 
reported in literature from in vitro studies (0.267 and 9.4ng/mL for DHA and PQ respectively). The 
model estimated two DHA MIC: 0.0124 and 0.0340 ng/mL for a typical patient with non-resistant and 
resistant parasite population, respectively, it was estimated that approximately 57% of the parasite 
population developed some resistance to the effect of DHA. Conversely, the DHA MPC was the same for 
both the parasite population (26.4ng/mL). The MIC and MPC estimated for PQ were 8.77 and 
12.7ng/mL, respectively. 
Aiming to compare the PK and PK/PD profiles for crushed film coated and water dispersible 
formulations, simulations were carried out on 200 male and female virtual paediatric patients aging 
between 6 and 12 months involved in a 2-way crossover design study with the two treatments. 
MICs and MPCs 
The typical inhibition concentrations that give 50% of the maximum effect (IC50) from the PD model 
were close to the in vitro IC50 reported in the literature. The reported in vitro IC50 range for DHA is 
0.9 nM to 2.6 nM (0.256 ng/mL to 0.739 ng/mL) and the estimated in vivo DHA IC50 for a typical 
patient was 0.267 ng/mL, which is within the range reported in the literature. It should be noted that 
the %RSE for DHA50 was 33.1% which was the largest %RSE for the typical value in patients. It was 
probably due to the fact that the LOQ for DHA was much higher in these studies with a value of 10 
ng/mL compared to DHA50 (2.267 ng/mL). The in vivo PQ50 for a typical patient was 9.40 ng/mL, 
which was close to the range reported for the in vitro IC50 for PQ, which ranged between 25.1 nM to 
49.7 nM (13.4 ng/mL to 26.6 ng/mL). 
The MIC was the concentration that results in a parasite killing rate equal to the parasite growth rate, 
i.e. no parasite growth. The minimum parasiticidal concentration (MPC) was the concentration that 
results in at least 99% of the maximum killing rate for the drug, i.e. a concentration with the 
maximum effect of the medication. 
The comparison between the old crushed and the new formulation for a typical paediatric patient 
weighing 8 kg are presented. The below figures depict the two formulations for a typical patient with 
and without resistance to the effect of DHA. The maximum concentration was higher for the old 
crushed formulation compared to the new formulation for both DHA and PQ. However, the differences

in PD response for the two formulations were comparable. Both formulations exhibited an onset of 
effect approximately 8 hours following the first dose and rapidly reached a killing rate close to DHAmax 
at approximately 8.4 hours postdose. Both formulations reached high steady killing rates for duration 
of approximately 4 to 5 hours and then declined down to a killing rate of 0.234 1/h by approximately 
23 hours after the first dose for the new formulation and 0.4 hour later for the old formulation. Then 
both formulations’ killing rates were steady at the maximum killing rate of PQ until the effect of the 
second dose took place. 
Simulated Population 
Aiming to compare the PK and PD profiles of Eurartesim dispersible (new) and crushed (old) 
formulations, Pop PK and PK/PD final model parameters were used to simulate patient’s PK and PD 
profiles. A 2-way crossover design study with two treatments (old crushed and new formulation) was 
used. 
Two hundred (200) virtual paediatric patients, aged between 6 and 12 months infected with malaria 
were created. The paediatric population was simulated according to the following order: sex, age 
(assumed uniformly distributed), body weight (according to the formulas from the WHO in the Training 
Course on Child Growth Assessment, and Eurartesim dose.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The simulated population consisted of 113 male and 87 female paediatric patients having frequency of 
the age and body weight (descriptive summary) as presented in Table 11.6.2-1 and Table 11.6.2-2 
The dose administered in the simulation followed the dosing regimen in the Study ST3073/ST3074-
DM-12-002. If the body weight was less than 7 kg, then the patient was receiving 80/10 mg PQP/DHA. 
If the body weight was greater or equal to 7 kg and less than 13 kg, then the patient received 160/20 
mg PQP/DHA, and if the body weight was greater or equal to 13 kg, then the patient received 320/40 
mg PQP/DHA. 
Bioequivalence 
PQ and DHA concentrations were simulated with a concentration at every 0.1 hours between 0 and 24 
hour. The PK parameters Cmax, area under the curve up to the last measurable concentration 
(AUClast) and area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) were evaluated using the 
simulated concentrations between 0 and 24 hour for PQ and 0 to 12 hour for DHA. The simulated 
concentrations at the beginning of the profile that were BLQ were set to zero and those after the first 
measurable concentration were set to missing. The apparent elimination rate constant (Kel) was 
estimated with all the data points following but not including Cmax. If the slope used to evaluate the 
Kel was positive, AUCinf was set to missing. AUClast was calculated by using the linear-trapezoidal 
method. 
Mean, median, 5th and 95th percentile of the DHA and PQ simulated concentrations for each 
formulation are presented below.

The geometric mean ratios (GMR), lower and upper 90%CI for bioequivalence assessment and the 
geometric CV% for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf obtained from the simulation of the two formulations in 
200 paediatric male and female patients are presented Table 11.6.3-1. The point estimate for the 
bioequivalence ratios of the new dispersible formulation over the old crushed formulation were within 
the 80-125% acceptance range for PQ but not for DHA, as expected from Pop PK analyses since the 
ratios from the PQ and DHA models were 100% and 73.1%, respectively. The geometric CV% for the

new formulation were generally lower than for the old formulation, suggesting a lower inter-individual 
variability, as expected for an age-appropriate formulation. 
Time above MIC (TMIC) and Time above MPC (TMPC) 
As already described the MIC is drug concentration that inhibits the parasite growing rate; while the 
MPC is the drug concentration with the maximum effect of the medication, therefore the time above 
MIC (TMIC) and time above MPC (TMPC) are the time interval during which a patient is exposed to 
effective drug concentrations. 
The TMIC and TMPC were calculated following the PK simulation and the descriptive statistics are 
presented Table 11.6.4-1. The mean TMPC and TMIC for PQ for both formulations were 
approximatively the same at 23 hours. The old crushed formulation remained on average 
approximately 1 and 0.5 hours longer above the MPC and MIC for DHA compared to the new 
formulation, respectively. 
Time to Parasite Clearance 
The 200 simulated virtual PK patients were used with the final parasite count model to simulate the 
parasite count without output noise for a typical paediatric patient. Prior to simulating the Parasite 
Count, a binomial distribution with parameters size = 1 and prob = 0.4285593 was used to determine 
if the parasite was resistant to the effect of DHA for each patient. Seventy-three (73) out of the 200 
simulated patients had malaria parasite sensitive to the effect of DHA. Also the initial parasite counts 
were simulated (the same within patient for each treatment). A transformation of the initial parasite 
count was used to have a distribution close to a normal distribution. The transformation of the data at

an exponent of 1/3 was used. If a simulated initial parasite count was outside the measured parasite 
count, it was re-simulated until a value within the observed range was obtained. 
The summary statistics for the first time that the parasite count decreased below 0.5 are presented in 
Table 11.6.5-1 for the new and old crushed formulations. On average, both treatments require 
approximately 34 hours before the parasite count reached zero. The CVs for the new and old crushed 
formulations were 35.7 % and 35.9%, respectively. The individual plots for these typical patients 
without output noise are presented in Section 16.4.2. 
The same 200 virtual patients in the 2-way crossover used for the simulations for the PK were used for 
the simulations of the parasite count. For each profile 200 simulations were performed and the mean 
of the LOG(parasite count + 2) was used. Table 11.6.5-2 presents the descriptive statistics. On 
average the new formulation reached a parasite count level below 0.5 for the first time 
approximatively 1 hour faster when compared to the old crushed formulation. The CVs for the new and 
old crushed formulations were 39.3% and 37.6%, respectively. The plots for the mean, median, 5th 
and 95th percentile of the simulated parasite count for both formulations can be found in Figure 
11.6.5-1.

PHARMACOKINETIC AND PK/PD CONCLUSIONS 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the PK of Eurartesim (PQP/DHA) in a new water 
dispersible formulation, film coated tablet, and crushed film coated tablet in venous blood samples 
during and after a therapeutic course of Eurartesim in a paediatric population. The primary endpoint 
was to estimate the population and individual PK parameters and variability of PQ and DHA in 
paediatric populations administered with Eurartesim. 
The final model for DHA was a 1-compartment PK model with two zero-order absorption processes 
each with a lag time. The covariates included in the final model were FORM and PAT on the relative 
bioavailability, PAT on Alpha (parameter used to calculate proportion of the absorbed drug for the first 
and second absorption process), CRSH and FORM on Lag_1, CHILD, FED and FORM on Tk0_1, and FED 
on Lag_2 and Tk0_2. 
The final model for PQ was a 3-compartment PK model with a zero-order absorption process and a lag 
time. Enterohepatic recycling was fitted by adding an additional lag time for the emptying of the 
gallbladder with a dose equal to the amount of drug excreted since the last gallbladder emptying. The 
covariates included in the final model were FED and PAT on the relative bioavailability, CRSH and FORM 
on FrelFED, FED, CRSH, and FORM on Lag, CRCH and PAT on Tk0, PAT on CL/F, and SEX on CLdt/F.

One of the secondary objectives of the study was to assess the PK/PD relationship of Eurartesim in 
malaria patients (adult and paediatric populations). The objective was to obtain a comprehensive 
PK/PD relationship for DHA and PQ after administration of Eurartesim as a film coated tablet, crushed 
film coated tablet, or water dispersible tablet in malaria patients. Modeling of P. falciparum parasite 
density was performed and the effect of covariates on the PD modeling was explored. 
A PK/PD model was developed to describe the parasite count as a function of the PK of PQ and DHA 
plasma concentration. The model was a 1-compartment model with a parasite growing rate, and killing 
rate as a function of DHA and PQ concentration. An Onset of effect parameter was used to model the 
delay between the appearance of DHA and PQ in plasma and the killing effect of the drug. DHA killing 
rate was modeled with an Emax function and the PQ killing rate was modeled with a sigmoidal Emax 
function. Antagonism between the effects of DHA and PQ incorporated into the model by taking the 
parasite killing rate to be the maximum between the killing rate of DHA and PQ. The initial conditions 
(value in the compartment at time zero) were fixed to the measured parasite count and the fitted Y 
was equal to LOG(parasite count + 2). The structure of the variance-covariance matrix was diagonal. A 
mixture model with two groups was included in the model for the parameter DHAmax since it had a 
bimodal distribution probably due to a different parasite population with different resistance to the 
effect of DHA. It was estimated that approximately 57% of the parasite population developed some 
resistance to the effect of DHA. 
The PK for PQ was bioequivalent between the new water dispersible formulation and crushed film 
coated tablet. Conversely, the PK for DHA was not bioequivalent between the new water dispersible 
formulation and crushed film coated tablet, however, the effects between the two treatments were 
comparable. 
The applicant states that the simulations confirmed that the PK for PQ but not for DHA was 
bioequivalent between the new water dispersible formulation and crushed film coated tablet. The mean 
PQ TMPC was about 23 h for both the formulations while the mean DHA TMPC differed of about 1 h 
between the formulations. Finally, the simulated time to parasite clearances differed for about 1 h 
between the Eurartesim crushed film coated tablet and the water dispersible formulations, indicating 
that the effects between the two treatments were comparable.

Summary of Efficacy Results  
At Day 28, in both treatment groups, uncorrected ACPR was very similar in the ITT population (80.9% 
and 80.8% for the dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively). In the PP population, 
uncorrected ACPR were 91.3% and 95.2% for the dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively. 
The two-sided 95% asymptotic CIs were: -0.094-0.096, Δ = 0.10% and -0.101-0.023, Δ = -3.9% for 
the ITT and PP populations, respectively. 
At Day 28, in both treatment groups, corrected ACPR was similar in the ITT population (86.9% and 
84.9% for the dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively. In the PP population, corrected ACPR 
were 98.3% and 100% for the dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively. The two-sided 95% 
asymptotic CIs were: -0.064-0.106, Δ = 2.1% and -0.037-0.002, Δ = -1.7% for the ITT and PP 
populations, respectively. 
At Day 42 in the ITT population, corrected ACPR was 85.9% and 82.8% for the dispersible and crushed 
formulations, respectively. In the PP population, corrected ACPR were 96.5% and 96.4% for the 
dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively. The two-sided 95% asymptotic CIs were: -0.053-
0.178, Δ = 62% and -0.078-0.151, Δ = 3.7% for the ITT and PP populations, respectively. 
At Day 42 in the ITT population, uncorrected ACPR was 67.84% and 61.62% for the dispersible and 
crushed formulations, respectively. In the PP population, uncorrected ACPR were 76.30% and 72.62% 
for the dispersible and crushed formulations, respectively. The two-sided 95% asymptotic CIs were: -
0.058-0.120, Δ = 3.1% and -0.047-0.049, Δ = 0.1% for the ITT and PP populations, respectively. 
With respect to the PCR-Corrected/Uncorrected ACPR at Day 28 and at Day 42, the comparison 
between PQP/DHA dispersible formulation group and PQP/DHA crushed formulation group showed no 
clinically significant differences, considering overall the ITT and the PP populations (all the CIs 
contained the value 0). 
The Day 28 PCR-Corrected ACPR obtained in this study were similar to those obtained in the previous 
Phase III trial conducted in African children, 90.4% and 95.7% in the ITT and PP populations 
respectively.

Within Day 28, and in the ITT population, the incidence of new P. falciparum infections documented by 
PCR analysis were 6% and 4% in the PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, 
respectively. The incidence of recrudescences documented by PCR analysis were 1.0% and 0% in the 
PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, respectively. 
Within Day 42, and in the ITT population, the incidence of new P. falciparum infections were 18.1% 
and 21.2% in the PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, respectively. The incidence of 
recrudescence were 2.5% and 1.0% in the PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, 
respectively. 
When estimated by the Kaplan- Meier method, at Day 42 the incidence of new P. falciparum infections 
was 19.8% vs 23.6% in the PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, respectively (ITT 
population); similar results were obtained in the PP population. 
In addition, when estimated by the Kaplan- Meier method, at Day 42, the incidence of recrudescences 
was 3.1 % vs 1.3% in the PQP/DHA dispersible and crushed formulation groups, respectively (ITT 
population); similar results were obtained in the PP population. 
As for PCR-Corrected /Uncorrected ACPR, the comparison between the PQP/DHA dispersible and 
crushed formulation groups on time to new infections and time to recrudescences were not statistically 
significant in both ITT and PP populations by Log-Rank tests. 
The observed cases of recrudescence by Day 28 were comparable with those observed in the previous 
Phase III study in African children in which the rate of true recrudescence was 1.4% in the ITT 
population and 1.5% in the PP population. In the same Phase III study, by Day 42, the recrudescences 
were equal to 4.0% and 4.3% in the ITT and PP populations, higher than in the present study in which 
≤ 2.5% of patients had recrudescences. 
Treatment Failure: Other than new infections/recrudescences other reasons for treatment failure were: 
There was only one ETF in the study and this was related to a complication in severe malaria for a 
patient enrolled about 48 hours from the starting of the malaria symptoms. The complication occurred 
about 20 hours after the first study drug intake and could be related to the late starting of the anti-
malarial treatment. 
There only patient who experienced an ETF was randomized to the dispersible formulation group. This 
patient (site 03 screening number 22 randomisation number 1085) presented at site three days after 
the start of symptoms (cough and cold) and fever. In those previous three days, the child was treated 
at home with paracetamol and vitamins. During the first day of treatment, the patient presented high 
fever and about 20 hours after the first study drug intake developed polypnea and severe anaemia. 
Worsening in severe malaria was diagnosed and the child was treated with parenteral artesunate. He 
finally recovered. 
Repeated vomiting was more frequent in the dispersible formulation group respect to the crushed 
formulation group (10 vs 2 cases) while withdrawal before Day 28 was more frequent in the crushed 
versus the dispersible formulation group, 9 vs 4 cases, respectively. 
Overall, the sum of the ETFs and LTFs in the ITT population was equal to 15 cases (7.5%) in the 
PQP/DHA dispersible formulation group and 4 cases (4.0%) in the crushed formulation group. In the PP 
population the cases were 15 (8.7%) and 4 (4.8%) respectively for the dispersible and crushed 
formulation groups. This difference was due mainly due to the difference in LTFs related to new 
infections.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/103576/2018  
Page 22/37 
 
 
 
 
 
By Day 42, there was an increase in number of LTFs in the crushed formulation group; therefore, the 
final figures of treatment failures were 42 episodes (21.2%) in the PQP/DHA dispersible formulation 
group and 22 (22.1%) in the PQP/DHA crushed formulation group. 
Proportion of aparasitaemic patients and time to parasitaemia clearance: In ITT population, less than 
half of the patients were still parasitaemic (46.2% and 48.5% in the dispersible and crushed 
formulation groups) at Day 1 afternoon check and only 3.0% and 2.0% were still parasitaemic at Day 
2 afternoon check. On Day 3 for dispersible formulation group, all patients but one were aparasitaemic, 
belonging to the dispersible group. This patient was then found aparasitaemic at the check on Day 7. 
There were no differences in the parasitaemia clearance time in both the two studied groups, as 
indicated by the Log-Rank test (p-value=0.653). 
Proportion of afebrile patients and time to fever clearance: In the ITT population, on Day 0, 40.2% vs. 
38.4% of patients were afebrile in the dispersible and crushed formulation groups, respectively. At the 
end of Day 1, 82.4% vs. 89.9% of patients were afebrile; on Day 3 almost all patients were afebrile. 
The analysis of the fever was not considered a relevant point in the evaluation of the efficacy of 
treatment since many patients had previous or concomitant administration of antipyretic drugs. 
Proportion of patients with gametocytes: At enrolment, in the ITT population, only 5% of patients in 
both groups presented gametocytes, which quickly disappeared in the next few days. Almost all the 
patients did not develop gametocytes during the course of the study. However, no conclusion can be 
drawn about the efficacy of the drug on gametocytes because of the limited number of patients 
presenting gametocytes in the infant population. 
Fever clearance time and gametocyte density over time: due to the quick disappearance of both fever 
and gametocytes the survival analyses relevant to those two parameters were not carried out. 
Summary of Safety 
Extent of Exposure: The compliance with the study drug for the whole treatment period was good in all 
the patients, except those who stopped treatment due to repeated vomiting. 
Adverse Events: The proportion of patients experiencing at least one TEAE was slightly higher in 
patients treated with the crushed formulation (84.9%) with respect to patients treated with the 
dispersible formulation (80.4%). In particular, vomiting (25.1% vs. 32.3%) was more frequently 
reported in the crushed formulation group with respect to the dispersible formulation group. 
In the dispersible formulation group, 160 out of 199 patients (80.4%) had at least one AE during the 
study. About a third of patients experienced at least one AE, which was considered related to the 
treatment (n = 67, 33.7%), while n = 93 (46.7%) experienced at least one AE, which was considered 
unrelated. For 115 patients (57.8%) the AEs were classified as mild, for 44 patients (22.1%) the AEs 
were classified as moderate, and only for one patient (0.5%) it was classified as severe AE.  
Vomiting was the most frequently reported AE (n = 50 patients; 25.1%) and was often associated with 
drug intake (n = 45; 22.6%). Anaemia was frequently reported during the study (n = 22; 11.1%), 
assessed as not serious, unsuspected and expected, and was usually temporally associated with P. 
falciparum infection. Only one case (0. 5%) was considered suspected. Other common AEs such as 
diarrhoea (n = 14; 7.0%), bronchitis (n = 20; 10.1%), gastroenteritis (n = 9; 4.5%), decreased 
appetite (n = 7; 3.5%), general respiratory tract infection (n = 20; 10.1%), rhinitis (n = 13; 6.5%), 
cough (n = 12; 6.0%), flu (n = 7; 3.5%) and pyrexia (n = 12; 6.0%) were mostly considered to be 
unrelated to the study treatment.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/103576/2018  
Page 23/37 
 
 
 
 
 
In the crushed formulation group, 84 out of 99 patients (84.9%) had at least one AE during the study. 
Among these patients, 42 (42.4%) experienced AE considered as suspected related to study treatment 
and 42 (42.4%) experienced AE unsuspected related to the study treatment by Investigators. For 58 
out of 99 patients (58.6%), the AEs were classified as mild, for 25 patients (25.3%) the AEs were 
classified as moderate and only for one patient (1.0%) it was classified as severe AE. Vomiting was the 
most frequently reported AE (n = 32 patients; 32.3%) and was often associated with drug treatment 
(n = 31; 31.3%). Anaemia was also frequently reported as AE (n = 12; 12.1%) and was often 
associated with P. falciparum infection. All these cases were assessed as not serious, unsuspected and 
expected. Other common AEs such as diarrhoea (n = 8; 8.1%), bronchitis (n = 11; 11.1%), general 
respiratory tract infection (n = 9; 9.1%), rhinitis (n = 3; 3.0%), pyrexia (n = 7; 7.1%) were mostly 
considered to be unrelated to the treatment by Investigators. 
The AEs profile for both dispersible and crushed formulation groups was very similar in terms of type 
and frequency of events and was consistent with that expected in young children with acute malaria in 
Africa. 
Serious adverse events, deaths and other significant adverse events: For 2 patients out of 298, the 
observed AEs were reported as STEAEs, one per treatment group (0.5%. vs. 1.0% in the dispersible 
and crushed formulation groups, respectively), both assessed as unrelated to the study treatment by 
Investigators. The STEAE in the crushed formulation group resulted in death.

Clinical laboratory evaluation: At recruitment, most of the patients were anaemic. During the course of 
the study, the anaemia ameliorated. At baseline AST, ALT and total bilirubin levels were clinically 
significantly increased in patients of both dispersible (11.6%, 3.0% and 2.0%, respectively) and 
crushed (16.2%, 3.0% and 3.0%, respectively) formulation groups, this was expected for malaria 
patients. Most of these abnormalities quickly resolved. 
Vital signs, symptoms and clinical examination: At enrolment, most of the patients had fever and high 
pulse rate. No significant differences of pulse rate and body temperature were found between 
treatment groups. Fever was resolved in most of the patient by Day 1. 
The most frequently observed symptoms reported as AEs during the study were vomiting, diarrhoea, 
anaemia, respiratory infections, cough and fever. 
The most common abnormal clinical examination findings at Day 0 between treatment groups regarded 
ear-nose-throat (9.1% vs 5.1%), lungs (32.7% vs 23.2%) and abdomen (13.6% vs 14.1%). After Day 
0, no relevant differences between treatment groups for any other abnormal examination finding were 
observed. 
QTc prolongation, potential and descriptive ECG and QTc analyses (centralised data): No arrhythmias 
were reported during the study. QTcF interval prolongations were reported as AESIs in 23 patients 
(11.6%) of the dispersible formulation group and 15 patients (15.2%) of the crushed formulation 
group. All cases were assessed as: Non Serious, Mild in intensity, Suspected and Expected per SmPC. 
All reported cases occurred in patients in which the food intake restriction could not be respected due 
to the small age of the patients. 
QTc interval prolongation was assessed using both Fredricia’s and Bazett’s correction methods but it 
must be considered that both correction formulas are biased by the physiological high HR presented by 
the young children, and exacerbated by the ill status and fever. At baseline, the values of QT/QTc were 
not significantly different between treatment groups using both correction methods. Of note, applying 
the two correction methods, the mean of the baseline evaluations differs drastically. In fact, the 
dispersible formulation group showed a mean baseline QTcF interval equal to 354 msec while the mean 
baseline QTcB became 415 msec. Similarly, in the crushed formulation group the mean baseline values 
were 359 and 421 for QTcF and QTcB, respectively. In both cases, there was a difference of about 60 
msec between the values of QTc intervals when a different correction method was applied. 
This difference deposed for a bias introduced by the high heart rate commonly recorded in young 
children suffering from an acute episode of malaria, and by its association with fever, which results in 
an increase of sympathetic activity. All these conditions are well known factors that affect QT/QTc 
interval duration. Furthermore, Fridericia’s correction formula tends to over-correct QT duration when 
heart rate values exceed 130-135 beats per minute, and the result of this correction can have 
determined lower baseline QTcF values than real. 
Fridericia’s Method: The change in QTcF interval from baseline (Day 0 pre-dose) was detectable on Day 
2 pre-dose, with a tendency to QTcF prolongation being observed in both groups with a parallel 
reduction in HR. 
At Day 2 post-dose, this change became more relevant, with respect to Day 0, with 22 patients in the 
dispersible group (11.1%) and 14 patients in the crushed group (14.1%) manifesting a QTcF over 60 
msec. These QT interval prolongations were transient and quickly resolved. In fact, at LAD, the QTcF 
prolongation tended to normalization, with only one patient (0.5%) in the dispersible formulation group 
and two patients (2.0%) in the crushed formulation group still presenting an increment of QTcF higher 
than 60 msec.

Bazett’s Method: The change in QTcB interval from baseline (Day 0 pre-dose) was detectable on Day 2 
pre-dose, with a tendency to QTcB prolongation being observed in both groups with a parallel 
reduction in HR. In fact, 2.0% of patients showed a QTcB prolongation > 60 msec in both the 
treatment groups. 
At Day 2 post-dose, this change became more relevant, with respect to Day 0, with 13 patients in the 
dispersible group (6.5%) and 3 patients in the crushed group (3.0%) manifesting a QTcB over 60 
msec. Only one patient in the dispersible group showed a QTcB interval prolongation over 500 msec 
(508 msec) on Day 2 post-dose starting from a baseline level at Day 0 of 456 msec. These QT interval 
prolongations were transient and quickly resolved. 
At LAD, the QTcB prolongation tended to normalization, with none of patients presenting an increment 
of QTcB higher than 60 msec, in both the treatment groups. 
There were no relevant differences between treatment groups at baseline (Day 0), at Day 2 pre-and 
post-treatment and at Day 7 in HR, PR and QRS. 
A relevant and comparable reduction in HR in both groups was observed at Day 2 (pre- and post-
treatment) accompanied with a related prolongation of the PR interval. These findings were partially 
due to the resolution of the malaria. 
As discussed before, this lengthening of QTc from baseline to Day 2 was probably influenced by the 
high HR associated with presence of fever and activation of the sympathetic activity. All these 
considerations strongly suggest that the QT/QTcF increase exerted by Eurartesim could be 
overestimated.  
In summary: 
-Virtually in no case, regardless the observed absolute increase of the value of the QTcF interval 
possibly related with the study treatment and the drug administration conditions, the QTcF interval 
duration exceeded the limits considered normal/borderline for QTcF duration in such patient population 
(450-470 msec). 
-No cases of QTcF> 500ms were reported. 
-No case evolved in any form of rhythm disturbance. 
-The QTcF interval prolongation >60 ms was mainly observed 3-6 h after the third and last drug 
administration. 
Overall, the changes in QT interval (either QTcF or QTcB) observed during the study treatment period 
were never associated with clinical signs of cardiotoxicity. 
Conclusions 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the PK of Eurartesim (PQP/DHA) in a new water 
dispersible formulation, film coated tablet, and crushed film coated tablet in venous blood samples 
during and after a therapeutic course of Eurartesim in a paediatric population. The primary endpoint 
was to estimate the population and individual PK parameters and variability of PQ and DHA in 
paediatric populations administered with Eurartesim. 
Among the secondary objectives of the study was to assess the PK/PD relationship of Eurartesim in 
malaria patients (adult and paediatric populations). The objective was to obtain a comprehensive 
PK/PD relationship for DHA and PQ after administration of Eurartesim as a film coated tablet, crushed

film coated tablet, or water dispersible tablet in malaria patients. Modelling of P. falciparum parasite 
density was performed and the effect of covariates on the PD modelling was explored. 
The other secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of the Eurartesim formulations 
(dispersible and crushed tablets) in treating uncomplicated malaria episodes and their ability in 
protecting patients from reinfections, to assess the PK/PD relationship of Eurartesim in malaria patients 
(adult and paediatric populations) and to evaluate safety and tolerability of Eurartesim in infants. 
The clinical results showed that both formulations confirmed the satisfactory safety and efficacy of 
Eurartesim. The clinical efficacy data confirmed that Eurartesim crushed film coated tablet and the 
water dispersible formulations were efficacious in treating the 300 real male and female paediatric 
patient aging between 6 and 12 months involved in the present study. The safety profile of Eurartesim 
was confirmed and the two different formulations compared in the study were substantially similar. 
CHMP comments:  
The  applicant  has  presented  PK  and  PK/PD  modelling  data  with  200  simulated  patients,  using  the 
results of the sparse PK sampling performed in the current paediatric study. However the two different 
strengths of the dispersible formulation have been grouped together, so it is not possible to ascertain 
the effects of the two tablets separately. 
No  PK  parameters  on  the  real  paediatric  population  have  been  presented.  Similarly  the  number  of 
subjects in each age and weight band of the real population have not been presented. The simulated 
weight only goes up to a maximum of 11.95 kg whereas the higher strength tablet is also for patients 
>13kg. 
According to the simulation, the BE criteria was met for the PQ component but not for DHA, which for 
both Cmax and AUC was lower for the new formulation. However the PD effects did not appear to be 
different. It is possible that lower values could be due to inclusion of patients that vomited, although 
according to the model such patients were excluded. 
Over 95% patients were considered treatment compliant however it is not clear how many adhered to 
the  food  restriction.  The  first  dose  was  given  irrespective  of  food  intake,  on  the  other  hand  vomiting 
was  progressively  less  from  D1  to  D3.  Therefore  clarification  is  required  of  the  effect  of  food  on  PK, 
safety and efficacy.  
The  patients  in  the  dispersible  and  crushed  groups  appear  generally  balanced  in  their  baseline 
characteristics, however lung infections were higher in the former. The applicant should comment. The 
number of withdrawals due to vomiting were also much higher in the dispersible group. 
The overall efficacy of the dispersible tablet appears similar to that of the crushed film-coated tablet. 
However  there  were  a  large  number  of  late  treatment  failures.  These  however  seem  to  be  similar  to 
the crushed group by D42. 
No new adverse events of concern were identified and the safety data from the paediatric patients in 
this study were consistent with the known safety profile of eurartesim. However the high incidence of 
vomiting,  particularly  on  day  1  and  soon  after  taking  the  medication  is  a  cause  for  concern.  This 
resulted in treatment withdrawals and treatment failures.  
The  considerable  number  of  QT-prolongations  observed  is  also  of  concern,  particularly  >  60  ms  in 
6.5% of the subjects treated with the dispersible tablets and one case of QTcB over 500 ms.  
The  increase  in  QT  prolongation  seen  could  be  due to  inaccurate  determination  as  the  formulae  used 
are known to be affected by raised heart rate. The fact that “all reported cases occurred in patients in 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

whom  the  food  intake  restriction  could  not  be  respected  due  to  the  small  age  of  the  patients”  is 
alarming and seriously questions the suitability of DHA/PQP for malaria therapy in this age group. The 
MAH is asked to critically discuss this issue, also in context with alternative treatment options for this 
age group. Further, ways to mitigate this risk should be explored such as possible shorter feeding time 
if  considered  essential  during  the  3  hours  before/after  eurartesim  intake,  iv  supplementation  etc; 
although it is acknowledged that these will be difficult to implement. Neverthless this will need clinical 
monitoring, which may not be feasible in low income and low resource settings. 
There  was  one  death  in  the  crushed  group,  considered  unrelated,  and  another  SAE  in  the  dispersible 
group of severe malaria and intestinal mycosis, considered unsuspected and unexpected. 
The population PK and PKPD modelling is acceptable and adequate for simulations. It should be noted 
that  patients  who  vomited  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Despite  lower  exposure  for  DHA  yet 
comparable  exposure  for  PQ,  simulated  time  to  parasite  clearances  was  comparable  between  the  old 
crushed and the new dispersible tablet. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted a clinical overview and the complete CSR for this paediatric study.  
The present study was a randomized open label study of 300 children (aged 6 to 12 months); a 
comparison between the approved tablet, crushed and administered with water, and the dispersible 
tablet was conducted in order to evaluate population pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety 
parameters. The two arms were allocated with a ratio of 2:1 (dispersible vs crushed film coated 
formulations). 
The clinical study demonstrated similar efficacy results. At day 28, the PCR-corrected ACPR was 86.9% 
(pure-ITT) and 98.3% (PP) in the dispersible tablet group, and 84.9% (pure-ITT) and 100% (PP) in the 
crushed tablet group. At day 42, it was 85.9% (pure-ITT) and 96.5% (PP) in the dispersible tablet 
group, and 82.8% (pure-ITT) and 96.4% (PP) in the crushed tablet group. 
The safety profile for the dispersible and crushed tablet groups was similar in terms of type and 
frequency of Adverse Events and was consistent with that expected in young African infants with 
uncomplicated acute malaria. There were no new or unexpected safety findings from the paediatric 
patients enrolled in the study, although the incidence of vomiting was high in both groups. There were 
a large number of SAEs in both groups, reflecting the serious condition of these patients. 
According to the MAH, the results of this study confirm the possibility to introduce an appropriate 
formulation for paediatric patients in order to reduce the dose and extent of exposure variability, so as 
to address a high medical need, mostly in endemic areas, with a significant improvement of the 
compliance. 
The MAH also confirms that this paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk profile for 
Eurartesim: therefore no further regulatory action is envisaged at this stage.  
2.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
On the basis of the results of this paediatric study, there is currently no change in the benefit-risk 
profile of Eurartesim for the existing indications. Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the 
results of this study at present. 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The introduction of a new formulation for the paediatric population is considered desirable to enable 
easier intake and to improve compliance. The dispersible formulation showed almost similar safety and 
efficacy compared to the crushed formulation despite the inequivalent exposures seen on BE modelling. 
The risk of QT prolongation would need to be mitigated by providing proper risk minimisation 
strategies, including full clinical and ECG monitoring, to the maximum extent possible. 
Further improvements in palatability and/or the development of an oral solution are also considered 
desirable. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
3.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  Information on module 3 should be provided as to determine the qualitative and quantitative 
composition, manufacturing process(es) and pharmaceutical performance characteristics (in-
vitro dissolution results) of the new formulations. 
2. 
 The batch size for each of the formulations should be stated. 
3.  Please clarify the number of patients that were included/treated per weight band (dosing group) 
and age band, particularly patients who were treated with the lower strength formulation.  
4.  The patients in the dispersible and crushed groups appear generally balanced in their baseline 
characteristics, however lung infections were higher in the former. The applicant should 
comment. 
5.  BE results have been presented with simulations only. Please clarify whether this was attempted 
in the real population despite the small number of samples. 
6.  Information on PK/PD, efficacy and safety must be provided for the two dispersible formulation 
groups separately. 
7.  Please clarify how many participants were fully/partly/non- adherent to the food restrictions per 
dosing group.     
8.  In the efficacy section it is mentioned that the incidence of vomiting was higher in the 
dispersible group while in the safety section it is stated it was higher in the crushed tablet group. 
Please clarify. 
9.  Vomiting is still a problem with the new formulation. The MAH should critically elaborate on the 
adequacy of the taste masking of the dispersible tablets. Further suggest how this concern of 
vomitting could be mitigated. Is further development planned to improve palatability? 
10. As the study participants were too young to report on any acceptability/palatability issues with 
the three formulations, the MAH should comment if taste panels (adult subjects) have been 
used during the formulation development or how acceptability of the formulation was evaluated. 
11. QT prolongation is also a concern. As this is more particualrly seen in patients whom the food 
intake restriction could not be respected due to the small age of the patients, the MAH is asked 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/103576/2018

to critically discuss the suitability of DHA/PQP for malaria therapy in this age group, also in 
context with alternative treatment options for this age group. Ways to monitor such patients 
and ways to mitigate this risk should be explored. 
12. The percentage of LTF is twice as high in the dispersible tablet group as compared to the group 
receiving crushed tablets. The applicant should critically discuss these imbalances and the 
potential consequences in clinical practice. 
13. Information on the severity of vomiting in the different treatment groups should be presented. 
14. There is lack of BE, safety concerns and thereby possible consequent efficacy concerns (eg lack 
of efficacy if the entire dose can not be taken due to vomitting) despite similar PK and PK/PD 
effects seen on modelling with the dispersible formulation compared to the crushed formulation. 
Therefore it is difficult to justify the use of this formulation, as is, in the proposed paediatric 
population. The applicant should fully justify their position.  
15. Further, requirement of adherence to food restrictions, need for clinical and ECG monitoring etc 
is difficult in low resource settings. The applicant should justify how this will be achieved. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  Information  on  module  3  should  be  provided  as  to  determine  the  qualitative  and  quantitative 
composition,  manufacturing  process(es)  and  pharmaceutical  performance  characteristics  (in-vitro 
dissolution results) of the new formulations: 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Information  on  module  3  has  been  provided  as  requested  including  details  of  the  qualitative  and 
quantitative  composition  of  the 
formulation,  manufacturing  process(es)  and  pharmaceutical 
performance characteristics (in-vitro dissolution results) of the new formulations. 
The information provided is considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
2. The batch size for each of the formulations should be stated: 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The batch data have been provided as requested. 
Response considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
3.  Please  clarify  the  number  of  patients  that  were  included/  treated  per  weight  band  (dosing  group) 
and age band, particularly patients who were treated with the lower strength formulation: 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The percentage of infants weighing < 7 kg BW was slightly higher in the water dispersible formulation 
group than in the crushed tablet formulation group, being about 21.1 versus 11.1%, respectively; 
conversely, patients aged < 9 months were quite balanced for age between groups, being 39.7 versus 
36.4% in the water dispersible formulation group and in the crushed tablet formulation group 
respectively.  
Considering the limited numbers obtained when patients were stratified by age and dose, we may 
assume that the balance among groups was acceptable.

The MAH’s responses are considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
4. The patients in the dispersible and crushed groups appear generally balanced in their baseline 
characteristics, however lung infections were higher in the former. The applicant should comment: 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In conclusion, in most of the cases cough is the only symptom at lung level and therefore most likely 
related to the malaria episode. Being this event resolved after a few days, together with the relief from 
acute malaria, it can reasonably be correlated with the malaria episode. The noted mild imbalance 
between the treatment groups was only detected at baseline, before any drug administration, 
therefore it was judged as caused by randomness and unrelated with the treatment, and not causing 
any bias in the study results. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
There does not appear to be an increased incidence of lung infections other than cough. Response 
considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
5. BE results have been presented with simulations only. Please clarify whether this was attempted in 
the real population despite the small number of samples. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In the real population, the increase in PQ bioavailability due to food effect was not observed. 
Annerberg et al 2011 and Tarning et al 2014 reported similar findings: small amount of food, mainly 
milk, did not alter the absorption of PQP in malaria patients. 
After a single dose of PQ, the analysis on dose corrected systemic exposure parameters confirmed the 
BE between the water dispersible formulation and crushed tablet formulation in terms of AUC, while 
Cmax was slightly lower for the new formulation compared to the old one. As expected, no food effect 
was observed for DHA absorption the BE analysis on dose-normalized systemic exposure parameters 
confirmed the results obtained through simulation approach, although in the real population the 
relative bioavailability of DHA was more than 10% higher than in the simulated population. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The simulated and real life results are not completely concordant. There does appear to be some effect 
of food, however this does reflect the normal situation where children are likely to be given some milk/ 
other food despite the restrictions being mentioned. It is further noted (see below), that despite slight 
differences in the AUC and Cmax for both PQ and DHA in the simulated vs real life results and between 
crushed and dispersible formulations, the clinical outcome parameters are more or less similar. 
Therefore the Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
6.  Information  on  PK/PD,  efficacy  and  safety  must  be  provided  for  the  two  dispersible  formulation 
groups separately. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
PQ and DHA pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety parameters were similar among dose and 
formulation groups.

Late failures at d42 are about 30-35%, with greater incidence in the low dose, low weight category ie 
the youngest children for both formulations. There was a slight imbalance in groups with the 
percentage of infants weighing < 7 kg BW being slightly higher in the water dispersible formulation 
group than in the crushed tablet formulation group (21.1 versus 11.1%).  This did not appear to be 
due to variable exposure of the actives, since DHA exposure was lower in all age groups for the 
dispersible compared to the crushed formulation. 
The Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
7. Please clarify how many participants were fully/partly/non-adherent to the food restrictions per 
dosing group. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
From the study recordings, the adherence to the food restrictions required for Eurartesim seemed quite 
difficult in patients below 13 kg body weight and 12 months of age.  
Overall, slightly less than 36% were fully or partially compliant of with food restrictions, the 
compliancy resulting quite balanced between the dosing groups. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
There were only about 36% subjects who were fully or partially compliant with food restrictions, this 
was quite balanced between the treatment groups. The main food given was milk in the majority of 
subjects, followed by maize.  
In these young patients this non-compliant behaviour is not unexpected. 
Response considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
8. In the efficacy section it is mentioned that the incidence of vomiting was higher in the dispersible 
group while in the safety section it is stated it was higher in the crushed tablet group. Please clarify. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In  conclusion,  there  was  a  small  difference  in  repeated  vomiting  between  the  two  treatment  groups, 
possibly  related  to  the  clinical  conditions  of  the  patients.  When  single  vomiting  episodes  are 
considered,  the  difference  observed  between  treatment  groups  is  more  evident  and  in  favour  of  the 
dispersible  formulation  administration.  For  more  details  about  the  vomiting  distribution  within  the 
weight categories, please refer to the answer provided for Question 13. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Response considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
9. Vomiting is still a problem with the new formulation. The MAH should critically elaborate on the 
adequacy of the taste masking of the dispersible tablets. Further suggest how this concern of vomiting 
could be mitigated. Is further development planned to improve palatability? 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In conclusion, the rate of vomiting observed in the present study is most likely to be related to the 
malaria symptoms and the low age of children rather than to the drug formulation. The data evidenced 
that the utilisation of a taste masked dispersible formulation has reduced the vomiting frequency in 
this population.

The MAH believes that all the efforts in order to improve the drug palatability have been done in the 
present formulation and that no other development strategies can be applied in order to further reduce 
the vomiting in this young population. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
No specific palatibility studies have been carried out. The choice of flavour is based on studies with 
other anti-malarials. This may be reasonable, although despite the dissolution test results it is  a 
possibility that taste may be affected. 
Neverthless, this may also be related to the age of the patients with youngest patients finding it harder 
to take the tablets than older children. 
Response considered acceptable. Point resolved. 
10. As the study participants were too young to report on any acceptability/palatability issues with the 
three formulations, the MAH should comment if taste panels (adult subjects) have been used during 
the formulation development or how acceptability of the formulation was evaluated. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
A microencapsulation technology was utilized for masking the bitter taste of PQP; furthermore the 
powder was formulated adding sweeteners and flavour to obtain a good palatability, evaluated through 
no-formal lab test. References1 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
No specific palatibility studies have been carried out. The choice of flavour is based on studies with 
other anti-malarials. This may be reasonable, although despite the dissolution test results it is  a 
possibility that taste may be affected. It is mentioned that the microencapsulated powder lacked any 
bitter taste when rapidly swallowed- this may not be possible to do in young children. 
Neverthless, this may also be related to the age of the patients with youngest patients finding it harder 
to take the tablets than older children. 
Adult tasting panel tests would have been helpful, even though it is known that sensitivity of taste 
differences are known between children and adults.  
The Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
11.  QT  prolongation  is  also  a  concern.  As  this  is  more  particularly  seen  in  patients  whom  the  food 
intake  restriction  could  not  be  respected  due  to  the  small  age  of  the  patients,  the  MAH  is  asked  to 
critically discuss the suitability of DHA/PQP for malaria therapy in this age group, also in context with 
alternative treatment options for this age group. Ways to monitor such patients and ways to mitigate 
this risk should be explored. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
Acute malaria illness has significant effects on the QT interval. When admitted to clinics, patients are 
usually febrile, anxious, upright, tachycardic and often anorexic. The sympathetic nervous system is 
activated and the QT interval is shortened. As the patient recovers, often lying in bed, the fever settles, 
appetite returns, the heart rate declines and the QT interval lengthens. The difference between the

shortened QT interval before treatment and the day-3 normalized QT interval (which often coincides 
with the peak of antimalarial drug concentration) may be misattributed to a drug effect. In addition, 
usual QT correction formulae designed to normalize the QT interval tend to “overcorrect” (i.e., the QTc 
interval appears shorter) at fast heart rates and “undercorrect” (i.e., the QTc interval appears longer) 
at normal or slow heart rates. These factors should be taken into account when interpreting results 
from ECG safety studies in malaria patients (White 2007). According to this consideration, the actual 
study results were re-analysed applying a study specific correction factor (QTcSS) and submitting all 
methods to a linear model including the changes in RR as primary explanatory variable.  
The QTcSS showed to be the best correction method in order to estimate differences between the 
baseline QT interval value and the 4h post-treatment value. When this correction method was applied 
to the data of the present study, QT interval prolongation drastically dropped down with respect to the 
values obtained when Fridericia’s or Bazett’s formula were applied. 
Interestingly, the covariate “food condition” did not show any influence in the model, demonstrating 
that the small amount of food taken by these children has not a significant relevance in term of the 
cardiotoxicity risk related to an increase of QT interval. These observation is also corroborated by the 
results obtained for the piperaquine concentration data reported in the answer to question 5 where the 
results show that there is no significant difference in the plasma piperaquine concentration when the 
DHA/PQP formulations have been administered with or without food. 
The lack of significant effect of a small amount of food on piperaquine pharmacokinetics was also 
previously demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic study conducted in malaria patients treated with 
DHA/PQ in fasting condition or co-administered with 200 mL of milk containing about 6.4 g of fat 
(Annerberg et al. 2011).  
Considering the QT interval prolongation observed when the QTcSS method was applied and the 
observation that piperaquine pharmacokinetics is not significantly different between infants treated 
under fasting or fed condition (see answer to question 5), the MAH believes that the risk associated 
with a small food co-administration in malaria children is negligible, on the other side, the benefit 
offered by having a more appropriate paediatric formulation of DHA/PQP in the paediatric treatment 
portfolio is of great relevance to keep ACT treatments efficacious as long as possible in view of the 
spread of artemisinin resistance already reported in the greater Mekong region (Yeung et al. 2009; 
Fairhurst et al. 2012).  
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The applicant contends that due to the various reasons for increased heart rate in children, both 
physiological and pathological, it is difficult to accurately measure QT prologation using the standard 
methods. Therefore a modification has been applied, based on the finding that only gender and not 
food seemed to affect the QT interval. This method is not considered to be fully validated and therefore 
caution is required when interpreting the results. 
It is agreed that an efficacious anti-malarial regimen is required in the face of increasing resistance to 
other therapies and that Eurartesim may, to some extent, be able to step in. It is also highly unlikely 
that all children will adhere to the strict no food restriction. Therefore taking a pragmatic view, it is 
considered that the risk of QT prolongation is outweighed by the benefit of a successful treatment.  
The Rapporteur is hence prepared to accept the response. Point resolved.

12. The percentage of LTF is twice as high in the dispersible tablet group as compared to the group 
receiving crushed tablets. The applicant should critically discuss these imbalances and the potential 
consequences in clinical practice. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The  unbalanced  distribution  of  patients  within  the  two  treatment  groups  at  the  site  03  and  the 
disappearance  of  any  difference  in  LTF  between  treatment  groups  at  Day  42  support  the  conclusion 
that  the  noted  Day  28  imbalance  within  the  two  treatment  groups  is  not  based  on  real  differences 
between the two drug formulations compared in this study.  
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The applicant contends that the difference in LTF observed at d28 but not a d42, could be due to 
imbalances in patient randomisation at two sited. This may be a possibility however a true effect is 
also likely as the difference was much less at d42. No other pausible explanation has been provided. 
The Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
13. Information on the severity of vomiting in the different treatment groups should be presented. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In conclusion, in most of the cases vomiting was of mild intensity and more frequent in infants treated 
with the crushed formulation. Since smaller children are more likely to vomit antimalarial treatments 
(WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria, 3rd Edition Section 5.2) when they are hill and febrile 
respect to the older ones, the evidence of reduced number of vomit episodes when the dispersible 
formulation was administered could be considered a sign of better acceptance of the dispersible 
formulation respect to the crushed one. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
No severe case of vomitting was reported in either group, with mild and moderate vomitting being 
lower and higher respectively in the dispersible and crushed formulations.  
Apart from taste, the infection itself and age of the patient may make them prone to vomitting. 
The Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
14. There is lack of BE, safety concerns and thereby possible consequent efficacy concerns (eg lack of 
efficacy if the entire dose cannot be taken due to vomiting) despite similar PK and PK/PD effects seen 
on  modelling  with  the  dispersible  formulation  compared  to  the  crushed  formulation.  Therefore,  it  is 
difficult to justify the use of this formulation, as is, in the proposed paediatric population. The applicant 
should fully justify their position. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
Overall, in MAH opinion, there are no major concerns about the efficacy and the safety of the new 
formulation compared to the crushed tablet formulation.  
In addition, the following considerations have to be taken into account for judging the clinical value of 
having a new pediatric Eurartesim formulation as an antimalarial drug: 
- 
- 
the obvious better compliance of this new pediatric formulation compared to the crushed 
tablet, 
the simplified schedule of Eurartesim as compared to other ACTs

- 
the importance of having multiple GMP compliant ACTs available on the market, which is 
definitively needed in the fight against the resistance dread particularly in high transmission 
territories as Africa. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
There is a need to balance concerns of bioinequivalence and safety against compliance and the efficacy 
outcomes.  Despite  the  lower  DHA  exposures  the  clinical  outcome  was  more  or  less  similar.  QT 
prolongation was seen but according to the model food has much less effect compared to gender.  
The Rapporteur is prepared to accept the response. Point resolved. 
However  it  is  considered  that  proper  ECG  monitoring,  to  whatever  maximum  extent  possible  in 
resource poor settings, must be performed to minimise the risk of QT prolongation. 
15. Further, requirement of adherence to food restrictions, need for clinical and ECG monitoring etc is 
difficult in low resource settings. The applicant should justify how this will be achieved. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
As discussed in answering Question 5, in the real population involved in the ST3073-ST3074-DM12002 
study, no increase in PQ bioavailability due to food effect was observed. Annerberg et al 2011 and 
Tarning et al 2014 reported similar findings: small amount of food, mainly milk, did not alter the 
absorption of PQP in malaria patients. In light of this observation, the requirement of adherence to 
food restrictions seems no longer as stringent as in the past, at least for the paediatric population 
essentially fed with some milk or maize. Consequently, also the stringent ECG monitoring seems no 
longer necessary.      
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The Rapporteur would not like to dismiss full monitoring of patients so trivially and considers that 
proper ECG monitoring, to whatever maximum extent possible in resource poor settings, must be 
performed to minimise the risk of QT prolongation.  
Hence the response may be acceptable provided proper risk minimisation strategies, including full 
monitoring, are put in place. Point considered resolved at this stage.

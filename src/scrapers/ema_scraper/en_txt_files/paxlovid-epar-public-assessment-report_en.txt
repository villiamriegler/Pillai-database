1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 7 January 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Paxlovid, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 July 2021. 
A combination pack request was submitted to the Agency on 31st May 2021. In accordance with 
Eudralex, Notice to Applicants, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Section 5.5, "In very exceptional circumstances, 
which must be considered on a case by case basis, the marketing of distinct medicinal products in the 
same package may be indispensable for public health reasons. Such reasons cannot be related to 
convenience or commercial purposes". Further to consultation with ETF on 6th July 2021, the CHMP 
endorsed via written procedure the outcome of the review process that the proposed combination pack 
was considered indispensable for public health, in order to facilitate patient access to the medicinal 
product in the current pandemic situation. The European Commission has been informed of this 
outcome and endorsed the acceptance of the combination pack in the context of the Covid-19 
emergency situation, stressing that the studies to support co-formulation shall be accelerated, and the 
progress of these ongoing studies must be reported to the EMA. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“PAXLOVID is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) 
in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) and who are at 
high risk for progression to severe COVID 19 (see section 5.1)”. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0566/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0566/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 9/170 
 
 
 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
1.5.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance (1R,2S,5S)-N-((1S)-1-Cyano-2-((3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-
yl)ethyl)-3-((2S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido) butanoyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-
azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as 
a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following scientific advice on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application: 
Date 
Reference 
SAWP co-ordinators 
9 July 2021 
EMA/SA/0000061585 
EMA staff  
The scientific advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects:   
a)  Justification for co-packaging PF-07321332 with RTV  
b)  Non-clinical safety strategy  
c)  Clinical pharmacology programme 
d)  Strategy regarding the investigation of human ADME 
e)  Dose regimen selection  
f)  Adequacy of the phase 3 outpatient study (C4671005)  to support a conditional MAA 
for treatment of adult patients with symptomatic COVID-19 
g)  Acceptance of non-EU data to support a CMA  
h)  Options for EUA in the EU and appropriate communication channels to request additional 
guidance 
Scientific advice compliance 
Overall, there is some degree of fulfilment to the CHMP advice given to the applicant’s questions raised 
in the request of scientific advice.  
However, some issues deserve to be underlined. 
- 
It was clearly identified by the CHMP that it was difficult to predict whether the DDI potential of 
PF 07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg BID would be similar to that of ritonavir 100 mg BID. As 
part of the response the CHMP underline the contributory value of PBPK simulations. However 
as a particular caveat, the applicant during the procedure was not able to provide a relevant 
PBPK model of simulation insofar that this model was only based on data from Healthy 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 10/170 
 
 
 
 
 
volunteers and not from patients while PK data were collected in adult patient in the C467-
1005 (EPIC-HR) study. 
- 
Finally, the applicant’s questions on the clinical development of the drugs were too broad to 
enable the Committee to elaborate an advice. 
1.7.  COVID-19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID-ETF)  
In line with their mandate as per the EMA Emerging Health Threats Plan, the ETF undertook the 
following activities in the context of this conditional marketing authorisation application: 
The ETF endorsed the Scientific Advice letter, confirmed eligibility to the rolling review procedure based 
on the information provided by the applicant and agreed the start of the rolling review procedure. 
Furthermore, the ETF discussed the (Co-)Rapporteur’s assessment reports overviews and provided 
their recommendation to the CHMP. 
For the exact steps taken at ETF, please refer to section 1.8.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally, 
on 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to 
control the outbreak.  
According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), histologic findings from the 
lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such 
as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular 
damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 24 January 2022, there have been over 349 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 5.59 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/). The majority of infections result 
in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery.   
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe 
disease and death due to COVID-19. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and 
fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 13/170 
 
 
 
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 disease varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no 
symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases 
typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six 
weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged 
from two to eight weeks.  
Studies among hospitalised patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby, 2020) (Westblade, 2020). Community-
based studies in non-hospitalised patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral load across 
both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung, 2021). 
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020 and 2021, and includes supportive 
care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy which at this stage 
are only registered via IV administration (e.g. Veklury (EMEA/H/C/005622)).  
Monoclonal antibodies and notably bi-therapies to overcome potential escape by VOC with mutations 
on spike are perceived as of potential value. This was particularly true for immunocompromised 
individuals especially where vaccines might not induce adequate immune response in those patients of 
particular medical need. Thurs, recently, three monoclonal antibodies Ronapreve 
(casirivimab/imdevimab, EMEA/H/C/005814), Regkirona (regdanvimab, EMEA/H/C/005854) and 
Xevudy (sotrovimab, EMEA/H/C/005676) have been authorised for the treatment of COVID-19 disease 
in adult. In the case of Ronapreve also adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 
kilograms), who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease 
becoming severe. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 14/170 
 
 
 
Ronapreve is also approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older weighing at least 40 kilograms. 
Other products have been repurposed to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, such as Kineret 
(anakinra, EMEA/H/C/000363) in adult patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- 
or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma 
concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)≥6 ng/ml, and RoActmera 
(tocilizumab, EMEA/H/C/000955) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require 
supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Additionally, there are 5 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to 
prevent COVID-19 disease: Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), Vaxzevria 
(EMEA/H/C/005675), COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (EMEA/H/C/005737) and Nuvaxovid 
(EMEA/H/C/005808). 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an 
urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics able to prevent, mitigate and treat COVID-19 infections 
during the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of 
the pandemic on a population level are desired. In addition, some studies have shown that patients 
might experience potential sequelae, including chronic fatigue, thrombotic events post infection, non-
reversible lung disease, etc; although these aspects have not been fully determined yet. 
2.2.  About the product 
Paxlovid is a combination pack medicinal product containing two active substances in separate 
pharmaceutical forms: PF-07321332 and ritonavir. PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the 
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro renders the protein incapable of 
processing polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication. Ritonavir inhibits 
the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of PF-07321332, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations 
of PF-07321332. 
The recommended dosage is 300 mg PF-07321332 (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 
100 mg tablet) orally every 12 hours for 5 days. 
The combination pack has been considered indispensable for public health by the CHMP and the 
European Commission, in order to facilitate patient access to the medicinal product in the current 
pandemic situation. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “PAXLOVID is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-
moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and 
older weighing at least 40 kg) and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (see 
section 5.1)”. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide clinical comprehensive data.  
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as in the framework of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 
there is an urgent need for safe and effective therapeutic interventions that can reduce viral

transmission, improve time to clinical recovery and prevent the progression of infection to more 
severe disease, hospitalisation and death. Such a therapeutic would also have the potential as an 
effective treatment for future coronavirus epidemics. Thus, development of pan-coronavirus 
treatments has a critical role in global health protection to prevent potential future pandemics. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. The applicant is providing data from their Phase 2/3 study 
C4671005 (EPIC-HR), which achieved overwhelming efficacy at the predefined interim analysis 
(based on 45% of the targeted sample size of around 3000 patients). Study C4671005 was 
conducted in the high-risk population. According to the applicant, the scheduled interim analysis 
showed an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death from any cause 
compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint). 
In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received 
PF-07321332/ritonavir compared to 10 (1.6%) deaths in patients who received placebo. Therefore, 
the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of the product outweigh the risks of 
further additional data requirement. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Paxlovid consists of two separately manufactured dosage forms both presented as 
film-coated tablets of pink and white colour, which are co-packaged together. Pink tablets contain the 
active substance (1R,2S,5S)-N-((1S)-1-Cyano-2-((3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)ethyl)-3-((2S)-3,3-
dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido) butanoyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-

Five blister cards are packed in an outer carton, providing 5 days treatment. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance PF-07321332 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name (IUPAC) of PF-07321332 is (1R,2S,5S)-N-((1S)-1-Cyano-2-((3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-
3-yl)ethyl)-3-((2S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido)butanoyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-
azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide, corresponding to the molecular formula C23H32F3N5O4. It has a 
molecular mass of 499.54 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 2): 
Figure 2. Chemical structure of PF-07321332 active substance 
The structure of the active substance (AS) PF-07321332 was elucidated by a combination of analytical 
methods, including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), UV-VIS 
spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR spectroscopy. The molecular structure and 
absolute configuration of PF-07321332 was independently confirmed using single crystal X-ray 
diffraction technique.  
PF-07321332 is a non hygroscopic, white to pale coloured crystalline powder. It has low solubility in 
(unbuffered) water and buffered aqueous media with pH from 1.97 to 6.96 ranging between 0.98 and 
1.15 mg/mL.  
PF-07321332 has 6 asymmetric centres, giving 32 possible stereoisomers (azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane 
moiety can only exist in the syn configuration) as could be derived from Figure 2, which shows the 
absolute configuration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 17/170 
 
 
 
 
 
As an additional element of the chiral control strategy, chiral identification assays have been developed 
for each of the starting materials (SMs) to ensure that the correct enantiomer of each is used in the 
active substance synthesis.  
PF-07321332 manufactured by the manufacturing process is isolated as crystalline polymorphic form 1 
(anhydrous form) as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD). Form 2 and Form 3 are further 
possible polymorphic forms. Form 1 is the thermodynamically most stable form at relevant 
temperatures and humidities. As the AS is poorly soluble, the polymorphic form could have an 
influence on the performance of the product, and thus it should be demonstrated that the polymorphic 
form does not change during storage of the AS (REC3).  
Overall, the provided general information on the active substance is sufficient. 
2.4.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several chemical transformation steps. A brief description of the 
manufacturing process is given including reagents and solvents, some in-process controls, and batch 
scale sizes. The projected commercial manufacturing scale for PF-07321332.  
The manufacturing process proposed for commercial supply has been described, however some further 
details of the manufacturing process and aspects of its control strategy should be provided; this was 
raised initially as a Major Objection (MO). Specifically, amounts or ratios for all compounds, reagents, 
catalysts, and solvents should be described; process conditions and parameters (like temperature, 
reaction time, pH, etc.) should be established and described; it should be clearly defined in which of 
the steps processing aids are used; conditions of reprocessing should be described and the effect on 
the impurity profile should be investigated. Since different process conditions may lead to a different 
impurity profile, it is requested that in order to improve the control strategy description and to confirm 
a consistent impurity profile, additional details should be included in the manufacturing process 
proposed for PF-07321332 commercial supply. In the context of a CMA this issue can be classified as a 
Specific Obligation (SO) and the data will be provided post-approval (SO1) at latest in June 2022 as 
committed by the applicant. 
The proposed choice of starting materials (SMs) are considered acceptable. Adequate justification to 
support the definition of the SMs according to ICH Q11 guideline have been provided. All three SMs are 
significant structural fragments of the active substance and there are sufficient chemical steps, and a 
form conversion step, between them and the final active substance. The synthesis routes for each of 
the SMs used by each of the suppliers are sufficiently described. However, some of the synthesis 
routes of the SM are still being optimised which could result in changes in the synthesis routes. 
Therefore, the final synthesis routes for the starting materials should be provided as soon as possible, 
at latest in June 2022 (REC2). Names and addresses for the SM manufacturers were provided in the 
responses but the dossier needs to be updated accordingly with this information (REC2). Provisional 
SM specifications, analytical procedures and summary of validation data were provided. However, the 
provisional SM specifications are not yet completely finalised. The SM specifications should be clearly 
updated based on historical batch data and comparative data should be presented (REC2). 
Appropriate acceptance limits for impurities, including chiral impurities, should be included in the 
starting material specifications. See discussion below concerning the control strategy for impurities 
(SO2).  
A list of the reagents, solvents and catalysts used in the manufacturing process with identification of 
ICH classification for solvents as well as the respective specifications has been submitted. The 
specifications for raw materials are acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 18/170 
 
 
 
Three intermediates are isolated. Provisional specifications have been established for the intermediates 
PF-07336591-01 and PF-07320267 in the manufacturing process of PF-07321332 active substance. 
The provisional intermediate specifications are not yet completely finalised, but the provided 
information submitted suffices in the context of the current emergency situation.  However, in order 
ensure comprehensive control of impurities throughout the lifecycle of the product, for each of the 
isolated intermediates, intermediate specifications should be clearly established including at least the 
test parameters description, assay/purity, limits of identified, unidentified and total impurities. See 
discussion below concerning the control strategy for impurities (SO2). 
A short discussion on inorganic and organic impurities (including elemental, genotoxic and chiral 
impurities) was provided. The applicant stated that the active substance control strategy for the 
impurities has not yet been fully established. The control strategy for the impurities, including chiral 
impurities, in the AS should be clearly defined. The carry-over of impurities arising from the synthesis 
of the starting materials and the proposed manufacturing process of the AS for commercial supply 
should be investigated on three pilot-or production batches. More information about the potential 
formation of other chiral impurities and their control strategy should be provided. Based on these data 
appropriate methods for control and acceptance criteria for impurities, including chiral impurities, 
should be included in the SMs and intermediates specifications. If necessary, toxicological qualified 
limits for additional impurities should be included in the AS specification. The applicant has committed 
to continue to re-evaluate the specifications and limits as additional manufacturing experience 
becomes available and as part of validation, currently scheduled to complete in June 2022. 
This issue of the control strategy for the impurities in the AS was raised initially as major objection. In 
the context of a CMA this issue can be classified as a Specific Obligation (SO2). The data should be 
provided at latest in June 2022 as proposed by the applicant. 
The residual solvents used in the final manufacturing step are specified in the active substance 
specifications with adequate limits according to ICH Q3C guideline. Purge factors for the residual 
solvents have been calculated. However, as the control strategy of the manufacturing process has not 
been completely finalised, the calculation of the purge factors cannot be concluded as final.   
Therefore, the carry-over of residual solvents used in the manufacturing steps before the final step 
should be also investigated on three consecutive production batches (REC3). 
The provided risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamines in the active 
substance is sufficient. Potential sources of nitrosamine impurities currently listed in EMA guidance 
were addressed. No risks are identified.  
A short description of the manufacturing process development is provided. The proposed and current 
manufacturing process is mainly similar to the earlier processes reported. Changes from process to 
process have been adequately described. The earlier routes were used to provide earlier development, 
pre-clinical and clinical batches. The applicant stated that at this stage of development Quality Risk 
Management is in-progress, an enhanced synthetic Route is being developed, and validation is ongoing 
consistent with ICH Q7 and ICH Q11 for active substance. A commitment has also been given to 
submit the enhanced control strategy for the current Route and the enhanced Route for Agency review 
and approval by variation as applicable (REC2). 
PF-07321332 is packaged in two sealed, low density polyethylene (LDPE) anti-static liners, which is 
then inserted in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum or equivalent secondary container. A 
representative IR spectrum for the low-density polyethylene liner is provided as well as the 
corresponding specification. The provided information is acceptable.

2.4.2.2.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for assay (HPLC), appearance, identification (IR, 
HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), solid state polymorphic 
form (PXRD), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The active substance specification contains all relevant test parameters. The justifications for the 
specifications, including individual specified organic impurities, qualified at toxicological levels or in line 
with ICH Q3A (R2), are acceptable in the context of this procedure. However, this provisional active 
substance specification should be revised in line with CHMP recommendations (RECs) and a final 
specification should be established for commercial supply.  
As the control strategy for the impurities will be finalised at the latest in 2Q 2022 (SOB2) if necessary, 
additional impurities should be specified in the AS specification. In addition, the structure of one of the 
impurities should be stated and it should be classified according to ICH M7 (REC3). Acceptance criteria 
for particle size distribution (PSD) have been set but should be tightened taking into account clinical 
batches, unless it could be show on PK or bioavailability data that the set upper limits of the PSD have 
no impact on the performance of the finished product (REC4). With regard to the omission of testing 
for microbial enumeration it is stated that microbiological quality will be evaluated for three primary 
stability lots at initial release and when stored under the proposed long-term storage conditions and 
results will be reported (REC4).  
The absence of elemental impurities of class 1 and class 2a has been shown on six batches of active 
substance for Class 1/2A and two batches for Class 3 Element. All of these elemental impurities were 
<30% of ICHQ3D option 1 limit. It is stated that the Class 1/2A elemental impurities, will continue to 
be monitored in the active substance and an appropriate control strategy will be established; this is 
acknowledged. The data should be provided at the latest in 2Q 2022 (REC3). 
The descriptions of the analytical procedures are acceptable in the context of the present conditional 
marketing authorisation in an emergency situation. The results of methods validation studies have 
been conducted and some validation data for the in-house methods were provided. However, not all 
validation parameters required according to ICH Q2(R) guideline have been investigated and will be 
provided later. A MO was initially raised requesting complete validation data for the HPLC method for 
assay and impurity testing and for the residual solvent method to be provided in order ensure 
comprehensive control of impurities throughout the lifecycle of the product. In the context of a CMA 
this data can be provided post-approval by June 2022 as a specific obligation (SO3). In addition, 
section 3.2.S.4.2 should be updated with the description of the residual solvent methods and the 
description and validation of the XRPD method (REC4). 
The quality of the reference standard for the active substance is sufficiently proven. 
Satisfactory batch analysis data are given for active substance batches used for toxicological batch and 
clinical batches. The batch data covers all synthesis routes used in the manufacturing development. 
Batch analysis data for three production batches of the current process are within set specifications.  
2.4.2.3.  Stability 
Stability data for two active substance batches produced by earlier manufacturing processes for up to 6 
months under long term conditions at 25°C/60% and under accelerated conditions at 40°C/ 75% RH 
were given showing compliance with specifications. The stability batches were packaged in double 
LDPE bags which are placed in HDPE drums.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 20/170 
 
 
 
 
 
No significant changes were observed. The stability of the active substance batches produced by earlier 
synthetic routes are supportive for proposed synthetic route as all synthetic routes have the same 
polymorphic form, similar synthetic chemistry and same final solvents. Differences in purity profile at 
release are not expected to impact stability. However, the applicant should provide further stability 
data for batches of PF-07321322 AS manufactured by the current route and from previous routes 
(REC5).  
A photostability study was completed under ICH conditions using light source option 2 two batches 
from earlier routes. No changes were observed in the photostability studies. The applicant has 
demonstrated that the active substance is photostable. 
Samples of PF-07321332 from earlier synthetic routes were subjected to forced degradation conditions 
to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity method and to identify potential primary degradation 
products. Forced degradation data on a batch of PF-07321332 AS manufactured by the commercial 
synthetic route should also be provided (REC5). 
Taking into account the requirements of the ICH Q1E guideline the proposed re-test period and storage 
conditions can be accepted. A commitment was given that the first three batches from route F will be 
placed on stability under long-term conditions at 30°C/75% RH for 36 months and under accelerated 
conditions at 40°C/75% RH over 6 months (REC5). 
2.4.3.  Active substance ritonavir 
Ritonavir is an established active substance described in the Ph. Eur. The supplier of ritonavir used in 
the manufacture of Paxlovid is Hetero Drugs Limited. Ritonavir from Hetero is already approved for use

[[(2S)-3- methyl-2-[[methyl[[2-(1 metylethyl)thiazol-4-yl] methyl] carbamoyl] amino] butanoyl] 
amino]-5-phenylpentyl]carbamate, corresponding to the molecular formula C37H48N6O5S2. It has a 
molecular mass of 720.94 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 3): 
Figure 3. Chemical structure of ritonavir active substance 
The molecular structure of ritonavir was investigated and confirmed by the 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV spectroscopy, and InfraRed spectroscopy.   
Ritonavir is a white or almost-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water, 
freely soluble in methanol and sparingly soluble in acetonitrile.  
Ritonavir exhibits isomerism. It contains 4 chiral centres which are introduced selectively in the 
synthetic process. Enantiopurity is determined by a chiral HPLC method in the active substance

specification. It also exhibits polymorphism; Hetero consistently produces polymorphic Form-I, 
characterised by a XRD pattern, and tested in the active substance specification. 
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture, process controls, characterisation and container closure 
Ritonavir from Hetero is already approved in the EU using the AMSF procedure. A Letter of Access 
specifying the ASMF version (applicant’s and Restricted Part of the ASMF) has been submitted.  
The chemical synthesis and a brief description of manufacturing process of intermediate and final 
active substance were provided. The manufacturing process consists of four chemical reaction steps 
followed by a purification and drying step. The 4 starting materials are well defined, have been justified 
are controlled by acceptable specifications and are acceptable. 
Information on possible impurities is provided covering Ph. Eur. impurities, additional non-Ph. Eur. 
impurities, residual solvents, genotoxic impurities, and elemental impurities.  
Details of the impurity studies carried out considering all the above impurities and the residual solvents 
of ritonavir (Form-I) were enclosed. Studies have been carried out to check the presence of the other 
possible impurities from the manufacturing process of ritonavir and its starting materials. 
A study has been conducted to check the possible presence of Class-I solvents in ritonavir with a 
validated method. From the study results it was concluded that all Class-I solvents are absent in the 
batches tested and therefore do not need to be controlled at the level of active substance. 
Based on the evaluation of the process, three impurities were identified as potential genotoxic 
impurities. Studies have been carried out to check their presence in final AS with a validated method. 
From the studies it was clear that these compounds are below detection limit in all the batches being 
tested. 
A risk assessment for the following Class 1, 2A, 2B and 3 elemental impurities as per ICH Q3D 
requirement was carried out for ritonavir production scale batches. Results from batch analysis 
obtained demonstrate that Class 1 and 2A along with intentionally added Class 2B and class 3 
elemental impurities were found to be insignificant levels in ritonavir production scale batches. 
Considering the manufacturing process, the potential presence of Class 1 and 2A and intentionally 
added Class 2B and Class 3 elemental impurities in ritonavir are highly remote. It is concluded that the 
active substance complies with ICH Q3D and that no further controls are required. 
The active substance is packaged in transparent polyethylene bag, tied with a plastic tag. This bag is 
placed in a black bag tied using another plastic tag. The polyethylene bags are made from LDPE (Low 
Density Polyethylene) and LLDPE (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene) respectively. The bags are placed 
in an HDPE drum. The packaging materials complies with relevant EU regulations and Ph. Eur. 
requirements. 
Specifications and test procedures for packing materials, IR spectrums of the polythene bags, in-house 
and supplier certificates of analysis for packing material and compliance certificate of packing material 
have been provided. 
2.4.3.2.  Specification analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis 
The proposed active substance specifications includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification 
(IR, HPLC), polymorphic form (XRD), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.) and residual solvents (GC). 4-Nitrophenyl 
chloroformate and [(5-Thiazolyl)methyl]- (4-nitrophenyl)carbonate content (UFLC-MS) and 1,3-

Dichloroacetone (GC-MS) content are not part of the release specifications but are going to be 
monitored on the first batch of every year and multiple of every 10th batch.  
The active substance specification contains all the requirements of the Ph. Eur. with additional 
requirements for polymorphic form, specific optical rotation, residual solvents, and additional non-
Ph. Eur. impurities. The limits for impurities are in compliance with Ph. Eur., ICH Q3A, ICH Q3C, ICH 
Q3D, and ICH M7. The active substance complies with relevant EMA and ICH guidelines where 
appropriate.  
The applicant provided an acceptable active substance specification as applied by the ASMF holder. It 
is also noted that the AS is converted to the premix and shipped to the ritonavir finished product 
manufacturer. The ritonavir premix specification applied by the finished product manufacturer has been 
provided in dossier section 3.2.P.3.4. This is acceptable, however the applicant’s own specification for 
ritonavir AS should also be provided (REC1). 
The analytical procedures are described, and their suitability was demonstrated by validation data. The 
reference standards are sufficiently characterised. 
The provided batch data of three ritonavir batches demonstrate compliance with the active substance 
specification. No significant differences between the batches was observable. 
2.4.3.3.  Stability 
Stability studies were initiated for the first three ritonavir AS validation batches, as per the ICH Q1A 
guideline at accelerated (40±2°C/ 75±5% RH), intermediate (30±2°C/ 65±5% RH), and long term 
conditions 25±2°C/ 60±5% RH. The batches were stored in the specified container closure system for 
60, 12 and 6 months under long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions respectively. The 
methods adopted for conducting the stability studies are stability indicating which were established 
based on the degradation studies performed. The available stability data have been evaluated and no 
significant changes were observed in any of the stability batches. It has also been demonstrated that 
the active substance is photostable. 
A forced degradation study has been performed under various stress conditions. The summary report 
on appearance, identification by IR and HPLC, P-XRD, related substances by HPLC, water and assay by 
HPLC is provided demonstrating that the methods adopted for conducting the stability studies are 
stability indicating. 
Based on the evaluation of stability data, the claimed retest period and storage condition is endorsed. 
2.4.4.  Paxlovid finished medicinal product  
The proposed medicinal product Paxlovid consists of PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets and 
ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets, which are separately manufactured, but co-packaged on the 
same blister for ease of daily co-administration.

Description of PF-07321332 film-coated tablets 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 23/170 
 
 
 
The PF-07321332 tablets are described as an oval, pink, film-coated tablet, with the dimensions of 
approx. 8.5 x 17.5 mm, debossed with “PFE” on one tablet side and with “3CL” on the opposite side.  
PF-07321332 finished product was designed as an immediate release (IR) dosage form, containing 150 
mg PF-07321332 as active substance.  
Excipients used for manufacturing the PF-07321332 tablet are listed in section 2.4.1 of this report and 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. All excipients are confirmed to comply with Ph. Eur, with exception of the 
film coat Opadry Pink, though all of its components are compendial, Ph. Eur. and NF, respectively). 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objective of pharmaceutical development was to rapidly develop a physically and chemically stable 
solid oral dosage form with the appropriate biopharmaceutical properties and quality attributes 
according to the quality target product profile (QTPP).  
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), in accordance with ICH Q8 was established to guide 
formulation and process development activities. Oriented towards this QTPP, quality attributes were 
derived as basis for the prospective finished product specification. Through a combination of 
experimental studies, risk assessments, and manufacturing experience across a range of scales and 
equipment types, an accelerated understanding of the formulation and process conditions and their 
impact on the quality attributes of the finished product was obtained. 
The active substance PF-07321332 is a non-hygroscopic and white to off-white crystalline compound 
with low aqueous solubility across the physiologically relevant pH range. The solubility is pH 
independent, as it is a non-ionisable compound. PF-07321332 is tentatively classified as BCS II/IV (low 
solubility with permeability to-be-determined) compound. A definite BCS classification for the active 
substance PF-07321332 on the basis of sound analytical data should be provided (REC6). 
Different polymorphic forms have been identified for PF-07321332. The polymorphic Form claimed to 
be the thermodynamically most stable form under relevant manufacturing and storage conditions and 
has been used for all drug product development and clinical manufacture activities. In addition, it 
should be investigated, and data should be presented whether the polymorphic form selected for PF-
07321332 finished product manufacture can remain stable under the proposed manufacturing 
conditions and during shelf life (REC6). 
For registration stability and clinical product batches manufactured to date the AS PSD had been 
stated. It is stated that particle size of all batches would continue to be monitored using a validated 
laser diffraction method with dry dispersion. As the data set in terms of PSD is premature, the stated 
PSD ranges used for producing clinical and registration stability batches is regarded as the provisional 
PSD specification, unless/until new PK data can justify wider PSD ranges. Considering that the active 
substance PSD, may impact the finished product characteristics and performance, an in-depth 
discussion with respect to potential PSD impact on manufacturability and bio-performance of the PF-
07321332 IR film-coated tablets should be provided (REC6). 
All excipients and corresponding quantities chosen are typically used for oral solid dose products such 
as the film-coated tablets in question, thus acceptable. All excipients are confirmed to comply with Ph. 
Eur, with exception of the film coat Opadry Pink, though all of its components are compendial, Ph. Eur. 
and NF, respectively).Section 3.2.P.4 for the dossier for PF-07321332 tablets should be updated to 
include compendial and non-compendial excipients used for the manufacture of PF-07321332 150 mg 
film-coated tablets and their function. In addition, the same section should be updated with an 
adequately compiled specification for the film coat system Opadry Pink, with a confirmation of 
compliance with the EU regulation 231/2012 for red iron oxide and with exemplary CoAs for the non-
compendial excipient Opadry (REC8).

Concerning compatibility, no experimental data of the PF-07321332 with each of the selected 
excipients are available. Instead, reference is made to the finished product stability study at ICH 
storage conditions. Based on stability data available to date, no active substance-excipient 
incompatibility has been observed. 
During formulation development, some formulations were tested in terms of desired quality attributes 
and bio-performance. For the first-in-human study an oral suspension formulation was developed.  
The different formulations used for different Phase of clinical development have been adequately 
described. The development core tablet formulations have very similar compositions with one 
difference (in the 150 mg formulation the disintegrant was replaced). Both formulations were 
manufactured with the same process, applying dry granulation, followed by tablet compression and 
film coating.  
The dissolution performance of representative PF-07321332 150 mg immediate release film-coated 
tablet batches was investigated in dissolution media over the physiological range. The dissolution 
conditions were satisfactorily justified and were found to be most suitable and thus are proposed for 
the routine quality control (QC).  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was studied by testing diverse “bad” batches and is 
considered appropriately addressed.  Following a request during the rolling review, a revised 
dissolution specification has been provided for 150 mg PF-07321332 film-coated tablets and is 
accepted. Based on the dissolution results provided, the discriminating capability of the proposed 
dissolution method is considered demonstrated, with regard to the timepoint set for routine QC testing. 
The manufacturing process development of PF-07321332 150 mg immediate release film-coated 
tablets comprises a conventional dry granulation process including the following steps: blending, 
screening, lubrication, dry granulation, milling, blending, followed by tablet compression and film 
coating. 
A risk assessment considering requirements from the QTPP was conducted to identify the potential 
relationships between the process parameters and quality attributes. Based on this assessment, quality 
attributes including assay, content uniformity, dissolution, disintegration and tablet appearance were 
determined to be potentially impacted by the process parameters.  
As next step, based on the outcome of this risk assessment, statistically designed experiments were 
conducted at laboratory scale, with additional learnings gained during manufacture of clinical, technical 
transfer and registration stability batches to collect more manufacturing process understanding and to 
recommend acceptable operating ranges for finished product manufacture. The operating ranges 
studied for the process parameters at laboratory and large manufacturing scales were shown to be 
robust for all quality attributes studied. It is stated that parameters would continue to be evaluated to 
further refine the control strategy of finished product manufacturing for commercial supplies. Impact 
on manufacturability and dissolution of the finished product of certain steps needs to be addressed in 
further detail (REC6). 
Overall, the manufacturing process development experiments have defined operating ranges for the 
proposed unit operations, which are considered appropriate for manufacturing PF-07321332 finished 
product of acceptable quality. However, the control strategy with respect to unit operations should be 
substantially amended (see below in Manufacture of the product and process controls). 
The container closure system including the microbiological attributes has been adequately justified. For 
further details refer below to Co-packed medicinal product Paxlovid.

2.4.5.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The respective manufacturing sites along with their corresponding responsibilities are clearly specified.  
Confirmations are available stating that the manufacturers operate under GMP.  
A brief description is provided for the developed manufacturing process consisting of the following 
steps: initial blending, screening, lubrication, dry granulation followed by milling, blending and 
lubrication, followed by tablet compression and film coating.  
The 150 mg film-coated tablets use compendial excipients and are manufactured using conventional 
processing equipment. The narrative description of the manufacturing process is presented with an 
acceptable level of detail in the context of this procedure, with regard to process parameters limits and 
hold times. However the following updates in the process description should be made: the individual 
process steps should be numerated in line with the corresponding numeration indicated in the flow 
chart; the term „Package“ currently stated at Step 10 needs to be replaced with „Co-package“ or 
similar to adequately reflect the co-packaging of PF-07321332 with ritonavir film-coated tablets in the 
same blister (REC7).  
In addition it has been clarified that there are no intermediates in the manufacturing process but more 
details on the process description, fully reflecting the information level required in the Guideline on 
Manufacture of the Finished Dosage Form (EMA/CHMP/QWP/245074/2015) (e.g. the operating ranges 
defined within the process development) should be sufficiently considered in the process narrative and 
will be added once validation is complete (REC7). The applicant has noted that based on available 
batch data at the commercial site, including tech transfer, ICH registration stability, clinical, and 
commercial manufacture, there is no indication of criticality associated with any hold time between the 
manufacturing steps; all unit operations, have shown to be robust enough and in-process testing as 
well as enhanced analytical testing are in place to ensure appropriate quality of each released batch. 
However, it should be further clarified whether hold times are intended to be applied for the PF-
07321332 finished product manufacture and, if so, relevant supportive stability data should be 
provided (REC7). As manufacturing experience will be accumulated appropriate controls will be 
implemented, if needed, and critical process steps and parameters should be described (REC7). 
Considering the presented information and commitments made, in the context of this procedure, the 
level of detail of the narrative description of the manufacturing process is acceptable. Batch formulae 
for batch sizes are provided. 
With respect to process validation data, the applicant provided some batch data from recent 
commercial batches and responded that the requested validation scheme will be available in April 2022 
and validation data be provided in June 2022. The few data provided suggest high reproducibility and 
may be regarded as supportive only, but they cannot adequately replace a full process validation data. 
Therefore, full process validation data, considering all requirements specified in the Guideline on 
Process Validation for Finished Products (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1,Corr.1), 
should be provided (REC7). 
2.4.5.2.  Product specification analytical procedures, batch analysis, reference standards 
PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form including for appearance, identity (HPLC and IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.,  HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). During 
stability, only appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbial purity are 
performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 26/170 
 
 
 
Sufficient information on specifications has been provided. However, some additional testing 
parameters like content uniformity, tablet thickness, and tablet weight should be included in the 
release specifications (REC9).  
The impurities and degradation products have been sufficiently discussed. There are no impurities in 
the finished product that are different from those present in the active substance.  However, to 
complete the discussion on degradation products, the degradation pathway of the possible degradation 
products should be highlighted under the section 3.2.P.5.5 and linked sufficiently to 3.2.S.3.2 (REC9). 
The finished product contains no Class 1 or Class 2 mutagenic impurities or degradation products. 
The dissolution limit has been satisfactorily justified. An elemental impurities risk assessment was 
completed in line with ICH Q3D. The risk of the mentioned elemental impurities in each of the key 
sources, including the AS, excipients, container closure system, manufacturing equipment, and utilities 
were assessed. Batch data from testing representative lots of the in-going AS and film coating were 
considered in the risk assessment, as well as data from the Lhasa Elemental Impurities Excipients 
Database. The data showed that the risk of the Class 1, Class 2A elemental impurities exceeding the 
30% Control Threshold of the Option 2 concentration limits and associated Oral PDEs were low to 
negligible. Testing by sufficiently validated Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) 
on representative lots of the finished product confirmed the overall low - negligible risks for Class 1 
and Class 2A elemental impurities and Li exceeding their PDEs in the finished product. Based on the 
risk assessment and on the discussion presented it can be concluded that no elemental impurities 
testing and no additional EI controls are needed for the PF-07321332 IR tablets.   
A risk assessment on the potential presence and formation of nitrosamine in the finished product was 
completed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  The applicant states, that no vulnerable 
amines have been identified in AS or excipients, as well as no nitrosamine risk have been identified 
from the packaging material used. To support this risk assessment, the limit for any N-nitrosamine 
without specific toxicological information has been calculated as 30 ppb, using the acceptable lifetime 
intake of 18 ng/day recommended by EMA in “Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(09-Jul- 2020), in combination with the maximum daily dose of PF-07321332 of 600 mg and a 
conservative 10 year to lifetime treatment duration. The limit for DIPNA is 44 ppb, using the 
acceptable intake of 26.5 ng/day in combination with the maximum daily dose of PF-07321332 of 600 
mg. 
Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
Overall, the specification limits have been sufficiently justified. In addition, justification has been 
provided concerning exclusion of tests on water content, nitrosamines, chiral purity, elemental 
impurities. Further information on justification of the limit for assay during shelf life should be provided 
(REC9).  
The descriptions of the analytical procedures and their validations provided are acceptable. Some 
additional information concerning some validation parameters for the three methods used for identity, 
assay degradation products and content uniformity should be provided (REC9). Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards has been provided during the procedure.

Batch analysis data were provided for seven batches of PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets. 
These batches were manufactured according to the details described in Section P.3.3 Description of 
Manufacturing Process and Process Controls and tested by the methods described in Section P.5.2 
Analytical Procedures. Some of the data presented were evaluated against specifications that differ 
from those described in Section P.5.1. Specification(s) but all data were within the specifications at the 
time.  
Adventitious agents 
PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate, which is the only excipient in 
PF-07321332 150 mg tablets that is of animal origin. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from 
milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption 
and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet 
according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.4.6.  Ritonavir film-coated tablets 
2.4.6.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets are described as white to off white, capsule shaped, film-coated 
tablet, debossed with ‘H’ on one side and ‘R9’ on other side. Its approximate dimensions are 17.14 mm 
x 9.13 mm.   
Pharmaceutical development  
The finished product has been developed as a generic to the reference product Norvir, which is 
authorised in the EU by AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. Its qualitative composition is essentially 
similar to the reference product.  
Ritonavir active substance is a white to light tan powder. Due to its low solubility and permeability 
properties, it has been assigned to BCS Class IVa.  
Excipients matching those of the EU reference product were chosen, all of which complying with Ph. 
Eur. monographs, including those contained in the non-compendial coating mixture. All excipients are 
common ingredients for this product type. Their compatibility with the ritonavir premix was confirmed 
by stability data. Minor amendments should be made to the composition table as to specify the active 
ingredient at the declared amount (100 mg) along with one total amount of each excipient used 
(REC12).  
Pharmaceutical development started with pre-formulation studies based on published information, 
physicochemical characterisation and in-vitro dissolution data of the US and EU reference products. 
Formulation development was driven by ritonavir’s key physicochemical characteristics and reference 
product’s in-vitro dissolution characteristics., additional information is required on the stability of the 
polymorph form during storage and manufacturing conditions (REC13). 
Following several trial formulations, a manufacturing process was chosen which resulted in tablets with 
acceptable in vitro dissolution data. The manufacturing process development was described. A process 
robustness study was conducted, identifying the possible variables during various stages of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 28/170 
 
 
 
 
manufacturing process and their effect on the in vitro dissolution performance of the formulation. 
Optimisation studies of different steps of the process were conducted. Nevertheless, little information 
on the development of the manufacturing process is provided. Critical process parameters during 
manufacture are identified with specified set points. However, justification based on development data 
is awaited for CPPs during dry mixing, lubrication, compression, and film-coating (REC13).  
The proposed dissolution method for routine QC testing is paddles, 75 rpm 900 ml water with 60 mM 
Polyoxyethylene 10 Laurylether. As the requirements of Reflection Paper 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017 apply to ritonavir film-coated tablets as part of the CMA for 
Paxlovid, justification of the dissolution conditions are awaited, particularly the choice of media (water 
with surfactant at a specific concentration), and the agitation speed (75 rpm) (REC13). 
For commercial batches used in the bioequivalence study, in vitro dissolution studies were conducted 
and compared to the results obtained with the EU reference product. The dissolution profiles were 
found similar in all media when compared to the reference product, with acceptable f2 values.  
Based on the development data, the biopharmaceutical performance of the test product is considered 
similar if not exceeding that of the reference product. Yet, the proposed limit for dissolution testing is 
not considered appropriate as it is located in the plateau and furthermore it does not allow for 
discrimination between batches. As a consequence an MO was raised initially; the applicant is required 
to tighten the in-vitro dissolution specification in 3.2.P.5.1 according to the results obtained for the 
biobatches as per the Reflection Paper EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017 e.g. to NMT 75 % (Q) in 
45 min. In the context of a CMA this can be addressed as a specific obligation post-approval by June 
2022 (SO4). 
In summary, the finished product has been shown to be comparable to the reference product if not 
superior, based on key parameters in vitro dissolution and related substances profile/levels. However, 
several aspects of pharmaceutical development, including discussion of the proposed control strategy 
for the manufacturing process including manufacture of the polymorph form, need to be addressed, 
and compliance with current ICH Q8 (R2) should be established as discussed above. 
In the context of the CMA, the quality documentation provided for ritonavir film-coated tablets is 
considered acceptable from a risk-based perspective, as the product is currently registered in several 
European countries with the currently proposed specifications. 
The choice of container closure system for the co-packaged medicinal product is based on PF-
07321332 tablets and is justified and was confirmed by results of accelerated stability studies. As for 
the bulk tablets, the suitability of the primary container (HDPE, with polypropylene closure) was 
confirmed by results of accelerated stability studies for 3 months. No significant changes were 
observed for water content, assay, related compounds, and dissolution.  
No risk of nitrosamine formation is identified originating from the packaging components. No overages 
are used during manufacture of ritonavir film-coated tablets. Microbiological attributes and 
compatibility are not applicable for the proposed finished product.   
Detailed information on the container closure system (LDPE bag placed in triple laminated aluminium 
bag) for ritonavir bulk tablets was provided including specifications, analytical procedures and 
certificates of analysis issued by both the suppliers and the product manufacturer. 
2.4.6.1.  Manufacture of the product process controls and characterisation 
All manufacturing sites and their operations were defined. The manufacturing process uses three 
stages for preparation of the premix: Stage-I (RPM-I: preparation of premix), Stage-II (RPM-II: 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 29/170 
 
 
 
pulverisation), Stage-III (RPM-III: blending, sifting, packaging). Afterwards, the material is 
sifted/mixed and prepared for hot melt extrusion, milled/sifted, (pre)lubricated, before compression 
and coating take place. The process is considered as non-standard procedure due to the hot melt 
extrusion included. Process descriptions were provided along with flow charts. Batch formulae for 
production batch sizes were presented. Routine in-process controls were presented. For the 
intermediate a detailed specification including a description of analytical methods and certificates of 
analysis, packaging material and hold times were presented. However, stability data of the 
intermediate product are required and, the specifications for the packaging material for the 
intermediate product is awaited (REC14). Overall, the process is well-described and controlled by in-
process tests. Nevertheless, the applicant is expected to provide further details and justification for the 
control strategy employed based on development data (REC14).  
Process validation data were provided for commercial batches at both minimum and maximum batch 
size. Key parameter during dry mixing and lubrication was blend uniformity, monitored in individual 
samples taken at several locations to make sure that the active substance is evenly distributed 
throughout the blend. During compression and coating, it has been confirmed that the physical tablet 
parameters (mass variation, uniformity of dosage units, friability, hardness) comply with pre-defined 
requirements. The process has been shown to be reliable, robust and reproducible in order to obtain 
tablets that comply with the specifications and quality characteristics defined on the respective 
validation protocol. 
Also, validation results of the manufacturing process of three batches of ritonavir premix were 
provided. The critical steps of the process were monitored. The critical steps of the process were 
monitored in order to ensure that the process is suitable and reproducible. The following critical steps 
were validated through additional or more frequent than routine in-process control testing: pulverising, 
sifting and packing. The results obtained demonstrate that the manufacture of ritonavir premix is 
acceptable and reproducible in order to obtain an intermediate complying with the specifications and 
quality characteristics defined in the respective validation protocol. Nevertheless, some additional 
validation data for the hot melt extrusion process should be provided, to justify time/temperature 
regimes in the context of chemical instability of the AS to ensure satisfactory quality specifications 
whilst the least temperature stress is applied. Furthermore, the process optimisation study results 
should be disclosed (REC14). 
2.4.6.2.  Product specification analytical procedures, batch analysis, reference standards 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description, identification (HPLC and UV), average weight (mass), water content (KF), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur. - HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (content uniformity Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
During stability studies, tests for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbial 
purity are performed. Different specifications limits are applied for shelf life concerning water content 
and degradation products. During shelf life, the following parameters are tested: Description, assay, 
related substances, water content, dissolution, microbial purity. 
Sufficient information on specifications has been provided. The specifications for ritonavir 100 mg film-
coated tablets are generally in line with the requirements of the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs, ICH 
guidelines and batch analysis data.  
If not otherwise justified, the limit for dissolution testing should be revised as per the Reflection Paper 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017 (e.g. to NMT 75% (Q) in 45 min) (as discussed previously in 
Pharmaceutical Development (SO4)).  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 30/170 
 
 
 
There are no impurities in the product that are different from those present in the active substance. If 
not otherwise justified, the limit for water content, which has been set to the shelf life specification 
with NMT 6.5% should be tightened according to the data obtained as the maximum amount found is 4 
% (REC15). In summary, satisfactory information or justification of specifications has been provided 
in the context of this CMA. Revision of specification limits for dissolution and water content is expected 
as discussed. 
A risk assessment for elemental impurities as per ICH Q3D has been provided, which sufficiently justify 
absence of test for elemental impurities in the finished product. The component approach has been 
used. However, data of three consecutive batches or six pilot batches are awaited and the respective 
analytical methods validation data, should be provided (REC15). 
A risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamines as per the requirements of EMA guidance on 
Information on nitrosamine for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/189634/2019 & 
CMDh/404/2019) and (EMA/428592/2019 & CMDh/405/2019) has been provided. For ritonavir premix 
and ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets no risk for presence of nitrosamine impurities was identified. 
However, for completeness of the assessment further information is awaited. Specifically, the 
analytical method validation data for the methods of analysis of nitrosamines impurities, should also be 
provided (REC15). 
The analytical methods which are mentioned in the specifications have been sufficiently described. 
Validation design and appropriate validation data has been provided for almost all methods described 
under analytical procedures including the method used for the determination of blend assay, blend 
content uniformity. Validation data have been presented for the method used for determination of 
assay and dissolution testing as well as for identification by UV and microbial purity.  
Information on reference standards used including certificates of analysis has been provided. Some 
information is still expected concerning the purpose of the reference standards used (REC16). 
Batch analysis data have been presented for four batches. All data were within the specifications. 
Certificates of analyses have been presented. However, clarifications concerning discrepancies of some 
of the specification parameters reported in the CoAs is awaited (REC15). 
Adventitious agents 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the manufacture ritonavir 100 mg Film-
coated tablets. 
2.4.7.  Co-packed Paxlovid 
2.4.7.1.  Container closure system for the co-packaged finished product 
The co-packed finished medicinal product Paxlovid consists of separately manufactured film-coated 
tablets (2 x PF-07321332 150 mg and 1 x ritonavir 100 mg), which are co-packaged into a blister. 
The container closure system for PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets and externally sourced 
ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets consists of a foil/foil blister system made from a composite 
Oriented PolyAmide/Aluminium Foil/Polyvinylchloride (OPA/Al/PVC) foil blister with aluminium foil 
lidding where each tablet is placed into an individual blister cavity. Illustrative drawings and 
representative IR spectra of the packaging components were provided. Some information concerning 
Assessment report

declarations confirming regulatory compliance of material in contact with food should be provided 
(REC10). 
2.4.7.2.  Stability for the co-packaged finished product 
PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets 
Due to the accelerated pharmaceutical development, limited primary stability data is currently 
available for the PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablet.  
In accordance with ICH guideline Q1A(R2), a primary stability study consisting of PF-07321332 150 mg 
film-coated tablets packaged in proposed commercial foil/foil blister packaging has been initiated. The 
primary stability batches were manufactured at 10% of the proposed commercial scale at Pfizer's 
Freiburg (Germany) site and packaged at the same facility.  
Preliminary stability data for three primary batches of the 150 mg tablets were reported for three 
months at the long-term storage conditions of 30°C/ 75% RH and 25°C/60% RH and at the 
accelerated storage conditions of 40°C/ 75% RH. During stability, solely the stability indicating tests, 
appearance, assay, degradation products, water activity and dissolution were performed. Results met 
the specifications. However, the batch size of the primary stability batches should be detailed and the 
method used for determination of water activity should be described and validation data should be 
presented (REC11).  In addition, photostability (in accordance with ICH guideline Q1B) of one batch 
was evaluated and data was provided. From the results it was concluded that PF-07321332 150 mg 
film-coated tablets are stable to light and no precautionary packaging or labelling is required. 
Various supportive data of early development tablet formulations packaged in PCTFE/foil blisters, 
foil/foil blisters and (less protective) HDPE bottles were evaluated under different conditions. 3-month 
data at the long-term storage condition of 30°C/75% RH and at the accelerated storage condition of 
40°C/75% RH for one batch of each formulation were reported. Additional supportive stability data 
from two developmental batches of the commercial formulation through 6 weeks storage at the long-
term storage condition of 30°C/75% RH and at the accelerated storage condition of 40°C/75% RH 
were also presented. 
Forced degradation studies on PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets were performed, including 
thermal, thermal humidity and photolysis conditions, to establish the extent and nature of potential 
degradation pathways and to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity method. However, the 
stability indicating power for the method, which is used alternatively for the determination of assay, 
should be demonstrated (REC9). 
Stress studies on film-coated tablets were performed. Total degradation products remained within 
specifications. 
Based on the overall stability data from the primary stability studies, supportive studies, stress stability 
studies and forced degradation stability studies, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions are 
considered acceptable provided that the stability data will be monitored monthly (REC11). In addition, 
the storage conditions will be reviewed and updated as necessary according to the stability data 
(REC11). 
Ritonavir film-coated tablets 
Stability data for ritonavir 100 mg film coated tablets in the proposed co-packaged blister system is 
currently not available. Stability studies were carried out on three full batches of ritonavir 100 mg film-
coated tablets packed in Alu-Alu blister and stored up to 36 months at 25ºC/60% RH and 6 months at 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 32/170 
 
 
 
40°C/75% RH. No significant changes were observed in description, water content, resistance to 
crushing of tablets, dissolution, related compounds, assay, XRD and microbiological examination of 
ritonavir 100 mg Film-coated tablets and the results were found to be well-within the specification valid 
at that time. XRD test should be included in the regular tests of the post-approval stability protocol and 
stability commitment, while it should further be confirmed that microbiological tests will be performed 
annually (REC17). 
A forced degradation study was carried out as a part of the analytical method validation in order to 
prove the specificity of the HPLC method for assay and related compounds of ritonavir premix and 
ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets. 
Supporting stability data for batches of commercially available ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets 
packed in Alu-Alu blister are presented, for which a shelf life of 24 months has been approved. 
According to the data up to 36 months at 25ºC/60% RH and 6 months at 40ºC/75% RH, no significant 
changes were observed in description, water content, hardness, dissolution, related compounds, assay, 
XRD and microbiological quality. The results were found to be well within the shelf life specification. 
Stability results of ritonavir bulk tablets were also presented. The studies were conducted with three 
commercial batches, stored up to 12 months at ICH long term conditions (25°C/60% RH). All test 
parameters remain within specifications.  
For the bulk tablets, a shelf life of 12 months is confirmed when stored up to 25°C with excursions up 
to 14 days at 5 ± 3°C, -20 ± 5°C, 50 ± 2°C, but the proposed storage condition for the bulk tablets 
(“Do not store below 25°C”) should be justified (REC17). A statement is provided to confirm that the 
requirements of CPMP/QWP/072/96 are taken into account for setting the shelf life of ritonavir film-
coated tablets. 
In addition, the ritonavir bulk tablets component is considered as intermediate product for Paxlovid 
finished product, which is being introduced in the last steps of manufacture of Paxlovid. Therefore, the 
contents of Module 3.2.P ritonavir bulk tablets should be integrated as sub-chapter in Module 3.2.P.3 
of Paxlovid in order to avoid confusion and repeating of documents (REC18). 
In conclusion, the presented stability data for ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets show that tablets 
are stable for 24 months without any special storage conditions. The commercially available Hetero 
Ritonavir 100 mg tablet in foil/foil blister container closure system has an approved shelf life of 24 
months, which is considered appropriate for the Pfizer co-packaged presentation as well.  
Co-packaged finished product 
Stability data have been provided for the PF-07321332 tablet and ritonavir tablets packaged separately 
in the proposed packaging material (as discussed above). However, stability data for the co-packed 
Paxlovid finished product have not been provided and information concerning the final co-packed 
Paxlovid finished product to be marketed is reflected poorly in the dossier. The respective sections of 
3.2.P PF-07321332 tablets should be updated to include the missing information for the co-packed 
Paxlovid finished product to be marketed (REC18). 
The applicant stated that stability studies for the co-packaged Paxlovid finished product are currently 
scheduled to start in January/February 2022, depending on packaging schedules. 
The final shelf-life and storage condition for the co-packaged finished product Paxlovid is based on the 
more stringent shelf-life and storage condition for either of the two products, which is PF-07321332 
150 mg film-coated tablets. Therefore, based on the overall available stability data presented for both 
components of the co-packaged product, the proposed shelf-life of 1 year with storage conditions “Do 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 33/170 
 
 
 
 
not store above 25°C. Do not refrigerate or freeze”, as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is 
acceptable. 
The twelve months stability for the Paxlovid finished product is acceptable provided the applicant will 
monitor the stability data monthly and will immediately inform the authorities in the case of out of 
specification (OOS) results. Storage conditions “Do not store above 25°C”, “Do not refrigerate or 
freeze” is accepted provided that these storage conditions will be updated as required when further 
stability data are available. 
2.4.8.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The applicant has applied for conditional marketing authorisation (CMA). In the context of the current 
public health emergency situation due to COVID-19 pandemic and the pharmaceutical development of 
the proposed medicinal products, the submitted quality documentation is considered sufficient for CMA 
approval. 
Paxlovid finished product comprises two separately manufactured dosage forms both presented as 
film-coated tablets. These two components of the finished product are film-coated tablets containing 
150 mg PF-07321332 as active substance and film-coated tablets containing 100 mg ritonavir as active 
substance. For ease of daily co-administration, both components (PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated 
tablets and ritonavir film-coated tablets) are co-packaged in the same blister. 
Active substance PF-07321332 
The submitted information on development, manufacture, control and stability of the active substance 
indicate that currently manufactured batches are of appropriate quality and that is comparable to that 
of clinical development batches. Some issues, initially raised as MOs, in relation to the active substance 
should be addressed post-approval as Specific Obligations (SOs) in the context of the CMA. Two of 
these issues relate to the control strategy of the manufacturing process and the impurities in the active 
substance. A third issue that should be followed-up post approval as SO concerns the completion of the 
validation study of the method for assay and impurity testing, and of the method for the residual 
solvent. 
Active substance ritonavir 
Ritonavir is an established active substance described in the Ph. Eur. The supplier of ritonavir used in 
the manufacture of Paxlovid is Hetero Drugs Limited. Ritonavir from Hetero is already approved for use 
in other medicinal products in the EU, using the AMSF procedure; the ASMF is acceptable.  
Finished product 
PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets are designed as an immediate release dosage form and are 
manufacture by a standard manufacturing process. Although relatively limited stability data were 
presented, they were adequate to establish an acceptable shelf life provided that the applicant will 
monitor the stability data monthly and will inform the authorities immediately in the case of out of 
specification results. 
Ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets co-packaged in Paxlovid, are externally sourced and have been 
approved in EU countries since 2015 as a generic product of the reference product Norvir. Therefore, 
the quality of ritonavir film-coated tablets is considered acceptable in the context of the CMA. 
However, an issue concerning the acceptance criteria of the dissolution of ritonavir tablets, initially 
raised as MO should be addressed post-approval as a Specific Obligations (SO) in the context of the 
CMA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022

Overall, the information on development, manufacture and control of the two components of the 
finished product (i.e. PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets and ritonavir 100 mg film-coated 
tablets) has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant 
to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a 
satisfactory way. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor quality issues having no impact on the 
benefit/risk ratio of the product, which pertain to supplementing various parts of the dossier module 3 
with updated and new information relating to the PF-07321332 active substance attributes, 
manufacture, control strategy and stability of the finished product and to update the information 
relating to ritonavir tablet component in line with technical and scientific progress in compliance with 
Article 23 of Directive 2001/83/EC. These points are put forward as recommendations (RECs) for 
future quality development and were agreed by the applicant to be addressed within an acceptable 
timeframe. 
The data presented to support consistent quality of the medicinal product Paxlovid is considered to be 
sufficient in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation in the current (COVID-19) pandemic 
emergency situation. To complete the quality documentation in the framework of the conditional 
marketing authorisation, the applicant should fulfil the mentioned specific obligations (SOBs) post-
approval within an acceptable timeframe. 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the context of the current (COVID-19) pandemic, is 
considered to be consistent and acceptable in the context of a CMA in an emergency situation.  
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have 
been investigated and are controlled in an acceptable way. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical 
performance. 
The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured product batches are of appropriate 
quality that is comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, in order to confirm that 
the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical 
development batches over the life cycle of the medicinal product a number of issues are expected to 
be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations (SOs) within the defined timeframe. The 
identified issues discussed in this report and listed in List 1 are compatible with the granting of a CMA. 
The CHMP has identified the following specific obligations (SOs) to address the identified quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product, and which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical quality data and 
controls for the active substances and the finished product. In the List 2  of this report the specific 
points that need to be addressed in order to fulfil the imposed specific obligations are detailed.

2.4.10.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Quality recommendations are covered in the list of recommendations in Annex I. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Paxlovid contains two active substances: PF-07321332 and ritonavir. PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic 
inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism 
of PF-07321332, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of PF-07321332. 
The non-clinical development programme was designed in accordance with ICH guideline M3. Ritonavir 
was originally developed as an antiretroviral agent used in HIV infection (at 600 mg BID dose); 
nowadays, it is exclusively used as a PK enhancer (mostly at 100 mg BID) for protease inhibitors in 
HIV and HCV infection; in the context of such PK enhancement use, ritonavir is often referred to as a 
‘booster’. As part of such boosted regimens ritonavir is of long-term use due to HIV being a chronic 
disease. Its non-clinical and clinical safety profile is well known and given that Paxlovid is intended for 
a 5 days treatment duration, no additional animal studies with ritonavir have been performed, which is 
acceptable. The following discussion on non-clinical aspects will therefore concentrate on PF-07321332. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
PF-07321332 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that exhibits a broad-
spectrum activity across the Coronaviridae family of 3CL proteases demonstrating its potential for a 
“pancoronavirus” activity but of uncertain efficacy against notably MERS-CoV until adequate clinical 
efficacy demonstration. The critical amino acid residues involved in enzyme-inhibitor binding 
interactions are particularly well conserved within this family of viruses.

2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro primary pharmacodynamic data are included in the clinical pharmacology section of this 
assessment report. 
In vivo pharmacodynamic studies 
A total of two in vivo studies were presented evaluating the antiviral activity of PF-07321332. PF-
07321332 showed antiviral activity in mouse models with mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 infection 
in BALB/c and 129 mouse strains (studies 105036 and 022652). Oral administration of PF-07321332 at 
300 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg twice daily initiated 4 hours post-inoculation or 1000 mg/kg twice daily 
initiated 12 hours post inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 MA10 (mouse-adapted virus) resulted in reduction 
of lung viral titres and ameliorated indicators of disease (weight loss and lung pathology) compared to 
placebo-treated animals.  
The applicant has used a mouse-adapted virus which was modified from the original virus with several 
nucleotide changes. The relevance of its nucleotide changes is not clear to the intended extrapolation 
to the clinical setting. The applicant has discussed the choice of the mouse-adapted virus as in vivo 
model rather than a modified mice model such as K18-hACE2 mice which could have been used with 
the SARS-CoV-2 and its variant. SARS-CoV-2 MA exhibited more clinically relevant phenotypes than 
those seen in Hfh4-ACE2 transgenic mice, which expresses human ACE2, and thus SARS-CoV-2 MA is 
used by numerous investigators in the SARS-CoV-2 field.  
No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the reduction of viral load in the upper respiratory 
tract and the impact of PF-07321332 treatment on viral transmission. The applicant rightly pointed out 
that analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hamsters by Abdelnabi et al (preprint) shows that the 
treatment of hamsters by PF-07321332 prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  
While ritonavir at booster dose does not exhibit an in vitro antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2, there is an 
ongoing in vivo study with PF-07321332 in combination with ritonavir using a mouse-adapted model of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (MA-SARS-CoV-2) in BALB/c mice. At the present stage, the lack of this study 
for the combination PF-07321332/ritonavir is acceptable given that ritonavir is used as a PK enhancer 
and the lack of antiviral effect by ritonavir. However, ritonavir affects both 07321332 metabolism and 
transport. This study, which should be provided post-approval, is considered essential for a better 
understanding of PF-07321332 distribution and efficacy following co-administration of PF-07321332 
and ritonavir.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies were undertaken against a wide panel of receptors, transporters, ion channels and 
enzyme assays, and the results indicated no significant inhibition of functional or enzyme activity at 
human relevant concentrations (study 100054569). No off-target was identified up to 100 µM (39x the 
predicted human unbound Cmax at the intended clinical regimen). 
PF-07321332 was also tested for inhibitory activity against 11 PDE subtypes (1 to 11) and the IC50 
values were determined to be >200 µM (study 20LJ074), which represented 78x the predicted human

2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
PF-07321332 was assessed in a series of safety pharmacology studies to assess potential 
pharmacodynamic effects on vital organ systems (central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory).  
For the in vivo safety pharmacology studies, two studies covering the respiratory and central nervous 
system in Wistar Han rats, different groups (study 8455743) and the cardiovascular system in 
cynomolgus monkeys (study 20GR275) were assessed. 
Relating to the effects on pulmonary system, administration of 1000 mg/kg of PF-07321332 (Cmax 
51.5 µg/ml from rat 2-wk study) single dose resulted in test article related higher respiratory rate (up 
to +44%) and minute volume (up to +38%) compared with vehicle controls from 40 to 160 minutes 
post-dose. Relating to the effects on CNS, in the quantitative locomotor assessment, administration of 
1000 mg/kg of PF-07321332 single dose resulted in test article-related lower number of mean vertical 
movement counts (-36%) during the first 5 minutes of the assessment period and higher number of 
mean horizontal (+298%) and vertical (+838%) movement counts during the last 30 minutes of the 
assessment period compared with vehicle controls. These effects were observed at exposures 12-fold 
higher than the anticipated clinical Cmax. A no observed effect level (NOEL) of 60 mg/kg is reported 
(Cmax 13.3 µg/ml from rat 2-wk study), associated with PF-07321332 exposures 3.2-fold higher than 
the anticipated clinical Cmax. 
Relating to the cardiovascular safety pharmacology study, it was conducted in conscious telemetered 
male monkeys in a cross-over design. PF-07321332 administered at 150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day (Cmax = 
14.7 µg/ml) produced HR decreases of down to -14 bpm from 0.75–16.00 HPD and increased systolic, 
diastolic and mean blood pressure (up to +5 mmHg) from 0.75–5.5 HPD (diastolic only) and 7.25-9.00 
HPD. The RR-interval was increased by up to +52 msec 0.75–16.00 HPD, consistent with the decrease 
in HR during this same time. Increases in both the PR interval (+3 msec) and QT-interval (up to +13 
msec) were observed during the 0.75-9.00 HPD period, which were considered secondary to the 
decrease in HR. When the QT interval was corrected for HR (QTc), there was a test article-related 
decrease (down to -7 msec) during the 7.25-16.00 HPD period. It was also noted a decrease in LV 
+dP/dt max (down to -364 mmHg/sec) during the 0.75-9.00 HPD period. All measures returned to 
vehicle control levels within 24 HPD. These cardiovascular effects were observed at exposures 3.5-fold 
higher than the anticipated clinical Cmax. A no observed effect level (NOEL) of 40 (20 BID) mg/kg is 
reported, associated with PF-07321332 exposures 0.33-fold higher than the anticipated clinical Cmax. 
From in vitro and ex vivo data (studies 200804.QHJ, 20LJ076 and 20J075), there was no clinically 
meaningful effect of PF-07321332 on hERG, isolated guinea pig heart or isolated rat aorta assays. The 
IC50 values for PF-07321332 inhibition of the Nav1.5 (peak) sodium and the Cav1.2 calcium channel 
currents were both determined to be >300 μM, (study 20LJ073), which represented 117x the predicted 
human unbound PF-07321332 Cmax at the intended clinical regimen. 
In these studies, no toxicokinetic parameters were included (except one measure of plasma 
concentration at 150 mg/kg/day in cardiovascular monkey study 20GR275). PF-07321332 Cmax values 
were extrapolated from 2-week studies in rats. Exposure from 4-week toxicity study are available; 
since Cmax observed in rats after 4-week administration were lower than those observed after 2-week 
administration, exposure margins extrapolated from the 2-week study in rat is acceptable. Exposure 
margins are expressed based on predicted human total PF-07321332 where a BID dose of 300/100 mg 
PF-07321332/ritonavir resulted in a Cmax of 4.14 µg/ml. 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with the combination of PF-07321332 with 
ritonavir. Given that that ritonavir is used as a PK enhancer and safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted at concentrations (in vitro) and doses (in vivo) that yielded exposures significantly higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 40/170 
 
 
 
than the predicted PK values of 300 mg/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir, the lack of safety 
pharmacology studies with the combination is acceptable. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In vivo pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with PF-07321332 have not been conducted. In 
vitro antiviral activity of PF-07321332 is discussed in the clinical pharmacology section. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The LC-MS/MS methods implemented were validated for the quantitation of PF-07321332 in plasma. 
No analytical methods were developed for quantitation of circulatory metabolites of PF-07321332 or 
quantitation of PF-07321332 in tissues in GLP toxicity studies given that no quantifiable metabolites of 
PF-07321332 in human plasma were observed when PF-07321332 is co-administered with ritonavir.  
The absorption was evaluated in two single dose administration studies in rat and monkey to study the 
PK profile of PF-07321332 (studies 103131 and 111728). PF-07321332 was rapidly absorbed and 
exhibited a moderate CL, with a moderate to low Vss, resulting in t½ values of 5 hours in rats and <1 
hour in monkeys. Following oral dosing, the overall bioavailability was moderate to high (29 to 
>100%) in rats but low (<10%) in monkeys. Repeat dose pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332 were 
evaluated following 14- or 15-day administration in the toxicity studies in rats and monkeys (studies 
20GR276 and 20GR289) and in embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies in rats and rabbits (21GR132 
and 21GR126). In rats, systemic exposures increased with dose and decreased with treatment 
duration. In monkeys, while systemic exposures also increased with dose, there was no decrease in 
exposure with treatment duration. On the contrary, in the 4-week study, at the two highest tested 
doses, exposures were higher at the end of treatment compared to Day 1. There were no consistent 
sex-related differences in systemic exposure. Systemic exposure increased with increasing doses in 
pregnant rats and rabbits. 
The distribution study results showed that PF-07321332 was moderately bound to plasma proteins in 
rat, monkey and human and similar across these species (study 010657). Concentration-dependent 
protein binding was observed in rabbit plasma (YDP/067/394).  PF-07321332 preferentially distributed 
into plasma relative to blood cells in rat, monkey and human (study 100444). 
An in vivo distribution study (quantitative whole-body autoradiography, QWBA) is on-going. The results 
from that study should be provided as it will provide an understanding of the distribution of 14C-
labelled drug-related material in tissues. 
The metabolism of PF-07321332 was evaluated in vitro in liver microsomes, hepatocytes and in vivo in 
rats and monkeys (studies 084546, 072016, 082057, 021055, 090141). A total of six metabolites were 
detected arising from hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and hydrolysis reactions. The major metabolite 
was M4 (PF-07329268). In plasma of rats and monkeys, unchanged parent drug was the most 
prevalent drug-related entity, with M4 as a major metabolite in monkeys. All oxidative metabolites 
were formed by CYP3A4/5, with other CYP enzymes contributing very minor amounts. Unchanged 
parent drug was also the most prevalent drug-related entity in rat urine and bile. In human plasma 
unchanged PF-07321332 was the main circulated compound, M4 and M5 were found at trace levels.  
The urinary and/or biliary excretion was assessed in single-dose PK studies after IV or oral dosing of 
PF-07321332 to rats (study 103131) and monkeys (study 111728). The percentage of PF-07321332 
dose excreted unchanged was 17% in the urine, 9% in the bile, and up to 11% in the faeces in rats, 
and 7% in the urine and 4% in the faeces in monkeys. The low percentage of PF-07321332 dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 41/170 
 
 
 
excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and faeces along with the relatively low CLr suggests minor urinary 
and biliary contributions to the overall elimination of PF-07321332. 
Mass balance excretory pathways and metabolic profile of unlabelled PF-07321332 was also assessed 
(studies 014401 and 021626). The primary excretion routes of orally administered PF-07321332 with 
ritonavir were urinary excretion of unchanged drug. In urine and faeces, unchanged PF-07321332 
accounted for 82.5% of the drug material (55% in urine and 27.5% in faeces). M5 was present at 
12.1% in faeces and urine, M8 (PF-07331782) at 4.2%, m/z 519 at 0.8% and M7 (acyl glucuronide of 
M5) at 0.3%of the dose. In rabbit and in monkey, M3, M4, M5 and m/z 498 were detected in plasma. 
All of these metabolites are below 10% the threshold specified in ICH M3 requested for toxicity 
assessment and no quantifiable metabolites of PF-07321332 in human plasma were observed when PF-
07321332 is co-administered with ritonavir.   
Animal data suggested minor urinary and biliary contributions to the overall elimination of PF-
07321332 whereas clinical results suggested that the primary excretion routes of orally administered 
PF-07321332 with ritonavir were urinary excretion of unchanged drug. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology programme for PF-07321332 has been designed in line with the requirements of ICH M3 
(R2) and taking into consideration the proposed treatment duration of 5-days.  
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity study was performed. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The species used for the GLP compliant pivotal studies included rats and monkeys based on similar PK 
profile seen in these species compared to human. Furthermore, the pharmacological target of PF-
07321332 is an exogenous entity (virus-specific protein) and therefore there are no pharmacologically 
relevant species. The oral route of administration was selected as it is the route of clinical 
administration.  
The toxicity of PF-07321332 was evaluated in 4 GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 1 month in 
duration in rats (studies 20GR276 and 21GR122) and cynomolgus monkeys (20GR289 and 20GR125). 
Two preliminary 4-days studies in rats (20GR250) and monkeys (20GR271) were also evaluated. 
Rats were administered once daily and monkeys twice daily as in human. This administration twice 
daily in monkeys was not supported by T1/2 which is <1h, however this regimen scheme was performed 
to mimic clinical regimen. Final reports have been submitted for the studies except for the 1-month 
study in rats and in monkeys (unaudited draft).  
There were no adverse findings in any of the studies. The NOAELs were the highest doses administered 
1000 mg/kg in rat and 600 mg/kg (300 BID) in monkeys and represented 11x/8.0x and 21x/14x for 
rats and monkeys (Cmax/AUC24), respectively, over the predicted human total PF-07321332 Cmax 
and AUC24 at a dose of 300/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir BID. Margins of exposure were calculated 
based on toxicokinetic data from the 2-week rat repeated dose toxicity study (20GR276) and predicted 
human total PF-07321332 Cmax of 4.14 μg/mL and AUC24 of 68.6 μg h/mL at a BID dose of 300/100 
mg PF-07321332/ritonavir, therefore the margins of exposure are only indicative at this stage as the 
PopPK model is only based on PK data collected from healthy volunteers. All non-adverse test article 
related clinical findings observed in rats (salivation and soft faeces, increases in aPPT, prothrombin, 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 42/170 
 
 
 
platelet count) or in monkeys (sporadic occurrence of emesis, increases in ALT, AST, fibrinogen) are 
monitorable in human. Test article related effects associated with the oral administration of PF-
07321332 to rats up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 1-month were limited to non-adverse findings in the liver, 
thyroid and pituitary gland. The pattern of linked findings in the liver, thyroid and pituitary glands are 
consistent with a rat specific response to hepatic enzyme induction resulting in increased thyroxine 
catabolism, raised serum thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy and 
anterior pituitary vacuolation (Childs et al, 1982; Greaves, 2012; Rosol et al, 2013). This mechanism is 
usually considered to have little to no relevance to humans mostly because of the marked differences 
in plasma half-life of thyroid hormones and in binding to transport proteins between rodents and 
humans (Rosol et al, 2013). No such findings were observed in monkeys. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
PF-07321332 was assessed in a series of genetic toxicity studies consisting of the microbial bacterial 
reverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (micronucleus in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells), and in vivo 
rat micronucleus assay up to 1000 mg/kg/day (studies 20GR288, 20GR286 and 20GR276a). All in vitro 
tests were conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation using concentrations up to 
applicable guideline limits or those limited by cytotoxicity or insolubility. PF-07321332 was not 
genotoxic in either in vitro or in vivo assays. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. Considering that the duration of treatment is limited 
to 5 days, the absence of carcinogenicity studies is in-line with the recommendations of ICH S1A. 
There are no microscopic findings indicative of pre-neoplastic changes from the limited duration repeat 
dose toxicity studies. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and embryo-foetal development studies were evaluated in rats and rabbits with PF-07321332 
(studies 21GR146, 21GR132 and 21GR126). Pre- and postnatal development was evaluated in rats 
(21GR149) based on the interim results.  
In the fertility study, there was no adverse effect of PF-07321332 on parental endpoints and on the 
reproductive performance of male and female rats treated at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day from 14 
days premating. C-section data did not highlight any treatment-related adverse effect on early 
embryonic development in the treated vs. concurrent control group. At the NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day 
for parental toxicity and fertility, the AUC-based exposure ratio reached 4.3. 
In the rat embryo-foetal development study, PF-07321332 was not shown to induce maternotoxicity, 
foetotoxicity or teratogenicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day administered during the whole period of 
organogenesis. Foetal examination showed increased litter and foetal incidences of 27th presacral 
vertebrae (skeletal variation) at the high dose level compared to concurrent controls (litter: 6%, 0%, 
5%, 21%; foetal: 0.93%, 0.00%, 0.56%, 4.29%) and outside historical control range (litter: 0-10.5%; 
foetal: 0-2.4%). Since there were no associated skeletal malformations or variations in associated 
structures, or any other adverse effect on embryo-foetal development, this finding could be considered 
as non-adverse. Overall, the maternal and developmental NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day in rats. At this 
dose level, the AUC-based exposure ratio was 7.8. 
In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study, slight effects on maternal body weight gain and food 
consumption were noted during the treatment period at the high dose level of 1000 mg/kg/day, but 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 43/170 
 
 
 
were not considered as adverse based on low magnitude of difference from control and lack of impact 
on absolute body weights. PF-07321332-related, adverse, lower foetal weight (0.91x control) was 
observed at 1000 mg/kg/day. At foetal examination, the foetal and/or litter incidences of a skeletal 
malformation (fused sternebrae) and visceral/skeletal variations (small gallbladder, misaligned 
sternebrae, bent hyoid arch) were increased compared to those in both concurrent and historical 
controls. As regards the increased incidence of small gallbladder, a paternally-mediated effect (see e.g. 
Stomp et al 2012) could not be excluded based on further analysis of sire records. Overall, the 
developmental NOAEL in rabbits was 300 mg/kg/day and corresponds to an AUC-based exposure ratio 
of 2.8. 
In the ongoing pre- and postnatal development toxicity study conducted in rats, a significant decrease 
in preweaning pup body weight gain from PND 10-17 at 1000 mg/kg/day was observed and translated 
into a decrease in pup body weight on PND 17 and 21. This effect seems transient since there is no 
significant impact on F1 offspring body weight or body weight gain from PND 21-56. In comparison to 
the interim results, with the final results additional data on any potential treatment-related effects on 
F1 oestrous cycles, reproductive performance (incl. intrauterine survival of F2 embryos), 
neurobehavior (auditory startle response, motor activity, learning and memory), and macroscopic 
examination at necropsy will be reported. 
As regards ritonavir, developmental toxicity was identified in rats and rabbits mainly at maternally 
toxic dose levels, whereas there was no effect on fertility in rats.  
PF-07321332 does not present a phototoxicity potential. No combination studies with administration of 
PF-07321332 with ritonavir have been conducted. Ritonavir is an already marketed drug as a PK 
enhancer with well characterised nonclinical and clinical safety profiles. No PD activity of ritonavir at 
100 mg (BID) dose is expected and no overlapping or additive toxicities between PF-07321332 and 
ritonavir are expected since no target organs have been identified after PF-07321332 administration in 
rats and monkeys up to 1-month duration. A combination toxicity study, therefore, will not provide any 
additional information beyond the known individual toxicity profiles of PF-07321332 and ritonavir.  
2.5.4.6.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance studies with PF-07321332 have not been conducted. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA for Paxlovid was performed according to the current guideline, the phase II assessment is still 
ongoing. Results of OECD107 study indicated LogDow < 4.5 for PF-07321332, therefore there is no 
need to screen PBT potential of PF-07321332. The PECsw value for PF-07321332 with 5 days of 
treatment (0.041 µg/L) is still higher than the 0.01 µg/L action limit. For ritonavir, reference is made 
to literature for LogDow value (< 4.5). No study report or detailed description of the conditions of the 
performed test was provided. The Log Dow for ritonavir needs to be determined experimentally 
according to the current guideline and sufficient details of the test performance need to be provided to 
determine the acceptability of the study. The PECsw value for ritonavir with 5 days of treatment (0.014 
µg/L) is also higher than the 0.01 µg/L action limit.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies are submitted in accordance with legal requirements; available guidelines and 
scientific advice has been followed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 44/170 
 
 
 
Pharmacology 
In vitro primary pharmacodynamic data is discussed under the clinical pharmacology section of this 
assessment report. 
The in vivo proof of concept studies consistently support the antiviral activity of PF-07321332, as 
demonstrated by reduced infectious lung titres and ameliorated indicators of disease (weight loss and 
lung pathology) compared to placebo-treated animals in mouse models with mouse-adapted SARS-
CoV-2 infection in BALB/c and 129 mouse strains. While ritonavir at booster dose does not exhibit an in 
vitro antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2, the applicant confirmed there is an ongoing in vivo study with 
PF-07321332 in combination with ritonavir using a mouse-adapted (MA) model of SARS-CoV-2 
infection (MA-SARS-CoV-2) in BALB/c mice.  The final study report should be provided (REC). At the 
present stage, the lack of this study for the combination PF-07321332/ritonavir is acceptable given 
that ritonavir is used as a PK enhancer and the lack of antiviral effect by ritonavir. However, ritonavir 
affects both 07321332 metabolism and transport. This study is considered essential for a better 
understanding of PF-07321332 distribution and efficacy following co-administration of PF-07321332 
and ritonavir.  
No off-target was identified in secondary PD studies up to 100 µM (39x the predicted human unbound 
Cmax at the intended clinical regimen). 
All pivotal safety pharmacology study reports contain GLP compliance statements, indicating they have 
been conducted in accordance with the principles of GLP, in an OECD MAD adherent country. Both in 
vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to address the safety pharmacology core battery, in line with 
ICH S7A. A higher respiratory rate (up to +44%), a higher minute volume (up to +38%), a lower 
number of mean vertical movement counts during the first 5 minutes of the assessment period (up to 
36%) and a higher number of mean horizontal (+298%) and vertical (+838%) movement counts 
during the last 30 minutes were observed in rats after a single administration of 1000 mg/kg of PF-
07321332 (12-fold higher than the anticipated clinical Cmax). In telemetered male monkeys the 
highest tested dose (150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day, 3.5-fold higher than the anticipated clinical Cmax) 
produced HR decreases of down to -14 bpm from 0.75–16.00 HPD and increased systolic, diastolic and 
mean blood pressure (up to +5 mmHg) from 0.75–5.5 HPD (diastolic only) and 7.25-9.00 HPD. The 
RR-interval was increased by up to +52 msec 0.75–16.00 HPD, consistent with the decrease in HR 
during this same time. Increases in both the PR interval (+3 msec) and QT-interval (up to +13 msec) 
were observed during the 0.75-9.00 HPD period, which were considered secondary to the decrease in 
HR. When the QT interval was corrected for HR (QTc), there was a test article-related decrease (down 
to -7 msec) during the 7.25-16.00 HPD period. PF-07321332 at 150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day also 
produced decreases in LV +dP/dt max (down to -364 mmHg/sec) during the 0.75-9.00 HPD period. 
These effects on safety pharmacology parameters were monitored in clinical trials and no safety 
concerns were identified and will be followed with the PSUR.  
Pharmacokinetics 
A nonclinical pharmacokinetic programme was carried out to evaluate the ADME properties of PF-
07321332. All studies are available except the ongoing in vivo QWBA study performed with PF-
07321332 (alone) which study report is requested by 31/03/2022 together with the applicant’s 
assessment (LEG). 
Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology package for PF-07321332 has been designed in line with the requirements 
of ICH M3 (R2) and taking into consideration the proposed treatment period of 5-days in duration. All 
pivotal safety pharmacology study reports contain GLP compliance statements, indicating they have 
been conducted in accordance with the principles of GLP, in an OECD MAD adherent country. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022

Repeated dose toxicity study final reports have been submitted except for 1-month in rats and in 
monkeys. These final study reports 21GR122 and 21GR125 are requested by 31/01/2022 (LEG). In 
relation to reproductive and developmental toxicity, a rat fertility study and two EFD studies in rats and 
rabbits are completed and submitted. The pre- and postnatal development study was ongoing; the 
interim report has been provided. The final study report for the PPND (21GR149) is requested by 
30/04/2022 (LEG). The applicant’s submission of new non-clinical data should be accompanied with an 
updated non-clinical overview and related updated tabulated and written summaries.  
The toxicity of PF-07321332 was evaluated in 4 pivotal GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 1 month 
in duration in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. There were no adverse findings in any of the studies. The 
NOAELs were the highest doses administered (1000 mg/kg in rat and 600 mg/kg (300 BID) in 
monkeys and represented 11x/8.0x and 21x/14x for rats and monkeys(Cmax/AUC24), respectively, 
over the predicted human total PF-07321332 Cmax and AUC24 at a dose of 300/100 mg PF-
07321332/ritonavir BID. The margins of exposure are only indicative at this stage. All non-adverse test 
article related clinical findings observed in rats (salivation and soft faeces, increases in aPPT, PT, PLT 
count) or in monkeys (sporadic occurrence of emesis, increases in ALT, AST, fibrinogen) are 
monitorable in human.  
The margins of exposure are therefore only indicative at this stage and it is expected to be further 
substantiated with the awaited provision of a relevant PopPK model including PK data collected from 
the patients enrolled in the EPIC-HR study with relevant covariables to be studied (notably age, 
weight, formulation). The PopPK model should be updated and provided once available (refer to clinical 
pharmacology LEG). 
The standard genotoxicity battery was performed, and negative results are acceptable by CHMP. 
No adverse effect of PF-07321332 on fertility parameters were observed up to 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC-
based exposure ratio reached 4.3). No effect of PF-07321332 on embryo-foetal development were 
observed in rats up to 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC-based exposure ratio was 7.8). In the rabbit embryo-
foetal development study, slight effects on maternal body weight gain and food consumption were 
noted during the treatment period at the high dose level of 1000 mg/kg/day, but were not considered 
as adverse based on low magnitude of difference from control and lack of impact on absolute body 
weights. PF-07321332-related, adverse, lower foetal weight (0.91x control) was observed at 1000 
mg/kg/day. The developmental NOAEL in rabbits was 300 mg/kg/day and corresponds to an AUC-
based exposure ratio of 2.8. This is adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. In the ongoing 
pre- and postnatal development toxicity study conducted in rats, a significant decrease in preweaning 
pup body weight gain from PND 10-17 at 1000 mg/kg/day was observed and translated into a 
decrease in pup body weight on PND 17 and 21. This effect seems transient since there is no 
significant impact on F1 offspring body weight or body weight gain from PND 21-56.  
PF-07321332 does not present a phototoxicity potential. No combination studies with administration of 
PF-07321332 with ritonavir have been conducted. 
An ERA for Paxlovid was performed according to the current guideline, the phase II assessment is still 
ongoing. The PECsw value for PF-07321332 with 5 days of treatment (0.041 µg/L) is higher than the 
0.01 µg/L action limit. Based on literature, for ritonavir there is a Log Dow value (< 4.5). The Log Dow 
for ritonavir needs to be determined experimentally according to the current guideline and sufficient 
details of the test performance need to be provided to determine the acceptability of the study. The 
applicant needs to clarify this point in the further ERA update.  The PECsw value for ritonavir with 5 
days of treatment (0.014 µg/L) is also higher than the 0.01 µg/L action limit. The ERA part II should 
be provided (REC).

Study 1005 (EPIC-HR, C4671005) is the single pivotal study supporting this conditional marketing 
authorisation application. This Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non-
hospitalised, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to 
severe illness will determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PF-07321332/ritonavir compared 
with placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Additionally, there are on-going studies 1002 and 1006 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients who 
are at low risk of progressing to severe disease and in the preventing of symptomatic SARS CoV-2 
infection in adult household contacts of individuals with symptomatic COVID-19, respectively. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir) is a combination therapy of PF-07321332, a new chemical entity, 
which is a potent and selective peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL, a viral encoded 
enzyme that is critical to SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, and ritonavir. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 49/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the current submission, the applicant is seeking an initial approval for Paxlovid for the treatment of 
adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with symptomatic, 
confirmed COVID-19 who are at high risk for progressing to severe disease, including hospitalisation 
and/or death. 
The proposed recommended oral dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir is 300 mg/100 mg twice daily (BID). 
The drug product for registration is a tablet containing PF-07321332 at one strength 150 mg and a 
tablet containing ritonavir at one strength 100 mg. 
The clinical pharmacology programme as presented in Table 1 consisted of 7 Phase 1 studies 
performed completed or ongoing in healthy volunteers. The following Phase 1 studies have been 
conducted: 
•  1 SAD and MAD study in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects (Study 1001) 
•  Relative bioavailability, QTc analysis, food effect and mass balance study (Study 1001) 
•  6 PK studies investigating intrinsic (Studies 1010 and 1011 for respectively hepatic and renal 
impairment) and extrinsic factors (Studies 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015). 
Phase 1 studies 1012, 1013 and Phase 2/3 studies 1002 and 1006 are ongoing. PK data from these 
studies will be submitted as soon as they become available. 
A population PK analysis was performed and comprised PK data from healthy volunteers only. In 
addition, a simulation exercise was performed (separated report) to evaluate the predictive 
performance of the developed Pop-PK model on the observed PK data in patients from Study 1005. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Throughout the clinical development, two bioanalytical methods were developed to quantify, 
simultaneously, PF-07321332 and ritonavir, in human K2EDTA plasma (Report c4679002), and only 
PF-07321332 in urine (Report c4679003). Both methods were developed and validated by York 
Bioanalytical Solution (York, YO26 6QR, UK). 
Generally, the used bioanalytical methods appear to be adequate and comply with acceptance criteria 
of the bioanalytical method validation EMA Guideline. Description and validation reports were provided 
with satisfactory results regarding specificity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, dilution factor linearity, 
matrix effect. Short and long-term stability of the analytes in biological matrix were tested and shown 
to be satisfactory. ISR were provided for each study with satisfactory results (100%). 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental (model-independent) PK methods were used to calculate PK parameters 
(Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, AUCs, CL/F and Vz/) using the NCA approach. 
The Population PK analysis (Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-POC-1246) was performed using a nonlinear 
mixed effects modelling methodology as implemented in the nonlinear mixed effects modelling 
(NONMEM) software system, version 7.5.0, using first-order conditional estimation method with 
interaction (FOCEI) as the estimation method. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 50/170 
 
 
 
Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN) version 5.2.6 was used for prediction corrected visual predictive check 
(pcVPC), and sampling importance resampling (SIR) for generating the model parameter uncertainty. 
R (version 4.0.3) and/or R libraries was/were used for data manipulations, exploratory graphical and 
numerical analyses, model diagnostics, post-processing of NONMEM output, creation of simulation data 
sets, as well as data summary. 
Overall, the standard NCA and the population methodology are acceptable for PK data analyses. 
Statistical analysis  
Generally, standard summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation [SD], and coefficient of 
variation [CV]) have been generated. For comparison, in most cases the 90 % confidence intervals 
(CI) were calculated in case of equivalence testing. In addition, in case significance levels were used, 
the significance level in most trials was 5%. This was considered acceptable. 
Absorption  
Following oral single administration, at the recommended dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 
mg, median Tmax was 3 hours and ranged between 1 to 6 hours, indicating that absorption is rapid. 
For note, the observed geometric mean PF-07321332 (CV%) Cmax and AUCinf were 2.21 μg/mL (33) 
and 23.01 μg*hr/mL (23), respectively.  
Absolute Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of PF-07321332 was not investigated. 
Relative bioavailability / Bioequivalence   
Several oral formulations of PF-07321332 were developed and evaluated during the development 
programme: 
•  An extemporaneously prepared oral suspension used in Studies 1001 and 1015 
•  An uncoated 250 mg immediate release (IR) tablet used for Study 1001 (Part 3) 
•  A 100 mg IR film-coated tablet used for Study 1011 and in a few patients in the Phase 2/3 Study 
1005 
•  A 150 mg IR film-coated tablet used for Study 1005 and other Phase 2/3 studies (Studies 1002 
and 1006) as well as in a Phase 1 study 1014.  
• 
The clinical study supplies for the 150 mg tablets used for the pivotal phase 3 study 1005 were 
manufactured at both the Pfizer Groton (Connecticut, USA) and Freiburg (Germany) using identical 
formulation and manufacturing process. 
The proposed commercial formulation dosage form for PF-07321332 is two 150 mg IR film-coated 
tablets and one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir.  
Comparison of uncoated tablet 250 mg versus suspension 250 mg 
The relative bioavailability of PF-07321332 formulated as the 250 mg tablet vs 250 mg oral suspension 
was evaluated in Study 1001 (Part 3) in 12 healthy volunteers without ritonavir combination, as part 
of an open label, randomised, 3 period, 3 sequence cross-over design (food effect also investigated, 
please refer to the next section) with a wash-out period of 2 days.  
The estimated ratio of geometric means for Cmax was 56.38% (90% CI of the ratio 43.42%-73.19%) 
and for AUClast was 81.21% (90% CI of the ratio 69.21%–95.28%). Cmax and AUClast of uncoated 
tablet was reduced by 44% and 19%, respectively compared to the suspension formulation.

Dissolution profiles of the tablet 100 mg vs 150 mg 
The comparability of PF-07321332 film coated tablets from representative batches of 100 mg and 150 
mg was investigated through dissolution profiles comparison at a clinical dose of 300 mg ( 3X 100 mg 
vs 2 x 150 mg) at three different pH. An f2 test was calculated to assess similarity of dissolution 
profiles between the two tablet formulations, and all values were ≥50 suggesting equivalence in 
dissolution performance of PF-07321332 3x100 mg versus 2x150 mg tablets. 
Dissolution profiles of tablet 150 mg by site Manufacturing  
The dissolution performance of representative batches of PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablets 
manufactured at Groton, CT, US and Freiburg; Germany sites was assessed in dissolution media over 
the physiological pH range. Similarly, to the preceding the estimated f2 were ≥50 suggests that in 
vitro dissolution performances are equivalent. 
Influence of food  
The effect of a high fat meal was investigated at two levels, following the administration of 250 mg PF-
07321332 alone (Study 1001 –Part 3) or in combination with ritonavir (Study 1001 Part 1) in a 
cross-over design.  
Results, indicated that relative to fasted conditions and in combination with ritonavir, administration 
with high-fat meal causes only a slight increase on Cmax (geometric mean ratio of 1.15) and no 
evident effect on exposure AUCs (geometric mean ratios of 1.01 and 1.01, for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf 
respectively). Tmax was delayed by 1.25 h and half-life slightly increased by 1h in the fed state 
compared to fasted state (6.9 vs 6 h).  
Overall, the applicant preconise that commercial tablet formulation could be administered without 
regards to food. The proposed dosing recommendation could be supported.

with ritonavir- Food effect (Part 1 SAD, Study 1001) 
Influence of gastric modifier 
The influence of gastric modifier was not investigated.  
Distribution 
PF-07321332 was found to be weakly bound to plasma protein (69%). B/P ratio was approximately 0.6 
indicating a limited penetration of PF-07321332 into red blood cells.

Following administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir supplied as tablet formulation at 300 mg/100 mg, 
the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) in healthy volunteers was 109.4 L. For note, results 
from the PopPK analysis (based on 20 healthy volunteers using the oral suspension) indicated a total 
apparent distribution volume of 111 L for a 300 mg/100 mg (theoretical dose).  
Elimination 
The excretion and biotransformation of a 300mg/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir oral dose as 
suspension was investigated in 6 healthy subjects using 19F-NMR and HPLC-MS/MS methods.  
By quantitative 19F-NMR, mean ± SD (range) mass recovery was 84.9% ± 8.9% (70.7-95.5%) which 
consisted of PF-07321332 at 80.7± 8% and M8 metabolite at 4.2%± 1.3% (silent due to loss of 
trifluoroacetyl group). The excretion into urine and faeces was 48.6% and 35.3%, respectively, mainly 
as unchanged PF-07321332. Most material excreted in urine emerged in the first 24 h while in faeces 
in 5 days. 
PF-07321332 was found to be predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes. Metabolite profiling was 
performed in the three matrices (plasma, urine and faeces). In plasma unchanged PF-07321332 was 
the main circulated compound, M4 and M5 were found at trace levels. In urine and faeces after 
normalisation of the data to complete mass balance, unchanged PF-07321332 accounted for 82.5% of 
the drug material (55% in urine and 27.5% in faeces). M5 was present at 12.1% in faeces, M8 at 
4.2% in plasma. The proposed metabolic scheme is presented in the following figure.

Across clinical studies in healthy volunteers after single or multiple oral doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir 
as oral suspension half-life ranged from 6.8 to 9.5 h. After single oral dose PF-07321332/ritonavir as 
tablet formulation half-life ranged from 6.05 to 7.72 h. At the recommended 300/100 mg PF-
07321332/ ritonavir dose in the fasted state, the arithmetic mean (+SD) terminal elimination half-life 
of PF-07321332, following single dose was 6.1 (1.8) hours.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality of PF-07321332 (with or without ritonavir) was investigated following single and 
multiple escalating oral dose in healthy volunteers during Study 1001. 
Part 1 (SAD) of Study 1001  
The interval of investigated doses ranged from 150 to 1500 mg for PF-07321332 (without ritonavir) 
and PF-07321332/ritonavir at two dose levels 250 and 750 mg. PK parameters following SAD of PF-
07321332 (with or without ritonavir) as oral suspension are presented in Table 3 and associated

Overall, based on phase 1 dose-escalation data (Study 1001) in healthy volunteers, the systemic 
exposures (Cmax, AUCs) of PF-07321332 boosted by 100 mg of ritonavir appeared to exhibit less than

Population PK modelling 
A preliminary population PK model of PF-07321332 was developed using plasma concentration data 
collected in healthy adult data from Study C4671001 (data cutoff date 30 June 2021). The analysis PK 
dataset included 536 evaluable plasma concentrations from 20 subjects who received 250 and 750 mg 
single dose and 75, 250 and 500 BID administration of PF-07321332 (suspension formulation) in 
combination with 100 mg ritonavir (RTV). Modelling used NONMEM, version 7.5. The first-order 
conditional estimation method with interaction was used during model development.  
The final model was a linear 2-compartment model with first-order absorption, a dose-dependent 
absorption implemented by separate power functions for ka and relative bioavailability (F1) and a 
linear elimination. Standard allometric scaling of body weight with exponents fixed to 0.75 and 1 was 
applied on clearance (CL/F) and volumes of distribution, respectively. Residual random effects were 
described with a combined proportional and additive model in the log domain. IIV were included on all 
parameters, with a full variance and covariance of the Ω matrix. IOV was included to ka.  
Parameter estimates for the final model are presented below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 59/170 
 
 
 
 
Table 5. Parameter estimates for the final population PK model based on preliminary data 
from Study C4671001 
In general, structural parameters were precisely estimated (low %RSE <20%), except for F1 at 1 mg 
dose (%RSE = 30.5%). However, proportional error, variance and covariance of the Ω block were 
poorly estimated (%RSE >30%). This is specifically problematic for the proportional residual error 
estimated to be low 3.36% but with an RSE% of 111%. These high %RSE and the high condition 
number (>1000) suggested that the final model is over-parameterised, which is expected given the 
inclusion of a full variance-covariance block for IIV and the available limited data. Sampling importance 
resampling were performed and overall were in line the model parameters estimates. All η and ε 
shrinkage were <20% except for IOV in ka. No major deficiencies were noted GOF plots. The pcVPCs 
indicated that the final model described the data reasonably well; even clear under-prediction of the 
low 5th quantile at 250 mg dose with RTV fed and fasted regimens (Please refer to the respective 
figures) and tendency to over-predict the terminal elimination phase are noted. 
The additive error was estimated at 339 ng/L (more than 33 times the LLOQ of 10 ng/mL and even 
larger than the target IC90% value of 292 ng/mL). Such finding, with the poor precision of the 
proportional error portion compromise the validity of the model. To handle this point during 
simulations, the large residual errors was excluded. This approach is not endorsed as it would imply 
estimation of PK parameters and associated variabilities necessary different from that in the final 
model and used for simulation. Therefore, model-based PK predictions should be considered with 
caution.  
The parameter estimates after adjustment by F1 at a dose of 300 mg are CL 8.2 L/h, volume of 
distribution 111 L, and ka 1.1 h-1. This gives a population mean half-live T1/2 of 15 hours, which is 
not consistent with that obtained from NCA calculations (mean T1/2 =7 hours). No clear estimate of 
the bioavailability 300 mg dose is provided / could be found. Importantly, given the observed 44% 
lower Cmax in tablets compared to the suspension formulation (relative bioavailability part in study

1001), the adequacy of using the current model (based only on tablet formulation data) to simulate PK 
data for the tablet formulation is not deemed adequate. 
The covariate (age, body weight, BMI, ethnicity, renal and hepatic impairment) effects could not be 
considered adequately explored given the very limited data and the demographic characteristics of 
subjects included in the dataset (ranges of age, BW and renal clearance were [21-56y], [58-99 kg] 
and [70 -141 ml/min], respectively and no information on BMI, ethnicity and hepatic impairment could 
be found). For note, a high-fat meal reduced ka by approximately 50%. However, considering its 
minimal impact on Cmin, and the inclusion of IIV and IOV on ka, the applicant did not retain the food 
effect in the final model for subsequent simulation. 
Using the final Pop-PK model and doses from 100 to 500 mg/100mg RTV BID for 5 days, the predicted 
PK exposures (Table 6) showed that, for a typical 70 kg subject, a dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 
300/100 mg BID would result in median Day 1 and steady state Ctrough (=C12h) concentrations ~3-4 
x IC90 and ~6 x IC90, respectively. With this dose, it is projected to have >90% of subjects would 
achieve Ctrough ≥IC90 even after the first dose and with IIV in CL inflated to 60%.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Preliminary PK data were collected from the ongoing pivotal efficacy and safety Phase 2/3 study 
(C4671005) in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were at increased risk 
of progressing to severe illness. Patients received PF-07321332/ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 
days (10 doses total). Sparse PK sampling was collected on Day 1 (0.5 to 1.5 hr post dose), on Day 5 
(up to 2 hours pre-dose) and optionally on Days 2, 3, or 4. At cutoff date (28 October 2021), a total of 
1298 plasma PF-07321332 concentrations, including 1068 evaluable samples and 230 (17.7%) BLQ 
samples from 601 patients were available for analysis. There were 46 participants who did not have 
any evaluable samples (all observations were BLQs). 
The observed plasma PF-07321332 concentrations in patients are shown in Figure 8.

Participants with COVID-19 on PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg q12h in Study 
C4671005 Stratified by Day 
PK data at Day 5 (Table 7) indicated that 140 out of 173 (>80%) patients achieved a Cmin≥ IC90. 
When excluding the BLQ samples during Day 5 visit, 140 out of 153 (>90%) patients achieved the 
target Cmin. Overall, the observed concentrations from patients appears to be consistent with those 
(dose-normalised to 300 mg) in the healthy participants. However, it is worth noting that a high 
number of BLQ (17.7% of the dataset) was observed after and beyond the first dose. Such finding 
requires further investigation. Of these BLQ, 95 samples (41.3%) were collected at Day 1, while no 
BLQ samples at or beyond 30 min post-dose was observed in healthy volunteers after of PF-
07321332/ritonavir dosing.

A predictive check (simulation) approach was performed to assess the adequacy of the preliminary 
Pop-PK model in describing the patient data from Study 1005 (PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg 
BID). 
Overall, a fair agreement was observed. The majority of the PF-07321332 concentrations in COVID-19 
patients fall within the 90% prediction interval generated from simulation. The median observed data

at Day 1 (Figure 9) and at steady state (Figure 10) appears to be consistent with the model

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
A formal study (C4671011) investigated the effect of mild, moderate and severe impairment on the 
PK of PF-07321332. Subjects were administered a single oral 100 mg dose of PF-07321332 in 
combination with the PK enhancer ritonavir administered as a 100 mg dose at -12, 0, 12, and 24 hours 
relative to PF-07321332 dosing. The number of subjects per category of renal impairment was n=8 
versus 10 subjects for the normal healthy controls. The estimated eGFR calculated using CKD-EPI 
equation was used a measure of renal function. 
PK data indicated that PF-07321332 systemic exposure increased with increasing severity of renal 
impairment, specifically in the moderate and severe impaired subjects Figure 11,  
Table 8). The geometric mean (90% CI) ratios for Cmax and AUCinf relative to subjects with normal 
renal function were:  
•  For the mild impaired group: 129.78% (101.93%, 165.25%) and 123.84 % (99.64%, 
153.91%), respectively  
•  For the moderate impaired group: 138.12% (113.18%, 168.55%) and 187.40% (148.52%, 
236.46%), respectively  
•  For the severe impaired group: 148.02% (111.40%, 196.68%) and 304.49 % (237.60%, 
390.21%), respectively  
Consistent with the increase on PF-07321332 systemic exposures, the apparent CL/F and CLr 
decreased with increased renal impairment severity. Mean CL/F in the moderate and severe group

decreased 47% and 67% and mean renal clearance decreased 47% and 80% respectively compared to 
the normal renal functional group.

Hepatic impairment 
A formal study (C4671010) investigated the effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the PK of PF-
07321332, in comparison to matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects were 
administered a single oral 100 mg dose of PF-07321332 in combination with the PK enhancer ritonavir 
administered as a 100 mg dose at -12, 0, 12, and 24 hours relative to PF-07321332 dosing. The 
number of subjects was n=8 in each cohort. Categorisation of participants into normal hepatic function 
or hepatic impairment group was based on Child-Pugh scores. 
The study is still ongoing and only a preliminary PK report (22 November 2021) is provided.  
Preliminary median PK profiles and PK data by hepatic function are shown in Figure 12 and 
summarised in Table 9. Overall, data suggest that PK exposure following single dose administration of 
PF-07321332 enhanced with ritonavir in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (AUCinf = 15.07 
μg*h/mL and Cmax 1.92 μg/mL) were comparable to those in participants with normal hepatic function 
AUCinf = 15.28 μg*h/mL and Cmax = 1.89 μg/mL).

No formal dedicated PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of gender on the PKs of 
PF-07321332.  
Among the 20 subjects included in the dataset for PF-07321332, both sexes were represented with 
less female (n= 4; 20 %) than male (n = 16; 80 %). Sex was not identified as a significant covariate 
on the PK parameters of PF-07321332. However, such conclusion should be sought cautiously as the 
validity of the population-PK analysis is still to be proven.  
Race / Ethnicity 
No formal dedicated PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of gender on the PKs of 
PF-07321332.  
Race effect on PF-07321332/ritonavir PK has been explored as part of Study 1001 in only 4 Japanese 
healthy volunteers. AUCtau and Cmax values were approximately 30% and 21-26%, respectively, 
lower in Japanese participants compared to Caucasian subjects. Drug accumulation was similar in 
Japanese compared to Caucasian subjects (~2). 
Body weight 
No formal dedicated PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of body weight on the 
PKs of PF-07321332.  
The Population model included an allometric relationship of baseline body weight on apparent 
clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) with exponents fixed to 0.75 and 1, 
respectively. However, the impact of this covariate on the systemic exposure of PF-07321332 was not 
clearly shown / explored (no results could be found). 
Elderly 
Preliminary PK data provided in patients (study C4671005) indicates an age between 18 and 86 years. 
However, the number of elderly patients included in the following subgroups of age: [65 to 74 years], 
[75 to 84 years] and >85 years is not detailed.  
No subject older than 65 years was included in Population dataset. 
Children and adolescents 
No PK data are available. The safety and efficacy of PF-07321332/ritonavir in children and adolescents 
below the age of 18 years have not yet been established.  
The applicant claimed an indication covering the adolescents aged 12 years of age and above and 
weighing > 40 kg with the same dosing regimen as adults, 300/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir BID. 
According to the applicant, the proposed dose is justified based on Population PK simulations. 
The preliminary Population PK model was used to simulate exposures in adolescent patients >40 kg. 
These model-based simulations suggest that a PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg BID dose in 
adolescents (i.e., ≥12 to < 18 years of age) provides reasonably comparable exposures in adults 
receiving the same dose and maintained PF-07321332 plasma concentration above EC90 over the 
entire dosing interval suggestive of pharmacodynamic activity of PF-07321332/ritonavir and thus the 
therapeutic response. 
The distribution of simulated Cmin on Day 5 by dose of either PF-07321332/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg 
BID or 300 mg/100 mg BID regimen in adolescent subjects are depicted in Figure 13. The distribution 
of simulated Cmin on Day 5 based on adults from the Study 1005 is provided for reference. Summary 
statistics for simulations results for all exposure parameters are presented in Table 10.

Table 10. Statistical Summary (Geometric Mean and Percentiles) of the Output of the 
Modelling and Simulation Evaluation 
Based on these simulations, a considerable overlap in Cmin values of PF-07321332 between the PF-
07321332/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg BID and PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg BID 
administrations in adolescents as compared to reference Cmin values in adults (300 mg/100 mg BID). 
As that could be expected, a dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg BID in adolescents 
achieved a larger distribution of subjects above the in vitro EC90 of 292 ng/mL as compared to those 
receiving the 150 mg/100 mg BID regimen, but detailed difference and statistical comparison was not 
provided.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Paxlovid interaction profile, as a co-packed combination of PF-0713321332, and ritonavir, has been 
investigated mainly by assessing PF-0713321332 interaction potency in studies 102559 (CYP inducer 
via AhR, CAR and PXR), 103243 (UGT and CYP inhibitors), 113907 and 12202 (CYP inhibitions), 
020944 (transporter inhibition), 124535 and 095737 (substrate of efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP),

and studies -013448, -110227, -114514, -124557 and - 013448 (hepatobiliary/renal uptake 
transporters). Interaction studies was also studied as part of clinical trials in studies -1014 and 1015, 
to characterise the effects of carbamazepine on the single dose PK of PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 
100 mg in healthy participants and to estimate the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole on the PK of 
PF-07321332 following multiple doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir respectively. 
Paxlovid as perpetrator 
The Appraisal of PF-07321332 interaction profile was based on in vitro studies. Its induction potential, 
inhibition of UGTs, inhibition of CYPs isoforms, as well as inhibition of transporters were performed in 
line with EMA drug-drug interaction guideline (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1).  
PF-07321332 was found to be an inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. It was identified as 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 with estimated KI of 15.5 µM and 13.9 µM, and estimated Kinact 
to 0.0142 min-1, and 0.0165 min-1, using respectively midazolam and testosterone as substrate. PF-
07321332 was also an inhibitor of P-gp (IC50 70.6 µM), OATP1B1 (IC50 44.4 µM), and OCT1 (IC50 
138.1 µM). Based on in vitro results, PF-07321332 may in vivo inhibit OCT1. For renal transporters, 
MATE1 Rr=0.023, slightly above the cut-off criteria (Rr≥0.002). However, since metformin is also 
substrate of OCT1, significant interactions with metformin could not be excluded. With respect to 
OATP1B1 inhibition potential, PF-07321332 shows an Rh of 0.110, which is above the EMA cut-off 
criteria of 0.04. Given the large drug-drug interaction spectrum of Paxlovid, clinical interaction study to 
assess the magnitude of interaction with these transporters or thorough justification of the lack of such 
investigation based on scientific evidence and rationale should continue. 
Ritonavir (RTV) interaction profile was based on Norvir SmPC. RTV is an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, as well as inducer of UGTs. Ritonavir has also shown to be a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, and a P-gp inhibitor.  
Overall, based on in vitro studies, Paxlovid, as co-packed combination of PF-07321332 with ritonavir, is 
considered inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1. It induces UGTs, CYP3A4, 
CY2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19.  
There is a possibility of additive effect in the induction of CYP enzymes. However, taking in 
consideration the low dose of ritonavir used for a short duration and its predicted induction of less than 
30%, it can be agreed that this magnitude of induction unlikely to necessitate dose adjustments and 
that it is appropriate to give guidance within the Paxlovid label based on Norvir (ritonavir) label which 
already states the risk of induction that was observed for higher doses.  
Paxlovid net effect on CYP3A4 and P-gp substrates in vivo is not yet established given Paxlovid is 
substrate, inhibitor, and inducer of CYP3A4, and also substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. This is currently 
being assessed in the following on-going studies, DDI study 1013 with midazolam, and DDI study 1012 
with dabigatran. Preliminary PK data from the midazolam DDI study was provided. The study consists 
of 3 treatments: single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg (Treatment A); PF-07321332/ ritonavir 300/100 
mg q12h (total 9 doses) + single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg on the Day 5 morning (Treatment B); 
ritonavir 100 mg q12h (total 9 doses) + single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg on the Day 5 morning 
(Treatment C). The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for midazolam 
AUCinf and Cmax were 1430.02 % (1204.54%, 1697.71%) and 368.33% (318.91%, 425.41%), 
respectively, when midazolam was co-administered with PF-07321332/ritonavir (Test) compared of 
midazolam administered alone (Reference). Midazolam CL/F was decreased by 93% and t½ was 
increased by 2-fold, when midazolam was co-administered with PF-07321332/ritonavir compared of 
midazolam administered alone. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) 
for midazolam AUCinf and Cmax were 1645.15 % (1385.75%, 1953.11%) and 387.20% (335.25%, 
447.21%), respectively, when midazolam was co-administered with ritonavir (Test) compared of 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 69/170 
 
 
 
midazolam administered alone (Reference). Midazolam CL/F was decreased by 94% and t½ was 
increased by 2.3-fold, when midazolam was co-administered with ritonavir compared of midazolam 
administered alone. Midazolam systemic exposure increased several-fold when co-administered with 
the strong CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir. However, coadministration of midazolam with PF-
07321332/ritonavir did not result in any further increase in midazolam exposure compared to ritonavir 
alone. This information was included in the SmPC.  
As a precautionary measure, other potential victim drugs were added in 4.3 and 4.5 sections of 
Paxlovid SmPC.   
Concomitant therapy with ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen, it is indicated that no dose 
adjustment is needed and that Patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are receiving ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen should 
continue their treatment as indicated. Although it is acceptable to conclude that it may be essential to 
administer ritonavir together with PF-07321332 to get the PK enhancement of PF-07321332, doses of 
ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice-a-day may increase incidence of adverse reactions. The benefit of 
Paxlovid in HIV and HCV patients who are receiving a PK booster, and subsequently are also infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 and need Paxlovid, is considered outweighing the risk of adverse events associated 
with an additional booster dose of ritonavir or cobicistat. Staggering of dose or skipping the ritonavir 
administration if PF-07321332 administered at the same time as other ritonavir-regimen would be 
confusing to patients and prone to error because some HIV treatments are QD and other BID. 
Therefore, keeping the PK booster together with associated protease inhibitor as indicated is 
considered acceptable. 
It is noteworthy that given the high-risk targeted population (including notably old patients, patients 
with cardiovascular disease), additional DDI studies with amiodarone and clozapine notably as victim 
drugs should have been performed by the applicant, since critical in this population. These studies 
could allow these patients, for whom treatment cessation could not be clinically easily handled, to 
benefit from Paxlovid treatments.  
Paxlovid as victim 
Administered with ritonavir, PF-07321332 is mainly excreted unchanged. Notably, 55.0% and 27.5% 
of the dose is excreted as parent compound in urine and faeces, respectively. Regarding the fraction of 
PF-07321332 metabolised, CYP3A4 was identified as the major contributor (fm = 0.99) of the oxidative 
metabolism, based on in vitro studies.  
PF-07321332-transporter interaction profile was studied based on in vitro inhibition studies. PF-
07321332 was found to be a substrate of the human MDR1 P-gp.  
In vivo PF-07321332 interaction profile was assessed in clinical studies with a potent inhibitor and an 
inducer of CYP3A4 enzyme. After co-administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir (300/100 mg SD) and 
carbamazepine (dose escalation design: 100mg BID from day 1 to 3, 200mg BID from day 4 to 7, 300 
mg BID from day 8 to 15), the AUC0-∞ and Cmax of PF-07321332 were decreased by 55% and 43%, 
respectively, as compared to administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir alone.  
Based on in vivo results, the SmPC specified a contraindication for the coadministration of Paxlovid 
with potent CYP3A inducers regarding the significant clinical impacts on both PF-07321332 and 
ritonavir PK. 
After co-administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir (5 oral doses 300/100 mg q12h) and itraconazole 
(200 mg orally q24h for 8 days), the AUCtau and Cmax of PF-07321332 were increased by 38% and 
19%, respectively, as compared to administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir alone. PF-07321332 
exposure increases observed in the itraconazole study are not expected to be clinically relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 70/170 
 
 
 
Therefore, no dosing adjustment of PF-07321332/ritonavir is necessary when a CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-
administrated with Paxlovid. 
Overall, the applicant has proposed to integrate the long list of DDI related to ritonavir, including 
contraindications. The CHMP has considered that this conservative measure should indeed apply at this 
stage. However, the CHMP has judged necessary to explain the reasoning in a dedicated introductory 
statement to the physicians before the table of DDI in the SmPC “As a conservative measure, the 
drug-drug interactions pertaining to ritonavir used in chronic HIV infection (600 mg BID when originally 
used as an antiretroviral agent and 100 mg BID as currently used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with 
antiretroviral agents), should apply for Paxlovid. Future investigations may enable to adjust the 
recommendations related to drug-drug interactions to the 5 days treatment duration of Paxlovid” 
The CHMP is committed to revisit for adjustment the ritonavir driven DDI in relation to the use of 
Paxlovid as soon as the requested data in pharmacokinetics would be available (including PopPK), to 
better guide healthcare professionals especially in the outpatients setting less familiar with those 
ritonavir driven DDI than HIV specialists at hospital. The CHMP has alerted healthcare professionals 
organisations on the complexity of the interaction profile of this treatment.  
The applicant is expected to particularly review the contraindication with drugs expected to be used in 
the targeted population at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 including drugs for which 
treatment cessation cannot be foreseen even for a short period, such as amiodarone, clozapine.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the coronavirus type 3C protease (3CLpro), including the 
SARS-CoV-2, 3CL protease. Inhibition of the 3CL protease renders the protein incapable of processing 
polyprotein precursors, leading to inhibition of viral replication. 
From the co-crystal structure of PF-07321332 bound to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, 6 contact residues 
(Cys145, Gly143, Glu166, His163, Phe140, His164) were identified in the active site of 3CLpro to form 
either covalent or hydrogen bonds between 3CLpro and PF-07321332. Examination of residues within 4 
Å from PF-07321332 binding sites identified 7 additional potentially critical residues. The conservation 
of these contact residues was assessed by aligning SARS-CoV-2 genomes with complete and high 
coverage sequences (N = 3,163,857; GISAID; last accessed 11-08-2021). The 13 residues explored 
(presented in Table 11) were highly conserved, with frequency of mutation <0.024%.

Table 11. Mutations at Key PF-07321332 Contact Residues on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro 
PF-07321332 has also demonstrated selectivity for coronavirus 3CLpro, showing little or no activity 
against a panel of human proteases, as well as HIV protease. IC50 against human chymotrypsin was 
>10 μM and against all other tested proteases was >100 μM. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Antiviral activity 
PF-07321332 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection of dNHBE cells, a primary 
human lung alveolar epithelial cell line (EC50 value of 61.8 nM and EC90 value of 181 nM) after 3 days 
of drug exposure (Table 12).  
It is considered as a pancoronavirus antiviral against other alpha and betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, 
HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63). But the clinical relevance 
uncertain since only based on in vitro data with no clinical data available except against SARS-Cov-2. 
PF-07321332 activity is selective to the coronavirus family and PF-07321332 did not inhibit enterovirus 
71 (EV71) or human rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B) viral-induced CPE, (EC50 >100 μM), nor did it 
demonstrate cytotoxicity in noninfected rhabdomyosarcoma cells or Hela cells (CC50 of >100 μM). 
The in vitro antiviral activity was demonstrated in VeroE6 ACE-2 cells with an EC50 of 0.0745 μM in the 
presence of P-gp inhibitor to better represent physiological cells, A549-ACE2 cells with EC50/EC90 
values of 0.0779 μM / 0.215 μM, and physiologically relevant dNHBE (differentiated normal human 
bronchial epithelial) cells with EC50 of 0.0618 μM and 0.0326 μM, at Day 3 and Day 5 post-infection 
respectively. The metabolite, PF-07329268 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 CPE in VeroE6 ACE-2 cells with an 
EC50 value of 0.690 μM, in the presence of P-gp inhibitor. The antiviral activity of PF-07321332 was 
specific and not due to cellular toxicity (no cytotoxicity was observed up to >100 μM in VeroE6 ACE-2 
cells) resulting in a TI of >21.5 in the absence of P-gp inhibitor.

Systemic exposure of PF-07321332 in humans is likely limited by CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. As 
such, ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with PF-07321332 in clinical trials in order 
to boost exposure. Ritonavir exhibited no inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in A549-ACE2 cells 
up to 3 μM. No host cell cytotoxicity was observed for PF-07321332 or ritonavir up to 3 μM in non-
infected A549-ACE2 cells.  
Efficacy in major SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) 
The antiviral activity of PF-07321332 against SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1351 (Beta), P.1 
(Gamma) and B.1.1.1.37 (Lambda, λ) and  B.1.621 (Mu, μ) was demonstrated using a cytopathic 
effect protection assay in Vero E6 P-gp Knockout cells, with reported EC50 values of  75.3 nM, 171 nM, 
87.7 nM, 59.5nM and 65.1 nM respectively, compared with 96.3 nM for WA1 (USA-WA1/2020). Due to 
the inability of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant to exhibit CPE in the Vero E6 P-gp knockout cell line, the 
variants were also evaluated in Vero E6 TMPRSS2 with P-gp inhibitor. Mean EC50 values were 92.8 nM, 
170 nM, 217 nM, 204 nM, 93 nM, and 82.2 nM and 138 nM in the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain 
and alpha, beta, gamma, lamda, and delta and Mu variants, respectively (remdesivir assay control 
EC50 range: 79.8 – 169 nM). Vero E6-TMPRSS2 is a relevant model for SARS-CoV-2 and close to 
“physiological” conditions. SARS-CoV-2 target cells are respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and 
TMPRSS2 (with absence of PGP efflux system).  
The impact of PF-07321332 on viral loads was also measured using a qPCR-based method, showing 
inhibition of the VeroE6 Pgp knockout cells with mean EC50 values of 32.2 nM, 41.0 nM, 127.2 nM, 
24.9 nM, 21.2 nM, 15.9 nM and 25.7 nM in the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain and the alpha, beta, 
gamma, delta, lambda and Mu variants, respectively (remdesivir EC50 1.9 - 14.8 nM). The activity in 
vitro on beta variant was of lesser extent. 
The Delta variant represented the most prevalent VOC circulating notably in Europe when the phase 
2/3 clinical study C4671005 was performed. Therefore, the population has quasi exclusively consisted 
in patients infected by this VOC (98%, in vast majority 21J sublineage). Four isolates that are 
representative of the sub lineages of Delta (21A, 21I and 21) were tested and demonstrated 
susceptibility to PF-07321332 across the different clades. The Delta variants tested all had Mpro 
sequences that were identical to the reference strain. From a large genomic surveillance of ~2.2 
million Delta isolates in GISAID, ~92% are identical to reference strain Mpro sequence. There are a 
small percentage of Delta subvariants that contain mutations at K88R, K90R, V73I and A260V (Table 
below). Three mutations (K88R, K90R, A260V) have been tested with no significant drop in potency by 
biochemical assay. The applicant plans to also test the V731I change and has been requested by the 
CHMP to shortly test activity of emerging VOC.

Table 13. Mutation and Global Frequency Analysis for Delta Variant from GISAID (B.1.617.2 
and AY.X; n=2,218,609) 
All patients with treatment failure TF (7 events) from study C4671005, were infected by a 21J isolate 
compared to 37 events of TF in the placebo participants (27 infected with 21J-Delta). The applicant 
clarified that Mpro retrieved from consensus genome sequence for these 7 events are all identical to 
reference sequence. The allele frequency of minor variants found are less than 5.05%, with a median 
value of 2.04%. There is therefore a low probability that these breakthrough cases are due to a lack of 
effectiveness against Delta clades 21J. The applicant is planning on isolating the viruses from the 
breakthrough cases and testing them in an antiviral assay against PF-07321332 for confirmatory 
purposes. The applicant was requested to substantiate the resistance data through the analysis of 
treatment failure in all applicant’s clinical studies, since at this stage the resistance pattern of Paxlovid 
remains to be determined. Even in vitro, only the model of MHV-3CL was used and not the relevant 
SARS-CoV-2. 
Upon CHMP request to obtain data on the predominant circulating Omicron VOC, the applicant provided 
dedicated results: PF-07321332 showed antiviral activity against the Omicron variant with EC50 values 
of 70 nM and 23 nM in the HeLa-ACE2 and Vero-TMPRSS cells compared to the SARS-CoV-2 USA-
WA1/2020 strain which had EC50 values of 207 nM and 38 nM in the same cell lines, respectively 
(Table 14). No PGP inhibitor was used in Vero-TMPRSS cells contrary to other variants tested in this 
cell line. Out of 166 omicron isolates retrieved from GISAID, two mutations have been found in the 
3CLpro. The P132H mutation has been found in all omicron isolates thus far and A70S has been found 
in one omicron isolate, both are located greater than 18 angstroms from the inhibitor. In a biochemical 
assay with recombinant Mpro expressing P132H, the activity was not reduced compared to the 
USAWA1/2020 Mpro (ki=0.635 Ki fold change <1).

Viral resistance 
PF-07321332 was only evaluated in resistance selection assay against murine hepatitis virus (MHV) 
infected L929 cells (10 passages). This led to the emergence of P55L and S144A mutations in 3CLpro 
as well as two lower frequency mutations (Thr129Met, Thr50Lys) in 3CLpro gene (frequency 
<4.6%).The presence of the substitutions P55L and S144A, was associated with a decrease in PF-
07321332 susceptibility with 4.4 to 5-fold increase in mean EC50 values (ranging from 2.65-2.93 μM 
compared to 0.6 μM for parent MHV in murine L929 cells), Table 15. These preliminary results 
indicate a possible likelihood of resistance development to PF-07321332, however the clinical relevance 
of these results remains unclear. S144A reduced PF-07321332 susceptibility by 90-fold (based on Ki 
value) in a biochemical assay.  
The applicant confirmed that In vitro selection of PF-07321332 resistant SARS-CoV-2 is being 
evaluated to further substantiate the genetic barrier, which appears limited at this stage. Mutants that 
can replicate at each passage should be monitored for reduction viral fitness or decrease in 
susceptibility to the treatment.

Potency against mutated SARS-COV-2 3CL protease enzymes 
The potency of PF-07321332 to inhibits the proteolytic activity of mutant SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease 
was evaluated using a biochemical assay.  
The tested mutants were: 
a)  The low frequency mutations at key contact residues on SARS-CoV- 2 3CL-Protease. 
Those with drop in potency are six: E166A (33-fold change), F140A (39-fold change), 
H164N (6.4-fold change), H172Y (233-fold change), Q189K (65.4- fold change), and 
Y54A (23.6-fold change).  
b)  Emerging naturally occurring mutations found in the population; those with drop in 
potency were A234V, D248E, P108S, T135I, T45I, G15S and the Ki change is less than 
5-fold. 
c)  Mutations emerging from the resistance experiment using MHV surrogate for SARS-CoV-
2. Those with drop in potency are S144A and the double mutation S144A and E55L. 
The table below summarises results for the 14 mutants that showed a statistically significant drop in 
potency, with GeoMean Ki values of 1.84 - 217 nM and with a fold change to wild type potency SARS-
CoV-2 3CLpro ranging from 2.0 to 233-fold change.  
Table 16. Potency of PF-073211332 Against 3CL-Protease Mutations with Significance (P-
Value) Compared to Wild Type 
To evaluate the impact of the above-mentioned mutations i.e G15S, S144A, H164N, E166A, H172Y, 
Q189K on virus replication fitness as well as on PF-07321332 activity, each mutation was engineered 
into recombinant SARS-CoV-2. L89F and K90R, were introduced into recombinant viruses as controls, 
as they had no significant impact on 3CLpro inhibition of PF-07321332 in the enzymatic assay. 
Generation of recombinant viruses containing Y54A or F140A was not successful, consistent with the 
possible lethality of these mutations to virus replication. 
Of the recombinant mutant viruses tested, Q189K showed reduced virus RNA replication (4-fold than 
those of the wildtype at 72 hours post-infection), while K90R had increased levels (4-fold than those of 
the wildtype at 48 and 96 hours post-infection). Recombinants containing L89F, S144A or E166A had 
similar replicated virus RNA levels to those of the wildtype virus (Table 17). Testing is ongoing to 
evaluate replication fitness of other mutant viruses.

Virological data from study C4671005  
Viral titres measured via RT-PCR in nasal swabs over time 
Participants with samples collected using unvalidated (local) swabs or collected at non-NP sites were 
excluded from this POC assessment, as were participants with no virus detected at baseline (0 
copies/mL). Viral load below the detection limit of 100 copies/mL was imputed as approximately 50 
copies/mL, ie, using 1.69 Log10 (copies/mL) for Log10 (viral load) values below 2 Log10 (copies/mL). 
Results in the mITT analysis set were also examined by serology status and baseline viral load (Table 
18). As expected, the additional viral load reduction from PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment relative to 
placebo were more apparent in participants who were seronegative than participants who were 
seropositive (-1.230 versus -0.473 log10 copies/mL, p=0.0022), and more apparent in participants 
with higher versus lower ((≥4 log10 copies/mL versus < 4 log10 copies/mL) viral load at baseline -
1.020 versus -0.475 log10 copies/mL, p=0.0109). Compared to results in the overall mITT population, 
similar findings were observed when viral load over time was analysed by serology status and by 
baseline viral load. Viral load results at Day 1 and Day 5 (and over time) for the mITT1 and mITT2 
analysis set were consistent with the mITT analyses (Table 19). 
Results should be interpreted with particular caution in terms of magnitude given the descriptive 
analysis. 
Viral load results over time for the mITT2 analysis set were consistent with the mITT analyses.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Several oral formulations of PF-07321332 were developed and evaluated during the development 
programme (oral suspension, uncoated tablet at 250 mg, film coated tablet of 100 mg and 150 mg). 
Presently only one relative bioavailability study was performed comparing performance of the oral 
suspension to the uncoated tablet at 250 mg and based on the results from Study 1001 Part 3, the 
biocomparison between these two formulations clearly indicated that they were different with a 44% 
decrease on Cmax and 19% decrease on AUClast. However, such results should be interpreted with 
caution since ritonavir boosted formulations were not compared (for example 250mg/100 mg oral 
suspension vs 250 mg/100 mg uncoated tablet). 
Between uncoated tablet dosed at 250 mg and film coated tablet dosed at 100 (or 150 mg), minor 
changes are observed in terms of drug loading and presence/absence of coated ingredients. Only 
dissolution tests were performed 1) between the film-coated tablets dosed at 100 mg and 150 mg, and 
2) between site manufacturing of the 150 mg film-coated tablet with for both satisfactory results based 
on f2. Therefore, at least, an in vitro dissolution test comparing the 250 mg uncoated tablet with the 
film coated tablets should be performed (REC). 
The applicant proposed to test the formulation effect as a covariate in the future PopPK model 
development, this is acceptable provided the PK dataset will include all the formulations used during 
the clinical development programme (oral suspension, 250 mg uncoated tablet, 100 mg and 150 mg 
film-coated tablets and 150 mg film-coated tablet by manufacturing process). This analysis should be 
provided as part of the updated PK Pop model.

Following administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir supplied as tablet formulation at 300 mg/100 mg, 
the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) in healthy volunteers was 109.4 L. However, in 
patients the Vz/F was not explored / provided.  
Overall, in healthy participants in the fasted state, the arithmetic mean (+SD) terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of PF-07321332, following single dose of 300/100 mg PF-07321332/ ritonavir, was 6.1 
(1.8) hours. However, no information regarding t1/2 of PF-07321332 in patients could be found. This 
should be further investigated / confirmed in patients.  
Population PK modelling  
A preliminary population PK modelling report (PMAR-EQDD-C467a-Proof of Concept-1246) based only 
on n= 20 healthy adult and the suspension formulation data (study C4671001, cutoff date 30 June 
2021) was provided. 
In summary, the preliminary Population PK model and model-based simulations (PMAR-EQDD-C467a-
Proof of Concept-1246) was not considered valid / reliable. Several issues are raised: 
a)  The residual error model appears to be mis-specified. In one hand, the additive term, 
estimated to 339 ng/L, is considered too high (30-fold) compared to lower limit of 
quantification (10 ng/mL). In the other hand, the proportional error (even low =3.36%) was 
estimated with very poor precision (RSE% =111%). This questions the validity of the model. 
b)  To minimise the large additive error (higher than the target IC90% value of 292 ng/mL), the 
residual errors was excluded in the simulations. This approach is not endorsed as it would 
imply estimation of PK parameters and associated variabilities necessary different from that in 
the final model. Therefore, model-based PK predictions should be considered with caution (as 
issued from a model whose adequacy to the observed data has not been demonstrated).  
c)  Large discrepancy (more than 2-fold) for the estimation of the terminal half-live T1/2 between 
the population approach (15h) and the NCA calculations (7h) was observed. This should be 
justified and its impact on model-based predictions should be further discussed. 
d)  The model-based PK predictions projected with the tablet formulation are not deemed reliable. 
In one hand, the Pop-PK model was developed using only the suspension formulation and on 
the other hand, Cmax of the tablet formulation appears 44% lower than that of the suspension 
formulation (Please refer to the relative bioavailability part in study 1001).  
Only very limited data in healthy volunteers (n=20) are part of the analysed dataset. The lack of 
PopPK model with all completed data from healthy volunteers and especially more full data from 
patients in pivotal phase 2/3 studies (very sparse data essentially steady state Ctrough are actually 
available) was consider critical caveat by the CHMP; it is deemed to better inform the model. 
Therefore, the applicant should update the model by inclusion of these data. The covariate effects 
(age, body weight, BMI, ethnicity, renal and hepatic impairment, pharmaceutical formulation, disease) 
should be explored as part of the work required to update the model. This is important to formally 
demonstrate the similarity of the PK features of PF-07321332 in patients compared to healthy 
volunteers and to address clear dosing recommendations for the specific subgroups that currently are 
not clearly informed (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, elderly, obese and underweighted 
patients). The update Population PK model should be submitted by 31 March 2022 (LEG). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Preliminary PK data were collected from the ongoing pivotal efficacy and safety Phase 2/3 study 
(C4671005) in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients received PF-
07321332/ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses total). Sparse PK sampling was 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 83/170 
 
 
 
performed: A total of 1298 plasma PF-07321332 concentrations, including 1068 evaluable samples and 
230 (17.7%) BLQ samples from 601 patients were available for analysis.  
The available PK data at day 5 indicated that 140 out of 173 (>80%) patients achieved a Cmin≥ IC90. 
When excluding the BLQ samples, 140 out of 153 (>90%) patients achieved the target Cmin. Even the 
observed concentrations from patients appears to be consistent with those in healthy participants 
(dose-normalised to 300 mg), more rich data in patients are required to allow reliable estimation of the 
PK parameters of PF-07321332 in the target population. In addition, it is worth noting that a high 
number of BLQ (17.7% of the dataset) was observed after and beyond the first dose. Such findings are 
expected to be revisited in the elaboration of the updated popPK model with inclusion of the PK data. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment:  
A formal dedicated PK study (C4671011) was performed to investigate the effect renal impairment on 
the PK of PF-07321332. Participants were graded using the recommended metric creatinine clearance 
CLCR (absolute GFR expressed as mL/min). Overall, the applicant propose that no dose adjustment is 
needed in mild renal impairment. Besides, the dose of PF-07321332 should be reduced by one-half: 
PF-07321332/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg BID. These dosing recommendations in these two subgroups 
are agreed.   
In severe renal impaired subjects, an increase of AUC by 204% was observed compared to the normal 
renal group. In addition, no appropriate dosing recommendations in this subgroup are currently 
proposed. Thus, based on the significant 3-fold increase on the systemic exposure of PF-07321332 in 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min), including ERSD (end-stage renal disease) 
haemodialysis patients, it is recommended, from a PK perspective, to not use the drug product in this 
subgroup of patients. This is reflected accordingly in the SmPC, as an explicit warning, to discourage 
the use at this stage, pending further investigations notably based on update of popPK model. 
A formal study (1010) investigating the effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the PK of PF-
07321332, in comparison to matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function, was performed. 
The study is still ongoing and only a preliminary PK report is provided. 
No dose adjustment for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment is proposed by the 
applicant. Provided that PK data/conclusion is confirmed in, the proposed dosing recommendations in 
patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment could be agreed. The final clinical study report for 
C4671010 should be provided (REC). 
At this time, no clinical / PK data are available for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Pending 
availability of clinical (efficacy/safety) data and an appropriate dosing recommendation with PF-
07321332 in this subgroup of patients, it is recommended, from a PK perspective, to not use the drug 
product in patients with severe hepatic impairment. This is reflected accordingly in the SmPC, as an 
explicit warning, to discourage the use at this stage, pending further investigations notably based on 
the update of PopPK model. 
It is noteworthy that during the Art 5.3 (December 2021), the CHMP recommended as a very 
conservative measure a contraindication for the severe hepatic impairment and for the severe renal 
impairment. However, given that a larger safety database from the final analysis of the unique 
C4671005 clinical study (around 1000 patients treated) with no major safety concern identified (which 
is in line with the lack of the target organs identified from the non-clinical data) and given that rather 
than evidence of harm, there is a lack of data to inform on a posology in patients with severe renal 
impairment and severe hepatic impairment, the CHMP concluded to remove the contraindication while 
including warnings. The CHMP has elaborated explicit warnings to alert healthcare professionals that no 
Assessment report

dose recommendation could be established and that further investigations were ongoing (having in 
mind the forthcoming update of PKPD). 
Gender: 
The provided investigations regarding a potential gender effect on the PKs of PF-07321332 are not 
considered conclusive or informative as the validity of the Population model is not proven. The effect 
will be investigated as part of the update PopPK model. 
Race / Ethnicity: 
Race effect on PF-07321332/ritonavir PK has been investigated as part of Study 1001 in only 4 
Japanese healthy volunteers. AUCtau and Cmax values were approximately 30% and 21-26%, 
respectively, lower in Japanese participants compared to Caucasian subjects. Drug accumulation was 
similar in Japanese compared to Caucasian subjects (~2). 
PTR (Peak to through ratio) was 6.27 therefore with an observed geometric mean Cmax of 3772 ng/mL 
which consequently leads to a geometric mean Cmin of 601 ng/mL (only twice the EC90 target). 
Importantly, cautions should be taken with this result since only 4 subjects were included in the 
analysis. These preliminary results will be confirmed by using the awaited update PopPK analysis.  
Body weight: 
Overall, the provided investigations regarding a potential body weight effect on the PKs of PF-
07321332 are not considered conclusive or informative. Therefore, the PKs of PF-07321332 in the 
obese and underweighted patients is not considered as clearly elucidated and the updated popPK 
model is expected to this purpose.  
Elderly: 
Overall, the PKs of PF-07321332 in elderly patients could not be considered elucidated yet and 
additional analyses are requested to allow a better understanding of the age effect in this subgroup. 
Again, the update PopPK model is expected to this purpose. 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of PF-07321332 in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not 
yet been established.  
No PK data are available. Thus, the PKs of PF-07321332 in adolescent patients <18 years is not 
considered elucidated yet.  
For the current CMA under assessment, the applicant claimed that adolescent patients > 40 kg could 
be treated with Paxlovid with the same dose as adults, 300/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir BID.  
According to the applicant, this dose is justified based on Population PK simulations; however, this 
extrapolation is based on PK data in healthy volunteers, which the CHMP considered as not adequate. 
As per the simulated data, it is expected that a PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg BID dose in 
adolescents (i.e., ≥12 to < 18 years of age) will provide comparable exposures in adults receiving the 
same dose and maintained PF-07321332 plasma concentration above EC90 over the entire dosing 
interval suggestive of a therapeutic response. However, such conclusion is not endorsed from a PK 
perspective. The preliminary Population PK model used to simulate exposures in adolescent patients is 
not considered valid/ reliable; and therefore, no valid conclusion could be drawn the model-based 
simulations. Together with the lack of PK data (PK of PF-07321332 not characterised in adolescents) 
and clinical data (efficacy and safety) in the target adolescent population, this issue regarding dose 
selection is considered of a major concern. Consequently, the applicant withdrew the adolescent 
patient population from the indication.

Interactions 
Based on in vitro studies, and given the calculated R values being below or just above the 2012 EMA 
guidance cut-off criteria for MATE1 respectively, the potential for PF-07321332 to cause clinically 
significant DDI based on inhibition of MATE1 only would be low, but interactions with OCT1, and 
OATP1B1 in vivo could not be excluded. The applicant has committed to perform a PBPK model 
exercise with commercial software (SimCYP) utilising compound files for metformin and rosuvastatin. 
The PBPK modelling robustness should be demonstrated and high level of qualification of the model 
should be provided (multiple substrates, multiple perpetrators, based on in vivo results), to waive the 
need for a clinical DDI study. Otherwise clinical studies to document the magnitude of interactions of 
these widely prescribed drugs are needed, especially for metformin. If possible, careful attention to 
patient co-medicated with metformin should be brought in the on-going studies. (REC).  
Due to both inhibition, and induction effect of Paxlovid, as co-packed combination of PF-07321332 and 
ritonavir, on CYP3A4 and P-gp, the net effect of Paxlovid on CYP3A4 and P-gp drug substrates needs to 
be assessed in vivo.  
Given the high-risk targeted population (including notably old patients, patients with cardiovascular 
disease), additional DDI studies with amiodarone and clozapine notably as victim drugs and critical in 
this population, should have been performed. These studies could allow these patients, for whom 
treatment cessation could not be clinically easily handled, to benefit from Paxlovid treatments. The 
applicant should improve the characterisation of the DDI profile post-authorisation. 
Drug-drug interactions are being assessed in studies 1013 with midazolam, and study 1012 with 
dabigatran. According to preliminary study results of the DDI study conducted with midazolam, 
midazolam exposure (AUCinf) was increased by 14.3-fold and Cmax increased by 3.86 fold in co-
administration with PF-07321332/ ritonavir 300/100 mg. The full CSR for 1013 and the clinical DDI 
study with dabigatran should be provided (REC). 
Taking the relatively short duration of treatment with Paxlovid into account (5 days), it is 
acknowledged that the current proposal for section 4.5 of the SmPC based on the interactions derived 
from ritonavir use in HIV treatment may be too restrictive. Nevertheless, in the absence of dedicated 
studies, more refined and therefore relevant recommendations can currently not be provided.  The 
applicant should improve the characterisation of the DDI profile post-authorisation with the objective of 
enlarging patient population eligible to Paxlovid. Having in mind this issue, the CHMP has addressed a 
letter to several Healthcare Professionals organisation to raise awareness about the DDI with Paxlovid. 
Pharmacodynamics 
PF-PF-07321332 is an orally bioavailable 3CLpro (3C-like protease) peptidomimetic inhibitor shown to 
be active against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (EC50=61.8 nM, in dNHBE cells). The in vitro data supports the 
selectivity of PF-07321332 for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with low or no measurable cytotoxicity in 
mammalian cells. 
PF-07321332 demonstrated antiviral activity against the alpha, beta, lambda, gamma, delta, mu and 
omicron variants with EC50 values ranging between 59.5-171 nM in a cell-based assay similar to EC50 
values of the control agent remdesivir with however a moderate decrease in PF-07321332 
susceptibility against the beta variant (4-fold increase in EC50 p<0.05). PF-07321332 showed in vitro 
antiviral activity against the Omicron variant with EC50 values of 70 nM and 23 nM in the HeLa-ACE2 
and Vero-TMPRSS cells, compared to the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain which had EC50 values of 
207 nM and 38 nM in the same cell lines, respectively. 
PF-07321332 was only evaluated in resistance selection assay against MHV infected L929 cells (10 
passages). In vitro selection of PF-07321332 resistant SARS-CoV-2 should be provided. It is 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 86/170 
 
 
 
recommended as well to conduct the assay against variants currently circulating (mainly Omicron and 
Delta) (REC). 
In phenotypic assessments for naturally occurring (based on public data) Mpro/3CLpro mutations, 
reduced PF-07321332 activity (≥3-fold higher Ki values) was identified for the following substitutions: 
G15S (4.4-fold), T135I (3.5-fold), S144A (91.9-fold), H164N (6.4-fold), H172Y (233-fold), Q189K 
(65.4-fold), and D248E (3.7-fold). The clinical impact of these polymorphisms is unknown. Additional 
biochemical analysis in non-naturally occurring mutations showed higher Ki values for the following: 
Y54A (23.6-fold), F140A (39.0-fold), and E166A (33.4-fold). Cell based PF-07321332 antiviral activity 
against all the mutant viruses should be performed (REC). 
It is agreed that there is a low probability that events of TF in the Paxlovid arm of study C46710053CL 
which all occurred in patients infected with the Delta (21J) subvariant are due to a lack of effectiveness 
against this clade. The applicant clarified that Mpro retrieved from consensus genome sequence for 
these 7 events are all identical to reference sequence and the allele frequency of minor variants found 
on Mpro are less than 5.05%. Phenotypic analysis to determine the impact of these specific mutations 
on potency and cell based antiviral activity are to be performed (REC).   
Individual mutations within the Mpro/3CLpro gene region and target cleavage regions were also 
monitored among participants who had a matched D1 and D5 sample analysed for TEMs in study 
C4671005. A260T substitution emerged in one Paxlovid subject and the A260V substitution emerged in 
3 other subjects; neither emerged in any placebo subjects. A260T/V could be a possible Paxlovid TEM. 
Nevertheless, the potential impact of either substitution on resistance is unclear as no TF occurred in 
any of these patients. In a biochemical assay with recombinant Mpro expressing A260V, no reduction 
in PF-07321332 susceptibility was observed. This is also the case for the Mpro D153Y, Q107X and 
cleavage site T6449I substitutions that emerged in 2 Paxlovid treated subjects each and TF occurred in 
any of these patients. Mutations should continue to be monitored for possible clinical evidence of 
treatment resistance and the full planned genotyping and phenotyping analyses at baseline and in 
treatment failure from the pivotal study 1005 should be provided (REC). 
The Mpro Q189K substitution emerged in 5 Paxlovid and 7 placebo treated subjects. It is thus unclear 
if Q189K could be considered a TEM. In addition, genomic position 189 is located in an AT rich region 
and probability of sequencing artefacts are high; nevertheless, this position should also continue to be 
monitored closely for possible clinical evidence of Paxlovid resistance. One case of TF was observed in 
Paxlovid treated subjects and the mutation has shown a drop in potency by biochemical assay (65-fold 
change).  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Paxlovid have been described in support of the use in 
the target population in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation to be used under 
emergency situations and a particular medical need. The CHMP considers the following measures 
necessary to address the clinical pharmacology issues: 
a)  The PopPK model results including PK data collected from the patients enrolled in the EPIC-
HR study with relevant covariables and relevant update to the exposure margins should be 
provided by 31 March 2022 
Clinical pharmacology recommendations and legally binding measures are covered in the list of post-
authorisation measures in Annex I.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development is based on the single pivotal Phase 2/3 C4671005 study conducted in non-
hospitalised, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to 
severe illnesses. 
Of note, two other Phase 2/3 clinical studies are conducted, but are not part of this procedure: (i) in 
non-hospitalised symptomatic adult participants with COVID 19 who are at standard risk of progressing 
to severe illness (Study C4671002), and (ii) the second as a post-exposure prophylaxis regimen (i.e., 
close contacts of patients with positive COVID-19) (Study C4671006).

No dose response study was conducted. The dose selection for the pivotal study was based on relevant 
available preclinical and clinical data, including repeat-dose toxicology studies, clinical safety, and PK 
data from the Phase 1 study (C4671001), and in vitro pharmacology studies with PF-07321332 (refer 
PK and pharmacology sections). 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
A single pivotal trial (C4671005 or EPIC-HR) provides data for the evaluation of efficacy. This is a 
phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

In December 2021, the EMA issued advice on use of Paxlovid for treating COVID-19 based on the 
interim analysis in an Article 5(3) procedure. The results of a planned interim analysis that was 
conducted after approximately 45% of participants in the mITT analysis set completed Day 28 
assessments and included participants randomised through 29 September 2021 (data cut-off 26 
October 2021). 
While the Art 5.3 was based on the primary interim analysis on the basis of which the DSMB 
recommended to stop the enrolment of the patient, the assessment of the marketing authorisation 
application is also based on the supportive final analysis; it presents the results of the primary analysis 
of all enrolled participants who completed the Day 34 visit.  
The planned 24-weeks follow-up has not been completed yet. Those data will be provided when the 
24-weeks follow-up will be completed.  
Study C4671005 
Methods 
This Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non-hospitalised, symptomatic 
adult participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness will 
determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PF-07321332/ritonavir compared with placebo in a 
1:1 ratio. 
Participants were screened within 48 hours of randomisation. Eligible participants have received PF-
07321332 plus ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses total). The total study duration is 
up to 24 weeks, study intervention through Day 5 or Day 6, efficacy assessments through Day 28, a 
safety follow-up period through Day 34, and long-term follow-up at Weeks 12 and 24.

participant’s home or at another non-clinic location approved by the investigator where possible when 
participants are unwilling or unable to attend a clinic visit. 
•  Treatments 
The dosing instruction were: 
  -  2 tablets of PF-07321332 150 mg (or 3 tablets of 100 mg for some participants in the sentinel 
cohort) or placebo for PF-07321332 q12h 
  -  1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg or placebo for ritonavir q12h. 
The treatment was administered for 5 days (10 doses in total). 
•  Objectives and outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective and endpoint were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 92/170 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with COVID-19 related 
hospitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28.  
Hospitalisation was defined as >24 hours of acute care, in a hospital or similar acute care facility, 
including Emergency Rooms or temporary facilities instituted to address medical needs of those with 
severe COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included specialised acute medical care unit 
within an assisted living facility or nursing home. This did not include hospitalisation for the purposes 
of public health and/or clinical trial execution. 
The analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set [all treated subjects 
with onset of symptoms ≤3 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-
19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment], the mITT1 analysis set (all treated subjects 
with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-
19 therapeutic mAb treatment), and the complementary population of analysis represented in mITT2 
comprised all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤5 days).  
Of note the CHMP has considered that the mITT1 was of particular relevance since in line with the 
SmPC recommendation of posology. Consequently, the results of this population of analysis were to be 
highlighted in a dedicated table in the section 5.1 of the SmPC while the results from the primary 
population of analysis (mITT) and the complementary one (mITT2) were to be covered through 
corresponding statements.   
The secondary objectives and endpoints were as follows:

Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022

In terms of efficacy, only the Proportion of participants with COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death 
from any cause through Day 28, with the different estimands, and the Viral titres measured via RT-PCR 
in nasal swabs over time have been analysed at the interim analysis, as planned in the protocol. 
•  Sample size 
This study was designed to have 90% statistical power to show a difference of 3.5% in the proportion 
of participants hospitalised/dying who did not receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb between the 
treatment arms (PF07321332/ritonavir versus placebo) and were treated ≤3 days after COVID-19 
symptom onset, using a 2-sided Type I error rate of 5%. The proportion of hospitalisation/death in the 
placebo arm was assumed to be 7%. 
The sample size needed to detect a 3.5% difference with 90% power at a 2-sided significance level of 
5% was determined to be 1717 randomised participants. Enrolment of participants who at baseline had 
received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment was estimated to be 
approximately 20% of participants and limited/capped to 25% enrolment. Enrolment of participants 
that had COVID-19 symptom onset >3 days prior to randomisation was expected to be approximately 
25% and was to be limited to approximately 1000 participants. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, the total 
sample size for this study was to be approximately 3100 participants. 
To allow for a 5% dropout rate, enrolment was to be stopped after approximately 1870 participants 
had been enrolled to ensure at least 1779 participants were available for the primary analysis. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible participants with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomised (1:1) to 
receive PF-07321332 and ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses total). 
Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and by whether participants had received/were 
expected to receive treatment with COVID-19 therapeutic mAbs (yes/no) based on the site 
investigator’s assessment at time of randomisation.  
Randomisation for the strata where participants had received or were expected to receive COVID-19 
therapeutic mAb treatment was to be capped at a maximum of 25% enrolment.  
This is a double-blind study. The majority of sponsor staff were blinded to study intervention 
allocation. There was an unblinded team supporting the interactions with, and the analyses for, the E-
DMC while the study was on-going. The team consisted of medical monitor/clinicians, reporting 
statistician and reporting programmer(s) and was separate from the direct members of the study 
team. After all participants completed the Day 34 visit (or Early Termination (ET) prior to Day 34 visit), 
the study was to be unblinded and analyses through Day 34, including the primary efficacy endpoint 
analyses, was to be conducted. However, a blinded study team is to manage the completion of the 
study until all participants had completed the Week 24 visit (or ET prior to the Week 24 visit). The 
blinded team was to be separate from the unblinded team. 
•  Statistical methods 
Interim analysis 
A planned IA for efficacy and futility with a potential sample size-re-estimation was conducted and 
reviewed by an independent E-DMC after approximately 45% overall participants had completed the 
Day 28 assessments in the mITT analysis set (i.e., 28 days after randomisation).  
A second IA for efficacy and futility was planned after approximately 70% of participants in the mITT 
analysis set completed the Day 28 assessments (i.e., 28 days after randomisation). 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 95/170 
 
 
 
Subsequent to the planned interim analyses, there were 2 analyses planned for reporting the results of 
this study. The primary analysis was to be performed after all participants had completed the Day 34 
visit. The follow-up analysis was to be performed after all participants had completed the Week 24 
visit. 
The nominal significance level for the 2 planned interim and final proportion of hospitalisation/death 
analyses was determined by means of the Lan-DeMets procedure with an O’Brien-Fleming stopping 
boundary. Further details are provided in the statistical methods section under multiplicity adjustment 
procedures. 
Changes after interim analysis results 
Following the availability of the first interim analysis results, the protocol was amended (Amendment 4, 
20 November 2021) to remove the second interim analysis as the planned interim analysis objective 
was achieved. The sample size was also updated from 3100 to approximately 3000 participants due to 
the removal of the second interim analysis.

dose of study intervention, and who at baseline did not receive nor were 
expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment. Participants will be 
analysed according to the study intervention to which they were randomised. 
Modified Intent-To-
All participants randomly assigned to study intervention, who take at least 1 
Treat 2 (mITT2) 
dose of study intervention. Participants will be analysed according to the study 
intervention to which they were randomised. 
The definitions for the FAS and the SAS remained the same. 
A Per Protocol set was also defined for the final analysis: All participants in the mITT set without 
important protocol deviations considered to impact the interpretation of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Hypothesis testing and multiplicity adjustment 
The primary hypothesis to be tested was whether or not there is a difference in proportion of 
participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28 between 
PF-7321332/ ritonavir and placebo. The statistical hypothesis was as follows: 
Where pPF-7321332 and pplacebo are the proportions of participants with hospitalisation or death through 
Day 28. The hypotheses will be tested at an overall significant level of 5% (2-sided). 
Following the positive test of the primary endpoint, sequential testing was to be performed for the 
following 2 secondary endpoints: 
1.  Proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause 
through Day 28 who did not receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment, regardless of their 
onset of COVID-19 related signs and symptoms. 
2.  Time (days) to sustained alleviation of all targeted signs/symptoms through Day 28. 
Other secondary endpoints listed below were to be subsequently tested following the Hochberg 
procedure: 
a)  Time (days) to sustained resolution of all targeted signs/symptoms through Day 28. 
b)  Proportion of participants with a resting peripheral oxygen saturation ≥95% at Days 1 
and 5. 
c)  Number of COVID-19 related medical visits through Day 28. 
The nominal significance level for the 2 planned interim and final proportion of hospitalisation/death 
analyses was determined by means of the Lan-DeMets procedure with an O’Brien-Fleming stopping 
boundary, with an overall 2-sided type I error rate of 5%. For the first IA (45%), O’Brien-Fleming

approach was used for decision making, i.e., reject H0 with 2-sided p-value ≤0.002, or reject H1 with 
2-sided p-value >0.9184. The actual stopping boundaries depended on the exact timing of the IA. 
For the second IA (70%), O’Brien-Fleming approach was to be used for decision making, ie, reject H0 
with 2-sided p-value ≤0.014, or reject H1 with 2-sided p-value >0.337. The actual stopping 
boundaries were to depend on the available percentage of information.  
A sample size re-estimation was to be conducted during the first interim analysis based on conditional 
power. The sample size could have been adjusted one time and the increase was to be capped at 30%. 
The Cui, Hung, and Wang (1999) method would be used to control the Type I error probability. 
Primary endpoint 
The cumulative proportion of participants who experienced a COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death 
due to any cause during the first 28 days of the study was estimated for each treatment group of the 
mITT analysis set using the Kaplan-Meier method to consider losses to follow-up and patients who 
discontinued early.  
The estimand was the difference of the proportions in the 2 treatment groups and its 95% confidence 
interval was presented, as well as, the associated two-sample proportion test. For the 95% CI, the 
corresponding estimate of the standard error was computed using Greenwood’s formula (Kalbfleisch 
and Prentice; 1980). The Greenwood’s formula to estimate the variance of the difference of proportions 
at Day 28 is sqrt[Var(SPF(28))+Var(SPlacebo(28))]. Instead of dealing with S(ti) the log-log approach to 
CI was used. The 95% CI was computed for the estimate of L(t)= log(-log(S(t))), the hazard function. 
The CI will be in right range when transforming back to S(t) = exp (-exp (L(t)). Antilogging this 
confidence interval gives a 95% confidence interval for the difference itself. 
The above primary analysis was to be conducted for the 2 planned interim analyses as well. Two-sided 
95% CI (adjusted for the 2 planned interim analyses) and associated p-value (two-sample proportion 
test) for the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups were to be presented. 
Significance level was to be determined using the O’Brien-Fleming approach at the interim analysis and 
the final analysis. The overall significance level was set at 5% (2 sided). 
For participants who completed Day 28 efficacy assessment (Day 34 visit), they were censored at their 
last visits. For participants who discontinued before Day 28 assessment or are lost to follow-up, they 
were censored at the last known date in the study. 
Participants were analysed under the mAb stratum assigned at randomisation/baseline. 
The proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause through 
Day 28 were summarised. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using the mITT2 analysis set. 
Two additional sensitivity analyses were performed: 1) excluding all data from Indian sites and 
additional participants from a non-compliant US site. 2) excluding participants from the sentinel cohort 
of the study treated with active treatment (3 doses of 100 mg). 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed using the mITT analysis set whereby participants that 
did not have follow-up data through Day 21 were hypothetically assumed to experience both COVID-
19-related hospitalisation and death in a worst-case scenario.

Secondary endpoints 
Proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death due to any cause through Day 
28 in the mITT1 analysis set 
The analysis of the proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death due to any 
cause through Day 28 in the mITT1 analysis set was similar to the primary endpoint analysis. 
Time (days) to Sustained Alleviation and Time to Resolution of Targeted COVID-19 Sign/Symptoms 
through Day 28 
The time (days) to sustained alleviation and time to resolution were defined for all targeted COVID-19 
associated symptoms based on self-assessment. 
Sustained alleviation of all targeted COVID-19 signs/symptoms was defined as the event occurring on 
the first of 4 consecutive days when all symptoms scored as moderate or severe at study entry are 
scored as mild or absent AND all symptoms scored mild or absent at study entry are scored as absent. 
The first day of the 4 consecutive-day period is considered the First Event Date. 
Sustained resolution is defined as when all targeted symptoms are scored as absent for 4 consecutive 
days. The first day of the 4 consecutive-day period is considered the First Event Date. 
For symptoms with no reported severity in baseline, the symptom was to be absent in order to be 
counted as sustained alleviated/resolved (missing severity at baseline were treated as mild). 
Day 25 is the last possible day the symptom alleviation and resolution endpoints can be achieved 
(definition includes data from the subsequent three days) and Day 28 is the last day participants report 
their daily signs and symptoms. 
The time to sustained symptom alleviation/resolution for the purpose of this study is defined as: 
• 
• 
For a participant with sustained symptom alleviation/resolution (event), time to event is 
calculated as (First Event Date) – (First Dose Date) +1. 
For a participant that either completes Day 28 of the study or discontinues from the study 
before Day 28 without sustained symptom alleviation/resolution (censored), censoring date is 
at the last date on which symptom alleviation/resolution is assessed, and time is calculated as 
(Censoring Date) – (First Dose Date) +1 or Day 25 whichever occurs first. 
The decision to require 4 consecutive days with all targeted symptoms absent was based on 
exploratory analyses of data from the ACTIV-2/A5401 study, which suggested that this choice (rather 
than requiring fewer consecutive days) better captured sustained symptom resolution with low 
probability of subsequent relapse. 
Participants who are hospitalised for the treatment of COVID-19 or death from any cause during the 
28-day period were classified as not achieving sustained symptom alleviation/resolution and were 
censored at day 25. 
Cox proportional hazard model analyses were used for time to sustained symptom 
alleviation/resolution. Cox proportional hazard model included treatment and region effect as 
independent variables. In addition, the stratification variables were added to the model analyses 
depending of the analysis population. 
Number of COVID-19 Related Medical Visits Through Day 28 
The number of COVID-19 related medical visits through Day 28 were analysed with a negative-
binomial regression model, using the log-total number of days of data collection as the participant

offset variable. The resulting analysis shows the difference in estimated rate of medical visits between 
treatment groups. The analyses were done using mITT, mITT1, and mITT2 populations. 
Subgroup analyses 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary and first key secondary endpoints using the mITT and 
mITT1 analysis sets, respectively, were conducted by age (<65, ≥65 years), gender, race, BMI (<25, 
25-29, ≥30 kg/m2), baseline serology status (antibody negative, antibody positive), baseline viral load 
([<104, ≥104 copies/mL] and [<107, ≥107 copies/mL]), baseline comorbidities and number of 
baseline comorbidities present (0-1, 2-3, ≥4). 
Changes to planned analyses 
Several important changes were made to the planned analyses as part of protocol amendments 2, 3 
and 4. Most relevant modifications are briefly described in the table below. 
Protocol amendment 
Change in planned analyses 
Amendment 2 
02 August 2021 
The primary analysis set (mITT) has been refined to include just those 
participants who were treated ≤3 days after COVID-19 symptom onset 
(symptom onset window reduced from <5 days to ≤3 days). Other 
impacts include: 
1.  Key secondary endpoint added as a consequence on mITT1 
population, i.e. regardless of COVID-19 symptom onset  
2.  Sample size increased from 2260 to approximately 3000 (adjusted 
for updated primary efficacy analysis) 
3.  Enrolment of participants that had COVID-19 symptom onset > 3 
days prior to randomisation expected to be approximately 25% and 
limited to 1000 participants 
Amendment 3 
Additional planned interim analysis for efficacy and futility to be done 
26 October 2021 
after approximately 70% of participants in the mITT analysis set 
complete the Day 28 assessments (i.e., 28 days after randomisation). 
Other impacts include: 
4.  Modification of first interim analysis to be planned for efficacy and 
futility (rather than efficacy and safety) 
5.  Sample size increased from 3000 to 3100 participants due to addition 
of second interim analysis 
Amendment 4 
Second interim analysis removed because the planned interim objective 
20 November 2021 
was achieved, and sample size reduced from 3100 to 3000 as a result. 
Several changes were also implemented by SAP amendments. Key changes were: 
•  A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint based on mITT2 in the SAP (v1.1; 12 October 
2021) was initially described as a secondary analysis of the primary endpoint (in protocol 
amendment 2, 2 August 2021) 
• 
The POC analysis of viral load was specified in the SAP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 100/170 
 
 
 
 
•  mITT, mITT1 and mITT2 populations updated for the final analysis as requested by the 
FDA. They are no longer required to provide at least one post-baseline measurement 
through Day 28 visit. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Of the 2396 participants screened for entry into the study, 2246 participants were randomised and 137 
participants did not fulfil all eligibility criteria at screening. The most common reason for screen failure 
was not having a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR collected within 5 days of 
randomisation. 
Figure 15. Participant flow 
•  Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 343 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Czech Republic, 
Hungary, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,  Mexico, Poland, Puerto Rico, Russian Federation, 
South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United States. The trial began on 16 July 2021 
and the and the primary completion date was 09 December 2021.  
Halt of centre’s recruitment 
The applicant made a data driven decision to halt recruitment (22 September 2021, total of 193 
participants randomised) in India due to observations in a blinded data review of a >90% rate of 
serology positive participants at baseline (92% versus 45% in patients from India versus ROW, 
respectively), with corresponding low levels of viral load measured at baseline from a blinded 
assessment (mean baseline viral load [Log10 copies/mL] = 2.36 versus 5.25 copies/mL in patients 
from India versus ROW, respectively), and the high frequency of participants experiencing mild COVID-
19 symptoms at baseline (73% versus 15% of participants with only mild symptoms at baseline, India 
versus ROW, respectively).

•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The applicant indicates that the permitted window in the inclusion criteria for a positive RT-PCR test 
prior to randomisation was updated from 3 days to 5 days (Protocol Amendment 1, 02 July 2021) (For 
other mains protocol amendment, please see Statistical methods’ section). 
Deviation 
Overall, the most frequently reported important protocol deviations occurred within the 
Procedures/Tests, Investigational Product, and Laboratory categories. All other categories occurred in 
≤2.5% of participants. 
  -  In the Procedures/Test category, most deviations (18.3% participants) were due to the participant 
missing more than 25% of their COVID-19-related symptoms diary entries. 
  -  In the Investigational Product category, most deviations (≥1% participants) were: PF 
07321332/placebo and ritonavir/placebo were taken > 5 minutes apart (9.5%), dose window 
more than +/- 4 hours (4.2 %), and compliance >115% (1.0%). 
  -  In the Laboratory category, most deviations (5.0% participants) were NP/nasal swab not done. 
The applicant considers that protocol deviations were comparable between both treatment groups. 
GCP noncompliance 
A US site, terminated for GCP noncompliance, reported a total of 12 important protocol deviations in 
12 of 37 enrolled participants at the site: 8 participants in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm and 4 
participants in placebo arm. Important protocol deviations by category include: 
  -  Inclusion/Exclusion criteria (PF-07321332/ritonavir: 3 participants; placebo: 0 participants) 
  -  Investigational Product (PF-07321332/ritonavir: 3 participants; placebo: 1 participant) 
  -  Procedures/Tests (PF-07321332/ritonavir: 2 participants; placebo: 3 participants). 
Stop of the study 
On 03 November 2021, the E-DMC reviewed data from the 45% interim analysis and determined that 
the pre-specified criteria for stopping the trial due to overwhelming efficacy had been achieved (PF-
07321332/ritonavir is superior to placebo in the mITT analysis set for reduction in 
hospitalisation/death; p<0.0001, the pre-specified p-value per protocol to stop the trial for efficacy 
was p<0.002). Further enrolment in the study was stopped. 
•  Baseline data 
The baseline demographics characteristics were overall equally distributed across treatment arms 
(Table 25).

The denominator to calculate percentages is N, the number of participants in the full analysis set within each treatment group.  
Risk Factors include Age ≥ 60, BMI > 25 and Verbatims from pre-specified Medical History (Cigarette Smoker, 
Immunosuppression, Chronic Kidney Disease,Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Cardiovascular Disorder, Chronic Lung Disease, 
HIV Infection, Sickle Cell Disease, Neurodevelopmental Disorder, Cancer and Device Dependence).  
Duration since First Diagnosis is days from qualifying positive SARS-CoV-2 test.  
Duration since first diagnosis and duration since first symptom are computed from the start of dosing.  
Missing category is not included in the table.  
Rest of World: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Russian Federation, South Africa, Republic of Korea, 
Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. 
A total of 2,246 participants were randomised to receive either Paxlovid or placebo in the supportive 
final analysis. 
All participants had a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, with 94.2% of participants having a 
qualifying SARS CoV-2 positive test collected within 3 days of first dose of study intervention. 
Across treatment groups: 
  -  93.8% participants did not receive or were not planning to receive mAbs for the disease under 
study at the time of randomisation. 
  -  53.0% of participants were serological positive at baseline. 
  -  60.2% participants had baseline viral load ≥4.0 Log10 copies/mL and 25.6% of participants had a 
very high baseline viral load (≥7.0 log10 copies/mL) 
The most common risks factor at baseline were across treatment groups: 
  -  BMI >25 kg/m2: 80.5% (BMI >30 kg/m2: 36.8%) 
  -  Cigarettes smokers: 39.0% 
  -  Hypertension: 32.9% 
Across treatment groups, 38.9% and 35.7% had respectively 1 and 2 risk factors. 
As a significant caveat, immunosuppressed patients were poorly represented in the clinical study 
(<1%). This is notably specified in the description of the study population in section 5.1. The mean age 
of the whole population was 46 years with 13% of participants 65 years of age and consequently the 
population of patients older than 75 was very limited (3%) with an expected scarce number of patients 
75 years of age and older; 66% of participants had onset of symptoms ≤3 days from initiation of study 
treatment; 37% were obese, which is limited since the inclusion criteria was also compatible for the 
inclusion of overweight patients  (BMI > 25 kg/m2), this has unfortunately somewhat diluted the obese

patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2); 12% had diabetes mellitus. It is noteworthy that a high proportion (51%) 
were serological positive while not expected to be vaccinated neither to have prior COVID-19 and only 
a limited proportion of participants (6.2%) either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 
therapeutic mAb treatment at the time of randomisation and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 
analyses. 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics are consistent across the interim and the final 
analysis. 
Variants of concern 
An analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence of VOCs by treatment and by treatment failure. 
The primary variant across both treatment arms was Delta (98.53%) and was distributed in high 
prevalence as subvariants Delta/21J (74.15%), Delta/21I (15.95%) and Delta/21A (8.43%). In the 
group receiving PF-07321332/ritonavir, 7 participants experienced TF, and all were infected with the 
Delta (21J) subvariant. 
Concomitant medication 
During the study treatment and follow-up periods (through Day 34), concomitant medications reported 
by participants included the following: 
  -  38 (1.7%) participants received mAb for COVID-19 treatment (bamlanivimab, etesevimab, 
casirivimab, imdevimab, and regdanvimab), which is lower than what was reported in the 6.2% of 
participants who were expected to receive mAb at the time of randomisation (baseline). Of the 
participants who received mAb for COVID-19 treatment, 12 (1.1%) participants were in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir group and 26 (2.3%) participants were in the placebo group (Table 14.4.2.1). 
  -  61 (2.7%) participants received favipiravir: (27 [2.4%] participants for PF-07321332/ritonavir and 
34 [3.0%] for placebo). 
  -  19 (0.9%) participants received remdesivir (2 [0.2%] for PF-07321332/ritonavir and 17 [1.5%] 
for placebo). 
  -  186 (8.4%) participants received corticosteroids with ATC2 classification of “Corticosteroids for 
systemic use” (69 [6.2%] for PF-07321332/ritonavir and 117 [10.5%] for placebo). 
Corticosteroids were administered for any reason, such as underlying conditions (e.g., rheumatoid 
arthritis, asthma) and COVID-19 
The proportion of participants who took a prohibited concomitant medication/vaccine was higher in the 
placebo group compared with the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (1.5% and 0.6%, respectively). 
Supplemental Oxygen 
Participants who required oxygen supplementation for COVID-19 during the C4671005 study were able 
to continue study treatment. During the study, 9 participants were administered supplemental oxygen 
for COVID-19 in the PF-07321332 group; of these, 5 (55.6%) participants had an event 
(hospitalisation). Within the placebo group, 55 participants were administered supplemental oxygen for 
COVID-19; of these, 47 participants (85.5%) had an event of hospitalisation or death. 
Serostatus  
Patients were considered seropositive at baseline if they had evidence of antibodies to either the S or 
the N antigen. Serology testing did not discriminate between IgG or IgM. Given the current turnaround 
time, serology testing was not part of the screening process prior to enrolment. Participants may have 
been unaware of prior (potentially asymptomatic) SARS-CoV-2 infection and tested seropositive at 
baseline. Additional exploratory testing is planned to further characterize the immune response to 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 106/170 
 
 
 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and over time (including cytokine, immune cell markers and neutralising 
antibody responses).  
Additionally, the population enrolled in Study C4671005 was limited to unvaccinated patients at high 
risk of progression to severe COVID-19. However, study C4671002 is running in parallel, and is 
recruiting both unvaccinated patients without risk factors for severe COVID-19 as well as fully 
vaccinated patients with risk factors for severe COVID-19. In a pre-planned interim analysis of data 
from this trial, an additional reduction in viral load of ~1.0 log10 copies/mL relative to placebo at Day 
5 was observed, similar to what has been characterised in unvaccinated/high risk patients from Study 
C4671005. These results suggest that the antiviral activity of PF-07321332/ritonavir is consistent 
across vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, as would be anticipated with an antiviral with an 
intracellular target. Some further insights might be obtained from the smaller sample sized study in 
patients at standard risk of developing severe COVID-19 including patients vaccinated or non-
vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, the added value of this additional C4671002 or EPIC-SR 
study performed in patients at standard risk is uncertain given that study of lower sample size failed on 
its primary endpoint. As immunity to SARS-CoV-2 wanes and/or is compromised by emerging variants 
of concern, risk of hospitalisation/death in vaccinated patients may increase and become more 
reflective of the C4671005 unvaccinated patient population. Therefore, data from both C4671002 and 
C4671005 will inform the anticipated efficacy of treatment in both vaccination and unvaccinated 
patients. 
Moreover, the CHMP requested to investigate the high proportion of patients with seropositive status 
having in mind that those patients were not expected to receive vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 nor had 
prior episode of COVID-19. The applicant specified that investigations were ongoing to this purpose. 
•  Numbers analysed 
The analysis of efficacy was performed using the mITT, mITT1, and mITT2 sets as follow. 
Table 26. Participant Evaluation Groups - All Screened Participants (Protocol C4671005) 
A total of 13 participants who were not screen failures were not randomised. Further examination of 
those 13 participants showed all but 2 withdrew consent. One participant did not come to the Day 1 
visit within 48 hours after screening and the other participant decided not to complete the baseline. 
Generally, the treatment duration was compliant with what is required in the Protocol.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary analysis 
COVID-19-Related Hospitalisation or Death from Any Cause (mITT) 
This analysis was conducted in patients who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive 
COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment and were treated ≤3 days of COVID-19 onset. Through Day 28, 
there were 9 deaths in the placebo group and none in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group.

Sensitivity Analyses 
At the request of FDA, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the mITT analysis set was performed whereby 
participants who did not have follow-up data through Day 21 were hypothetically assumed to have 
experience both COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in a worst-case scenario: 
  -  2 participants in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group and 1 participant in the placebo group were 
assumed to have had a primary endpoint event. 
  -  A 5.66% (95% CI: -7.69% to -3.63%; p<0.0001) absolute reduction, reducing the primary 
endpoint event rate from 6.68% to 1.02%, with PF-07321332/ritonavir in comparison with 
placebo treatment. 
Additionally, to evaluate whether the results in the primary analysis were affected by data from India 
and a non-compliant US site, the analysis was repeated while excluding data from these sites. 
  -  5 participants in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group and 44 participants in the placebo group were 
assumed to have had a primary endpoint event. 
  -  A 5.87% (95% CI: 7.86% to -3.88%; p<0.0001) absolute reduction, reducing the primary 
endpoint event rate from 6.60% to 0.73%, with PF-07321332/ritonavir in comparison with 
placebo treatment. 
  -  It is to note that, of 193 participants from India randomised, none progressed to hospitalisation or 
death. 
The results of an additional sensitivity analysis that excluded participants from the sentinel cohort of 
the study treated with active treatment (3 x 100 mg PF-07321332 tablets) were consistent with those 
observed in the primary analysis. 
Sensitivity Analyses using mITT2 
This analysis aimed to assess the treatment effect in a population including participants who received 
mAb treatment or planned to receive mAb treatment (as a note, one participant in each treatment

group had received mAb treatment). The population includes patients regardless they received 
treatment within 3 days and after 3 days since onset of symptom.

The results of the analyses were consistent with the mITT primary analysis and conclusions remain 
unchanged: 
  -  when participants who received a therapeutic COVID-19 mAb treatment postbaseline were 
considered to have experienced a primary endpoint event, treatment with PF-07321332/ritonavir 
reduced the primary event rate from 6.678 to 0.867%, showing a 5.811% absolute reduction 
relative to placebo (p<.0001). Two participants in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group and 3 
participants in the placebo group received mAb treatment postbaseline. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
1) Proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause through 
Day 28 (mITT-1) 
This secondary analysis assessed the treatment effect in a population including participants who have 
received treatment within 3 days of symptom onset and those who have received treatment after 3 
days. Through Day 28, there were 12 deaths in the placebo group and none in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir group.

2) Time to Sustained Alleviation of All Targeted Signs/Symptoms Through Day 28 (mITT) 
Because statistical significance was achieved in the analyses of both the primary and first secondary 
endpoints, the time to sustained alleviation in all targeted signs/symptoms through Day 28 was 
analysed with an alpha level of 5% in the sequential testing procedure. The median time to sustained 
alleviation in the placebo group was 15 days and was reduced to 13 days in the PF-07321332/ritonavir 
group.

likely to maintain those levels at Day 5 than those with a resting peripheral oxygen saturation <95% 
at baseline but the treatment difference was not significant (p=0.2331).

Design 
C4671005 
This Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non-
hospitalised, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 at increased risk of 
progressing to severe illness determined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PF-
07321332/ritonavir compared with placebo. Eligible participants with a confirmed 
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomised (1:1) to receive PF-
07321332/ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses total). 
Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and whether participants had 
received/were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment (yes/no) 
based on the site investigator’s assessment at the time of randomisation.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical study in support of this procedure was a phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study (C4671005 or EPIC-HR study) to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PF-
07321332/ritonavir versus placebo in non-hospitalised, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 
who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. The total study duration was up to 24 weeks, 
study intervention through Day 5 or Day 6, efficacy assessments through Day 28, a safety follow-up 
period through Day 34, and long-term follow-up at Weeks 12 and 24. 
The general design of this phase 2/3 clinical trial appears appropriate. Additionally, considering the 
pandemic context and the need of curative treatments for the COVID-19, supporting the MAA with a 
single pivotal study is deemed acceptable. 
The selection criteria are globally consistent with the target population. To be enrolled, positive RT-
PCR, or other molecular or antigen tests, and initial onset signs/symptoms attributable to COVID-19 
were needed, both within 5 days prior randomisation. This seems reasonable to define symptomatic 
patients with COVID-19, as well as the list of the specified signs/symptoms. 
Risk factors of progressing to severe illness were predefined. Some inclusion criteria were not 
sufficiently stringent and thus have somewhat diluted the population at the highest risk of progressing 
to severe disease. Patients were to be enrolled on the basis of being overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2,), 
likely referring to CDC, and not necessarily requiring obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) based on WHO’s criteria 
and ECDC. Additionally, the lower bound for age regardless of comorbidities was >60 y/o, and not > 
65 y/o, hence not enriching the population with very old patients.  
In absence or further stratification factors, it is not fully clear in which extent both subpopulations, 
patients with mild-illness and patients with moderate illness, are sufficiently represented and well 
balanced across the treatment groups. Additionally, the selection criteria allowed to enrol patients with 
oxygen saturation of ≥92% on room air, while SpO2 <94% is one of the criteria to define severe 
illness. Nonetheless, current need for hospitalisation or anticipated need for hospitalisation within 48 
hours after randomisation was an exclusion criterion, as such it might be unlikely that patients with 
severe illness were recruited at screening.  
Considering that the applicant has not provided a definition of ‘mild to moderate disease patients’ and 
also considering that non-severe patients are best defined as not requiring O2, the CHMP requested 
that the indication be updated to not state ‘mild to moderate’ but rather ‘not requiring O2’, when 
describing the target population. The indication was updated accordingly. 
Regarding prior and concomitant medication, drug-drug interactions related to CYP3A4, due to the 
administration of ritonavir, was taken into account. 
It should also be highlighted that subjects were not vaccinated (allowed only from Day 34, while 
primary timepoint is at Day 28) but could receive mAb. 
Regarding the study treatment, patients were instructed to take 2 tablets of PF-07321332 150 mg (or 
3 tablets of 100 mg for some participants in the sentinel cohort) plus 1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg 
q12h. Taking into consideration the assessment of pharmacodynamics and Scientific Advice provided 
by CHMP, the rationale for dose selection, based on reaching unbound Ctrough values above EC90 and 
assuming an inflated intrasubject variability, can be agreed, all the more in view of the clinical results 
with this selected dose. Further scrutiny will apply once the results of the updated PopPK model will be 
submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 122/170 
 
 
 
The treatment duration, 5 days (10 doses), was defined by the company based on other antiviral 
agents used in the treatment of acute respiratory infections, such as remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 and 
oseltamivir for influenza. This is agreed, based on the results of the clinical study with this tested 
treatment duration. This should be further explored in immunodeficient patients characterised by a 
prolonged clearance of the virus (potentially resulting in emergence of resistance). Even though the 
CHMP considered it was not feasible to proceed with a clinical study in immunocompromised patients, 
this issue should be monitored post-authorisation. 
The choice of placebo as comparator is considered appropriate. The study designed allowed the use of 
mAb as considered standard of care for COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen and at increased risk of 
progressing to severe COVID-19. Enrolment of participants that had received or were expected to 
receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment was to be limited to approximately 25% of participants. 
The primary objective and the primary endpoint of percentage of increased risk patients with COVID-
19 related hospitalisation or death all causes within 28 days is of particular clinical relevance. There are 
no objections with the proposed secondary endpoints. The time to alleviation or resolution of 
symptoms as part of the secondary endpoints is of limited value to substantiate the clinical benefit.  
The sample size calculations appear to be in line with corresponding protocol assumptions. The 
assumed proportion of hospitalisation/death in the placebo arm (7%) is consistent with the observed 
rate at interim and final analyses. 
Following the availability of the first interim analysis results, the protocol was amended to remove the 
second interim analysis as the planned interim analysis objective was achieved. 
Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and by whether participants had received/were 
expected to receive treatment with COVID-19 therapeutic mAbs (yes/no) based on the site 
investigator’s assessment at time of randomisation. First, it is unclear to which extent this latter factor 
is appropriate to define patients most at risk of progressing to severe illness. Secondly, as the study 
primary analysis is restricted to patients who were treated ≤3 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, 
time since COVID-19 symptom onset at randomisation (≤3 vs >3 days) would have been expected as 
an additional stratification factor of the randomisation. The lack of stratification for the time since 
symptom onset could raise a concern about the preservation of the randomisation in the primary 
analysis population (mITT). Nevertheless, given the observed balance of treatment arms and other 
stratification factors in the primary analysis set, this issue is not thought to have affected the results. 
Based on the SAP, all efficacy populations (mITT, mITT1 and mITT2) excluded subjects who were not 
treated (both interim and final analyses) or without at least 1 post-baseline visit through Day 28 (IA 
only). Efficacy analysis sets would be generally expected to include all randomised subjects regardless 
of treatment with study drug and regardless of post-baseline visit attendance. Similarly, it would be 
expected for the COVID-19 symptom onset criteria ≤3 days to be defined using the randomisation 
date, rather than using the treatment start date. The applicant did not provide additional analyses of 
the primary endpoint using alternative efficacy analysis sets. Nevertheless, considering the mITT, 
mITT1, mITT2 in the supportive final analysis to include subjects without post-baseline measurements 
and the relatively small frequency of untreated patients, this concern is not thought to impact the 
study conclusions.  
The primary analysis method (proportions derived from Kaplan-Meier method with 95% CIs based on 
Greenwood’s formula of the variance estimate) appears overall acceptable. The Lan-DeMets procedure 
with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries for the testing of the primary endpoint across interim and final 
analyses is expected to provide an appropriate control of the study type I error. 
Some discrepancies were noted in the statistical analysis plan, such as the definition of analysis 
populations and the sequential testing of the secondary endpoints, which were clarified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 123/170 
 
 
 
Although the primary analysis method seems acceptable, the censoring of subjects who discontinued 
before their Day 28 assessment or were lost to follow up could be questioned. Data from subjects who 
withdrew early could lead to biased estimates. As part of the assessment, the applicant provided a 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis with the assumption that subjects not providing follow-up data through 
Day 21 hypothetically experienced both COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. This may have 
provided an alternative treatment effect estimate under more conservative assumptions, which was 
consistent with the supportive final analysis.  
There were several important changes to the planned analyses that were implemented while the study 
was ongoing. A change in the primary analysis population and the addition of a key secondary 
endpoint are two key updates to the study design which could potentially raise concerns about the trial 
integrity. Nevertheless, these modifications were performed before unblinding the study. More 
importantly, the primary analysis has been repeated on all mITT, mITT1 and mITT2 populations. These 
alternative populations may be used to assess the robustness and consistency of the primary analysis 
results on wider analysis sets. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The enrolment in the study was stopped upon recommendation by the E-DMC following the review of 
data from the 45% interim analysis and determined that the pre-specified criteria for stopping the trial 
due to efficacy had been achieved. This is acceptable. 
This report included as part of this marketing authorisation includes the results from 2426 randomised 
participants, while 1361 participants only (n=678 for PF-07321332/ritonavir, n=683 for placebo) were 
included in the 45% interim analysis. 
The proportion of discontinuation remained limited, with 93.1% of the randomised participants who 
completed the treatment phase and 93.6 % who completed the follow-up period until day 34, with 
well-balanced proportions across the treatment groups. 
Overall, the number of important protocol deviations was comparable between the treatment groups.  
Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics are balanced across the treatment groups. It should 
be noted that a high percentage of patients with positive serology status at baseline was observed 
(51.2% vs 47.0%), while the exclusion criteria included any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection prior the 
study and, participants who have received or are expected to receive any dose of a SARS-CoV-2 
vaccine before the Day 34 visit. According to the applicant, serology testing did not discriminate 
between IgG or IgM. This did not allow to explore if the positive status was due to unaware of prior 
(potentially asymptomatic) SARS-CoV-2 infection or to immune response related to the current COVID-
19 episode (at the time of the enrolment). However, the applicant is committed to provide the results 
of the exploratory testing planned to further characterise the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 at 
baseline and over time (REC). 
Across treatment groups, 38.9% and 35.7% had respectively 1 and 2 risk factors. Main risk factors 
observed in the participants were overweight (80.5% with a BMI >25 kg/m2, 36.8% with a BMI >30 
kg/m2), hypertension (32.9%) and diabetes mellitus (12.2%). 21.67% were older than 60 years of 
ages and 12.8% older than 65 years of age. Patients with immunodeficiency were poorly represented 
with less than 1% of the study population. There are concerns on the maintenance of the benefit in 
patient with immunodeficiency for which a prolonged period of viral shedding could occur. This is of 
importance as viral clearance might be lower in those patients with a potential risk of treatment failure 
and emergence of resistance with the recommended 5 days treatment. Therefore, the applicant needs 
to particularly monitor treatment failure in this subset of patients post approval (REC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 124/170 
 
 
 
Additionally, it is noteworthy that cigarettes smokers are largely represented (39%). Cigarette smoking 
is not per se considered a risk factor. Thus, the applicant is committed to further elaborate in which 
extent participants with “cigarettes smoke” at baseline presented this solely factor or other 
comorbidities, and its potential impact of the results (REC). 
60.4% participants had baseline viral load ≥4.0 Log10 copies/mL. 
The population enrolled was mainly from US (41.3%) and Europe (29.8%). This appears sufficient to 
generalise the results of the study results to the European population. 
Given the period the study was conducted, the primary variant across both treatment arms was Delta 
(98.53%) and was distributed in high prevalence as subvariants Delta/21J (74.15%), Delta/21I 
(15.95%) and Delta/21A (8.43%).  As the vast majority of the participants were infected with the 
Delta variant, the clinical efficacy of Paxlovid is only demonstrated in this VOC. However, in vitro data 
are supportive of activity of Paxlovid against other major VOCs including the currently circulating 
omicron variant.  
Sequencing data are available from 878 participants, completed genotyping and phenotyping analyses 
from the pivotal C4671005 study should be provided (refer to clinical pharmacology recommendation). 
While 6.2% of the participants were expected to receive mAb at the time of randomisation, only 1.7% 
participants received mAb for COVID-19 treatment, 12 participants (1.1%) in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir group and 26 participants (2.3%) in the placebo group, remaining a limited 
proportion. Additionally, 186 (8.4%) participants received corticosteroids with ATC2 classification of 
“Corticosteroids for systemic use” during the study period (through Day 34); 69 (6.2%) for PF-
07321332/ritonavir and 117 (10.5%) for placebo which seems consistent with the observed efficacy of 
the study treatment.  
The determination of primary efficacy was based on a planned interim analysis of 774 subjects in mITT 
population. The estimated risk reduction was -6.3% with unadjusted 95% CI of (9.0%, 3.6%) and a 
95% CI of (-10.61%, -2.02%) when adjusting for multiplicity. The 2-sided p-value was < 0.0001 with 
2-sided significance level of 0.002.  
In the supporting final analysis, the primary endpoint of the study was met with a 5.807% (95% CI: -
7.777% to - 3.837%; p<0.0001) absolute reduction, reducing the primary endpoint event rate from 
6.531% to 0.723% at Day-28, with PF-07321332/ritonavir in comparison with placebo treatment. No 
patient died in the Paxlovid treatment group whereas 9 deaths occurred in the placebo group according 
to the mITT and 12 deaths according to the mITT1. The results are consistent with the outcomes of the 
interim analysis. Sensitivity analyses were also generally consistent with primary results; remove data 
from Indian participants and the site terminated for GCP noncompliance did not change the 
conclusions. 
Likewise, the primary results are consistent with the analysis conducted in mITT1 and mITT2 
(respectively - 5.619% [95% CI: -7.207% to -4.031%; p<0.0001] and - 5.363% [95% CI: -6.884% 
to -3.842; p<0.0001]).  
These finding were also supported by the results in the secondary endpoint reduction in the number of 
COVID-19 related medical visits. While statistically significant, a limited effect was observed in the 
median time to sustained alleviation of all targeted signs/symptoms through day 28 and the median 
time to sustained resolution of all targeted signs/symptoms through day 28.  
Long-term data (i.e. at Week 34) are planned to be collected in the clinical study EPIC-HR but not yet 
available. The applicant has committed to provide the follow-up data as soon as available to ensure no 
further events onset which could potentially impact the main outcomes (REC).  
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 125/170 
 
 
 
A large proportion of participants started treatment beyond 3 days after COVID-19 onset (i.e. 38.6%) 
and are excluded of the mITT. If such proportion of patients failed to start the treatment within 3 days 
while clinical trials offer generally optimal conditions and follow-up, it is unlikely that the proportion will 
be better in clinical practice. Results in mITT1 may thus appear more appropriate for generalisation 
and more representative of the population of interest (notably encompassing patients treated within 5 
days since symptoms onset). This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Given above considerations regarding the population of interest, together with the much larger number 
of subjects available in mITT1 than in mITT, subgroup analyses are assessed with mITT1 outcomes. 
Overall, results were consistent in subgroup analyses for the risk factors mainly represented. It can be 
observed an absolute reduction of: 6.847% (95% CI: -9.823% to -3.871%; p<0.0001) in patients 
with a BMI >30 kg/m2, 10.614% (95% CI: -14.294% to -6.935%; p<0.0001) in patients with 
hypertension, 13.933% (95% CI: -20.066% to -7.800%; p<0.0001) in patients older than 65, and 
5.512% (95% CI: -10.510% to -0.515%; p=0.0306) in patients with diabetes mellitus. The absolute 
reduction, 3.045% (95% CI: -5.164% to -0.926%; p=0.0049) in patients who are cigarettes smoker, 
was smaller while statistically significant. 
In patients with positive serology status at baseline (55.6%), a limited, but statistically significant, 
absolute reduction of 1.337% (95% CI: -2.445% to -0.229%; p=0.0180) was observed. This makes it 
difficult to conclude on a relevant clinical efficacy. It has to be underlined that the number of events 
was low in the placebo group (8 hospitalisation and 1 death). As expected, the effect size is lower than 
the one observed in patients with seronegative status. However, given the lack of correlates of 
protection, the variable protection against circulating VOC, the fact that serostatus determination 
cannot be a prerequisite of treatment in a context of a pandemic and given the need to administer the 
antiviral treatment as early as possible, it is acknowledged that in practice those patients will be 
treated and some of them could retrieve a significant benefit. More broadly, the question therefore 
arises of the generalisability of the results to vaccinated patients with high risk for progression to 
severe COVID-19. The applicant noted that results of the study C4671002, in which vaccinated 
participants were enrolled, could provide supportive data. During the procedure, the applicant 
communicated on the failure to meet the primary endpoint of this study, preventing from formally 
interpreting the subgroup analyses. The applicant is committed to provide C4671002 study results as 
soon as available (REC). 
Additionally, the applicant did not want to limit the indication to participants who do not require 
supplemental oxygen. However, oxygen supplementation for COVID-19 was an exclusion criterion and 
only started after randomisation in case of patient’s need. Therefore, participants who required oxygen 
supplementation for COVID-19 were not randomised across groups and no conclusion can be drawn on 
the available data. Additionally, there is no reason to deviate from the harmonised wording to qualify 
the patients with non-severe type of COVID-19 i.e. not requiring O2. This was in fact the position 
adopted by the CHMP as part of the Article 5(3) procedure with the similar clinical study in support. 
The applicant adjusted the indication accordingly. 
Finally, upon submission of the CMAA, the applicant covered in the indication the use of Paxlovid in the 
adolescents, on the basis of extrapolation from adults PK based on PK simulation from PopPK model 
only including PK data from healthy subjects (N=20) and not PK data in patients. Therefore, the 
applicant withdrew this age group from the indication as a response to the major objection by the 
CHMP due the lack of appropriate PK/PD data in high risk adolescent patients.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data submitted are considered sufficient to support the use of Paxlovid for the treatment 
of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for 
progressing to severe COVID-19.  
While the clinical data are comprehensive, some further investigations are worth being undertaken, 
such as patients with seropositive status at baseline, the need to further elaborate in which extent 
participants with “cigarettes smoke” at baseline presented other comorbidities, further scrutiny through 
ongoing studies in immunocompromised patients (including chronic kidney disease, 
immunosuppression, cancer, or HIV infection) and the planned long-term data (i.e. at Week 34) from 
study C4671005. 
Clinical efficacy recommendations are covered in Annex I. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety data is primary based on the supportive final analysis (of the larger sample size than 
primary interim analysis) of the pivotal Study C4671005 (treatment in patients COVID-19 positive at 
High Risk, EPIC-HR) at the data cut-off date of 11 Dec 2021. Safety data from supportive Phase 1 
studies 1001, 1011, 1014 and 1015 were also submitted.  
As of the data cut-off (11 Dec 2021), 2246 (100.0%) participants were randomised into Study 1005, 
2224 participants were included in the safety analysis set and 2102 (93.6%) participants had 
completed the safety follow-up (Day 34). 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The duration of treatment in the safety analysis set was similar across the two treatment arms 
(median duration of treatment of 5.00 days in both arms). A total of 94.1% in PF-07321332/ritonavir 
arm and 93.1% in placebo had a treatment compliance with study intervention from ≥80% to ≤115% 
reflecting a high adherence to treatment.

C4671005) 
Study intervention compliance was assessed by site personnel by reviewing the electronic study

intervention returned by the participant at the study visits. Overall, treatment compliance with study 
intervention (≥80% to ≤115%) was 93.6% and adherence was similar for both PF-07321332/ritonavir 
and placebo treatment groups. The most frequently reported important protocol deviation related to 
investigational product was PF-07321332/placebo and ritonavir/placebo were taken > 5 minutes apart 
(9.5%) which was not expected to impact the safety profile. 
Overall demographic and baseline characteristics in the safety analysis set (SAS) were comparable 
between the two arms of study C4671005. The median age is 46.00 yrs (range 18.00 – 88.00) with a 
greater proportion of 18-44 (47.7%); subjects ≥65 years of age represented 12.9% of total safety 
database. The repartition of male and female is comparable (50.9% of male, 49.1% female). As 
described above, there was 36.8% of subjects with obesity (BMI ≥30) and 43% of subjects with 
overweight (BMI 25≤30). Patients with most reported comorbidities patients with hypertension 
(33.0%), with diabetes mellitus (12.2%), with chronic lung disease (4.5%) and with cardiovascular 
disease (4.1%). There was a significant proportion of cigarettes smokers which is disputable as being 
per se a risk factor unless associated with comorbidities. The other comorbidities defining the high risk 
of developing severe illness from COVID-19 were reported in <1% of SAS. The large majority of 
subjects in the SAS did not receive/not expected to receive COVID-19 mAb treatment (93.8%). 
Participants with known medical history of active liver disease or acute liver failure and participants 
receiving dialysis or have known moderate to severe renal impairment were excluded from the pivotal 
study C4671005; no safety data in these populations was gained in Study C4671005. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
• 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), All causalities 
The occurrence of TEAEs in PF-07321332/Ritonavir and placebo arms was comparable, i.e. 22.6% and 
23.9% respectively. Serious AEs were less reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm, 
i.e. 1.6% and 6.6% respectively. There were 3 additional deaths reported in the final report compared 
to the 45% interim analysis (none in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm and 13 in placebo arm). The majority 
of reported AEs in the study were low grade. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were also less reported in PF-
07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm, i.e. 4.1% and 8.3% respectively. No AE leading to study 
discontinuation occurred in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm and occurred at 1.2% subjects in placebo arm. 
AEs leading to drug discontinuation were more reported in placebo arm than PF-1332/ritonavir arm, 
4.2% and 2.1% respectively. There were no data on the AEs leading to treatment modifications.

Table 46. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) - DAIDS Grade - Safety 
Analysis Set (Protocol C4671005) 
All-causality TEAEs were most common (reported in ≥3% of participants in PF-07321332/ritonavir 
group) in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders (6.0% in PF-07321332/ritonavir and 4.8% in placebo), 
Infections and Infestations (2.1% in PF-07321332/ritonavir and 6.8% in placebo), Investigations 
(8.0% in PF-07321332/ritonavir and 9.3% in placebo), Nervous system disorders (7.2% in PF-
07321332/ritonavir and 2.3% in placebo), and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2.1% 
in PF-07321332/ritonavir and 3.0% in placebo). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥1%) were Dysgeusia 
(5.6%), Diarrhoea (3.1%), Fibrin D-dimer increased (1.9%), Alanine aminotransferase increased 
(1.5%), Creatinine renal clearance decreased (1.4%), Nausea (1.4%), Headache (1.4%) and Vomiting 
(1.1%).  
The reported TEAEs (≥0.5%) that occurred at a greater frequency in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group 
compared with the placebo group were Dysgeusia (5.6% vs 0.3%), Diarrhoea (3.1% vs 1.6%), 
Vomiting (1.1% vs 0.8%), Headache (1.4% vs 1.3%), Pyrexia (0.7% vs 0.6%), Myalgia (0.6% vs 
0.2%), Hypertension (0.6% vs 0.2%), Chills (0.5% vs 0), Dyspepsia (0.5% vs 0.4%); these TEAEs 
were mostly Grade 1-2. In PF-07321332/ritonavir arm, a total of 34 (3.1%) subjects experienced a 
Grade 3 AE and 11 (1.0%) had a Grade 4 events. The majority of the Grade 3-4 events were reported 
in the SOC Investigations (Creatinine renal clearance decreased, Fibrin D dimer increased) and 
Infections and infestations (COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, abscess, pyelonephritis chronic, 
sepsis/viral sepsis). 
• 
Treatment-related TEAEs  
Treatment-related TEAEs were highly reported in PF-1335/ritonavir arm compared to placebo, i.e. 
7.8% and 3.8% respectively. Despite the higher incidence of treatment-related TEAEs with PF-
1335/ritonavir, only 1 (0.1%) treatment-related TEAE was considered as serious and 5 (0.4%) were 
Grade ≥3.

Table 47. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Treatment Related) - DAIDS Grade - Safety 
Analysis Set (Protocol C4671005) 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥1%) 
were Dysgeusia (3.7%), and Diarrhoea (1.9%). 
Most of the TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs experienced by participants in both treatment groups 
were mild to moderate (Grade 1-2) in severity. No Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related AEs occurred with 
PF-07321332/ritonavir. There was 5 (0.4%) cases of Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir group: one case of palpitations (reported as serious AE, event resolved), two cases 
of ALAT increase, one case of ASAT increase, one case of dysgeusia and one case of rash maculo-
papular. In the placebo arm, one participant had a potentially life-threatening (Grade 4) event (Blood 
glucose increased) that was considered related to treatment and 4 patients experienced Grade 3 
treatment-related AEs (2 cases of nausea, one case of hepatic enzyme increased and one case of 
rash). No participant in either treatment group had an event of death related to an AE (Grade 5). 
Hypertension 
The proportion of hypertension events was higher in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm compared to placebo 
arm but reported at a low frequency (0.6% vs 0.25%). As regards this apparent imbalance, there was 
no case of hypertension considered as related to PF-07321332/ritonavir. Of the 7 cases of 
hypertension reported with PF-07321332/ritonavir, 6 were low grade (four Grade 1 events, two Grade 
2 events) and resolved. Nevertheless, although not considered related, one patient not treated for 
hypertension, has experienced a Grade 3 hypertension on Day 5 that did not resolve, see narrative 
below. 
A participant received study intervention from Days 1 to 3. The participant had the following risk 
factors: BMI >25 kg/m2, and history of Diabetes mellitus. He experienced 2 SAEs (Abscess [Grade 3] 
and Sepsis [Grade 4]) on Day 4. On Day 5, he had an event of Grade 3 Hypertension and Grade 3 
pneumonia. On Day 6, he experienced Grade 2 Insomnia. All of the events were assessed as not 
related to study intervention by the investigator. All events resolved except severe Hypertension and 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 130/170 
 
 
 
 
severe Pneumonia, which were reported as not recovered/not resolved. The participant was 
permanently discontinued from study intervention and did not complete the study due to withdrawal of 
consent on Day 11. 
It is outlined that hypertension events mostly occurred during the Paxlovid treatment schedule based 
on the listing of AEs within PF-07321332/ritonavir, i.e. 6 of the 7 patients experiencing hypertension 
had an event onset between Day 2 and Day 5 and one patient had hypertension at Day 25. Based on 
the provided listings of AEs and on risk factors, it is observed that the majority of patients experiencing 
hypertension with PF-07321332/ritonavir had no history of hypertension (4 of 7 patients). Taking into 
account these data and the known risk of hypertension with ritonavir at a upper dosage and a long-
term treatment duration (see section 4.8 of the SmPC of Ritonavir 100mg) making unclear the 
contributory effect of PF-07321332, it is considered necessary to further evaluate the risk of 
hypertension in the routine PV and follow-up questionnaires. Ongoing clinical studies notably study in 
standard risk population (C-4671002) of patients without having risk factor patients. Due to this 
sensitive issue in a population where hypertension is already a risk factor, the CHMP has asked the 
company to complete the preliminary safety review covering safety data from ongoing early access 
worldwide and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) and literature data with cut-off date 
31st March by April 2022 (LEG) awaiting for a global safety review planned to be made by the applicant 
on the 3 applicant’s sponsored clinical studies performed (EPIC-HR, EPIC-SR and study in PEP) planned 
to be provided in June 2022.  
Myalgia 
A similar apparent imbalance (0.6 vs 0.2% for Paxlovid vs Placebo respectively) was observed for 
myalgia events. Given the known risk of myalgia with ritonavir at a upper dosage and a long-term 
treatment duration (see section 4.8 of the SmPC of Ritonavir 100mg) the contributory effect of PF-
07321332 and more globally of Paxlovid 5 days treatment duration, the CHMP has also requested a 
safety review (REC).  
Hepatotoxicity 
Detailed narratives on all participants included in the safety population from the final analysis with 
hepatotoxicity in study 1005 were provided.  
Hepatotoxicity cases occurred at similar rate in both arms and were reported in 11 (1.0%) subjects in 
PF-07321332/ritonavir arm and 16 (1.4%) subjects in placebo arm. The majority of hepatotoxicity 
cases reported in the safety population were hepatic transaminase elevation > 5xULN. Indeed a risk of 
hepatotoxicity is associated with ritonavir and mentioned in the section 4.8 of the SmPC of Ritonavir 
100 mg, i.e. Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical 
hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals. Hepatotoxicity is addressed in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC of Paxlovid considering 
the known risk with ritonavir which is endorsed. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The proposed list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC is as follows: 
Table 48. adverse reactions with Paxlovid 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 131/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dysgeusia and diarrhoea were known risks with ritonavir mentioned in section 4.8 of SmPC of Ritonavir 
100 mg at very common frequency and based on the safety data in study 1005 their inclusion as ADR 
for Paxlovid is agreed. Vomiting and headache were listed as ADR in the proposed SmPC which is 
supported based on their frequencies, see all causality AEs section above.  
Adverse event of special interest (AESI) 
1) Hemodynamic events 
Vital signs measurements did not suggest clinically meaningful changes relative to hemodynamic 
events across treatment groups.  
Table 49. Summary of Treatment-Emergent Hemodynamic Adverse Events by Decreasing 
Frequency (All Causalities) - Safety Analysis Set (Protocol C4671005) 
2) Inflammatory events

No difference was observed in the incidence rates of AESI between the two treatment arms except the 
hypertension events for hemodynamic events reported at a greater frequency in PF-
07321332/ritonavir than placebo and Fibrin D dimer increased for the inflammatory events reported at

a greater frequency in placebo compared to PF-07321332/ritonavir (2.8% vs 1.9%) likely in relation to 
disease progression in the placebo arm. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
The overall incidence of participants with all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir treatment group (1.6%) compared with placebo (6.6%).

The most frequently reported treatment emergent SAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥2 
participants) were COVID-19 (2 participants, 0.3% [compared with 7 participants, 1% in the placebo 
group]), and COVID-19 pneumonia (4 participants, 0.6% [compared with 21 participants, 3.1% in the 
placebo group]). All of these SAEs were considered related to the disease under study.  
Regarded the non-COVID-19 related SAEs occurring with PF-07321332/ritonavir, it was reported one 
case of Chest discomfort, Dyspnoea, Palpitations (resolved at Day 5), one case of Facial paralysis 
(recovered with sequelae at Day 37), one case of Abscess, Sepsis (resolved at Day 9), one case of 
Haemoglobin decreased (resolved at Day 7) and one case of Creatinine renal clearance decreased (Low 
creatinine was a pre-existing condition that the participant was unaware of, SAE ongoing at the time of 
the last available report). 
Among the non-related COVID-19 SAEs reported, one case was considered as treatment related, see 
the narrative below. 
Participant experiencing SAEs of Chest discomfort, Dyspnoea, and Palpitations resulting in permanent 
discontinuation from study intervention: 
The participant received study intervention from Days 1 to 2. The participant had the following risk 
factors: BMI >25 kg/m2. 
The participant started experiencing COVID-19 signs and symptoms from Day -3 and had a confirmed 
positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 on the same day. Further on Day 2, the participant was 
hospitalised due to the SAEs of Grade 2 Chest discomfort, Grade 2 Dyspnoea, and Grade 3 
Palpitations. On the same day (Day 2), a chest X-ray showed left sinus infarction in lower lobe, which 
was related to COVID-19. The participant’s ECG was normal. The participant received oxygen therapy 
and was treated with enoxaparin, acetylsalicylic acid, famotidine, potassium phosphate and 
multivitamin supplement as prophylaxis. Study intervention was permanently discontinued on Day 2 in 
response to the events of Chest discomfort, Dyspnoea, and Palpitations. The events of Chest 
discomfort, Dyspnoea, Palpitations, and Pyrexia were reported as resolved on Day 5. 
In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the events of Chest 
discomfort, Dyspnoea, and Palpitations were related to the study intervention (ritonavir); there was 
not a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the study intervention (PF-07321332), 
concomitant drug or clinical trial procedure. 
There were no deaths in the PF-07321332 + Ritonavir arm according to the provided data on 
study 1005. A total of 13 deaths were reported in the placebo arm, all related to COVID-19 and 
respiratory event (hypoxia, acute respiratory distress/failure). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
The clinical safety laboratory tests were to be performed at baseline, Day 5 then Days 14 and 34 
required only if clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values were present from a sample drawn at the 
previous study visit. 
The overall incidence of laboratory test abnormalities occurring within 34 days of first dose was 
comparable between both treatment groups. No major haematological and clinical chemistry 
abnormalities were detected in both PF-07321332/ritonavir and placebo arms. The most frequently 
occurring laboratory test abnormalities (occurring in ≥5% participants in any treatment group) were 
fibrinogen (<0.75 x baseline; >1.25 x baseline), aPTT (>1.1 x ULN), D-Dimer (>1.5 x ULN), PT (>1.1 
x ULN), bicarbonate (<0.9 x LLN), thyrotropin (>1.2 x ULN), glucose (>1.5 x ULN), creatine kinase 
(>2.0 x ULN), and neutrophils (>1.2 x ULN). 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 135/170 
 
 
 
Elevations of hepatic transaminases >3xULN were reported at comparable rates in both PF-
07321332/ritonavir and placebo arms, i.e ASAT at 1.4% in each arm; ALAT at 3.6% and 4.2% 
respectively. 
Vital signs 
Baseline values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation (%), body 
temperature, and respiratory rate, were similar across both treatment groups, and there were no 
clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in the mean changes from baseline in vital 
signs assessments. 
The mean maximum change from baseline in vital signs were comparable for participants in 
the PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment group compared with the placebo group. 
The incidence of participants with diastolic blood >90 mmHg, pule rate >120 bpm or systolic 
blood pressure >140 mmHg was comparable across treatment groups. 
• 
• 
ECGs 
Overall, few (≤5%) participants in either treatment group had clinically significant findings in Study 
1005. Mean baseline values and mean changes from baseline were similar between treatment groups 
for all ECG parameters. 
The Study 1001 Part 5 aimed to evaluate QTc of PF-07321332/ritonavir at supratherapeutic dose. The 
upper bounds of 90% CI for ΔΔQTcF estimates across the entire concentration range 
(supratherapeutic, 2 x therapeutic exposure and therapeutic exposure) were all less than 10 ms 
suggesting no clinically relevant effect of PF-07321332/ritonavir on QTcF interval. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
At the time of the data cutoff in Study 1005 (final CSR), there was 2 reported pregnancy in the safety 
database. Both participants were in the placebo group and will continue to be followed for pregnancy 
outcomes. Please refer to nonclinical part.

• 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
The AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were more reported in placebo arm than PF-
07321332/ritonavir arm, i.e. 4.2% and 2.1% respectively. The most frequently reported AEs leading to 
discontinuation with PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment were Nausea (0.5%), Vomiting (0.4%) and 
Creatinine renal clearance decreased (0.3%).

•  AEs leading to study discontinuation 
No participant in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group discontinued the study due to TEAEs (all causalities) 
compared with 13 participants (1.2%) in the placebo group. 
2.6.8.8.  Supportive studies 
•  Study 1001 – Phase 1 study 
o  Part 1 – SAD (n=13): Out of 12 TEAEs, 7 were observed in placebo (alone or enhanced 
with ritonavir) treatment groups, and 5 were observed in the PF-07321332 500 mg, 
1500 mg and 250 mg/ritonavir treatment groups. The SOCs with participants reporting 
all-causality TEAEs across all treatment groups, including placebo, were Nervous 
system disorders (4 events; 2 placebo and 2 treated), Gastrointestinal disorders (3 
events; all placebo), General disorders and administration site conditions (2 events; 1 
placebo and 1 treated), Psychiatric disorders (2 events; 1 placebo and 1 treated) and 
Investigations (1 event; treated). None of the TEAEs in PART-1 were treatment-
related. No participant had an SAE, severe AE, or dose reduced or temporary 
discontinuation due to AEs. 
o  Part 2 – MAD (n=29): TEAEs were reported at similar rate across the 6 treatment arms 
in PART-2. The SOCs with the greatest number of participants reporting all-causality 
TEAEs were Gastrointestinal disorders (13 events; 1 placebo and 12 treated), followed 
by General disorder and administration site conditions (8 events; 2 placebo and 6 
treated), Nervous system disorders (6 events; all treated) and Investigations (5 
events; 2 placebo and 3 treated). The numbers of treatment-related TEAEs were also 
similar between the 6 treatment arms in PART-2. No participant had an SAE, severe 
AE, discontinuation from study due to AEs, or dose reduced or temporary 
discontinuation due to AEs in PART-2. 
o  Part 3 – RBA/FE (n=12): TEAEs were reported at similar rate in PF- 07321332 250 mg 
(suspension), fasted and PF- 07321332 250 mg (tablet), fasted group (3/12, 25.0% in 
each group) and in 1/12 (8.3%) subjects included in the PF- 07321332 250 mg 
(tablet), fed group. The SOCs with participants reporting all-causality or treatment-
related TEAEs were General disorders and administration site conditions (5 events, 1 
treatment-related), and Nervous system disorders (3 events, all treatment-related). Of 
note the case of Chest discomfort reported with PF- 07321332 was considered as 
treatment-related similarly to the SAE case reported in Study 1005. 
o  Part 4 – M&E (n=6): Only 1 all-causality TEAE (Nasopharyngitis) was reported in PART-
4. This AE was not treatment related. 
o  Part 5 – SE (n=10): The incidences of all-causality and treatment-related TEAEs were 
the same between the 2 groups, treated and placebo in PART-5. The most frequently 
reported SOC of TEAE was Gastrointestinal disorders (6 events, 2 treatment-related). 
•  Study 1011 (Renal impairment):  
A total of 35 participants were assigned to treatment and 34 of them were treated, 8 each in mild, 
moderate, and severe renal impairment group and 10 in healthy control group. There was an 
imbalance in AEs with a higher incidence of AEs in severe renal impairment compared to patients with 
normal renal function and mild/moderate renal impairment. All-causality AEs were reported by 2 
participants in the normal renal function group and by 1, 1 and 5 participants in the mild, moderate, 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 138/170 
 
 
 
and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. Most of the all-causality AEs (17 out of 22) were 
reported by participants in the severe renal impairment group. One participant in the severe renal 
impairment had 3 SAEs, including 1 severe SAE (Pulmonary oedema), and 2 moderate SAEs (1 Acute 
kidney injury, 1 Pneumonia), and all 3 were considered not treatment related. This participant 
discontinued study due to the SAE of Acute kidney injury. There were no deaths in this study. All-
causality AEs were most frequently reported under the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders, General 
disorders and administration site conditions, and Nervous system disorders. 
•  Study 1014 
All 12 participants took at least 1 dose of study intervention and were included in the safety analysis. 
In Period 1 (PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg as a single oral dose), 4 AEs were reported in 4 
(33.3%) participants, and 1 AE was considered treatment related. The TEAEs reported by PT were 
Vessel puncture site haematoma, Dysgeusia, Sciatica and Polyuria (1 participant each, 8.3%). All 4 
TEAEs were mild in severity. 
In Period 2 (Carbamazepine on a titration schedule for 15 days + PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 
mg as single dose at Day 14), 18 AEs were reported in 9 (75.0%) participants, and 8 AEs reported in 6 
(50%) participants were considered treatment related. One participant discontinued from study due to 
treatment related AE. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by PT, regardless of SOC, were 
Transaminases increased (5 participants, 41.7%). The majority of the TEAEs (17/18) were mild in 
severity. There was 1 moderate TEAE of Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion 
(Hyponatremia/SIADH) leading to study discontinuation and considered treatment-related. 
•  Study 1015 
Twelve participants received at least 1 study treatment and were thus included in the safety analysis.  
All-causality 26 and 48 AEs were reported by 7 and 10 participants in Periods 1 and 2, respectively. 
None of the AEs were considered serious or severe by the investigator. No participants discontinued 
from the study or study treatment or had dose reductions due to AEs. Among the all-causality TEAEs, 
24 out of 26 AEs in Period 1 and 43 out of 48 AEs in Period 2 were considered treatment related. 
In Period 1, 1 participant reported Vomiting and Headache (both related to study treatment); 1 
participant reported Dizziness (not related to study treatment) and Headache (related to study 
treatment). 
In Period 2, 1 participant reported Constipation (related to study treatment); and 1 participant 
reported Anorectal discomfort, Constipation, Diarrhoea, and Gastrointestinal motility disorder (all 
related to study treatment). 
One participant experienced the event of Atrioventricular block first degree on Study Day 3 in Period 1, 
which continued through Period 2. The event resolved on Study Day 13.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data provided by the applicant is primarily based on the final analysis of the pivotal study 
C4671005/EPIC-HR at the data cut-off date of 11 Dec 2021. The treatment was intended at the 
posology of PF-07321332 300mg and ritonavir 100mg every 12h for 5 days. As of the data cut-off, 
2246 (100.0%) participants were randomised into study C4671005, 2224 participants were included in 
the safety analysis set and 2102 (93.6%) participants had completed the safety follow-up (Day 34). 
Overall demographic and baseline characteristics in the safety analysis set (SAS) were comparable 
between the two arms. Participants with known medical history of active liver disease or acute liver 
failure, and participants receiving dialysis or have known moderate to severe renal impairment were 
excluded from the pivotal study C4671005; thus, no safety data in these populations was generated. 
The duration of treatment in the safety analysis set was similar across the two treatment arms 
(median duration of treatment of 5.00 days in both arms). A total of 94.1% in PF-07321332/ritonavir 
arm and 93.1% in placebo had treatment compliance with study intervention from ≥80% to ≤115% 
reflecting a high adherence to treatment. 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in PF-07321332/ritonavir compared to placebo, i.e. 22.6% 
and 23.9% respectively. It should be noted that the majority of the adverse events occurring in the 
study may be confounded with COVID-19 symptoms. The majority of reported AEs in the study were 
low grade. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were less reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm, i.e. 
4.1% and 8.3% respectively. In PF-07321332/ritonavir arm, a total of 34 (3.1%) subjects experienced 
a Grade 3 AE and 11 (1.0%) had a Grade 4 events. The majority of the Grade 3-4 events were 
reported in the SOCs Investigations (Creatinine renal clearance decreased, Fibrin D dimer increased) 
and Infections and infestations (COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, abscess, pyelonephritis chronic, 
sepsis/viral sepsis). Treatment-related TEAEs were however more reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir 
arm compared to placebo, i.e. 7.8% and 3.8% respectively. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥1%) were Dysgeusia 
(5.6%), Diarrhoea (3.1%), Fibrin D-dimer increased (1.9%), Alanine aminotransferase increased 
(1.5%), Creatinine renal clearance decreased (1.4%), Nausea (1.4%), Headache (1.4%) and Vomiting 
(1.1%). Dysgeusia and Diarrhoea were the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the 
PF-07321332/ritonavir group (3.7% and 1.9% respectively). The reported TEAEs (≥0.5%) that 
occurred at a greater frequency in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group compared with the placebo group 
were Dysgeusia (5.6% vs 0.3%), Diarrhoea (3.1% vs 1.6%), Vomiting (1.1% vs 0.8%), Headache 
(1.4% vs 1.3%), Pyrexia (0.7% vs 0.6%), Myalgia (0.6% vs 0.2%), Hypertension (0.6% vs 0.2%), 
Chills (0.5% vs 0), Dyspepsia (0.5% vs 0.4%); these TEAEs were mostly Grade 1-2. There was 5 
(0.4%) cases of Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group: one case of 
palpitations (reported as serious AE, event resolved), two cases of ALAT increase, one case of ASAT 
increase, one case of dysgeusia and one case of rash maculo-papular. 
Hypertension occurred at a low frequency overall but with an apparent imbalance (0.6% and 0.2%, in 
the PF 07321332/ritonavir and placebo group, respectively). There was no case of hypertension 
considered as related to PF-07321332/ritonavir. Of the 7 cases of hypertension reported with PF-
07321332/ritonavir, 6 were low grade (four Grade 1 events, two Grade 2 events) and resolved. 
Although not considered related, one patient, not treated for hypertension, experienced a Grade 3 
hypertension on Day 5 that did not resolve. It is noted that hypertension events mostly occurred 
during the Paxlovid treatment schedule based on the listing of AEs within PF-07321332/ritonavir, i.e. 6 
of the 7 patients experiencing hypertension had an event onset between Day 2 and Day 5 and one 
patient had hypertension at Day 25. Based on the provided listings of AEs and on risk factors, it is 
observed that the majority of patients experiencing hypertension with PF-07321332/ritonavir had no 
Assessment report

history of hypertension (4 of 7 patients). Narratives of the hypertension cases occurring in PF-
07321332/ritonavir were provided. Based on these observations and due to the limited number of 
cases, a causality with Paxlovid cannot be concluded at this stage. Additionally, the possible 
contributory effect of DDI with ritonavir cannot be excluded for the serious case of hypertensive crisis. 
Due to this sensitive issue in a population where hypertension is already a risk factor, the CHMP has 
asked the company to complete the preliminary safety review covering safety data from ongoing early 
access worldwide and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) and literature data with cut-off 
date 31st March by April 2022, awaiting for a global safety review planned to be made by the applicant 
on the 3 applicant’s sponsored clinical studies performed (EPIC-HR, EPIC-SR and study in PEP) planned 
to be provided in June 2022 (LEG). Additionally, this issue will be further followed-up through routine 
PV and follow-up questionnaires, together with the review of the upcoming safety data. The CHMP has 
considered that it would be premature to conclude on causality, therefore it is not reflected in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
There was also an apparent imbalance for myalgia, more reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm than 
the placebo arm (7 [0.6%] vs 2 [0.2%]). The narratives for all the myalgia cases occurring in the PF-
07321332/ritonavir arm were provided. Two cases were considered related to treatment and four were 
considered due to COVID-19. The limited number preclude any conclusion on a correlation between 
myalgia and Paxlovid at this stage. Ongoing studies are expected to provide more data regarding this 
issue. Taking into account the imbalance of myalgia events across the treatment arms, the two PF-
07321332/ritonavir related cases of myalgia reported in study C4671005 and the known risk of 
myalgia with ritonavir (when used for the treatment of HIV infection at a higher dosage and for a long-
term treatment duration), it was agreed to further evaluate the issue of myalgia through routine PV 
and to review the upcoming requested safety data as part of Post Authorisation Measure based on 
early access worldwide and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) and literature data with 
cut-off date 31st March by April 2022, awaiting for a global safety review planned to be made by the 
applicant on the 3 applicant’s sponsored clinical studies performed (EPIC-HR, EPIC-SR and study in 
PEP) planned to be provided in June 2022 (REC).  
There were pre-specified adverse event of special interest (AESI) including hemodynamic events, 
inflammatory events, and thyroid-related events. No difference was observed on the incidence rates of 
AESI between the two treatment arms except the hypertension events for hemodynamic events, which 
were reported at a greater frequency in PF-07321332/ritonavir than placebo and Fibrin D dimer 
increased for the inflammatory events reported at a greater frequency in placebo compared to PF-
07321332/ritonavir (2.8% vs 1.9%). 
Serious AEs were less reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm, i.e. 1.6% and 6.6% 
respectively. The SAEs were mostly related to COVID-19. The most frequently reported SAEs with PF-
07321332/ritonavir were COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19, and creatinine renal clearance decreased 
and occurred less frequently compared to placebo group (0.5% vs 3.3%, 0.2% vs 0.7% and 0.2% vs 
0.3% respectively). Among the non-related COVID-19 SAEs reported, one case of chest discomfort, 
dyspnoea and palpitations was considered by the investigator as reasonably possible to be related to 
the treatment. The treatment was permanently discontinued on Day 2 and the events were reported as 
resolved on Day 5. The SAEs occurring with PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment were manageable. The 
majority of the reported SAEs with PF-07321332/ritonavir were considered as resolved/recovered and 
2 cases were ongoing at the time of the report (creatinine renal clearance decreased and oxygen 
saturation decreased).  
No death occurred in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group while a total of 13 deaths (12 in the 28-day 
period and 1 in the safety follow-up period) were reported in the placebo arm, all related to COVID-19. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022

The overall incidence of laboratory test abnormalities occurring within 34 days of first dose was 
comparable between both treatment groups. No major haematological and clinical chemistry 
abnormalities were detected in both PF-07321332/ritonavir and placebo arms. 
No in-depth QT study was performed. Based on ECG data collected, the applicant did not identify any 
clinically relevant difference between treatment groups. In addition, the study 1001 Part 5 aimed to 
evaluate QTc of PF-07321332/ritonavir at supratherapeutic dose and the ΔΔQTcF estimates suggested 
no clinically relevant effect of PF-07321332/ritonavir on QTcF interval. 
In light of the nonclinical findings, it is appropriate that Paxlovid is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
No summary of AEs by age group was provided by the applicant. Data on safety profile of PF-
07321332/ritonavir with regard to children ≥12 to <18 years of age included initially in the claimed 
indication was lacking. Additionally, data was also missing in patients with severe renal impairment, 
with severe hepatic impairment and in pregnant women and WOBPC. These issues are addressed as 
safety concerns in the RMP (missing information).  
The AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were more reported in placebo arm than PF-
07321332/ritonavir arm, i.e. 4.2% and 2.1% respectively. The most frequently reported AEs leading to 
discontinuation with PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment were Nausea (0.5%), Vomiting (0.4%) and 
Creatinine renal clearance decreased (0.3%). There was no study discontinuation due to AE with PF-
07321332/ritonavir and 13 in placebo arm (subjects who died). 
No notable safety signal was detected with PF- 07321332/ritonavir in the supportive studies except 
study 1011. An imbalance in AEs was observed in study 1011 (renal impairment) with a higher 
incidence of AEs in severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function and 
mild/moderate renal impairment, which can be expected in view of the significant over-exposure 
observed in this study (approx. 90% in patients with moderate impairment and approx. 200% in 
patients with severe impairment). 5 of the 8 patients with severe renal impairment (RI) reported an 
AE, of which one participant who had 3 SAEs and discontinued study due to a SAE of Acute kidney 
injury that may be related to the severe renal impairment condition. Two participants in the normal 
renal function, one participant in mild renal impairment and one participant in moderate renal 
impairment groups experienced an AE. As expected, in view of the large increase of PK exposure in 
patients with severe renal impairment (+204%), an increase of AEs is observed in those patients.  
One case of Atrioventricular block was reported with PF-07321332/ritonavir in study 1015 and one 
case of Chest discomfort was reported with PF- 07321332 in study 1001 and considered as treatment-
related. Taking into account the SAE of Palpitations, Chest discomfort and dyspnoea that occurred with 
Paxlovid in Study 1005, a risk of cardiovascular events cannot be ruled out but the limited cases 
reported prevent any conclusion at this stage. 
Two clinical studies sponsored by the applicant are still on-going that will provide additional 
information regarding the safety profile and possible rare adverse reactions of Paxlovid. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the provided safety data, no major concern was identified in the safety profile of Paxlovid. 
The most frequent adverse reactions were dysgeusia, diarrhoea, vomiting and headache which are 
described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The safety profile is expected to be further substantiated with 
the on-going studies in treatment of patients with standard risk of COVID-19 and post exposure 
prophylaxis. Given that in these two studies patients are less likely to have comorbidities, the causality 
assessment might be facilitated.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the clinical issues: 
a)  A safety review for hypertension covering safety data from ongoing early access worldwide 
and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) and literature data with cut-off date 
31st March should be provided by April 2022, awaiting for a global safety review planned 
to be submitted  covering the 3 applicant’s sponsored clinical studies (EPIC-HR, EPIC-SR 
and study in PEP) in June 2022. 
Risk of medication errors related to the co-packaged blister (including in relation to the dose 
adjustment in patients with moderate renal impairment), the handling of the numerous drug drug 
interactions by healthcare professionals in the outpatient setting less familiar than infectious diseases 
specialists at hospital used to handle the ritonavir driven interactions in the field of HIV infection, will 
be a source of particular scrutiny in post-marketing safety data as part of routine pharmacovigilance. 
Clinical safety recommendations and legally binding measures are covered in Annex I. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
2.7.1.  Safety concerns 
The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns:  
Table 53. Summary of safety concerns 
Important identified risks  None 
Important potential risks  None 
Missing information 
Safety in patients with hepatic impairment  
Safety in patients with renal impairment 
Safety during use in pregnancy and lactation 
Risks considered important for the inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
Missing information  
Safety in patients with hepatic impairment: Since participants with known medical history of active 
liver disease or acute liver failure were excluded from the pivotal study C467-1005 (EPIC-HR), safety 
in patients with hepatic impairment should be considered as missing information. Of note in the PK 
study in patients with hepatic impairment, the category of patients with severe hepatic impairment was 
not covered. In moderate hepatic impairment, the PK data did not significantly differ from the control.  
Safety in patients with renal impairment: There is a lack of data in the moderate to severe renal 
impairment population in study C467-1005 since this population was excluded. The results of the 
completed PK study C4671011 showed a PF-07321332 systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) increase 
with a magnitude depending on the severity of the renal impairment: in severe renal impairment, 
increase of AUC by 204% leading the CHMP to propose a contraindication in this sub-population at the 
time of Art 5(3) prior procedure and a dose reduction by one-half is proposed in population with 
moderate renal impairment. However, efficacy and safety data of Paxlovid at this reduced posology is 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 143/170 
 
 
 
 
 
lacking. In addition, a higher incidence of AEs in severe renal impairment compared to patients with 
normal renal function and mild/moderate renal impairment was observed in study C4671011. It is 
therefore considered that the safety profile of PF-07321332/ritonavir in this population cannot be 
established yet and that the use in patients with renal impairment should be added as missing 
information. As per the routine risk minimisation measures, it has been considered that the inclusion in 
the SmPC of a  warning and precaution for use of  PF-07321332/ritonavir was more appropriate than a 
formal contra-indication, given that there is a lack of data to inform on a posology, rather than 
evidence of harm.  
Safety during use in pregnancy and lactation: Considering that the current epidemiology data raise 
concerns on the SARS-CoV-2 infection for both the pregnant women and their newborns, the loss of 
foetal weight observed as part of the Paxlovid non-clinical findings and that clinical experience of 
Paxlovid is currently  missing  in pregnant women, it is agreed that safety during use in pregnancy and 
lactation is included as missing information.  
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
Hypertension: based  on the final analysis of the pivotal Study C467-1005/EPIC-HR (cut-off date of 11 
Dec 2021), hypertension occurred at a low frequency overall (0.6% and 0.2%, in the PF- 
07321332/ritonavir and placebo group, respectively) but was more frequent in the PF- 
07321332/ritonavir group. Most of events were low grade and none was considered treatment-related 
in the PF- 07321332/ritonavir group. Nevertheless, considering that the hypertension events mostly 
occurred with a short time to onset, the majority of patients experiencing hypertension had no history 
of hypertension and that hypertension is a known risk with ritonavir, it remains uncertain the causality 
of hypertension with Paxlovid.  
This risk will be further evaluated through routine pharmacovigilance and relevant updates should be 
provided within the upcoming PSUR. A targeted follow-up questionnaire is to be implemented.  
Myalgia: based  on the final analysis of the pivotal Study C467-1005/EPIC-HR (cut-off date of 11 Dec 
2021), myalgia was reported at a low frequency (0.6% and 0.2%, in the PF- 07321332/ritonavir and 
placebo group, respectively) but was more frequent in the PF- 07321332/ritonavir group. Since two of 
the seven cases reported with PF- 07321332/ritonavir were considered treatment-related and 
considering myalgia is a known risk of ritonavir, it remained questionable whether there is a causal 
relationship between myalgia and PF-07321332/ritonavir. Myalgia will be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance, including PSUR. 
The applicant clarified that hypertension is monitored as an event of special interest (under 
‘hemodynamic events’) in the ongoing development programme and both events are evaluated during 
safety reviews of interval and cumulative data from the clinical studies.  Hypertension and myalgia will 
be reviewed via routine pharmacovigilance activities. Furthermore, the applicant will provide a 
cumulative safety review of all available data on hypertension and myalgia from available sources, 
including spontaneous data, compassionate use and literature (cut off-date 31sth March) by 30th April 
2022 awaiting for a global safety review planned to be made by the applicant on the 3 applicant’s 
sponsored clinical studies performed (EPIC-HR, EPIC-SR and study in PEP) planned to be provided in 
June 2022.   
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) (with CYP3A substrates and CYP3A inducers): Paxlovid contains ritonavir, 
a well-known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A (and PgP inhibitor), which may interact with other 
medicines leading to clinically significant reactions, including potentially life-threatening or fatal 
reactions, loss of therapeutic effect of Paxlovid and possible development of viral resistance. The 
applicant will closely monitor cases potentially indicative of drug-drug interactions via routine 
pharmacovigilance and present relevant data within the upcoming PSURs.   
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 144/170 
 
 
 
The applicant considers that  the list of contraindicated medicinal products in Section 4.3, in addition to 
the comprehensive list of drug interactions included in Section 4.5 are sufficient to mitigate the risk of 
drug interactions by appropriately informing prescribers of the potential medicinal products which may 
interact with Paxlovid. In addition, the applicant included a QR code and website link on the PL and 
outer carton, which link to the MAH product website (COVID19oralRx.com) that includes a drug 
interaction tool. This tool will provide another mechanism to communicate the drug interactions listed 
in the SmPC.  
Furthermore, an additional communication regarding this DDI is proposed by the EMA and will be 
circulated to all relevant professional societies on the day of the CHMP opinion, which is the same day 
that the product information is published on EMA website.  
2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection: the applicant will implement the following:  
• 
Pregnancy follow-up questionnaires (Exposure During Pregnancy Follow-up Questionnaire for 
non-study cases and Exposure During Pregnancy Supplemental Form for study cases) are also 
utilised to collect further data on pregnancy outcome and reproductive and developmental 
toxicity. 
•  A Data Capture Aid has been created to gather data about the safety during use in lactation.  
• 
Two further DCAs, for lack of efficacy (including fields to request information on the COVID-19 
variant) and for hypertension are provided. 
Monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants: 
As part of the enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants from all available data sources, will 
include (not limited to): 
•  Spontaneous cases (using a targeted follow-up questionnaire for lack of efficacy as stated 
above) 
•  Clinical trial data  
• 
Literature  
•  Studies conducted by public health authorities 
If the review of the data leads to an impact on the benefit risk of the product, a benefit-risk discussion 
and any warranted product information updates will be submitted within 1 month from assessment via 
appropriate variation procedure. Additionally, the interval and cumulative data will be summarised in a 
dedicated section in the PSUR. 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant proposes the following 5 studies to further evaluate safety and to address missing 
information in the post marketing setting.  
The following table outlines proposed additional pharmacovigilance activities in RMP version 1.2.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 31.12.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons 
for the approval of the conditional marketing authorisation under emergency use.  
The applicant has endeavoured to ensure that the package leaflet is comprehensive and supports 
patient adherence and understanding, especially for patients that may have limited direct access to 
healthcare professionals. Further adjustments have been made to the language in the PIL to support 
this. 
The applicant commits to complete user testing and provide it as soon as possible. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 therapeutics (EMA/35618/2021, from 12 
March 2021) document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID-19 therapeutics’ 
developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to 
facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-19 therapeutics for EU citizens within the 
existing legal framework. 
Considering the self-administration context and the need for the information to be readily available and 
understood by the users in their national language, The QRD Group agreed to a maximum of 2 months 
length of deviation for all of the below requests, in particular: 
a)  Agreed to market an outer and immediate packaging in English only for all EU markets for a 
maximum period of 2 months following the EC decision; 
b)  An English only Package Leaflet was not agreed. The applicant shall liaise with the respective 
national competent authorities (NCAs) and discuss the provision of a paper PL alongside the 
pack in the national language(s). As noted above this has to be seen in the context of self-
administration. It is crucial that the user has from the start the information in their national 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022

language. 
c)  Agreed to provide national translations of the package leaflet via a Quick Response (QR) 
code, but as a supplement to the paper package leaflet, as indicated above. 
d)  Agreed to use one Global GTIN within the unique identifier for all EU markets; 
e)  Agreed to omit the NHRN (national code) to be encoded in the Datamatrix for some 
countries; 
f)  Agreed to omit the Blue Box information and to provide it via a QR code instead; 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling for the purpose of ensuring easy access to the most 
recent versions of the product information to patients and HCPs has been submitted by the applicant 
and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
Based on whether they select the patient or the HCP area, the user will be sent through to the most 
appropriate local website which will provide them with the following: 
a)  The most up to date ‘Package Leaflet; Information for the Patient’ (formatted as a PDF) 
b)  The most up to date Summary of Product Characteristics (formatted as a PDF) 
c)  Information about how to ensure that the HCP has obtained an authentic version of the 
medicine, manufactured by Pfizer.  
In addition, a so-called “Drug Interaction Finder.” will be included which will replicate the two drug 
interactions tables (‘Contraindicated for concomitant use’ and ‘Potentially significant interactions with 
other medicinal products’) in a searchable format. This would support patient safety by allowing HCPs 
to more easily identify a medicine which may interact with PF-07321332 and ritonavir. 
2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Paxlovid ((1R,2S,5S)-N-((1S)-1-Cyano-2-
((3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)ethyl)-3-((2S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido) butanoyl)-6,6-
dimethyl-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide /ritonavir) is included in the additional monitoring 
list as it contains a new active substance and the product is approved under a conditional marketing 
authorisation..  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 manifests as a wide range of illness, from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, 
ARDS, and death. Although approximately 80% cases are asymptomatic or mild, patients who are 
hospitalised with COVID-19 may have significant morbidity and mortality, and are at increased risk of 
developing complications such as severe inflammation associated with elevations in proinflammatory 
cytokines, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, thromboembolic events, hypercoagulability, and/or kidney 
injury. Moreover, other comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, as well as older age 
increase the risk for worse outcomes. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The therapeutic armamentarium is limited for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are at increased 
risk of progression to severe disease and not O2 requiring, as targeted in the C4671005 patients. 
While some anti-spike monoclonal antibodies have been a valuable tool, the emerging VOC with 
mutations in the spike protein are constantly threatening their activity. Currently, sotrovimab is almost 
the unique mAb that maintains activity against the currently circulating omicron variant. 
Remdesivir is also indicated for the same patient population as Paxlovid. However, remdesivir is only 
available via intravenous administration. There is a need to have an oral antiviral effective against 
COVID-19 disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development is based on the single pivotal phase 2/3 C4671005/EPIC-HR study conducted 
in non-hospitalised, symptomatic adult patients with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of 
progressing to severe illnesses. It was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, in a 1:1 ratio and 
conducted in a superiority setting. 
Eligible patients have received PF-07321332 plus ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses 
total). The total study duration is up to 24 weeks, study intervention through Day 5 or Day 6, efficacy 
assessments through Day 28, a safety follow-up period through Day 34. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The determination of primary efficacy was based on a planned interim analysis of 774 subjects in mITT 
population. The estimated risk reduction was -6.3% with unadjusted 95% CI of (9.0%, 3.6%) and a 
95% CI of (-10.61%, -2.02%) when adjusting for multiplicity. The 2-sided p-value was < 0.0001 with 
2-sided significance level of 0.002. 
In the supporting final analysis, the primary endpoint of the study was met with a 5.807% (95% CI: -
7.777% to - 3.837%; p<0.0001) absolute reduction in proportion of COVID-19-related hospitalisation 
or death from any cause at Day 28, reducing the primary endpoint event rate from 6.531% to 0.723% 
at Day-28, with PF-07321332/ritonavir in comparison with placebo treatment, in patients who did not 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 151/170 
 
 
 
receive or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment and were treated ≤3 days 
after COVID-19 symptom onset (mITT). No patient died in the Paxlovid treatment group whereas 9 
deaths occurred in the placebo group. Sensitivity analyses were also generally consistent with the 
primary results. 
Similar benefit was observed in the mITT1 population of analysis with an absolute reduction of 5.619% 
(95% CI: -7.207% to -4.031%; p<0.0001). mITT1 includes patients treated within 5 days since 
symptoms onset in line with the posology recommendation. Again, no patients died in the Paxlovid 
treatment group whereas 12 deaths occurred in the placebo group. 
In line with the study period, the primary variant across both treatment arms was Delta (98.53%) and 
was distributed in high prevalence as subvariants Delta/21J (74.15%). As the vast majority of the 
participants were infected with the Delta variant, the clinical efficacy of Paxlovid is only demonstrated 
in this VOC. However, in vitro data are supportive of activity of Paxlovid against other major VOCs 
including the currently circulating omicron variant. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The identified quality issues concerning the active substance PF-07321332 manufacture and finished 
product control strategy, to be addressed through fulfilment of specific obligations, pose some 
uncertainties with regard to the batch to batch consistency between the product batches studied in 
pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical development, and future commercial batches. 
A high rate of patients with positive serological status at baseline was observed, which needs to be 
better understood. According to the applicant, serology testing at baseline did not discriminate 
between IgG or IgM. This did not allow to differentiate whether the positive status was due to 
unawareness of prior (potentially asymptomatic) SARS-CoV-2 infection or to immune response related 
to the current COVID-19 episode (at the time of the enrolment). The applicant indicated that 
exploratory testing is planned to further characterise the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline 
and over time. 
As rather expected, a much more limited effect could be observed in patients with positive serology 
status at baseline. Therefore, uncertainties remain on the magnitude of the benefit in this 
subpopulation. More broadly, the question therefore arises of the generalisability of the results to 
vaccinated patients with increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19. The benefit of the 
treatment in the vaccinated subpopulation needs to be further substantiated.  
Patients with immunodeficiency were poorly represented with less than 1% of the study population. 
There are concerns on the maintenance of the benefit in patients with immunodeficiency for which a 
prolonged period of viral shedding could occur. This could lead to potential risk of treatment failure and 
emergence of resistance with the recommended 5 days treatment duration. The applicant will have to 
particularly monitor treatment failure in this subset of patients in post-approval. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in PF-07321332/ritonavir compared to placebo, i.e. 22.6% 
and 23.9% respectively. The majority of reported AEs in the study were low grade and non-serious, 
and no death occurred with PF-07321332/ritonavir. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were also less reported in PF-
07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm (4.1% vs 8.3%). The most frequently reported TEAEs in the 
PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥1%) were Dysgeusia (5.6%), Diarrhoea (3.1%), Fibrin D-dimer 
increased (1.9%), Alanine aminotransferase increased (1.5%), Creatinine renal clearance decreased 
(1.4%), Nausea (1.4%), Headache (1.4%) and Vomiting (1.1%). The reported TEAEs (≥0.5%) that 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 152/170 
 
 
 
occurred at a greater frequency in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group compared with the placebo group 
were Dysgeusia, Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Headache, Pyrexia, Myalgia, Hypertension, Chills, Dyspepsia. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the PF-07321332/ritonavir group (≥1%) 
were Dysgeusia (3.7%), and Diarrhoea (1.9%).   
Serious AEs were less reported in PF-07321332/ritonavir arm than placebo arm (1.6% vs 6.6%). The 
most frequently reported SAEs with PF-07321332/ritonavir were COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19, and 
Creatinine renal clearance decreased. Among the non-related COVID-19 SAEs reported, one case of 
Chest discomfort, dyspnoea and palpitations was considered by the investigator as reasonably possible 
to be related to the treatment (ritonavir). The majority of the reported SAEs with PF-
07321332/ritonavir were considered as resolved/recovered and 2 cases were ongoing at the time of 
the report (creatinine renal clearance decreased and oxygen saturation decreased).  
Finally, the complexity of the interaction profile driven by the ritonavir booster dose co-packaged with 
the antiviral PF-07321332 in Paxlovid is of importance, all the more for outpatients population, having 
in mind that general practitioners might be less familiar with the handling DDI derived from ritonavir 
than healthcare professionals at hospital in the field of HIV infection. Nevertheless, it can also be 
acknowledged that the short 5 days treatment duration could mitigate the burden. 
At this stage the CHMP has adopted to apply the list of DDI in the SmPC of ritonavir into that of 
Paxlovid as indicated in the SmPC as a conservative measure. In order to highlight and mitigate this 
issue, the CHMP has addressed a letter to several Healthcare professionals’ organisations to raise 
awareness about the DDI with Paxlovid.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are uncertainties on the impact of hepatic impairment on the safety profile of Paxlovid. 
Participants with known medical history of active liver disease or acute liver failure were excluded from 
the pivotal study C4671005 (EPIC-HR). In the PK study in patients with hepatic impairment, the 
interim analysis data in moderate HI did not significantly differ from the control, nevertheless the 
category of patients with severe HI was not covered. 
In addition, the safety profile of PF-07321332/ritonavir in patients with moderate and severe renal 
impairment cannot be established yet. There is a lack of data in the moderate to severe renal 
impairment population in study C4671005 (exclusion of this population) and the results of the 
completed Phase 1 study C4671011 showed a PF-07321332 systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) 
increase with a magnitude depending on the severity of the renal impairment and a higher proportion 
of AEs in the severe renal impairment compared to the other groups.  
In severe renal impairment, there was an increase of AUC by 204%. No recommendation in terms of 
dose adjustment could be elaborated at this stage. 
For both patients with severe renal impairment and severe hepatic impairment, given that there is a 
lack of data to inform on a posology, rather than evidence of harm, an explicit warning has been 
introduced in the SmPC at this stage pending dedicated investigations (notably through an updated 
PopPK model). 
In moderate renal impairment, a dose reduction by one-half of PF-07321332 has been proposed by the 
company but was not tested in clinic. The adequacy of this dose adjustment in patients and the risk of 
medical errors will be particularly scrutinised in post approval.  
Hypertension occurred at a low frequency overall but with an apparent imbalance (0.6% and 0.2%, in 
the PF- 07321332/ritonavir and placebo group, respectively). Most of events were low grade and none 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 153/170 
 
 
 
was considered treatment-related in the PF- 07321332/ritonavir group. Nevertheless considering that 
the hypertension events mostly occurred with a short time to onset (mainly between Day 2 and Day 
5), the majority of patients experiencing hypertension had no history of hypertension (4 of 7 patients) 
and that hypertension is a known risk with ritonavir, it remains uncertain whether there is a causal 
relationship between of hypertension with Paxlovid. Given this sensitive issue in a population where 
hypertension is already a risk factor, the CHMP requested a safety review for hypertension covering 
safety data from ongoing early access worldwide and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) 
and literature data with cut-off date 31st March 2022, by April 2022 followed by the integrated safety 
report with its three sponsored studies (C4671005/EPIC-HR, C4671002/EPIC-SR and C467PEP) in June 
2022. 
Myalgia occurred at a low frequency with also an apparent imbalance (0.6% and 0.2%, in the PF- 
07321332/ritonavir and placebo group, respectively). Since two cases of the 7 reported with PF- 
07321332/ritonavir were considered treatment-related and considering myalgia is a known risk of 
ritonavir, again it remains uncertain whether there is a causal relationship between myalgia and 
Paxlovid. A safety review for myalgia was also requested covering safety data from ongoing early 
access worldwide and notably from US (Emergency Use Authorisation) and literature data with cut-off 
date 31st March 2022, by April 2022 followed by the integrated safety report with its three sponsored 
studies (C4671005/EPIC-HR, C4671002/EPIC-SR and C467PEP) in June 2022.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The identified quality issues discussed in this report and to be addressed through fulfilment of specific 
obligations, raise some uncertainties with regard to the batch to batch consistency between the 
product batches studied in pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical development and future commercial 
batches. However, the submitted data indicate that batches to date are of appropriate quality that is 
comparable to that of clinical development batches. Considering the emergency context of this 
application the above identified quality issues do not preclude granting of a CMA. However, in order to 
confirm that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of 
clinical development batches over the life cycle of the medicinal product, these issues are expected to 
be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations, within the defined due dates. 
The primary endpoint of the study, proportion of COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death from any 
cause at Day 28, was met with consistency and further supported by the results of sensitivity analyses 
and in the first secondary analysis in mITT1, while, based on the provided safety data, no major 
concern was identified in the safety profile of PF-07321332/ritonavir combination, which appears 
comparable to placebo at the intended dosage of 300mg/100mg Q12h for 5 days. However, the 
complexity of the interaction profile driven by the ritonavir booster dose could be a limiting factor for 
its use. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The submitted quality data is currently not fully comprehensive, but this is considered acceptable in 
the emergency context and the quality package will be completed though fulfilment of specific 
obligations by defined due dates. 
Overall, there is a clinical benefit of Paxlovid by reducing the risk of hospitalisation or death in the 
target population of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not require oxygen 
supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 156/170 
 
 
 
Based on the provided safety data, no major concern was identified in the safety profile of PF-
07321332/ritonavir combination. The most frequent adverse reactions were dysgeusia, diarrhoea, 
vomiting and headache which are described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The demonstrated benefits of Paxlovid outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive quality data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation 
was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment life-threatening disease. In addition, 
the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an emergency situation. It is a public health threat duly 
recognised by the World Health Organisation as well as the EU. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The CHMP has identified 
specific obligations concerning pharmaceutical (quality) data, which are expected to provide 
comprehensive data for this product. No concerns have been identified with the ability to complete 
these specific obligations, as the applicant has indicated that they consider respective due dates as 
feasible. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as in the framework of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 
there is an urgent need for safe and effective therapeutic interventions that can reduce viral 
transmission, improve time to clinical recovery and prevent the progression of infection to more 
severe disease, hospitalisation and death. Paxlovid has demonstrated efficacy on patient at 
increased risk of severe COVID-19, it is also for oral use that can be taken outside the hospital 
setting.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. COVID-19 inarguably represents the most significant public 
health emergency of our time. In this context it is considered that the benefits to public health of 
the immediate availability of Paxlovid outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional quality 
data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Paxlovid is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’ 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
Assessment report  
EMA/95110/2022 
Page 157/170 
 
 
 
 
that the benefit-risk balance of Paxlovid is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Paxlovid is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who do not 
require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID 19 (see 
section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing 
authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that the active substance 
(1R,2S,5S)-N-((1S)-1-Cyano-2-((3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)ethyl)-3-((2S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-
trifluoroacetamido) butanoyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

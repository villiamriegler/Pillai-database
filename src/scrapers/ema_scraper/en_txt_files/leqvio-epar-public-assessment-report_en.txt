2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Leqvio is proposed to be used in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-
intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Primary hypercholesterolaemia by definition is any hypercholesterolaemia that is caused by a 
disturbance (familial- or nonfamilial) in the lipid metabolism and is not caused by another condition, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition 
[heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH)] is rare and is estimated to occur in 1:500 
individuals globally. LDL-C levels in affected individuals are elevated and in spite of aggressive statin 
use there is still a 2-fold excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) related deaths relative to age-
matched controls within this population. 
Hypercholesterolaemia is caused by an increased level of cholesterol in the blood. Primary 
hyperlipidaemia is usually due to genetic causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental 
factors, such as diet and lifestyle and primary nonfamilial hyperlipidaemia is a kind of hyperlipidaemia 
that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, but due to polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidaemia is 
generally defined as elevated LDL-C and high triglycerides and/or low high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C). 
A strong positive correlation and causal relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) has been derived from a large body of clinical and epidemiological studies. There is also 
a strong relationship to other clinical manifestations in the body like cerebrovascular disease (i.e. 
ischaemic stroke) or peripheral vascular disease. Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous increasing 
relative risk of CVD from very low to high levels of LDL-C, with a higher absolute risk in patients at the 
higher end of LDL-C levels. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. There are 
multiple factors that contribute to the development. The main factor, which is derived from numerous 
clinical studies, genetic examinations, and epidemiological surveys, is an elevated LDL-C level, which 
increases the risk to develop atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.  
Data from several studies emphasise the importance of targeting cholesterol reduction for both 
primary and secondary prevention of reducing cardiovascular (CV) events and this is supported by 
current US and EU recommendations. As these recommendations recognise that the LDL-C goals are 
not always achievable by maximum tolerated statin therapy alone, an unmet medical need remains 
and additional LDL-C lowering therapies are necessary3.  
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 14/143 
 
 
 
Data from several clinical studies suggest that the greater the LDL-C reduction will be, the greater the 
declines in ASCVD-associated morbidity and mortality can be expected.  
Although several classes of LDL-C-lowering drugs are currently available, there is still a need for new 
effective and safe treatment options. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Based on epidemiological evidence a strong positive correlation and causal relationship between serum 
LDL-C and the risk of atherosclerotic vascular damage exists which leads to CHD, CVD, and peripheral 
vascular disease by developing atheromatous vascular debris that leads to a constriction of the 
vascular lumen and thus to circulatory disorders.  
The European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) released a consensus statement in the year 2017 to 
confirm the “LDL-C hypothesis” by stating that “there is a dose-dependent, log-linear association 
between absolute LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, and this association is independent of other 
cardiovascular risk factors and is consistent across the multiple lines of evidence".  
Statins are today the gold standard for treating elevated LDL-C levels. A 25% proportional reduction in 
the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures was observed with statin therapy or a more intensive 
statin regimen per 1 mmol/L lower LDL-C. Statins reduce LDL-C levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA 
reductase (also known as 3-hydroxy3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase). Recent studies 
demonstrated that the administration of lipid-lowering agents such as ezetimibe on top of statins 
further reduce LDL-C levels and the CVD event rate compared to monotherapy.  
The reduction rates for lipid-modifying agents are at about 50% for high-intensive statin therapy, 
about 15% to 30% for ezetimibe, about 13% to 20% for bile acid sequestrants, and about 43% to 
64% for PCSK9 inhibitors, respectively.  
The results of these clinical studies have sufficiently demonstrated the direct association between LDL-
C reduction and CV risk reduction across a wide variety of patient populations with different 
cardiovascular risks. 
Results from recent studies with the new PCSK9-inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab also 
demonstrated the strong relationship between LDL-C reduction and CV risk reduction and that there is 
currently no lower limit below which lowering LDL C is not beneficial. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
The underlying atherosclerotic vascular lesions that cause CHD, CVD, and peripheral vascular occlusive 
disease are vascular lesions caused by an elevated LDL-C level. An outstanding role to reduce the risk 
of major CV events is lowering of LDL-C, which has been established for a long time. Data to support 
the relationship between LDL-C and CV events and specifically the relationship with inhibition of PCSK9 
has been shown in genetic studies of variations in the genes that influence LDL-C and from studies in 
patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). In Mendelian randomisation studies evaluating 
multiple genetic targets that impact LDL-C levels, the variants in genes that regulate LDL-C levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 15/143 
 
 
 
(e.g., LDL-R, PCSK9) have demonstrated that lowering of LDL-C is associated with a lower risk for CV 
events1 2. 
To minimise this risk factor, lipid-lowering therapies are recommended in the primary and secondary 
prevention of ASCVD. To reach this goal, specific targets have been suggested. It has been shown that 
the higher the CV risks, the more aggressive the lipid-lowering therapy should be. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Today available lipid-lowering therapies include: 
•  Statins (oral administration) are the gold standard in LDL-C reduction and have been 
extensively evaluated in numerous clinical studies in patients with a wide range of CV risk 
profiles. The 2019 ‘ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid 
modification to reduce cardiovascular risk’ focus on the benefits of statin therapy while non-
statin therapies like ezetimibe or PCSK9-inhibitors can provide additional benefit or can be 
used as monotherapies in statin-intolerant patients. 
• 
• 
• 
Ezetimibe (oral administration) is used as add-on therapy when treatment goals have not been 
achieved with statins or as monotherapy when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. CV 
benefits have been demonstrated in patients with established CVD. 
Fibrates (oral administration) and bile acid sequestrants (oral administration) are less 
efficacious than statins at LDL C lowering and have a less favourable side effect profile 
compared to statins. Cardiovascular benefits of these lipid-modifying agents have not been 
demonstrated satisfactorily. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (SC administration) can be 
used as add-on therapy to maximum statin treatment when treatment goals have not been 
achieved with statins or when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. CV benefits have 
already been demonstrated in patients with established CVD. 
About the product 
Mode of action 
Inclisiran (ALN-PCSSC) is a chemically modified double-stranded 21-23mer small interfering RNA 
(siRNA), conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate 
uptake by hepatocytes. It is an injectable LDL-C lowering drug being developed for the treatment of 
patients with hyperlipidaemia.  
Inclisiran inhibits the translation of PCSK9 in the liver cell thus preventing the degradation of the LDL-
receptor (LDLR) on the cell surface, which leads to a reduction of LDL-C.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Inclisiran sodium is a synthetic, chemically modified, double-stranded, small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA). The sense strand contains 21 nucleotides and the antisense strand contains 23 nucleotides. 
The sense strand is conjugated with triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake 
by hepatocytes.  
The molecular formula of inclisiran sodium is C529 H664 F12 N176 Na43 O316 P43 S6 (salt form) and molecular 
weight is 17,284.75 g/mol (salt form). The molecular formula and molecular weight of inclisiran 
sodium are summarised in Table 1.  
Table 1: active substance molecular formula and molecular mass 
The active substance structure is illustrated in Figure 1and Figure 2. In Figure 1, the bases involved in 
a base pair formation are connected with a centre dot. The structure of L96, the N-acetylgalactosamine 
(GalNAc) containing moiety, is also provided. In Figure 2, the structure is represented using an 
expanded structural formula showing the phosphate backbone. The bases involved in a base pair 
formation in this case are connected with a dotted line.

Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020

Figure 2 : expanded active substance structure 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow hygroscopic powder. In order to mitigate the potential 
adverse effects of hygroscopicity, the active substance is packaged in wide mouth high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene screw closures. The HDPE bottles are placed into foil 
bags, which serve as a secondary moisture barrier. Stability of the active substance has been 
established in the same container closure system demonstrating good control of moisture content. 
The solubility of inclisiran sodium in water is at least 300 mg/ml at ambient conditions. Solubility of 
inclisiran sodium in acetonitrile, methanol, isopropyl alcohol and other organic solvents is negligible 
due to the highly polar nature of the oligonucleotide active substance. The results are consistent with 
the very poor lipophilicity expected from a highly charged oligonucleotide. 
The chemical structure of inclisiran sodium was elucidated and characterised by a combination of 
orthogonal analytical techniques. 
The structure elucidation data are considered acceptable to confirm the correct sequences of the single 
strand intermediates and the duplex structure of the inclisiran active substance. 
The stereochemistry of inclisiran sodium is complex and is controlled in the synthesis of the single 
strands. There are chiral centre contributions from three components of the active substance 
summarised below. 
1. The nucleotides; Each adenosine (A), guanosine (G), uridine (U) and cytidine (C) nucleotide 
introduces four chiral centres and each thymidine (dT) introduces three chiral centres into the single 
strands. The chiral centres associated with the phosphoramidites are not labile and inversion of 
stereochemistry at these centres is not expected to occur under the conditions of detritylation, 
coupling, capping, deprotection or cleavage associated with the synthesis of the single strands, or the 
subsequent steps leading to the active substance. 
2. The GalNAc (L96) moiety; Two components in the GalNAc structure, galactosamine and trans-4-
hydroxy-L-proline methyl ester contribute to the chiral centres of GalNAc. The galactosamine and 
trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline methyl ester are both of natural origin and their stereochemistry is 
established by the biological source. 
3. Phosphorothioate groups; The phosphorothioate groups (4 in the antisense strand and 2 in the 
sense strand) are formed by a reaction that is not stereospecific. The stereochemical outcome is 
expected to be consistent from batch to batch. The control strategy for ensuring the consistent 
stereochemistry of inclisiran sodium final active substance is considered acceptable. A test method was 
developed that can reliably separate the diastereoisomers. The distribution of the peaks is consistent 
across batches within each single strand, and comparable to batches used in toxicology studies.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Inclisiran sodium is manufactured in seven main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specification as summarised in Figure 3. The manufacturing process consists of synthesizing 
the two single strand oligonucleotides (sense and antisense strands) by conventional solid phase 
synthesis using 3’-O-(2-cyanoethyl) phosphoramidite chemistry with the 5’-hydroxyls protected with 
4,4’-dimethoxytriphenylmethyl (DMT) groups and fluoro-, OMe- or deoxy-modifications at the 2’-
position.  
The sense strand is synthesised on protected GalNAc-containing-ligand (i.e., L96) loaded polymer 
support. The antisense strand is synthesised on 2’-OMe A-loaded controlled pore glass (CPG) support.  
The synthesised single strand oligonucleotides are cleaved from the solid support, deprotected, and 
after an ultrafiltration step, purified by HPLC. Purification is followed by a second ultrafiltration step, to 
remove the components of the mobile phases used in the chromatography. The two single strands are 
mixed in a targeted equimolar ratio during annealing, followed by concentration and lyophilisation. 
Figure 3: active substance manufacturing process - main steps 
The manufacturing scale is defined based on the loading of the synthesis solid support.  
Additional ultra/diafiltration and lyophilisation steps are stated as potential reprocessing steps. No 
reprocessing has been performed yet and the applicant commits to perform investigations and inform 
the authorities if reprocessing is required.  
The starting materials used in the preparation of inclisiran sodium include eight phosphoramidites, 2’-
OMe A Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) and fully acetylated triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine trans-4-
hydroxyprolinol-O-DMT succinate (protected GalNAc [L96]) polymer support - Protected GalNAc-PS). 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020

Protected phosphoramidites are considered suitable starting materials for synthetic oligonucleotides. 
An appropriate justification for the classification of phosphoramidites as starting materials has been 
provided. Detailed information on the impurity profiles of the phosphoramidite starting materials and 
their classification into critical and non-critical impurities has been provided. Critical impurities can be 
incorporated into the active substance during various steps of synthesis cycle. Impurity species that 
cannot be incorporated into the oligonucleotide during synthesis and thus do not impact the purity of 
the final product are considered non-critical. The phosphoramidite specifications have been set taking 
into account the limited available batch data and the applicant has committed to re-evaluate and 
tighten the specification limits of the phosphoramidite starting materials when data from a sufficient 
number of commercial active substance batches (additional 18 batches) will be available (REC1). 
A detailed description of the synthesis of the GalNAc-PS starting material has been provided, together 
with results of batch analysis of several batches, characterisation of the impurity profile, control of the 
GalNAc-PS and also its precursor in the synthesis and  discussion of fate and purge of impurities 
present in GalNAc-PS. These data are considered appropriate to substantiate controlled and consisted 
quality of the proposed starting material GalNAc-PS considering that this starting material is complex. 
Analytical validation data for the methods applied in the specification have been provided. 
Controlled pore glass (CPG) loaded with nucleotides are a class of long standing and commercially 
available supports for oligonucleotide synthesis. 2’-OMe A CPG is manufactured by the chemical 
modification of native CPG beads to generate beads bearing a long chain amine group. The amine 
group is coupled with 2’-OMe A succinate to attach the nucleotide to the support.  
The selection of all starting materials has been carried out according to the principles of ICH Q11, i.e. 
they all have defined physical and chemical properties and structure; they are incorporated as a 
structural fragment into the structure of the inclisiran; they are purchased from commercial suppliers; 
and they are controlled with specifications to ensure inclisiran active substance quality. The selection of 
the starting materials is considered adequately justified taking into account also the manufacturing 
process which includes numerous cycles of various steps, including purification steps, which altogether 
ensure the proper purge of starting materials’ potential related and degradation impurities preventing 
their carry over to single strand intermediates or even final inclisiran active substance. Critical and 
non-critical impurities from starting materials have been identified and the proposed acceptance limits 
provided. This classification is mostly related to the potential reactivity or non-reactivity of these 
impurities, respectively, and the consequent impact on the quality of the intermediate single strand 
oligonucleotides and the final inclisiran DS. Suppliers of the starting materials are listed in the dossier. 
Confirmation that the addition of an alternative vendor for the starting materials will applied for by 
variation has been provided.  
A list of all reagents, solvents, and auxiliary materials used in the active substance manufacturing 
process is provided. Adequate specifications have been provided for each of the raw materials. 
The principles of criticality assessment and risk analysis are adequately addressed. Critical quality 
attributes (CQA), critical process parameters (CPP) and process parameters (PP) have been defined. 
The critical process steps and associated CPPs for each unit operation and the non-critical process 
parameters of the manufacturing process are summarised. Proven acceptable ranges have been 
defined for the CPPs. These proven acceptable ranges are acceptable and have been justified in the 
process refinement studies.  
The quality of double-stranded oligonucleotides is pre-determined by the quality of the single strand 
precursors. Therefore, the control of these intermediates by adequate specifications is essential. 
Identity by molecular weight and retention time but more importantly by sequencing is performed for 
the sense and antisense strand. Consequently, the sequence is proven also for the resulting duplex. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 21/143 
 
 
 
Purity of the sense and the antisense strand is determined by two techniques, AX-HPLC and IPRP-
HPLC.  
The specified impurities for the sense strand are grouped based on their retention times and controlled 
within defined limits for each group. This is acceptable as it is commonly applied for synthetic 
oligonucleotide products. Batch analysis for 12 batches of sense and antisense strand have been 
provided, respectively. The proposed limits for purity of specified impurities, total unspecified and total 
impurities in the single strands are acceptable. The applicant has committed to re-evaluate the 
specification limits for the single strand intermediates when data from a sufficient number of 
commercial active substance batches (additional 18 batches) will be available (REC2). 
A three-stage lifecycle approach is applied for process validation of the active substance manufacturing 
process. This approach is acceptable and a statement has been provided that active substance process 
validation will be finalised prior to marketing of the resulting finished product. The commercial 
manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical development 
program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
Information on batch history from development through validation has been provided. The main 
changes during development were change 1 (a scaled-up process) and change 2 (a finalised refined 
process to be used for the validation). All changes are described in detail and the influence on active 
substance quality has been sufficiently investigated and described. The characterisation reports for 
process refinement (change 2) were provided. The quality of the active substance used in the various 
phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed 
commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
As per ICH Q3A, impurities are classified into organic impurities, inorganic impurities and residual 
solvents. The organic impurities are further classified into process-related impurities and product-
related impurities. 
Product-related oligonucleotide impurities are formed during the manufacturing process or during 
storage, including degradants. These impurities are controlled by the manufacturing process and long 
term storage conditions by two orthogonal HPLC techniques (AX-HPLC and IPRP-HPLC) in the single 
strand intermediates and the final active substance. 
 impurities are deletion (shortmers) and addition (longmers) impurities, partially deprotected 
oligonucleotide chains that are not fully deprotected or improperly deprotected during manufacture, 
phosphodiester (P=O) impurities, where a phosphodiester replaces the thiophosphate (P=S) in the 
sense and antisense strands, impurities carried over from parent starting material impurities and in 
particular those associated with the triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) portion of the sense 
strand. 
In general, a good understanding of the impurity profile in the single strand intermediates and the final 
active substance has been demonstrated. Impurity monitoring is performed on impurities grouped by 
adjusted RRT ranges which is acceptable for synthetic oligonucleotides with an extremely complex 
impurity profile. Process related organic impurities have been discussed and are considered removed 
due to extensive washing, chromatographic and ultrafiltration steps. 
The evaluation of the presence of genotoxic materials in the active substance is performed in 
accordance with the principles stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. It is agreed that based on the very 
large purge factors associated with the steps downstream of synthesis, there is no risk associated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 22/143 
 
 
 
these potential impurities to the quality of the final active substance and therefore no need to be 
monitored. 
There are no class 1 solvents used in the manufacturing of inclisiran active substance. A number of class 
2  and  class  3  solvents  are  used  in  the  manufacturing  process.  Sufficient  data  have  been  provided  to 
justify that only acetonitrile will be controlled in the active substance specification. Inorganic impurities 
have been sufficiently addressed. The packaging materials comply with the Regulations EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity by duplex retention time 
(IPRP-HPLC-UV), identity by single strand MW (IPRP-HPLC-UV ESI MS, non-denaturing), identity by Tm 
(UV spectrophotometry), identity of single strands by sequence (MS-MS fragmentation), sodium 
content (Ph. Eur.), purity non-denaturing (IPRP-HPLC-UV), purity denaturing (AX-HPLC UV), purity 
denaturing (IPRP-HPLC-UV), assay (UV absorption), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
acetonitrile (headspace GC FID), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The active substance specification attributes are acceptable The concept of grouping of impurities as 
proposed in the specification is acceptable. The proposed control of impurities is acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Sufficient information 
on reference standards and materials and the container closure system has been provided.  
The identity of the single strands is determined by sequencing of the single strands intermediates 
during the synthesis, as per the intermediate specifications. Batch analysis data from twelve batches of 
the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. The applicant has committed to re-evaluate the active substance specification limits when 
data from a sufficient number of commercial active substance batches (additional 18 batches) will be 
available (REC3). 
Stability 
Stability data from 11 batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 60 months* under long term freezer conditions (-20°C ± 5°C) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
(*Data for up to 60 months (1 batch), 36 months (1 batch), 30 months (3 batches), 18 months (1 
batch), 12 months (1 batch), 6 months (3 batches) and 3 months (1 batch) were provided.) 
The quality attributes tested under the storage conditions are appearance, assay, water content, purity 
by non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC, purity by denaturing AX-HPLC, purity by denaturing IPRP-HPLC, 
bioburden and bacterial endotoxins. No changes or trends have been observed at long term or 
accelerated conditions with the exception of noticeable degradation at accelerated conditions for purity 
by denaturing IPRP-HPLC. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed. The stress conditions studied are temperature, acid, 
base, oxidation and light (in line with ICH Q1B). Acceptable mass balance was demonstrated 
supporting the use of the three purity methods as stability indicating. Significant degradation was 
observed at high temperatures and under acid, base and oxidation conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months stored in freezer 
conditions (-20 ± 5 °C) in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile solution in a prefilled syringe (PFS). Each PFS unit contains 284 mg 
inclisiran (equivalent to 300 mg inclisiran sodium) in 1.5 mL water for injection.  
The container closure for PFS is a 2.25 mL Type I clear glass syringe with a staked needle and rigid 
needle shield and a bromobutyl fluorotec coated plunger. The final assembly of the syringe also include 
a standard plunger rod and a finger flange installed during secondary packaging. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The pharmaceutical development is adequately described in the dossier. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined. A list of critical process parameters (CPP) and the corresponding critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) were identified. 
The finished product contains the active substance dissolved in WFI with sodium hydroxide or 
phosphoric acid added for pH adjustment. For an adequate subcutaneous application, a target pH of 7 
was defined. The composition of the finished product used throughout all clinical development was the 
same as proposed for commercial formulation. 
The manufacturing process consists of bulk solution preparation and sterile filtration plus aseptic filling. 
Compatibility of the bulk solution with the manufacturing equipment was tested. The equipment was 
found to have no negative impact on the finished product quality based on the impurity profiles of 
three finished product batches compared to the profiles of the three active substance batches used for 
the manufacture of the finished product batches. Bulk hold time was also evaluated. Hold time studies 
for the bulk solution were part of the process validation. The selection of sterile filtration and aseptic 
filling as the sterilisation process has been sufficiently justified in accordance with EMA Guideline on 
the sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) and Ph. Eur. chapter 5.1.1. Given the thermally sensitive 
nature of the active substance, terminal sterilization using either moist or dry heat or even post aseptic 
treatment heating options are not useable options and lead to greater risk to product quality than the 
use of sterile filtration. The use of ionizing radiation has been demonstrated to lead to extensive 
degradation on nucleic acid formulations, especially at the proposed 25 Gy exposure level. The 
generation of new additional impurities and extensive degradation are risks to product quality not 
associated with sterile filtration. Gas sterilization uses alkylating or oxidizing agents known to be highly 
reactive towards nucleic acids, therefore it is not useable for a formulation such as inclisiran. 
Validation of the sterilizing filter covered a bacterial challenge study. Filter validation is supplemented 
with sufficient data and discussion on potential sorption of solution components to the filters and 
extractable and leachables from the filters. 
An overfill of 0.03 mL of the pre-filled syringes to allow for 1.5 mL delivered volume have been defined. 
The overfill has been derived from a fill volume study. The primary packaging is a 2.25 mL Type I glass 
siliconised  syringe  with  a  staked  needle  and  a  rigid  needle  shield  and  a  bromobutyl  flurotec  coated 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 24/143 
 
 
 
plunger. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The glass syringe is supplied sterilised 
(EtO sterilisation), the plunger ready to sterilise. The compatibility of the glass syringe and the plunger 
with  the  finished  product  has  been  demonstrated  based  on  the  stability  studies  and  on 
extractable/leachables studies.  At time zero and 6 months (25 °C and 40 °C) no leachables of concern 
were found. The stability study will continue until 36 months of storage of the primary stability batches. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of five main steps: dissolution of the active 
substance in WFI, pH adjustment, sterile filtration, aseptic filling and stoppering. The process is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The syringe barrels with staked needle and rigid needle shield are ready to use with no further 
treatment during the manufacturing process. Details on the sterilisation conditions for the plungers and 
the syringes were presented.  
The filtration process is sufficiently well described in the dossier. The dossier states the equilibration 
time of the active substance at room temperature and all intended and validated hold times. 
The applicant performed a risk assessment exercise utilizing risk priority indices which are calculated 
considering severity, probability and detectability of the respective risk of a manufacturing process 
parameter. The applicant explains that based on the calculation of the risk priority indices after 
implemented risk mitigation steps and planned validation, no process steps were identified to be 
critical. This approach is not in line with the definition of a critical process parameter in ICHQ8 (R2). 
Monitoring or controlling a process parameter does not change its criticality, the process parameter 
remains critical but well controlled. The applicant updated process parameters in the dossier. This was 
considered to be acceptable. 
As the original dossier contained only process validation protocols for the proposed batches sizes, a 
major objection was raised requiring process validation data to be submitted for this non-standard 
manufacturing process (i.e. aseptic processing and sterile filtration).  
The applicant presented a validation report for the finished product manufacturing process for three 
batches at a nominal batch size. The dossier also contains results of media fill runs, which are 
considered acceptable. Information on autoclave sterilisation of components, equipment parts and 
production materials, filling-line sterilisation validation and environmental monitoring are included.  
The applicant’s conclusion that the validation data for the provided batch size is also representative for 
a larger batch size without further supporting data was not accepted. Therefore, the larger batch size 
has been deleted from module 3. The Major Objection was considered to be resolved by the provision 
of process validation data and removal of the larger batch size from the dossier. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  specifications    include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  product/dosage  form; 
appearance (visual), identification by duplex retention time (IPRP-HPLC), identification (IR), deliverable 
dose (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (UV), purity (non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC, 
denaturing AX-HPLC, denaturing IPRP-HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities 
(ICP-MS), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.),  sterility (Ph. Eur.), gliding force and break loose force (ISO 
11040-8), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and container closure integrity test (USP).

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.  
There are no significant differences between the impurity profiles of the finished product and the active 
substance, and no significant degradation of the finished product was observed during manufacturing 
or on stability storage at both long term and accelerated conditions. As purity is mainly controlled by 
the active substance manufacturing process, the finished product purity limits are mainly the same as 
for the active substance. The proposed acceptance criteria in the finished product specification for 
purity are accepted considering the limited available manufacturing and batch data. The applicant 
commits to re-evaluate the finished product specification limits, together with the active substance 
purity specification limits, when data from a sufficient number of additional commercial finished 
product batches will be available (REC4).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The identification methods are specific and can distinguish inclisiran from comparable active 
substances. The applicant commits to include testing for colour and clarity of the solutions based on 
Ph. Eur. 2.2.1. and Ph. Eur. 2.2.2. in the release and shelf-life specification after a sufficient number of 
batch data is generated (REC5). 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamines was missing and resulted in a major 
objection. The applicant has provided a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the finished product applying the principles outlined in the notice “Information on 
nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/189634/2019)”. The conclusions drawn by the 
applicant are acceptable. There is no risk of nitrosamines contamination. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data using 
a validated method was provided, demonstrating that all elemental impurity values were below 30% of 
the conservative PDE acceptance criteria. Based on the risk assessment it can be concluded that it is 
not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data, including the results for the validation batches of finished product were provided. 
All results are within acceptance criteria and batch to batch consistency is demonstrated. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging (syringes) proposed for marketing.  
The applied tests are those included in the shelf-life specification. All results were well within 
specification limits with no obvious trends observed.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results demonstrated that the finished product is not susceptible 
to light exposure.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with the special storage conditions 
“This medicinal product does not require any special storage condition. Do not freeze.” as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There is no risk of potential contamination with adventitious agents of viral or non-viral origin. The 
finished product, including the active substance and all excipients, does not contain any materials of 
human or animal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
Major objections raised relating to finished product process validation and requesting a risk assessment 
for possible nitrosamines impurities have been resolved (no risk for nitrosamines identified). There are 
five quality recommendations to update starting material, intermediate, active substance and finished 
product specifications when further commercial batch data is available. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should re-evaluate and tighten the specification limits of the phosphoramidite 
starting materials when data from a sufficient number of commercial active substance batches 
(additional 18 batches) will be available. 
2.  The applicant should re-evaluate and tighten the specification limits for the single strand 
intermediates when data from a sufficient number of commercial active substance batches 
(additional 18 batches) will be available. 
3.  The applicant should re-evaluate and tighten the active substance specification limits when 
data from a sufficient number of commercial active substance batches (additional 18 batches) 
will be available. 
4.  The applicant should re-evaluate and tighten the finished product specification limits when data 
from commercial finished product batches will be available in which the additional 18 batches 
of active substance are used. Revised finished product specifications should be provided 
together with the revised active substance specification.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Inclisiran (also referred to as ALN-PCCSSC) is a double stranded small-interfering RNA (siRNA) 
molecule, the antisense strand of which is modelled to specifically correspond to human Proprotein 
Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA. PCSK9 protein is predominantly expressed by the 
liver and is critical for the down regulation of hepatocyte low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 
expression, which results in a subsequent reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDLC).  
Inclisiran was developed as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy. Inclisiran is administered 
subcutaneously (SC) by a health care provider initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months as 
300 mg inclisiran sodium injection. 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of inclisiran were evaluated 
in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. The nonclinical testing strategy for inclisiran was 
consistent with existing regulatory guidance. All pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with the 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). There are some deviations in the non-clinical development program as 
summarized in the Table below.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Inclisiran is a double stranded chemically synthesised small-interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule, the 
antisense strand of which is modelled to specifically correspond to human Proprotein Convertase 
Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA. PCSK9 protein is predominantly expressed by the liver and is 
critical for the down regulation of hepatocyte low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression.  
The applicant conducted data mining analysis and directed sample analysis that showed there are no 
naturally occurring polymorphisms in the target sequence of inclisiran, and therefore no reduction of 
activity is anticipated for patients from any ethnic background. The applicant states that the nucleotide 
sequence of inclisiran exhibits complete homology to the analogous sequences in the human and 
Cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 genes and partial homology to the rat and mouse PCSK9 gene sequences. 
Consequently, the evaluation of the in vivo pharmacological activity of inclisiran that guided the clinical 
development program was primarily conducted in monkeys. In response to a request, the applicant 
explained in a detailed manner the extent of identity between the antisense strand of inclisiran and the 
respective regions of rat, mouse and rabbit PCSK9 mRNA sequence. For the rat and for the mouse, 100 
% complementarity was shown for the seed region and partial homology for the remainder. One 
mismatch was detected for the seed region and 3 mismatches in the remaining region for the rabbit. 
Sequence homology was sufficient to result in pharmacologic activity (LDL-C decreases) of inclisiran in 
all three species. Reproductive toxicity of inclisiran was studied in rats and rabbits. Therefore, it is 
agreed that the relevance of the species chosen for the assessment of pharmacologic and toxicological 
effects has been shown and that rat and rabbit were adequate animal species for reproductive toxicity 
studies with inclisiran. 
Inclisiran consists of chemically modified (2´-Fluoro-, 2’O-Methyl-) nucleotides (except one thymidine) 
with several phosphorathioate-linkages at/close to the ends of both strands (5’- and 3’-ends of 
antisense strand; 5’-end of sense strand) and a triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
covalently linked to the 3’-end of the sense strand to target the molecule to hepatocytotic uptake via 
asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR). The ASGPR is a member of the C-type lectin family of receptors 
that recognizes and binds glycoproteins with terminal galactose (Gal) or GalNAc residues. It is 
expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes at a high copy number (0.5-1 million per cell) and 
facilitates clearance of desialylated glycoproteins from the blood through endocytosis. According to the 
proposed mechanism inclisiran uptake through ASGPR on hepatocytes leads to receptor-mediated 
endocytosis followed by release of inclisiran from the endosome into the cytoplasm and recycling of the 
ASGPR back to the cell surface for successive rounds of uptake. The applicant confirmed that the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) delivery system is not expected to be saturated, as, based on an 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 30/143 
 
 
 
 
animal’s PK data analysis provided by the applicant, a saturation of liver ASPGR was not observed in 
rasH2 wild type mice, rats and monkeys. 
In hepatocytes, the antisense strand is incorporated in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and 
directs catalytic breakdown of mRNA for PCSK9 thereby inhibiting translation of PCSK9 protein. A 
single siRNA-bound RISC has an enzymatic activity and cleaves many transcripts and the duration of 
action may be longer than other mechanisms. 
In HeLa or Hep3B cells inclisiran delivered via transfection into the cells (and not entering cells via cell 
surface asialoglycoprotein receptors) inhibited PCSK9 synthesis with an IC50 value in the picomolar 
range. 
When inclisiran was injected once SC in transgenic mice expressing human PCSK9 (hPCSK9) 10 days 
post injection hPCSK9 serum levels were lowered dose-related with an ED50 of 2 mg/kg bw. and ED80 = 
6 mg/kg bw. 
After single SC dosing inclisiran exhibited in female Cynomolgus monkeys a dose-dependent and 
sustainable reduction of PCSK9 protein paralleled by a lowering of serum LDL-C with similar kinetics. 
No PD effect was observed at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg bw. A pronounced PD effect on PCSK9 and LDL-C 
levels was observed at doses of 3 mg/kg bw and higher (6 mg/kg bw and 10 mg/kg bw) with no 
difference in time to nadir (approx. Day 20 post dose). At doses of 6 mg/kg bw or 10 mg/kg bw mean 
maximal PCSK9 reductions of about 85% and LDL-C lowering of about 68% were recorded. A dose 
dependent effect on the duration of PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction was observed with PCSK9 and LDL-C 
levels returning to baseline at approximately Day 130 and Day 100 post dose in the 3 mg/kg bw and 6 
mg/kg bw groups, respectively, and remaining below baseline through Day 180 post dose in the 10 
mg/kg bw group. 
In another study in female Cynomolgus monkeys several SC multi-dose regimen following an initial 
administration of 6 mg/kg bw of inclisiran were investigated. Monthly (QM) dosing regimens of 1 
mg/kg bw of inclisiran or higher were successful at maintaining the levels of PCSK9 and LDL-C 
reduction achieved after the initial 6 mg/kg bw dose for up to one year whereas with SC administration 
of 10 mg/kg bw every 3 months (quarterly; Q3M) partial recovery of PCSK9 and LDL-C levels were 
observed prior to administration of the next quarterly dose. 
In yet another study in female Cynomolgus monkeys with single IV administration of 6 mg/kg bw of 
inclisiran, single SC administration of 1,3, and 6 mg/kg bw of inclisiran, and single SC administration of 
6 mg/kg bw of inclisiran followed by multiple monthly (4 times) or biweekly (7 times) SC 
administrations of 3 mg/kg bw of inclisiran pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics were 
investigated. PCSK9 protein levels were maintained at ≥ 50% of baseline for 7 days, 28 days and 84 
days following single dose SC administration of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively, and for 
84 days following the last dose in the groups receiving biweekly or monthly injections. Reductions of 
LDL-C levels below 50% of baseline were sustained for 49 and 56 days following the last monthly and 
biweekly dose, respectively. The plasma levels of inclisiran were below the lower limit of quantitation 
(20 ng/mL) in all dose groups by 24 hours post dose indicating a temporal disconnect between 
inclisiran PK and PD effects. 
Chain-shortened metabolites of inclisiran were observed in in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiling. In 
response to a request, the applicant clarified that while minor amounts of extensively truncated 
metabolites and metabolites resulting from endonuclease cleavage are not expected to enter the RISC 
and, therefore, produce any off-target effect, n-1 and ´n-2 metabolites and metabolites resulting from 
truncation on the 5´end up to n-4 do exhibit similar activity as the unmetabolised parent strand. It is 
assumed, that inclisiran treatment does not result in any adverse effects related to off-target activities 
based on the long-term toxicology studies in rats and monkeys. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 31/143 
 
 
 
The PD activity of inclisiran including reduction of endogenous plasma PCSK9 and serum LDL-C levels 
was determined following single and multiple SC dose administration to cynomolgus monkeys and 
transgenic mice. In response to a request, the applicant clarified that in vivo studies in animal disease 
models of hypercholesterolemia would be of minimal impact to the understanding of inclisiran’s biology 
and pharmacology in human. The argumentation included among others the facts that use of PCSK9 
antibodies in clinical practice has validated PCSK9 as a pharmacologic target for reducing LDL-C and 
that there are species differences in cholesterol fractions. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Regarding possible off-target activity a bioinformatic analysis was used to identify a set of transcripts 
that may potentially be inhibited by the antisense strand of inclisiran based on sequence homology. 
Specificity was predicted for the 19-mer core sequence by performing a comprehensive search against 
the human transcriptome. Twenty potential off-target transcripts were assayed using quantitative PCR 
in Hep3b cells transfected with inclisiran. Two targets were not expressed in Hep3b cells. Inclisiran did 
not substantially inhibit expression for any of the other 18 potential off-targets that were tested in this 
assay with a factor of ≥45-fold between the “on-target” suppression of PCSK9 by inclisiran and the 
“off-target” suppression of any of the predicted off-target transcripts and no IC50 values could be 
determined. The off-target transcript inhibition was considered low, even at high inclisiran 
concentrations. In response to a request, the applicant provided appropriate data on the 20 off-target 
genes identified whose expression may be impacted by inclisiran in order to explain that none are 
thought to be housekeeping genes and to clarify that no impact on the cell hemostasis is expected.  
The applicant substantiated that due to position and extensive number of 2’-O-Methyl modifications as 
well as the addition of the GalNAc ligand to the 3’ end of the sense strand of inclisiran the likelihood 
that the sense strand would lead to ‘off-target` transcript suppression is significantly decreased. Even 
after removal of the GalNac residue,RNAi activity of the sense strand is not expected.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant conducted a cardiovascular and respiratory safety study in conscious telemetered male 
Cynomolgus monkeys with SC injections of up to 250 mg/kg bw of inclisiran. Neither statistically 
significant effects on PR, QT or QTc intervals, or QRS duration, nor abnormal ECG waveforms or 
arrhythmias were attributed to administration of inclisiran. In addition, no effects on heart rate, 
systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, pulse pressures or respiration rate was attributable to administration 
of inclisiran. The applicant clarified that no other measurements of respiratory function apart from the 
determination of respiratory rate were collected neither in study 8297017 nor in any other nonclinical 
studies. As inclisiran has meanwhile been used and investigated in humans in clinical trials, it is not 
considered appropriate to request the conduct of a new non-clinical study investigating another 
respiratory parameter apart from respiratory rate in animals. The safety factor of 67 resulting with the 
highest dose investigated (250 mg/kg bw) between the experimentally achieved Cmax and the clinically 
intended therapeutic Cmax in humans at the 300 mg dose is considered sufficient. The molecular weight 
of inclisiran (free acid) is high (16339.53 g/mol). No in vitro cardiac ion channel assays were 
performed. The electrocardiographic effects of inclisiran at a supra-therapeutic dose (900 mg) was 
investigated in a Phase 1 clinical study ([ORION-12]). In that study, inclisiran did not produce clinically 
or statistically significant electrocardiographic effects, including prolongation of QTcF.  
Neurological evaluations were incorporated into the repeat dose toxicology studies conducted in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. In the 40 week repeated dose toxicology study the parameters analysed 
included postural reactions (proprioceptive positioning, placing reactions), spinal nerve function 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 32/143 
 
 
 
(muscle tone, withdrawal and perineal reflex), and cranial nerve effects (head movement, head 
symmetry, head muscle tone, and jaw tone, eye reactions, eye symmetry, eye position, palpebral 
reflex, and pupil light reflex). There were no inclisiran-related effects reported on any parameter up to 
the highest doses tested and the NOEL for neurological effects was ≥ 300 mg/kg, the highest dose 
tested in the 40 week study. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Dedicated PD drug interaction studies have not been conducted in animals but the applicant performed 
a 13-week repeated dose toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys with co-administration of inclisiran 
(once monthly SC) and/or atorvastatin (orally daily) in which PCSK9 levels and lipid profiles where 
investigated. The study did not reveal any marked differences in PD parameters associated with 
administration of the combination of inclisiran or atorvastatin compared to administration of either 
inclisiran or atorvastatin alone. All groups receiving inclisiran (with or without atorvastatin) except 
females receiving 300 mg/kg bw of inclisiran alone, showed moderate decreases in triglyceride levels, 
whereas atorvastatin alone did not exhibit an effect on triglyceride levels. The difference in response 
from the male cohort may be due to experimental and/or individual animal variability, as the 
triglyceride values were within a reference interval for cynomolgus monkeys (Koga et al 2005). It 
should be noted that inclisiran did not produce reductions in serum triglycerides in monkeys in the 4-
week ([8302575]), 15-week ([8297016]) or 40-week ([5001352]) pivotal toxicity studies. The 
majority of the data indicate that inclisiran alone does not reduce serum triglycerides in monkeys. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of inclisiran were investigated by the applicant in rodent and non-rodent species 
and in vitro using human tissue. 
The applicant used a variety of bio-analytical methods to investigate the pharmacokinetics of inclisiran 
and its short-chain oligonucleotide metabolites. The validation of the bioanalytical methods included 
the linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, dilution, selectivity, recovery, matrix effect, and 
carryover. In all cases, validation did not include incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) but ISR was 
conducted in study [8302576] titled “ALN-PCSSC: A 4-Week Repeat-Dose Toxicity and Toxicokinetics 
Study in Rats with an 8-Week Recovery” and Study [8302575] titled “ALN-PCSSC: A 4-Week Repeat 
Dose Toxicity and Toxicokinetics Study in Cynomolgus Monkeys with an 8-Week Recovery Phase”, 
which is considered acceptable. For the LC-TOF-MS assay the standard curve was constructed based on 
the duplex with two separate calibration curves constructed one for the AS and one for the sense 
strand. The AS strand was typically present at lower concentrations than the sense strand, which is 
considered being due to the sense strand being more stable due to the GalNAc group at the 3’end 
which has steric effects that unlike the AS strand protects the 3’end from exonuclease metabolism. 
Systemic bioavailability of inclisiran after SC administration of 5 mg /kg bw was determined in the rat 
as being 35.1% (compared to IV bolus injection) to 48.9% (compared to IV infusion). In the monkey a 
systemic bioavailability after SC administration of 24.7% to 33.8% was demonstrated (depending on the 
concentration  of  the  SC  administered  formulation).  The  long  half-life  of  inclisiran  at  the  SC  dose  site 
(~526  hours  in  rats)  based  on  a  radiolabelled  study  could  explain  the  apparently  low  absolute 
bioavailability of the SC route. 
A Tmax of 1 to 2 hours after SC administration was determined in both species. There were no gender 
differences identified in PK parameters. In the range between SC administration of inclisiran at 1 and 5 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 33/143 
 
 
 
 
or 6 mg/kg bw Cmax and AUC increased dose-proportionally in both species. After single SC 
administration of 5 mg/kg inclisiran to rats Cmax values between 592 ng/mL to 787 ng/mL were 
determined. Pharmacokinetic parameters after the last dose of repeated administration in biweekly or 
monthly intervals were very similar to those after single administration in both species. Inclisiran 
plasma t1/2 ranged in the rat from 0.9 to 1.7 hours and in the monkey from 1.9 to 4.3 hours after SC 
administration.  
The degree of plasma protein binding increased as the inclisiran concentrations decreased, with the 
highest degree of binding observed at the lowest concentration tested for all species including mouse, 
rat, monkey, and human plasma. At 0.5 µg/mL (human Cmax = 0.507 µg/mL), the lowest 
concentration of inclisiran assayed, plasma protein binding was similar between species and ranged 
from 87.4% for human plasma to 93.1% for rat plasma. 
Tissue distribution after SC administration was investigated in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys in 
selected organs using unlabelled inclisiran (1, 5 or 25 mg/kg bw for the rat; 1, 3 or 6 mg/kg bw for the 
monkey) and in many organs using 14C labelled inclisiran (65 mg/kg bw for the rat; 20 mg/kg bw for 
the monkey). In general Cmax and AUC of liver and kidney are by far higher than those ones of plasma.  
The study using unlabelled inclisiran in the rat showed that inclisiran was measurable in the liver and 
kidney to at least 336 hours (= 14 days) and 1344 hours (= 56 days) post dose, respectively, after a 
single dose. Liver Cmax and AUC0-t values generally increased in a dose proportional manner over the 
range evaluated. Mean apparent liver half-lives ranged from 53.1 to 191 hours across SC doses. Mean 
kidney concentrations were lower by approximately 2-5 fold than liver at all dose levels. Kidney Cmax 
and AUC0-t exposure increased in a dose proportional manner between 1 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw 
and greater than dose proportional manner between 5 mg/kg bw and 25 mg/kg bw. Mean apparent 
kidney half-lives ranged from 244 hours to 355 hours across the SC doses. The tissue distribution of 
inclisiran following a single SC dose of 5 mg/kg bw indicates that inclisiran is predominantly localized in 
the liver followed by kidney. Markedly lower inclisiran exposure based on AUC0-t was observed in 
adrenal (1076 fold lower), thymus (758 fold lower), thyroid (93 fold lower), pancreas (36 fold lower), 
jejunum (278 fold lower) and testis (743 fold lower) compared to liver. Inclisiran was no detected in 
the brain (LLOQ = 160 ng/g). 
The study using 14C labelled inclisiran in the rat showed that the site of SC administration showed the 
by far highest Cmax and AUC values. In response to a request, the applicant clarified that the highest 
concentrations of radioactivity at the injection site are due to the concentrated radioactive dose 
administered and are not a species specific effect. Nevertheless, in all non-clinical studies inclisiran was 
well tolerated at the injection sites. 
Ten times lower Cmax and AUC values compared to the injection site were found in the liver and similar 
or slightly lower values in the kidney. All other organs showed Cmax values by a factor of at least 20 or 
AUC values by a factor of at least 8 times lower than shown for the kidney. Elimination of radioactivity 
from all tissues was relatively slow and half-life values, if determinable, were in all organs at least 150 
hours, with 526 hours at the injection site, 270 hours in the liver and 360 hours in the kidney. 
Relatively long, reliable, tissue half-life values (> 500 hours) were observed in brain (medulla, 1105.9 
hours), eye (uvea, 1070.8 hours), adrenal gland (725.2 hours), spleen (606.7 hours), spinal cord 
(553.1 hours), and stomach (gastric mucosa, 531.6 hours). 
In the study using unlabelled inclisiran in the monkey with a single IV dose of 6 mg/kg or single SC 
doses of 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg or a loading SC dose of 6 mg/kg followed by three administrations of 3.0 
mg/kg monthly (QM) or six administrations of 3.0 mg/kg biweekly (Q2W) inclisiran was not detected in 
kidney and heart tissue with any dose regimen. Inclisiran was detectable in liver in all dose regimens, 
but only at the 8 hour post dose time point. At 8 hours post dose, the liver concentrations after SC 
administration of 6 mg/kg were approximately 16 fold higher than those after an IV administration of 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 34/143 
 
 
 
mg/kg. It should be noted that inclisiran was detectable in liver, kidney and heart samples collected 
from cynomolgus monkeys in the pivotal toxicology studies in which higher doses were administered. 
Regarding investigation of inclisiran liver tissue concentration, animals underwent obviously multiple 
times liver biopsy sampling. The reasoning for multiple sampling in the same animal was to save the 
number of monkeys used in this experiment performed rather early in drug development.  
The study using 20 mg/kg bw of 14C labelled inclisiran in the monkey the injection site was not 
investigated but qualitative whol- body autoradiographs performed in monkeys showed high levels of 
radioactivity at the injection site. Liver and kidney were the organs with the highest Cmax and AUC 
values with the Cmax values being similar and the AUC value for the liver being 20 to 30 times higher 
than that one of the kidney. The organ with the third highest exposure were found to be lymph nodes 
(about 5 times lower Cmax than for the liver). For the liver a half-life of about 2,000 hours was 
calculated, for the kidney a half-life of about 10,000 hours. For cardiac blood the long half-life of 672 
hrs was calculated. In response to a request, the applicant ascribes this long value to the high 
sensitivity of LSC. A significant drop in radioactivity was seen around 24 hours, and low levels of 
radioactivity in cardiac blood were detected up to 1008 hours. When the calculation of cardiac blood 
half-life is based on the time points between 4 and 24 hours only, a half-life of about 3.6 hrs is 
obtained which is more in line with values obtained using unlabeled inclisiran. The applicant has 
discussed possible effects of the high and long-lasting concentration of inclisiran as determined in 
livers and kidneys of monkeys. Slight increases in enzymatic markers (e.g. ALT) were seen but it is 
agreed that these slight changes were not considered adverse. Slight enzymatic changes were also 
reported in humans, but no overt liver or kidney toxicity was seen in humans. 
Inclisiran was stable when incubated in pooled serum obtained from mouse, rat, monkey, and human. 
Following 24 h incubation of inclisiran in mouse, rat, monkey, and human serum at 37°C, the percent 
of antisense strand remaining was approximately 85%, 82%, 72%, and 80%, respectively; the percent 
of sense strand remaining was approximately 95%, 91%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. 
Metabolism of inclisiran in rats and monkeys has been studied using unlabelled and 14C-labelled 
inclisiran. Inclisiran appears to be metabolised only to a limited extent. In both species the AS strand 
metabolites formed mainly from sequential exonuclease activity on the 5’ and 3’ ends.  
Using unlabelled inclisiran after SC administration parent substance and/or metabolites were detected 
in plasma from rats and monkeys at 0.5, 2, 8 and 24 hours (only for the monkey). For the sense 
strand only the parent strand or the parent strand with loss of one to three sugars could be detected in 
both species at the mentioned time points. Regarding the AS strand in both species only the parent 
strand or the parent strand with likely a 5´ end deletion of one nucleotide was detected with the 
exception of a minor amount (8%) of a 3´end truncation by 7 nucleotides at the time point of 2 hours 
in the monkey. Regarding formation of metabolites in the liver of rats and monkeys for both species 
only data obtained 8 hours after SC administration are available. Concerning later time points, data 
obtained at 72 hours for the monkey and 96 hours for the rat are available. With regard to the sense 
strand at the investigated time points, truncations only targeting the sugar moieties are the by far 
most prominent entity of metabolites yielding between 82 to 100% of total identified metabolites. 
Regarding the AS strand at 8 hours parent and by one nucleotide from the 3´end truncated AS strand 
constitute at least 97% of the detected antisense material. The same holds true at the 96 hours for the 
rat. In monkey liver at 72 hours parent and by one nucleotide from the 3´-end truncated antisense 
strand on the one hand side and by 6 or 7 nucleotides 5´end truncated metabolites with or without a 
one nucleotide 3´end truncation on the other hand side constitute both approximately half of the 
identified antisense material. 
Based on studies using 14C-labelled inclisiran AS(n-1) was determined to be the only metabolite 
consistently detected and quantifiable in all matrices investigated (plasma, urine, bile [only rat], 
Assessment report

Page 35/143 
 
 
 
faeces, liver, kidney, injection site [only rat]), although at markedly lower concentrations than the AS 
parent strand. As 5´ and 3´ end of the AS strand share the same terminal bases, a distinction between 
both ends could not be made. In rats and monkeys, based on their respective Cmax concentrations, 
AS(n-1) was 27.5-fold and 24-fold lower in plasma, respectively, and 35.1-fold and 9.5-fold lower in 
liver, respectively, and 62.4-fold and 13.7-fold lower in kidney, respectively, than the parent AS 
strand. The AS(n-2) metabolites were only detected in the urine from rats and urine and liver from 
monkeys, and at levels only slightly above the limits of quantitation. The other AS strand metabolites 
were not present in high quantities and encompassed a minor portion of the entire profile. 
The S strand of inclisiran is also not extensively metabolised. The major S strand metabolites in both 
species resulted from the sequential loss of the three GalNAc groups on the 3’ end, followed by the loss 
of their three associated linker groups. There were additional minor metabolites formed from 
successive loss of nucleotide groups from the 3’end and there is evidence for minor metabolism from 
the 5`end.  
Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination with approximately 29% and 32% of the administered 
dose  of  inclisiran  recovered  in  the  urine  of  rats  and  monkeys,  respectively,  over  a  7-day  period  with 
most of the amounts being excreted during the first 24 hours. Over the 7-day period in the rat 23% of 
the total dose were excreted via faeces, whereas only 1.6% were recovered from faeces in monkeys. 
The amount of radioactivity remaining in the carcasses of rats was determined after 96 hours and was 
approximately 39%. This correlates well with the long tissue retention time of inclisiran in tissues. 
Excretion  of  inclisiran  to  milk  was  observed  in  the  F0  generation  of  rats  dams.  High  inter-animal 
variability was observed in maternal milk data: overall, maternal mean plasma concentrations increased 
with increasing dose levels between 50 and 150 mg/kg/day; and the mean milk concentrations increased 
with increasing dose levels between 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, and the mean concentrations between 100 
and 150 mg/kg/day were  generally comparable. The inclisiran concentrations were generally lower in 
milk  compared  to  maternal  plasma  at  100  and  150  mg/kg/day  dose  levels.  At  50  mg/kg/day,  no 
conclusion  could  be  made  regarding  milk  to  plasma  ratios  due  to  inter-animal  variability  in  milk  and 
maternal plasma data. 
Inclisiran does not exhibit direct or time-dependent inhibitory potential towards seven human 
cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5), 
and inclisiran does not induce human CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. In addition, inclisiran does not act 
as a substrate or inhibitor of human transport proteins including MDR1, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, 
OCT2, OCT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2k, and BSEP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Toxicity studies were performed in mice, rat, rabbit and monkey. The choice of species is considered 
adequate. 
Single dose toxicity studies were not conducted. This approach is in line with the current view is that 
adequate information can be obtained from other sources than specific single dose toxicity studies 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 36/143 
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in mice rats, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. Three 
non-GLP compliant studies have been performed; one in male and female CD mice, one in male and 
female SD rats and one in male Cynomolgus monkeys. Inclisiran was administered subcutaneously 
once weekly for 4 weeks (5 doses in total) at doses of 0, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. Studies were 
accompanied by evaluation of toxicokinetics.  
There was no overt toxicity in these studies. The main findings were limited to disturbances in the lipid 
profile (decrease of LDL and cholesterol, to a lesser extend of HDL) which can most likely be attributed 
to the pharmacodynamic activity of inclisiran and some minor effects on liver (rat: deposits of neutral 
lipids; vacuolation in the highest dose group,), kidney (monkey: basophilic granules, rat: basophilic 
pigment, tubule; chronic progressive nephropathy, mineralisation, focal) and heart (minimal 
mononuclear cell infiltrate). 
GLP compliant studies were performed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. The studies were 
accompanied by toxicokinetic investigations. 
Three studies with a dosing phase of 4, 15 and 29 weeks were performed in rats. Inclisiran solved in 
saline was administered subcutaneously in a dose volume of 1.25 ml/kg in a variable dosing scheme 
into different predefined injection sites. In the 4-week study male and female animals received 0, 10, 
50, 250 mg/kg inclisiran every two weeks (=3 doses) or 10 mg/kg once weekly (= 5 doses). The 
recovery period was 8 weeks. The 4-week rat study (8302576) suffers several inaccuracies which can 
be traced back to inaccuracies in animal identification and group assignment and unplanned 
cohabitation. However, in the study program there are toxicity studies in rats of longer duration. The 
overall impact for marketing authorization appears therefore rather low.  
In the 15 weeks study male and female animals received 0, 10, 50, 250 mg/kg once monthly (=4 
doses) or 25 mg/kg (=8 doses) every two weeks. The recovery period was 8 weeks. 
In the 29 weeks study male and female rats received, 10, 50, 250 mg/kg once monthly (=8 doses). 
The recovery phase was 13 weeks. 
Three studies with a dosing phase of 4, 15 and 40 weeks were performed in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Inclisiran solved in saline was administered subcutaneously in a dose volume of 1.25 ml/kg (4 and 15 
weeks) or in a dose volume of 1.5 ml/kg (40 weeks) in a variable dosing scheme into different 
predefined injection sites. In the 4 weeks study male and female animals received 0, 10, 50, 250 
mg/kg every two weeks (=3 doses) or 30 mg/kg once weekly (=5 doses). The recovery phase was 8 
weeks. 
In the 15 weeks study male and female animals received 0, 10, 50 250 mg/ kg once monthly (= 4 
doses) or 125 mg/kg every two weeks (=8 doses). The recovery was 15 weeks. 
In the 40 weeks study male and female animals received 0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg once monthly (=11 
dose). The recovery was 13 weeks. 
All animals were investigated during the study course and at the end of the respective study for usual 
toxicological endpoints. Studies in monkeys were widened by investigations on PCSK, Anti-Drug 
Antibody (ADA) analysis, biomarkers (troponin I, DHEA, DHT) and T-cell dependent antibody response 
(TDAR/ IgM and IgG). 
In the 4, 15 and 29-week toxicology studies in rats, minimal to marked vacuolation was noted in 
hepatocytes of males and/or females in most dose groups. The vacuolation was characterised by 
microvesicular (numerous small vacuoles without nuclear displacement) and/or macrovesicular (a 
single large vacuole that displace the nucleus) types. Following the recovery periods in all three 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 37/143 
 
 
 
studies, the liver hepatocyte vacuolation was still present but the extent of the finding was greatly 
reduced indicating a decrease in severity and partial recovery. Following the recovery phase minimal to 
mild randomly distributed foci of slightly hypertrophied hepatocytes cytoplasm and central 
hyperchromatic nuclei of the basophilic type was present in one female from the 50 mg/kg and three 
females from the 250 mg/kg dose groups. A finding was not observed during the main phase of this 
study. The applicant´s conclusion that the finding of hepatic foci of cellular alteration is of uncertain 
relevance, and the nonclinical data do not indicate a potential human risk for neoplasia was agreed to.  
In the 4 week study in rats, basophilic granules considered minimal to slight were noted in the kidney 
tubule cell cytoplasm of animals in the 50 and 250 mg/kg dose groups, in the 15 week study, minimal 
to moderate basophilic granules were noted in the kidney tubular epithelium of animals in the 25, 50 
and 250 mg/kg dose groups, and in the 29 week study these findings were present in the 50 and 250 
mg/kg dose groups. In general, the basophilic material formed variably sized round vacuolated 
structures in the cytoplasm. Following the recovery periods in all three studies, the basophilic granules 
were characterised as minimal and limited to the 250 mg/kg dose groups. There were no microscopic 
kidney findings in the 4, 15 and 40-week monkey studies.  
The 4, 15 and 40-week toxicology studies in monkeys were not associated with vacuolation in 
hepatocytes. However, in the 15 and 40-week studies there were findings of basophilic granules in 
hepatocyte cytoplasm of several animals encompassing all dose groups. In the 15-week study the 
severity ranged from minimal to slight and in the 40 week study the severity ranged from minimal to 
mild. Following the recovery periods, the basophilic staining was not present in the low dose group (50 
mg/kg), indicating recovery, but still present in the mid (125 mg/kg) and high (250 mg/kg) dose 
groups in the 15 week study and present in all dose groups (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) in the 40 week 
study, but with decreased incidence and severity indicating partial recovery. 
The applicant points out that presence of vacuolation, particularly in the liver, and basophilic granules 
in the kidney were not associated with additional degenerative microscopic findings or consistent 
correlative changes in clinical pathology parameters including liver function enzymes and urinalysis 
parameters.  
In addition, there were indications that these findings were reversible signifying that the vacuolation 
and basophilic granules are not adverse toxicological findings. The content of these vacuoles/ 
basophilic granules was not investigated further, but the applicant believes that this material is 
inclisiran, which accumulates within the cells. This explanation is considered acceptable. 
A similar finding in the 4, 15 and 40-week studies in monkeys, was a minimal to moderate 
accumulation of vacuolated macrophages in the sinusoids of lymph nodes (mandibular, mesenteric, 
axillary, or inguinal) across all inclisiran dose groups. The macrophages were characterised by 
accumulations of foamy cytoplasmic vacuoles, with faintly basophilic staining often distending the 
cytoplasm. The finding was most common in the mesenteric and axillary lymph nodes. No dose 
relationship in severity was noted. Following the recovery periods, the vacuolated macrophages were 
still present but with decreased incidence and severity indicating partial recovery; however, following 
the recovery period in the 15 week study this finding was not present in the 10 mg/kg dose group 
indicating complete recovery at this dose. Considering the rather high tissue distribution of inclisiran 
into lymph nodes the basophilic material is most likely accumulated inclisiran. 
The primary clinical pathology findings across all studies and dose groups were changes in lipid profiles 
that were expected based on the pharmacologic activity of inclisiran. Reductions in LDL were consistent 
across all dose groups in the 4, 15 and 29-week toxicology studies in rats and 4, 15 and 40-week 
studies in monkeys. In addition, reductions in HDL were noted in the 4 and 15-week studies in rats but 
not in the monkey studies. Lipid profiles returned to control values during the recover periods. In 
addition, there were minimal increases in ALP in the high dose groups in rats in the 4 and 29-week 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 38/143 
 
 
 
studies and monkeys in the 4 and 40-week studies that returned to control values during the recovery 
periods. The applicant does not discuss that finding in detail but refers to the publication of Blom et al 
1998, indicating that the plasmatic ALP increase may be explained by the occupation of the galactose 
receptor by inclisiran and a therefore decreased plasmatic ALP clearance. This explanation appears to 
be acceptable. 
Neurological assessments were included in the pivotal repeat dose toxicology studies conducted in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. These involved evaluation of general behaviour and awareness, gait, postural 
reactions, and spinal and cranial nerves. There were no findings that were indicative of inclisiran 
related changes in CNS activity up to the highest doses tested. In addition, tissue distribution studies 
conducted with 14C-labelled inclisiran showed that the amount of inclisiran in the brain relatively low 
compared to the liver.  
Pro-inflammatory properties were investigated in a non-GLP study in monkeys and mice. There were 
no changes in levels of C-reactive protein, complement, and proinflammatory cytokines monkeys. In 
mice inclisiran did not significantly alter the levels of several different cytokines including G-CSF, IL-6, 
IP-10, KC, MCP-1, and TNF-α. 
Immunotoxicity was investigated in a 85 day toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. In this study 
inclisiran did not affect the generation of a TDAR following immunisation with KLH during the dosing or 
recovery periods. Anti-KLH IgM and IgG antibody titres for primary and secondary responses in 
inclisiran treated animals in all dose groups were similar to vehicle controls. In addition, in the same 
study, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry analysis showed that inclisiran did not impact total 
numbers of T-lymphocytes (CD45+/CD3+), T-helper (Th) lymphocytes (CD45+/CD3+/CD4+), T-
cytotoxic (Tc) lymphocytes (CD45+/CD3+/CD8+), B-lymphocytes (CD45+/CD3-/CD20+) and Natural 
Killer (NK) cells (CD45+/CD3-/CD16+). 
A GLP toxicology study was conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity of combined inclisiran and 
atorvastatin administration to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 85 days. There were no new or 
exacerbated toxicities observed when inclisiran and atorvastatin were coadministered compared to 
either test article alone. All inclisiran-related observations in the presence or absence of atorvastatin 
were similar to those noted in repeat dose toxicity studies. The NOAEL was 300 mg/kg for inclisiran 
when given alone and in combination with 25 mg/kg/day atorvastatin. In line with the SmPC inclisiran 
is also indicated in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. The respective combinations were not tested in animals. 
However, clinically significant interactions are not expected since no interactions with the CYP 450 
system or common drug transporters were evident and the distinct mode of action compared to other 
lipid lowering substances such as the recombinant human IgG monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 
(alirocumab and evolocumab) or ezetimibe. 
Although inclisiran was quantifiable at low levels in heart tissue samples, it did not associate with RISC 
indicating that there is a low likelihood that inclisiran will influence gene expression in tissues that do 
not express PCSK9. 
The calculated safety margins a based on the highest dose applied and are based on the NOAEL doses 
in the pivotal chronic toxicity studies. They are 99-fold and 101-fold based on Cmax and 48.9 fold and 
99.6 fold based on AUC in rats and monkeys, respectively, compared to the 300 mg human clinical 
dose. These safety margins are based on exposures generated from studies of once monthly dosing. 
The applicant points out that these would cover considerably more frequent administrations than the 
recommended dosing regimen of 300 mg initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months. 
However, the dose regime induces a persistent reduction in the lipid profile, which equals continuous 
application as indicated in humans. Considering this aspect, the data supports the application of 11 
injections, which would equal more than 4 years of clinical use.

Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests has been performed with inclisiran. 
Inclisiran was negative in in vitro Ames tests, a chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral 
blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo micronucleus test performed in rats. Therefore, inclisiran is not 
considered to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long- and short-term carcinogenicity studies with inclisiran have been performed in rats for 104 weeks 
and Tg-RasH2 mice for 26 weeks. In the rat study inclisiran was applied via the s.c. route at once 
monthly intervals up to 250 mg/kg. In the transgenic mice study inclisiran was applied via the s.c. 
route at once monthly intervals up to 1500 mg/kg. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study a significant 
increase of benign mammary fibroadenoma was noted in female rats in the 95 and 250 mg/kg dose 
groups. In addition, there was a statistically significant trend in mammary tumour combinations in 
females including mammary fibroadenoma in the 250 mg/kg dose group. As tumour incidences were 
small and in the range of published historical controls of the breeder, the rats were derived from, this 
is not a concern. Furthermore, no increase in tumour incidences was reported for the 40 mg/kg dose 
group (NOEL). Exposure at Day 197 in females was 25100 hr*ng/mL (AUClast). This corresponds to a 
safety margin of 3-fold compared to single human dose of 300 mg (AUC: 8590 hr*ng/mL, pooled PK 
analysis of combined data from healthy individuals in clinical studies ORION-6 and ORION-7). It has to 
be noted that in patients inclisiran will be initially administered, again at 3 months, and then every 6 
months, thus dosing frequency and long-term exposure to inclisiran in humans is much lower as in the 
rat carcinogenicity study. Furthermore, inclisiran was negative in the 26-weeks carcinogenicity study 
with transgenic Tg-RasH2 mice up to doses of 1500 mg/kg, which is >100-fold the anticipated human 
exposure. 
Overall, based on the results of the 2-year rat and 6-month transgenic mice carcinogenicity studies, 
inclisiran is not considered to be carcinogenic and mice and rats and does not indicate a carcinogenic 
potential in humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A complete set of reproductive and development toxicity studies as requested by the respective 
guidelines (ICH M3(R2), ICH S5) was performed for inclisiran in rats and rabbits. The choice of species 
for reproductive toxicity studies is considered adequate. 
Separate studies on male and female fertility were performed in rats with subcutaneous injection of 
inclisiran. The administration of inclisiran once every two weeks for 4 weeks to male rats with doses up 
to 250 mg/kg was not associated with paternal toxicity or effects on spermatogenesis, fertility or early 
embryonic development. 
Inclisiran was administered to female rats once every four days at doses up to 250 mg/kg beginning 
14 days prior to cohabitation and during mating, and then once daily at doses up to 150 mg/kg during 
gestation up to gestation day 7. Inclisiran treatment did not result in maternal toxicity or effects on 
female fertility or early embryonic development including ovarian and uterine parameters, oestrous 
cycles and maternal performance. The NOAEL for male and female fertility was thus established for 
each study at the highest dose level with exposure margins of 41, respectively 19-times based on 
AUC at the recommended human therapeutic dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 40/143 
 
 
 
Studies on embryo-foetal development with daily s.c. administration of inclisiran were performed in 
rats and rabbits. There was no evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity, -lethality or teratogenicity up to the 
highest dose administered in rats (150 mg/kg) with an exposure margin of 15-times as well as in 
rabbits (150 mg/kg) with an exposure margin of 37-times based on AUC at the recommended human 
therapeutic dose. 
Maternal to foetal plasma ratios in the rat were at least more than 60-fold depending on the dose. No 
inclisiran was detected in pooled foetal liver samples from the rat. There were no antibodies present in 
maternal plasma samples from the rabbit. 
Toxicokinetic data showed no accumulation of inclisiran after repeated administration in the pregnant 
rat and rabbit. In general, a dose proportional increase in exposure with increasing dose was observed 
for both species but for the lower dose levels in rats where a more than dose proportional increase was 
noticed. No gender differences in toxicokinetic parameters were observed between pregnant rats and 
male rats. 
Administration of inclisiran by s.c. injection from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 was well tolerated 
in F0 female rats with no evidence of maternal toxicity or effects on maternal performance up to a 
dose of 150 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on the development of the F1 generation, including 
survival, growth, physical and reflexological development, behaviour, and reproductive performance. 
Accordingly, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity, maternal performance and the development of the F1 
generation was 150 mg/kg/day. Inclisiran was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with milk to 
plasma ratios of 0.4 to 1.8-times. F1 generation pup plasma levels were below LLOQ. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic analysis indicated that inclisiran had a relatively short plasma half-life ranging from 0.76 
hours to 7.65 hours in rats and 1.8 hours to 16.5 hours (18.6 in females only) in monkeys. There were 
no gender differences in TK parameters. Exposure tended to increase in a dose proportional manner 
and there was no accumulation of inclisiran in plasma following repeat dosing. In a limited tissue 
analysis, inclisiran was found predominantly in the liver which is the target organ followed by the 
kidney which is the primary organ of elimination. Inclisiran was present at higher concentrations and 
exhibited a longer half-life in liver and kidney than plasma. There was a dose related increase in tissue 
exposure and there did not appear to be target organ (liver) saturation, even in mice administered 
inclisiran up to 1500 mg/kg. In the 15 and 40-week toxicology studies conducted in monkeys there 
were sporadic incidences of animals developing ADA at or near the end of the dosing periods. Five 
animals in the 15-week study and three animals in the 40 week study developed low titre ADA. Due to 
technical issues, the data set concerning the 40 weeks study is too limited to conclude on antibody 
formation and toxicokinetic parameters. However, there were no evidence for neutralising effects of 
these ADAs since no effect on PK (plasma or tissues) or PD (PCSK9 and lipid lowering) parameters 
were observed.  
Local Tolerance  
Dedicated local tolerance studies have not been conducted. However, Draize scoring as well as 
macroscopic and microscopic analysis of injection sites were conducted in all pivotal toxicology studies 
conducted in rats and monkeys. The dosing scheme applied prevents recurrent injections at the same 
side. In general, inclisiran was well tolerated at the injection sites despite of the rather high inclisiran 
residues. There were sporadic instances of local erythema and oedema associated with discoloration 
that ranged from very slight to moderate in severity that were self-limiting and not present following 
the recovery periods. Injection site microscopic findings were present in rats in the 29-week study and 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 41/143 
 
 
 
included minimal to moderate perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates and/or haemorrhage in males 
and females at ≥ 50 mg/kg. There was near compete resolution of these findings following the 
recovery period. There were no injection site microscopic findings in the monkey studies. Provided that 
the various injection sides will be used in clinical practice no overt local effects are expected. 
Other toxicity studies 
The absence of dedicated impurity studies is adequately justified. Impurities can be considered 
qualified based on the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of Inclisiran to the 
environment. The applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) in accordance to the 
EMA guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4470/00 (2006, corr 2). The ERA consists of a Phase I assessment. 
The calculated PEC value exceeds the action limit in Phase I, therefore, a Phase II assessment is 
required. The required Phase II assessment is pending, and its submission is committed by the 
applicant until 2021. 
In reference to the provided log DOW no further PBT assessment is necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of inclisiran were evaluated 
in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. The nonclinical testing strategy for inclisiran was 
consistent with existing regulatory guidance and scientific advises obtained during the development 
process. All pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). In 
one 4 weeks rat study technical inaccuracies were detected during the assessment process. However, 
these shortcomings do not influence the overall conclusion on the data set submitted. Despite there 
were some deviations in the non-clinical development program, no major concerns have been 
identified from non-clinical point of view and the applicant was able to respond adequately on the 
various Other Concerns initially raised. 
Pharmacodynamics of inclisiran was demonstrated in transgenic mice and monkeys. 
The four animal species used for non-clinical studies, especially the general and reproductive 
toxicology studies, are considered relevant. Non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated after 
SC administration preferred liver uptake, the site of intended action of inclisiran. In the rat SC injection 
sites were investigated and it was shown that the highest tissue concentration was demonstrated for 
this tissue. This phenomenon is not species specific.  
The studies on toxicity identified no overt toxicity. Inclisiran showed no reproductive toxicity. The 
calculated safety margins are based on the highest dose applied and are based on the NOAEL doses in 
the pivotal chronic toxicity studies. They are 99-fold and 101-fold based on Cmax and 48.9-fold and 
99.6-fold based on AUC in rats and monkeys, respectively, compared to the 300 mg human clinical 
dose. The safety margins obtained in reproductive toxicity studies are slightly lower, but sufficient. 
These safety margins are based on exposures generated from studies of once monthly dosing. The 
Assessment report

applicant points out that these would cover considerably more frequent administrations than the 
recommended dosing regimen of 300 mg initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months. 
The dose regime used in non-clinical toxicology studies induces a persistent reduction in the lipid 
profile, which equals the effects seen in humans with the intended clinical application scheme. 
Considering this aspect, the data supports the application of 11 injections, which would equal more 
than 4 years of clinical use. Considering this aspect, the high inclisiran concentrations remaining at the 
injection sites may be of importance. However, provided that various injection sites will be used in 
clinical practice no overt local effects are expected. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Inclisiran showed no overt toxicity in the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. Inclisiran 
showed no reproductive toxicity. Inclisiran was not genotoxic in vitro and in vivo nor revealed it a 
carcinogenic potential in rats and mice. There are no objections against marketing authorisation from 
the nonclinical viewpoint.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Inclisiran is a double-stranded 21-23mer small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) designed to inhibit 
the production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Inclisiran is conjugated at the 
sense strand with triantennary GalNAc to facilitate hepatic uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor 
(ASGPR).  
Inclisiran is intended for use as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the 
treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidaemia (including heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is administered by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection from a prefilled syringe at a dose of 300 mg inclisiran sodium (284 mg 
inclisiran free acid).  
No absolute bioavailability and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies in 
human have been performed for inclisiran. The PK of inclisiran in human has been evaluated in four 
Phase I studies (ALN-PCSSC-001, ORION-6, ORION-7 and ORION-12) following single subcutaneous 
doses of 25 mg to 900 mg inclisiran sodium.  
No relative bioavailability or bioequivalence studies have been conducted, since the drug product used 
throughout the clinical program was the same except for the volume filled in the single-use container 
and a change from single-use vial to the prefilled syringe with no concomitant changes in PD effects, 
safety or tolerability of inclisiran noted.  
Plasma concentrations are not directly related to the pharmacodynamic effects, which last for several 
months. Due to the large temporal disconnect observed, the dose-response relationship was 
characterised using a population PD model. 
Absorption  
After a 300mg single dose inclisiran sodium SC in healthy human subjects, inclisiran is absorbed from 
the SC injection site (abdomen) into plasma with median Tmax (range) of 6 hours (0.5 to 12 hours) and 
is detectable in plasma up to 48 hours post dose. Inclisiran is rapidly cleared from the plasma with a 
mean half-life (t½) of 9.58 hours and mean Cmax and AUC0-inf amounted to 509 ng/mL and 7980 
ng/mL*h, respectively. 
PK of inclisiran after single SC administration of 300mg inclisiran sodium appeared similar in subjects 
with elevated LDL-C as compared to healthy subjects.  
After multiple dose SC administration of 300mg inclisiran sodium, means for Cmax, AUC0-tau and t½ in 
subjects with elevated LDL-C were 750 ng/mL, 15586 ng/mL*h and 3.59 h off statins, and 1252 
ng/mL, 18860 ng/mL*h and 7.36 h on statins, respectively.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution of inclisiran was estimated approximately 500 L in healthy adults 
following single 300 mg SC doses of inclisiran sodium. Apparent clearance in healthy subjects was 
estimated 38.1 L/hour.  
Elimination 
Apparent clearance in healthy subjects was estimated 38.1 L/hour.  
Based on non-clinical data, initial blood clearance of inclisiran appears to occur through high liver 
distribution. It was estimated that approximately 82.5% elimination of inclisiran from plasma is due to 
hepatic uptake. Besides hepatic uptake, renal clearance was identified a main route of elimination of

unchanged inclisiran from plasma in human. 15.9% of unchanged inclisiran was excreted in urine over 
48 hours following a single oral SC dose of 300 mg inclisiran sodium. The mean (SD) renal clearance 
(CLR) was 6.18 (1.62) L/h in healthy subjects. 
Although rapidly cleared from plasma, inclisiran exhibits a slow elimination half-life from liver based on 
non-clinical QWBA (270 hours in rats; > 1980 hours in monkeys), and does not appear to undergo 
extensive metabolism.  
The metabolism of inclisiran was evaluated in vitro in human, mouse, rat and monkey serum and liver 
S9 fractions, and in vivo in rat and monkey plasma and liver samples. While inclisiran was relatively 
stable after 24 hours incubation in human serum in vitro with 80% of the antisense and 87% of the 
sense strand remaining, in human liver S9 fractions, slow degradation especially of the antisense 
strand appears to take place with only 41% of the antisense and 71% of the sense strand remaining 
after 24 hours incubation. Metabolic profiling in human serum and liver S9 fractions did not identify 
any metabolites unique to human in vitro. Inclisiran appears to be primarily metabolised by non-
specific nucleases to shorter nucleotides of varying length.  
In vivo, full-length inclisiran parent was the major component in human plasma obtained from healthy 
subjects. The AS(n-1)3’ and AS(n-1)5’ metabolites were also detected and their kinetics appeared to 
parallel that of inclisiran. The plasma concentration ratios of metabolite AS(n-1) relative to the parent 
AS strand increased from 0.5 hours to 48 hours post dose. Metabolites AS(n-2)3’ and AS(n-2)5’ were 
not detected. Metabolic profiling has not been investigated in clinical urine samples. 
As in the renal impairment study ORION-7, unexplained high antisense to sense strand ratios above 
the normal range were observed for inclisiran in several subjects with renal impairment, especially in 
urine, but not in subjects with normal renal function in this and other studies, and also not in the urine 
of monkeys in non-clinical studies, and the safety data in severe renal impairment are too limited to 
draw a definite conclusion, inclisiran should be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment which is reflected in the PI.  
The applicant argued that the potential of the antisense strand or metabolites thereof for off-target 
effects is negligible. From a set of 20 potential off-target transcripts identified by an in silico approach, 
the response of 18 transcripts endogenously expressed in the hepatocyte cell line Hep3b was 
measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and no substantial inhibition by inclisiran was found. However, 
two potential targets, namely SULF1 (NM_015170.2) and FAM196B (NM_001129891.1), could not be 
analysed in this study because they are not expressed in the hepatocyte cell line Hep3b. The applicant 
stated that as inclisiran is targeted to the liver and has not been shown to silence genes in tissues 
outside of liver, these two targets were not considered as genes that could be silenced by inclisiran. 
The applicant did not provide any information on whether these two transcripts are expressed in the 
renal tubular epithelial cells, or in other cells for which there is evidence of ASGPR expression, such as 
dendritic cells and monocytes. Hence, the possibility for off-target effects of inclisiran cannot be fully 
ruled out. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Inclisiran PK was found approximately dose proportional in subjects with elevated LDL-C, with doses 
ranging from 25 mg to 800 mg, and does not accumulate with multiple dosing.  
The variability appeared mostly moderate, although high variability was sometimes observed. 
In vitro plasma protein binding was concentration dependent with higher protein binding at lower 
inclisiran concentrations. At therapeutic concentrations, inclisiran was approximately 87% protein 
bound in human plasma.

Special populations 
Evaluation of the effects of body weight, age, gender and race on inclisiran PK suggested that only 
body weight was a statistically significant covariate on inclisiran PK parameters (p < 0.001), Tmax 
excluded. Age (in the analysed range of 20 to 70 years), gender and race had no impact on inclisiran 
PK. The observed differences in PK of inclisiran by body weight do not appear to have any significant 
impact on the overall clinical response to inclisiran treatment based on the population PD analyses. 
The effect of mild, moderate and severe renal impairment on the PK of inclisiran has been investigated 
in a dedicated study (ORION-7). Significant increases in inclisiran exposures were revealed, with 
greatest increases (3.31-fold for Cmax and 2.33-fold for AUC0-48) in subjects with severe renal 
impairment. However, inclisiran was not detectable in the plasma of any of the patient groups beyond 
48 hours and higher exposure of inclisiran was not correlative to the PD response.  
The effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and of haemodialysis on inclisiran PK have not been 
studied. Based on the relationship observed between inclisiran clearance (systemic and renal) and 
creatinine clearance, an increase in inclisiran exposures to levels that are not higher than the 
exposures observed in prior clinical studies and considered safe was predicted. It was concluded that 
no dose adjustment of inclisiran in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, as well as 
ESRD is necessary. Given the infrequent and transient exposures to inclisiran that can be expected 
based on the long dosing interval (initially, after 3 months and then every 6 months) and short t½ of 
inclisiran in plasma, this appeared acceptable. However, based on differences in the antisense to sense 
ratios noted solely in several subjects with renal impairment (see above) and the safety data in severe 
renal impairment being too limited to draw a final conclusion, inclisiran should be used with caution in 
patients with severe renal impairment. As regards the effect of haemodialysis, the applicant reasoned 
that as inclisiran was undetectable in the plasma of patients with severe renal impairment within 72 
hours or less, it is recommended to dose inclisiran at least 72 hours before or any time after a 
haemodialysis session to avoid any potential impact on inclisiran PK. 
The effect of mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment on PK of 
inclisiran has been evaluated in a dedicated study (ORION-6). Inclisiran exposure increased with 
hepatic impairment. While subjects with mild hepatic impairment had similar inclisiran Cmax and 1.33-
fold higher inclisiran AUCinf, subjects with moderate hepatic impairment had 2.1-fold higher inclisiran 
Cmax and 2.04-fold higher inclisiran AUCinf as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, 
respectively. Regardless of hepatic status, inclisiran was undetectable in plasma within 96 hours.  
It was concluded that no dose adjustment of inclisiran is considered necessary in subjects with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. The ORION-6 study did not include subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment, therefore the effects of inclisiran in these subjects are unknown. Based on the linear 
regression analyses, subjects with severe hepatic impairment are anticipated to have Cmax and AUC 
that are approximately 2.5- to 4-fold higher than the respective mean exposures in subjects with 
normal hepatic function, which is still less than the exposures observed in prior clinical studies and 
considered safe. It is proposed that inclisiran should be used with caution in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment as no data are available. 
Overall, hepatic impairment increases systemic exposure in the plasma but the half-life of inclisiran 
remains short and levels are undetectable within 96 hours as compared to 48h in normal hepatic 
function. According to the applicant, there is currently no evidence from non-clinical and clinical studies 
to suggest that this temporary and modest increase in systemic exposure correlates to an impact on 
the safety profile of inclisiran.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The results of in vitro DDI assessments indicated a very low risk for CYP- or transporter-related clinical 
PK interactions at clinically relevant concentrations; therefore, no dedicated in vivo DDI studies were 
performed. In vitro, inclisiran showed no direct inhibitory potential against CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8. 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 with IC50 values of >612 μM in all cases. Inclisiran had no 
potential for time-dependent inhibition of these CYP enzymes at concentrations up to 612µM. Inclisiran 
showed no potential for induction of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. It is anticipated that inclisiran is not 
a substrate for CYP enzymes, but this has not been investigated and is reflected accordingly in the PI. 
Inclisiran is not an inhibitor of human OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2k, 
MDR1, or BCRP in vitro. No active inclisiran transport was observed for human OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2k, MDR1, or BCRP in vitro. Active OAT1 transport could not be completely 
excluded, but is not likely. Inclisiran is not a substrate or an inhibitor of human OCT1, OCT3 or BSEP 
transporters in vitro. 
The potential risk of PK DDI upon statin coadministration was investigated in ALN-PCSSC-001 (effect of 
statin on inclisiran PK) and ORION-10 (effect of inclisiran on statin PK). In study ALN-PCSSC-001, co-
administration resulted in slightly increased plasma exposure to inclisiran, and at the 300 mg dose 
level in higher t½, lower CL/F, CLR and Fe values, but the effect appeared to be attenuated at higher 
dose level, especially after multiple dose administration. In study ORION-10, PK drug-drug interaction 
between inclisiran as a perpetrator and atorvastatin or rosuvastatin could not be ruled out. However, 
based on limitations observed (i.a. noncrossover study design, the very small number of subjects 
(ALN-PCSSC-001), and very sparse PK sampling, variability observed and population PK model applied 
(ORION-10)), the conclusions to be drawn from the two studies are limited. Based on the totality of 
the data, including assumed lack of biological plausibility of a PK interaction, the long dosing interval 
and short t1/2 of inclisiran, it was concluded that there is no clinically significant drug-drug interaction 
between statins and inclisiran and that statins and inclisiran can be co-administered in combination 
without a need for statin dose adjustment. 
Overall conclusion on PK 
No absolute bioavailability and human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies have been performed for inclisiran. Given these limitations, and the lack of metabolic profiling 
in clinical urine samples, pharmacokinetics of inclisiran has been sufficiently characterised. Inclisiran is 
absorbed from the SC injection site (abdomen) into plasma with Tmax ranging between 0.5 to 12 hours 
and is detectable in plasma up to 48 hours post dose. Inclisiran is rapidly cleared from the plasma with 
a half-life of ~9 hours. Based on non-clinical studies, the majority of inclisiran is taken up by the liver, 
the target organ of effect. Renal clearance is a main route of elimination of unchanged inclisiran from 
plasma in human; about 16% of unchanged inclisiran is excreted in urine following single SC 
administration of 300 mg inclisiran sodium. Inclisiran PK is approximately dose proportional with doses 
ranging from 25 mg to 800 mg, has a short plasma half-life, and does not accumulate with multiple 
dosing. Based on in vitro data, there is a low risk for CYP- or transporter-related clinical PK interactions 
at clinically relevant concentrations. Plasma concentrations are not directly related to the 
pharmacodynamic effects, which last for several months. The applicant has not proposed any changes 
to the dosing recommendations in subjects with various stages of renal impairment as well as in 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment despite significant increases in exposures 
observed in these subjects as compared to healthy subjects. This may be acceptable from a PK point of 
view, given the infrequent and transient exposures to inclisiran that can be expected based on the long 
dosing interval (initially, after 3 months and then every 6 months) and short t½ of inclisiran in plasma, 
however as differences in the antisense to sense ratios have been noted solely in several subjects with

renal impairment and the safety data in severe renal impairment is too limited to draw a final 
conclusion, inclisiran should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.   
Plasma concentrations are not directly related to the pharmacodynamic effects, which last for several 
months. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Inclisiran is a chemically synthesised, long-acting, subcutaneously delivered, siRNA double-stranded 
oligonucleotide directed against PCSK9 that is covalently linked to a ligand containing three GalNAc 
residues. These carbohydrates bind to abundant liver-expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), 
leading to inclisiran uptake specifically into hepatocytes. 
When introduced into the hepatocyte, inclisiran engages the natural pathway of RNA interference 
(RNAi) by binding intracellularly to the RISC, enabling it to cleave messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules 
encoding PCSK9 specifically. The cleaved PCSK9 mRNA is degraded and thus unavailable for protein 
translation, which results in decreased levels of the PCSK9 protein. A single siRNA-bound RISC is 
catalytic and cleaves many transcripts and the duration of action is anticipated to be longer than other 
mechanisms.

The decrease in PCSK9 triggers a reduced breakdown of LDLR and thus an increased reduction of LDL-
C in plasma. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Phase I and phase II PK / PD studies 
The proof-of concept first in human study in healthy subjects, a PD single- and multiple-ascending 
dose study (ALN-PCSSC-001), showed that the dose response for decrease in PCSK9 over time 
correlated well with the dose responses for a decrease in LDL-C.  
The study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of ALN-PCSSC in 2 phases: a 
single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. The enrolled cohorts are 
presented in the table below. 
Table 3.3.2.1: Planned and Optional Cohorts Enrolled in Study ALN-PCSSC-001 
In the SAD phase, subjects with LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) who were not on statin medication 
were enrolled in a total of 6 cohorts. Each cohort was composed of 4 subjects randomised 3:1 to 
receive a single dose of ALN-PCSSC or placebo, respectively. 
The mean (SD) baseline LDL-C concentrations ranged from 3.50 (0.149) mmol/L to 4.76 (1.210) 
mmol/L across treatment groups. A dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C concentrations was observed 
up to 300 mg inclisiran as single dose, at which there was a plateauing of dose effect, and was 
maintained through Day 180, the last day measured, in all inclisiran treatment groups, except for the 
25 mg dose.

to 300 mg inclisiran, at which there was a plateauing of dose effect. Reductions in PCSK9 from baseline 
were maintained through Day 180, the last day measured, in all inclisiran treatment groups, except for 
the 25 mg and 100 mg doses.

The largest mean percent reduction from baseline at the individual nadir was observed at 800 mg 
inclisiran (-82.3%) and at the group nadir at 800 mg inclisiran (79.4% at Day 98). 
In the MD phase, subjects with LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) were enrolled in 6 cohorts (4 
cohorts of subjects without statin co-medication, 2 cohorts of subjects with statin co-medication). Each 
cohort was composed of 8 subjects randomised 3:1 (in blocks of 4 subjects) to ALN-PCSSC or placebo, 
respectively. 
The mean (SD) baseline LDL-C concentrations ranged from 3.35 (0.643) mmol/L to 3.93 (1.864) 
mmol/L across treatment groups. A plateauing of dose effect was observed for all inclisiran dose 
groups and dose frequencies. Reductions in LDL-C from baseline were maintained through 180 days 
after the last dose for each inclisiran treatment group.

The largest mean percent reduction of LDL-C from baseline at the individual nadir was observed at 
300 mg inclisiran without statin (-64.4%) and at the group nadir at 300 mg inclisiran without statin 
(55.7% at Day 70). The mean percent reductions at the individual and group nadirs were similar within 
300 mg and 500 mg groups regardless of statin co-medication use and the time to group nadir was the 
same at each dose level. 
The mean (SD) baseline PCSK9 concentrations ranged from 276.23 (58.686) μg/L to 460.69 (209.435) 
μg/L across treatment groups, including subjects who received placebo. A plateauing of dose effect 
was observed for all inclisiran dose groups and dose frequencies. Reductions in PCSK9 from baseline 
were maintained through 180 days after the last dose for each inclisiran treatment group.

The largest mean percent reduction from baseline at the individual nadir was observed at 500 mg 
inclisiran with statin (-88.5%) and at the group nadir at 500 mg inclisiran with statin (85.2% at Day 
84). The mean percent reductions at the individual nadirs were similar within 300 mg and 500 mg 
groups regardless of statin co-medication use, and the time to group nadir was the same at each dose 
level. 
In both administration phases dose-dependent reductions from baseline were observed in total 
cholesterol (TC), non-HDL-C, and apo-lipoprotein B (Apo-B), with a plateauing of dose effect observed 
at 300 mg inclisiran.

Reductions were also observed in lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] beginning at 100 mg inclisiran. There were no 
dose-dependent trends in increases in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), with maximum 
increases observed at 300 mg inclisiran. 
Exposure-response relationship phase II study 
In the phase II study ORION-1, a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled dose response study to 
assess the effect of inclisiran injection(s) on efficacy, safety, and tolerability in subjects with ASCVD or 
ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g. diabetes and FH) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated dose of 
LDL-C lowering therapies, the PK/PD relationship of 200 mg, 300 mg, and 500 mg inclisiran, 
respectively, administered as single dose or 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg inclisiran on day 1 and day 
90 as multiple dose has been investigated.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 180. 
Secondary efficacy parameters included the change from baseline LDL-C, change from baseline in lipids 
and lipoproteins including TC, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, VLDL, Apo-A1, Apo-B, Lp(a), 
CRP, and PCSK9. 
All randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and had both the baseline and 
the 180-day follow-up LDL-C assessment. Treatment classification was based on the randomised 
treatment. This was the primary population for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints 
(mITT-Population). 
Single dose group 
Results of study ORION-1 in the single dose groups for the primary endpoint showed a mean 
percentage LDL-C reduction of 27.9%, 38.4%, and 41.9% following single doses of 200 mg, 300 mg, 
and 500 mg inclisiran, respectively, compared to a 2.1% increase in the placebo group (all p<0.0001) 
for the mITT Population.  
Results of the secondary endpoints percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 
104, 120, 150, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, and 360 showed a LDL-C reduction at all timepoints with all 
doses of inclisiran. The LS mean reductions from baseline at specific timepoints (Days 30, 60, 90, 120, 
150, and 180) ranged from 27.93% to 44.33% after a single dose of 200 mg, from 38.39% to 50.62% 
after a single dose of 300 mg, and from 41.10% to 50.87% after a single dose of 500 mg. In the 
placebo group, LS mean changes from baseline ranged between increases of 2.13% and decreases of 
3.73% over time and the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 360 was 29.8% after a single 
dose of 200 mg, 29.5% after a single dose of 300 mg, and 28.4% after a single dose of 500 mg. In the 
placebo group, the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 360 was 13.4%.

Likewise, PCSK9 levels were reduced through Day 360 (mean reductions 33.4%, 36.5%, and 39.2% at 
200 mg, 300 mg, and 500 mg inclisiran, respectively). PCSK9 levels were unaffected in the placebo 
group through Day 360.

Double dose group 
Results for the primary endpoint in the double dose groups of study Orion-1 showed a mean 
percentage LDL-C reduction of 35.5%, 44.9%, and 52.6% following two doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 
300 mg inclisiran, respectively, compared to a 1.8% increase in the placebo group (all p<0.0001) for 
the mITT Population. 
Results for the secondary endpoint percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Days 30, 60, 90, 120, 
150, and 180 showed LS mean reductions from baseline ranging from 34.09% to 40.99% with two 
doses of 100 mg, from 43.91% to 50.18% with two doses of 200 mg, and from 44.19% to 54.87% 
with two doses of 300 mg. In the placebo group, LS mean changes from baseline ranged between 
increases of 1.82% and decreases of 3.66% over time. 
The maximum LS mean LDL-C reduction of 54.87% was observed at Day 150 following the 
administration of 300 mg inclisiran on Day 1 and Day 90. Although there was some return to group 
baseline values, the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 360 after two doses of 100 mg was 
17.6%, after two dose of 200 mg 32.3%, and after two dose of 300 mg 33.8%. In the placebo group, 
the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 360 was 10.9%. 
Figure 3.3.2.12: Percent Change from Baseline Beta-Quantification LDL-C (mg/dL) by Dose Group over 
Time – mITT Population + Double Dose 
PCSK9 levels were reduced through Day 360 (mean reductions of 22.6%, 44.6%, and 40.6% at doses 
of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg, respectively). PCSK9 levels were unaffected in the placebo group 
through Day 360.

Figure 3.3.2.13: Percent Change from Baseline PCSK9 (ng/mL) by Dose Group over Time – mITT

The maximum reductions in PCSK9 and LDL-C observed in study ORION-1 were similar to the 
maximum reductions observed in study ALN-PCSSC-001, with both PCSK9 and LDL-C returning 
towards baseline slowly after the Day 90 dose. LDL-C lowering on Day 270 was similar to Day 90, 
suggesting a 6-month dosing regimen would be sufficient to maintain efficacy. The 300 mg dose given 
on Day 1 and Day 90 achieved a maximum LDL-C reduction of 56%, and had a greater effect than 
either the 100 mg or 200 mg doses. These results confirmed that less frequent doses of 300 mg 
inclisiran sodium are sufficient to achieve and maintain the PD response. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Renal impairment 
The safety, PK, and PD of inclisiran was studied in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment following administration of a single SC injection of 300 mg inclisiran in study ORION-7:  
”A single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study to assess the pharmacokinetics of inclisiran in subjects 
with renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function”. 
The primary objectives were to quantify the effect of different degrees of renal impairment on the PK 
of inclisiran and to assess safety and tolerability in order to develop dosing recommendations for 
subjects with renal impairment. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of inclisiran on lipids, lipoproteins (TC, triglycerides, 
HDL-C, LDL-C calculated and measured by beta-quantification), and PCSK9 protein levels measured as 
a percentage of change from baseline. 
Subjects were planned to be classified into 1 of the 4 groups: 3 groups with renal impairment (mild, 
moderate, severe impairment) as defined by their creatinine clearance (CrCl) and 1 group of healthy 
volunteers. The subjects with normal renal function received the study drug after the renal impaired 
subjects to ensure comparable average demographics regarding age, body weight, and proportional 
race and gender. 
Assessment report

Reductions in the calculated LDL-C (mg/dL) were similar across all groups of renal function. The mean 
baseline LDL-C levels were 129.3, 142.9, 117.1, and 99.0 mg/dL in subjects with normal renal function 
and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. Reduction in the mean levels of 
calculated LDL-C was observed from 4 hours postdose on Day 1. 
Reductions in the beta-quantification LDL-C (mg/dL) were similar across all groups of renal function. 
The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 135.7, 139.0, 112.9, and 95.4 mg/dL in subjects with normal 
renal function and with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. Reduction in the 
mean levels of beta-quantification LDL-C was observed from 4 hours postdose on Day 1.

over Time 
It should be noted that the effect of inclisiran in subjects requiring haemodialysis on inclisiran PK has 
not been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety, PK, and PD of a single 300 mg SC injection of inclisiran sodium was studied in patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to matched controls in study ORION-6: 
“A Phase I, open-label trial to evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of inclisiran 
administered subcutaneously in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to 
subjects with normal hepatic function”. 
Subjects with normal hepatic function were dosed after dosing of hepatic impaired subjects in order to 
ensure comparable matching of subjects. Matched subjects with normal hepatic function were enrolled 
on a 1 to 1 basis and were not matched to more than 1 hepatically impaired subject within each 
hepatic function group. 
Hepatic impairment subjects were classified at screening by hepatic function based on the Child-Pugh 
(CP) assessment. Scoring of CP assessment was repeated at check-in (Day 1).  
Decreases in LDL-C from Baseline to Day 60 were reported for all groups. Subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment had the lowest mean change (%) from baseline on Day 60. 
Subjects with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic function had little changes in LDL-C between 
Day 30 and Day 60, whereas subjects with moderate hepatic impairment had a mean change from 
baseline of -22.0% and -39.7% on Day 30 and Day 60, respectively, suggesting that inclisiran may 
take longer to reach peak effectiveness in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.

Figure 3.3.2.15: Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), Mean Percent Change from Baseline ± SD

Mean baseline PCSK9 was 327.9 ng/mL and 197.1 ng/mL for subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment (normal range 160 ng/mL to 521 ng/mL). Subject 133 had markedly higher PCSK9 at 
baseline compared to other subjects in the moderate group, which impacted baseline mean values and 
interpretation of data. 
Decreases in PCSK9 from baseline to Day 60 were reported for all groups. The decrease was less 
pronounced in the group of subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. These subjects, particularly 
those with the highest CP score, had markedly lower mean PCSK9 levels at baseline compared to the 
subjects with mild or no hepatic impairment, which may account for the difference in effect. Within the 
group of subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, those with the greatest degree of impairment (CP 
score of 9) responded the least to inclisiran.

Subjects with normal and mild hepatic impairment responded as expected to inclisiran in terms of LDL-
C and PCSK9 reduction while the responses among subjects with moderate hepatic impairment varied. 
Subjects with a CP score of 9, who had low PCSK9 at baseline (Day 1), showed less reduction in PCSK9

and LDL-C, even with the exclusion of Subject 118, who had an increase in LDL-C. Subjects with a CP 
score of 7, who had normal PCSK9 at baseline, responded as expected with a mean reduction of PCSK9 
of -59.5% and mean LDL-C reduction of 50.1%.  
In the Day 60 to Day 180 addendum, where the results were presented up to Day 180, all subject 
groups had decreases in LDL-C on Day 180 compared to baseline. The greatest decreases were 
observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function.

pronounced in the group of subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. These subjects, particularly

subjects with mild or no hepatic impairment, which may account for the difference in effect.

QT prolongation 
The thorough QT study ORION-12 was a phase I randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- 
and positive-controlled, 3-way crossover study in healthy subjects with a supratherapeutic single SC 
injection of inclisiran 900 mg (3-fold the therapeutic dose), inclisiran placebo, and a single oral dose of 
moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control). 
The primary objective was to assess the effect of a supratherapeutic dose of inclisiran on cardiac 
repolarisation as assessed by the QT interval corrected (QTc) for heart rate (HR) using the Fridericia 
correction (QTcF). Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of inclisiran on other 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters of HR, PR, RR, QRS, ST-, T-, and U-wave morphology, and QTc 
for HR using the Bazett correction if QTcF failed to adequately correct, to assess the effect on QTcF in 
relation to plasma levels of inclisiran using exploratory concentration-effect modelling, to evaluate the 
assay sensitivity using oral moxifloxacin as an active control, to evaluate the PK profile after a single 
dose of 900 mg inclisiran sodium, to evaluate the effect of inclisiran on PCSK9 and LDL-C, and to 
assess safety and tolerability in healthy subjects after a single dose of 900 mg inclisiran. 
Following a supratherapeutic 900 mg dose of inclisiran sodium, the geometric mean Cmax was 
2643 ng/mL (geometric CV% 43.6%) and occurred at a median Tmax of 4.003 hours postdose. The 
geometric mean AUC0-24, AUC0-48, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf were 34890 h*ng/mL, 38190 h*ng/mL, 
37030 h*ng/mL, and 39,110 h*ng/mL, respectively. The geometric mean t1/2 was 5.834 hours and 
geometric mean CL/F and Vd/F were 21.78 L/h and 183.3 L, respectively.  
Observed QT was corrected for the influence of HR with the Fridericia formula. The adequacy of the 
correction formula was assessed by determining the linear relationship of QTcF to the RR interval 
(60,000 ÷ HR). Adequacy was defined as a population of QTcF: RR slope of <|0.045|, and a slope of 
<|0.045| in at least 50% of individual subjects. The prespecified criteria for adequacy of the correction 
were met. 
The maximum predicted ddQTcF during the study, which occurred near Cmax at 4 hours, was 2.5 msec 
(90% CI 0.6, 4.5 msec) for inclisiran and 11.4 msec (90% CI 9.5, 13.4 msec) for moxifloxacin. Thus, 
inclisiran had no clinically significant effect on QTcF, while moxifloxacin had the expected substantial 
effect. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020

The dQTcF-plasma concentration relationship was assessed in an exploratory analysis to support the 
central tendency analysis. The model included dQTcF as the dependent variable and baseline QTcF, 
treatment, timepoint, and plasma concentration as independent variables. The dQTcF-concentration 
relationship was not statistically significant (p=0.0772). At the inclisiran mean Cmax observed in this 
study (2888 ng/mL), the model-predicted ddQTcF was 1.9 msec (90% CI 0.64, 3.17 msec). At the 
maximum individual inclisiran concentration observed in this study (8430 ng/mL), the model-predicted 
ddQTcF was 5.7 msec (90% CI 1.14, 10.27 msec). At the mean Cmax observed in a previous study 
(ORION-7) at the therapeutic dose of 300 mg in severe renal impairment (1760 ng/mL), the model-
predicted ddQTcF was 1.1 msec (90% CI 0.34, 1.92 msec). Thus, inclisiran had no clinically significant 
effect on QTcF at systemic exposures that significantly exceeded those likely to be obtained at 
therapeutic doses. 
No clinically significant group changes in QTcF, HR, PR interval, and QRS interval were observed, and 
there were no categorical values or change values of concern, and no pattern of drug effect except for 
the expected effect of moxifloxacin. Inclisiran appears to have no clinically or statistically significant 
effects on the ECG in humans at a supratherapeutic dose of 900 mg, 3-fold the therapeutic dose. 
Exposure-response relationship in phase III studies 
Similar exposure-response relationships as compared with the phase I study ALN-PCSSC-001 and the 
phase II study ORION-1 were observed in the 3 phase III studies, i.e. study ORION-9 conducted in 
subjects with HeFH, study ORION-10 conducted in subjects with ASCVD, and study ORION-11 
conducted in subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD-risks equivalents. 
Treatment with inclisiran 300 mg given by SC injection on Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months 
thereafter resulted in 50 to 58% lowering of LDL-C relative to placebo at Day 510 and a time-averaged 
44 to 54% lowering of LDL-C after Day 90 through Day 540 across the phase III studies and similar 
effects in PCSK9 reduction.  
Inclisiran lowered Apo-B approximately 40%, supporting a mechanism of action of increased LDLR 
expression, lowered non-HDL and did not have any clinically significant impact on HDL-C or 
triglycerides. 
Inclisiran lowered LDL-C by -53.9% in patients not on statin (statin intolerant) and by –54.5% in 
patients on statin treatment.

PK/PD modelling 
A population PD analysis was carried out evaluating PD profiles of PCSK9 and LDL-C levels after SC 
injection of inclisiran using a turnover model. The hypothetical liver effect compartment was linked to 
the synthesis rate for PCSK9 through an Imax model. PCSK9 levels were then linked to the 
degradation / clearance rate of LDL-C through the use of a second Imax model. Population PD analyses 
were based on available PD data (i.e., PCSK9 and LDL-C) from nine clinical trials, including 4 phase I 
studies, 2 phase II studies and 3 phase III studies (ALN-PCSSC-001, ORION-1, ORION-3, ORION-6, 
ORION-7, ORION-9, ORION-10, ORION-11, and ORION-12). Final model evaluation revealed a 
satisfactory model performance. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
No absolute bioavailability and human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies have been performed for inclisiran. Given these limitations, pharmacokinetics of inclisiran 
appear to have been overall sufficiently characterised. The applicant has not proposed any changes to 
the dosing recommendations in subjects with various stages of renal impairment as well as in subjects 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment despite significant increases in exposures observed in 
these subjects as compared to healthy subjects. Given the infrequent and transient exposures to 
inclisiran that can be expected based on the long dosing interval (initially, after 3 months and then 
every 6 months), short t½ of inclisiran in plasma, and the lack of correlation with PD response, this 
may be considered acceptable from a PK point of view. However, as differences in the antisense to 
sense ratios have been noted in several subjects with renal impairment and the safety data in severe 
renal impairment is too limited to draw a final conclusion, inclisiran should be used with caution in 
patients with severe renal impairment.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action that inclisiran blocks the natural pathway of RNA interference by binding 
intracellularly to the RISC appears reasonable. The cleaved PCSK9 mRNA is degraded and thus 
unavailable for protein translation, which results in decreased levels of the PCSK9 protein where 1 
single blocked RISC can cleave many transcripts of the PCSK9 protein. This leads to a reduced 
degradation of the LDLR and thus to an increased removal of LDL-C.

Results of the phase I dose escalating study ALN-PCSSC-001 in healthy subjects and the phase II 
single and multiple dose study ORION-1 in subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and 
elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapy showed robust and 
significant reductions in PCSK9 levels with concomitant reductions in LDL-C levels after inclisiran 
treatment. Results of both studies showed an optimal effect on PCSK9 and LDL-C with an inclisiran 
300 mg SC injection and study ORION-1 demonstrated that every 6 months dosing would be the 
optimal dosing regimen to maintain a time adjusted average LDL-C reduction of greater than 50% over 
6 months. 
Based on these observations, the optimal dose regimen for the phase III trials was determined to be 
300 mg inclisiran sodium administered SC on Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months thereafter. 
Results of the phase I / phase II studies ORION-6 and ORION-7 demonstrated that the LDL-C 
reduction follows the decrease of PCSK9 over time, that the reduction of the PD parameters was 
comparable over the different renal impairment groups, and that PCSK9, LDL-C, and TC levels 
decreased in all hepatic impairment groups from baseline to Day 180 with less pronunciation in the 
moderate hepatic impairment group. According to the results of these studies no dose adjustments of 
inclisiran seems to be necessary across the different renal and hepatic impairment groups; however, 
no data are available for subjects on haemodialysis and with severe hepatic impairment and end stage 
liver disease. 
The thorough QT study ORION-12 indicated an absence of effect of inclisiran on potential QTc 
prolongation. No indication for a QT prolonging effect of inclisiran was observed after dosing with a 900 
mg dose and no need for closer QT observation during the phase III studies was raised. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No absolute bioavailability and human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies have been performed for inclisiran. Given these limitations, pharmacokinetics of inclisiran have 
been sufficiently characterised. 
The mode of action of inclisiran has been established reasonably well and LDL-C lowering has been 
demonstrated. There is no sign of a pro-arrhythmic effect of inclisiran. The effect on LDL-C has been 
further explored with a PK/PD model. The pharmacology effects were mainly evaluated based on the 
effect on PCSK9 and LDL-C lowering. This approach is supported, as it is the primary relevant marker 
for pharmacology and efficacy of inclisiran in relation to any potential cardiovascular effect. The LDL-C 
lowering effect was demonstrated in a phase I study in healthy volunteers and in a phase II study in 
subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents. The PCSK9 and LDL-C percentage reduction from 
baseline was dose dependent up to 300 mg inclisiran with no further benefit of higher doses. 
Studies in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment indicated that the LDL-C reduction follows the 
decrease of PCSK9 over the time in all examined groups of renal and hepatic impairment and that a 
dose reduction in the groups investigated is not necessary. However, since safety data in severe renal 
impairment is too limited to draw a definite conclusion, inclisiran should be used with caution in 
patients with severe renal impairment. Results of a thorough QT study indicated an absence of effect of 
inclisiran on potential QTc prolongation.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The inclisiran clinical development programme included 4 phase I studies, 3 phase II studies (1 still 
ongoing), and 6 phase III studies (3 still ongoing). 
The dose-response effect was evaluated in the phase I study ALN-PCSSC-001 and the phase II study 
ORION-1 including either healthy subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations or subjects with ASCVD 
or ASCVD-risk equivalents with or without statin co-medication. A PCSK9 and in consequence LDL-C 
lowering effect was observed with inclisiran doses of 25 to 800 mg. Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL-C 
levels were apparent within 14 days post dosing, with mean reductions of 71% to 74% for PCSK9 and 
48% to 51% for LDL-C observed 30 to 60 days post 300 mg dose.  
According to the phase I/II results, the optimal dose for the phase III trials with a maximum reduction 
in LDL-C seemed to be 300 mg inclisiran administered at days 1 and 90, and every 180 days 
thereafter. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The primary efficacy data obtained in the proposed target population were derived from the pivotal 
phase III studies ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11. The 3 confirmatory studies were placebo-
controlled, double-blind, randomised trials in patients with HeFH or ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents 
with elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapy. Additional supportive 
efficacy data come from the ongoing open-label extension study ORION-3 and the long-term studies 
ORION-4 in subjects with ASCVD, ORION-5 in subjects with HoFH, and ORION-8 in subjects with 
ASCVD, ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and FH), HeFH, or HoFH. 
Study reports from the long-term studies ORION-4, ORION-5, and ORION-8 have not been included in 
the dossier. 
ORION-9, ORION-10, ORION-11 
The applicant conducted 3 confirmatory studies (ORION-9, ORION-10, ORION-11) as placebo-
controlled, double-blind, randomised trials to evaluate the effect of 300 mg of inclisiran sodium given 
as SC injections in subjects with a history of HeFH with a diagnosis of HeFH by genetic testing or 
documented uncontrolled LDL-C levels >190 mg/dL (study ORION-9) and in subjects with ASCVD and 
ASCVD-risk equivalent (studies ORION-10 and ORION-11), despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. 
Inclisiran sodium 300 mg was given by SC injection on Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months thereafter. 
Methods 
The 3 completed confirmatory studies ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 were double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre studies with injections of inclisiran sodium 
300 mg s.c. or placebo on Days 1, 90, and every 180 days thereafter in adult patients who are at risk 
of CVD when used alone and in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) or ezetimibe. 
In each study, the co-primary efficacy endpoints were percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to 
Day 510 and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540  
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 68/143 
 
 
 
 
To evaluate the efficacy of inclisiran as an add-on to lipid-modifying therapy subjects were required to 
be on a background of maximally tolerated statin therapy before randomisation with or without other 
LDL-C lowering agents such as ezetimibe. Subjects not receiving statins must have had documented 
evidence of intolerance to all doses of at least 2 different statins. Subjects were randomised (1:1) to 
either inclisiran sodium 300 mg s.c. injection or placebo, stratified by current use of statins or other 
lipid-modifying therapies. Subjects randomised in ORION-9 and ORION-11 were also stratified by 
country.  
Screening occurred approximately 2 weeks prior to Day 1 (Visit 1). Patients who met all enrolment 
criteria during the screening period were instructed to continue their therapy(ies) for lipid lowering and 
to maintain consistent diet and exercise patterns throughout the study.  
The reduction of LDL-C as a causal factor in the pathophysiology of ASCVD with strong and consistent 
evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization 
studies, and randomised intervention trials was chosen as surrogate marker. 
Study Participants  
The 3 phase III studies included 3660 subjects with 18 months duration and tested 2 product 
presentations – namely ‘vial and syringe’ and ‘prefilled syringe’, of which the latter is proposed in this 
application. 
Important inclusion criteria in the 3 confirmatory studies included a history of HeFH with a 
diagnosis of HeFH by genetic testing; and/or a documented history of untreated LDL-C of >190 mg/dL, 
and a family history of FH, elevated cholesterol or early heart disease may indicate FH, stable on a 
low-fat diet (e.g., National Cholesterol Education Program), serum LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) 
at screening and calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >30 mL/min by estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) using standardised clinical methodology (study ORION-9); a history of ASCVD 
(CHD, CVD, or PAD), serum LDL-C ≥1.8 mmol/L (≥70 mg/dL), and no current or planned renal dialysis 
or renal transplantation (study ORION-10); a history of ASCVD (CHD, CVD, or PAD) or ASCVD-risk 
equivalents (type 2 diabetes, FH, and including subjects whose 10-year risk of a CV event assessed by 
Framingham Risk Score or equivalent has a target LDL-C of <100 mg/dL), serum LDL-C ≥1.8 mmol/L 
(≥70 mg/dL) for ASCVD subjects or ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) for ASCVD-risk equivalent subjects at 
screening and calculated GFR >30 mL/min by eGFR using standardised clinical methodology (study 
ORION-11). 
Additional inclusion criteria common in all 3 studies were fasting triglyceride <4.52 mmol/L 
(<400 mg/dL) at screening and subjects on statins should have been receiving a maximally tolerated 
dose. Maximum tolerated dose was defined as the maximum dose of statin that can be taken on a 
regular basis without intolerable AEs. Intolerance to any dose of any statin was documented as 
historical AEs attributed to the statin in question in the source documentation and on the Medical 
History page of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and subjects not receiving statin must have had 
documented evidence of intolerance to all doses of at least 2 different statins. 
Exclusion criteria were related to any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical 
condition that could either interfere with participation in the clinical study and/or put the subject at 
significant risk (according to investigator’s [or delegate] judgement) if he/she participated in the 
clinical study and to underlying known disease, or surgical, physical, or medical condition that, in the 
opinion of the investigator (or delegate), may have interfered with interpretation of the clinical study 
results, and major adverse CV event within 3 months prior to randomisation.

Treatments 
With respect to background LMT in all 3 confirmatory studies subjects were allowed to be on 
hormone replacement therapy, on lipid-lowering medications as subjects already on a stable (≥30 days 
before screening) lipid-lower medications (such as statins and/or ezetimibe) should remain on the dose 
that they had received during participation in the original protocol unless clinically indicated, 
prescription medications prescribed to treat preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes and 
hypertension, and prescription or non-prescription medications, when necessary to treat an AE, and at 
the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects were not allowed to add medications prescribed to lower LDL-C (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, 
lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, colesevelam, bile acid absorption inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies 
directed towards PCSK9) and any medication taken for the purpose of lipid lowering, including over-
the-counter or herbal therapies during the studies. 
All 3 phase III studies had similar designs to facilitate data pooling – including objectives, endpoints, 
placebo control, test medication dosage, the schedule and sequence of study procedures (set up to 
capture peak and trough effects of inclisiran), protocol assessments, adverse event reporting, data 
collection, statistical methods, and quality management and included a screening period of 14 days. 
The same design scheme applies to ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11. 
Figure 3.3.5.10: Common design of the 3 Phase III Studies 
Inclisiran was to be administered on Day 1, Day 90, Day 270, and Day 450 in all 3 studies and no dose 
adjustments occurred during the treatment periods.  
Objectives 
The co-primary and secondary objectives of these studies were to evaluate the efficacy of inclisiran as 
compared to placebo on the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and time-adjusted 
percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Each of the 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies assessed percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and 
the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 as the 
co-primary efficacy endpoints. A cardiovascular outcomes trial of inclisiran versus placebo in 15,000 
ASCVD subjects is ongoing and results are anticipated in 2024. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints of the studies were: 
•  Absolute change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 70/143 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Time-adjusted absolute change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 
Percentage change from baseline to Day 510 in PCSK9, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B 
(Apo-B), and non-HDL-C. 
Sample size 
For all 3 pivotal phase 3 studies the sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which 
was based on the observed results from a Phase II study) that the difference in change from baseline 
between the active dose group and the placebo group for LDL-C would be no less than 30 mg/dL, with 
a standard deviation of 20 mg/dL. 
•  Study ORION-9 
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size was approximately 380 subjects that were 
evaluable for efficacy across the placebo and inclisiran dose groups. This sample size of at least 380 
evaluable subjects, provided more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction of LDL-C levels in the 
inclisiran group compared to the placebo group at 1-sided significance level of 0.025. Due to faster 
than expected enrollment, actual enrollment was 482 subjects. This increased sample size contributed 
additional safety data and did not appreciably affect power calculations. 
•  Study ORION-10 
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size was planned to be approximately 1425 subjects 
that were evaluable for efficacy across the placebo and inclisiran dose groups. This sample size of at 
least 1425 evaluable subjects, was expected to provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% 
reduction of LDL-C levels in the inclisiran group compared to the placebo group at 1-sided significance 
level of 0.025. This sample size also contributed additional sufficient safety data. 
•  Study ORION-11 
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size would be approximately 1425 subjects that were 
evaluable for efficacy across the placebo and inclisiran dose groups. This sample size of at least 1425 
evaluable subjects, would provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction of LDL-C levels in 
the inclisiran group compared to the placebo group at one-sided significance level of 0.025. This 
sample size would also contribute additional sufficient safety data. 
Randomisation 
In the confirmatory phase 3 studies, subjects were required to be on a background of maximally 
tolerated statin therapy before randomisation with or without other LDL-C lowering agents such as 
ezetimibe. Subjects were randomised (1:1) to either inclisiran sodium 300 mg or placebo on Day 1, 
Day 90, Day 270, and Day 450, stratified by current use of statins or other lipid-modifying therapies. 
Subjects randomised in ORION-9 and ORION-11 were also stratified by country. 
Blinding (masking) 
In all 3 studies the study drug was blinded prior to distribution to the site. Each study drug vial, 
inclisiran or placebo, contained a yellow shroud to blind the vial. Randomisation via an automated IRT 
was used to assign subjects to blinded study drug. The clinical study site pharmacist maintained the 
double-blind according to site-specific procedures and the Pharmacy Manual. As inclisiran may be 
visually distinguishable from placebo, blinded syringes were provided to all study sites and used to 
maintain the blind.

Statistical methods 
The Statistical methods of the 3 pivotal studies are similar. Efficacy evaluations were primarily based 
on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population containing all randomised subjects according to their 
randomised allocation. Additional analysis were conducted based on the Full-Analysis-Set (FAS) 
population (all randomised subjects receiving treatment at least once) and the modified ITT population 
(all subjects in the FAS having available LDL-C measurements at baseline and Day 510).  
Missing data handling 
The sponsor diligently followed up with each subject during the study on all efficacy laboratory 
assessments to keep missing data to a minimum regardless of whether the subject was on study 
treatment, used ancillary therapies, experienced an adverse event, or adhered to the protocol, and all 
data were included in all analyses. Although the studies did not employ the estimand framework 
discussed in the addendum to ICH E9 R1(EMA/CHMP/ICH/436221/2017), this follow-up of patients is in 
line with targeting an estimand based on the treatment policy strategy, which is considered of 
regulatory relevance in this setting. 
If missing data, defined as data not available from either scheduled (within the protocol defined visit 
window) or unscheduled visits, occurred for the primary or any of key secondary efficacy endpoints 
then that data were multiply imputed (total of 100 imputations). Percentage changes and absolute 
changes were calculated after imputation. Two different approaches were used for the two co-primary 
endpoints, but both approaches impute missing data under the assumption that the outcome would 
have been similar to those in the placebo group with similar background characteristics. This is in 
principle acceptable and aligned to a treatment policy strategy.  
More specifically, the primary method to impute missing data for the first co-primary efficacy endpoint 
(percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510) was a multiple imputation washout model. For 
subjects in the inclisiran group only missing Day 510 values will be imputed based on placebo data and 
accounting for the subjects’ baseline value and use of statin/lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) at baseline. 
For subjects in the placebo arm missing data for all visits are imputed and the applied imputation 
approach corresponds to imputing based on the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption in this arm. This 
washout model was used in ORION-11. A modified washout model was used in ORION-9 and -10, in 
the integrated efficacy analysis and as a post-hoc analysis in ORION-11. This modified version deviates 
from the described washout model by imputing intermittent missing Day 510 measurement in the 
inclisiran arm based on the MAR assumption (i.e. based on observed inclisiran data instead of placebo 
data) for subjects who received all 4 inclisiran doses, had the Day 510 value missing, and had 
evaluable data at Day 540.   
The primary method to impute missing data for the second co-primary endpoint (time-adjusted 
percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540) used a control-based 
pattern-mixture model (PMM). For subjects who discontinued the study without any further follow-up 
data, missing data for all visits were imputed based on placebo data (for inclisiran and placebo). 
Intermittent missing values will be imputed based on the MAR assumption.  
The amount of missing data and consequently its impact on study results and conclusions is, overall, 
very low. Furthermore, the control-based pattern-mixture model used for the second co-primary 
efficacy endpoint is also used as a sensitivity analysis for the first co-primary endpoint and results are 
similar. 
Missing data for key secondary endpoints will be imputed using the control-based PMM. Missing data 
for all parameters not listed in the primary and key secondary endpoints were not imputed and were 
excluded from the associated analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 72/143 
 
 
 
In addition, sensitivity analyses using different missing data handling (see below) were performed on 
co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints to assess the impact of missing values.  
Analysis of Co-Primary Endpoints 
For percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
is applied to each of the 100 multiply imputed datasets. The model included a fixed effect for 
treatment and baseline LDL-C as a covariate.  
For time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540, a 
mixed-effects model for repeated measurements (MMRM) including fixed effects for treatment, visit, 
baseline value, and the interaction between treatment and visit is applied to each of the 100 multiply 
imputed datasets. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation approach will be used with 
the covariance structure set as “Unstructured”. The time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from 
baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 and its difference between treatments was calculated from 
the MMRM by means of linear combinations of the estimated means after Day 90 and up to Day 540. 
Note that Day 90 was excluded from the MMRM.  
For each endpoint, treatment effects from the 100 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s Rules and 
the difference in the least squares means between treatment groups and corresponding two-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided for hypothesis testing. 
For Orion-11, ANCOVA and MMRM analysis used to evaluate co-primary endpoints were extended by a 
fixed effect for current use of statins or other LMT at baseline. However, additional post-hoc analyses 
were conducted excluding this covariate. 
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted for both co-primary endpoints including analysis that 
account for stratification factors and analyses that assess the impact of missing data. Analyses for the 
latter include MMRM analyses without missing data imputation (i.e. based on the missing-at-random 
assumption) and tipping-point analyses evaluating how strong deviations from missing-at-random 
assumption need to be to lose statistical significance. Furthermore, the control-based pattern-mixture 
model will also be applied for the first co-primary endpoint. Overall, these analyses are supported and 
show robustness of result. Tipping-points calculated generally correspond to a worsening way beyond 
the patients’ baseline levels and further support robustness. 
Efficacy data were also analysed for relevant subgroups. 
Analyses of Secondary Endpoints 
The absolute change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and percentage change from baseline to Day 
510 in PCSK9, TC, Apo-B, and non-HDL-C will be analysed using a MMRM with covariates as specified 
for the second co-primary endpoint on each of the multiply imputed data sets. Time adjusted absolute 
change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be analysed similarly to the second 
co-primary endpoint. MMRM without multiple imputation will be used as sensitivity analyses for the key 
secondary endpoints. 
Other secondary endpoints will be analysed based on available data. The two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for least squares means will be provided for continuous variables at a single timepoint using an 
analysis of covariance model or using MMRM methods for variables measured over time. The odds ratio 
and 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio will be provided for binary variables using logistic 
regression models. Nominal p-values will be provided when applicable. 
Multiplicity Control 
Both co-primary efficacy endpoints were tested hierarchically at a two-sided alpha level of 5% and not 
in the usual sense of ‘co-primary’ endpoints (meaning both endpoints need to show statistical 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 73/143 
 
 
 
significance for study success). Nevertheless, hierarchical testing properly controls the type 1 error 
and, in the end, superiority over placebo could be shown for both endpoints.  
In case superiority can be achieved for both co-primary endpoints, key secondary endpoints were 
tested and multiplicity was controlled across these key secondary endpoints using Hochberg procedure. 
The study reports do not explicitly discuss the application of the Hochberg procedure. However, as all 
p-values for primary and key secondary endpoints are <0.0001, it is directly apparent that superiority 
can be claimed for all these endpoints based on the specified multiplicity control strategy. Generally, 
also adjusted p-values should be provided. These are currently not available, but - given that all p-
values are <0.0001 - adjusted p-values will also be <0.0001.  
Changes in the conduct of analysis 
For each study, some aspects of the statistical analysis were changes after unblinding of the studies. 
For ORION-11, additional post-hoc analyses were conducted using the modified washout model for the 
first co-primary endpoint and analyses excluding the effect of use of statins/LMT at baseline from 
efficacy analysis. This can be agreed. In contrast, for ORION-9 and -10, accounting for ‚use of 
statins/LMT at baseline‘ in the imputation models resulted in convergence issues for all or some of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints and the effect was excluded from the imputation model. 
In principle, this results in lack of proper pre-specification of the imputation approach. Still, the amount 
of missing data is low and the number of different sensitivity analyses using different assumptions to 
handle missing data have been conducted showing that results are robust and not relevantly impacted 
by missing data. Hence, this issue is not considered of further concern. 
Integrated Summary of Efficacy 
The primary analysis of efficacy is based on data from each study individually. Pooled analyses were 
performed for these studies as follows: Efficacy Pool 1, includes all 3 Phase III trials, ORION-9, ORION-
10, and ORION-11 and Efficacy Pool 2, includes only ORION-10 and ORION-11, since ORION-9 includes 
subjects with HeFH who have different demographic (e.g., younger age) and disease profiles. 
Analysis is similar to the one described above for the individual studies except that analysis model 
include an additional fixed effect for study.

Most of the participants in the 3 confirmative studies were on a lipid-modifying therapy at baseline. 
LMT usage was generally balanced between the treatment groups at randomization (Day 1). 
In study ORION 9, 94.4% (455/482) of subjects received LMT, 90.5% (436/482) of subjects received 
statin therapy, and 55.4% (267/482) received other LMT (58.3%; 140/240 of placebo-treated subjects 
and 52.5%; 127/242 of inclisiran-treated subjects) and 3.9% (19/482) received other LMT and no 
statin. 
Overall, 73.9% (356/482) were on a high intensity statin at baseline. A total of 14.5% (70/482) of 
subjects received a moderate intensity statin and 1.9% (9/482) subjects received a low intensity statin 
at baseline. Approximately half (52.3%; 252/482) of subjects were treated with ezetimibe. 
A total of 25.3% (122/482) of subjects were either partially or completely intolerant to statins. The 
most common symptoms of statin intolerance (partial or complete) were muscle ache (74.6%; 
91/122), other symptoms (36.1%; 44/122), and cramping (22.1%; 27/122). 
In study ORION-10, 94.7% (1478/1561) of subjects received LMT, 89.2% (1393/1561) of subjects 
received statin therapy, and 31.3% (489/1561) received other LMT. 
Two-thirds (69.4%; 1084/1561) of subjects were on a high intensity statin at baseline. A total of 
18.7% (292/1561) of subjects received a moderate intensity and 0.8% (12/1561) subjects received a 
low intensity statin at baseline. A total of 9.9% (156/1561) subjects were treated with ezetimibe. 
A total of 22.0% (344/1561) of subjects were either partially or completely intolerant to statins. The 
most common symptoms of statin intolerance (partial or complete) were muscle ache (83.1%; 
286/344), cramping (25.0%; 86/344), and other symptoms (21.5%; 74/344). 
In study ORION-11, 96.8% (1565/1617) of subjects received LMT, 94.7% (1532/1617) of subjects 
received statin therapy and 11.8% (191/1617) received other LMT. 
Based on the FDA feedback received on September 13, 2019, and in order to be consistent with 
ACC/AHA guidelines, simvastatin 40 mg was to be included in the moderate intensity stain group 
instead of the high intensity statin group as prespecified in the final SAP. Based on the SAP Addendum 
defined criteria in which simvastatin 40 mg is considered a moderate intensity statin, 78.0% 
(1261/1617) of subjects were on a high intensity statin at baseline. A total of 15.5% (251/1617) of 
subjects received a moderate intensity and 0.4% (6/1617) subjects received a low intensity statin at 
baseline. A total of 7.1% (114/1617) subjects were treated with ezetimibe. 
A total of 11.4% (185/1617) of subjects were either partially or completely intolerant to statins. The 
most common symptoms of statin intolerance (partial or complete) were muscle ache (70.3%; 
130/185), other symptoms (38.4%; 71/185), and cramping (8.6%; 16/185).

Co-Primary endpoints 
An overview of the results of the co-primary endpoints of the 3 confirmatory studies is presented in the 
table below.

Table 3.3.5.2: Primary Efficacy Endpoints from Phase III Studies 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Results of the key secondary endpoints of the 3 confirmatory studies were as follows. 
Absolute Change in LDL-C from Baseline to Day 510 
The placebo-adjusted absolute change from baseline to Day 510 in LDL-C levels was -68.9 mg/dL 
(p<0.0001) [ORION-9], -54.1 mg/dL (p<0.0001) [ORION-10], and -51.9 mg/dL (p<0.0001) [ORION-
11], respectively.  
Time-adjusted Absolute Change in LDL-C from Baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 
Compared to placebo, the time-adjusted absolute change from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 
540 was -62.7 mg/dL (p<0.0001) [ORION-9], -53.3 mg/dL (p<0.0001) [ORION-10], and -48.9 mg/dL 
(p<0.0001) [ORION-11], respectively.  
Percentage Change in PCSK9 from Baseline to Day 510 
The placebo-adjusted percentage change in PCSK9 from baseline to Day 510 was -78.3% (p<0.0001) 
[ORION-9], -83.3% (p<0.0001) [ORION-10, and 79.3% (p<0.0001) [ORION-11], respectively.  
Percentage Change in Total Cholesterol from Baseline to Day 510 
The placebo-adjusted percentage change in TC from baseline to Day 510 was -31.8% (p<0.0001) 
[ORION-9], -33.1% (p<0.0001) [ORION-10], and -29.8% (p<0.0001) [ORION-11], respectively.  
Percentage Change in Apo-B from Baseline to Day 510 
The placebo-adjusted percentage change in Apo-B from baseline to Day 510 was -36.1% (p<0.0001) 
[ORION-9], -43.1% (p<0.0001) [ORION-10], and -38.9% (p<0.0001) [ORION-11], respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 83/143 
 
 
 
 
Percentage Change in Non-HDL-C from Baseline to Day 510 
The placebo-adjusted percentage change in non-HDL-C from baseline to Day 510 was -42.4% 
(p<0.0001) [ORION-9], 47.4% (p<0.0001) [ORION-10], and 43.3% (p<0.0001) [ORION-11], 
respectively.  
Sensitivity analyses using MMRM yielded similar results and were statistically significant (p<0.0001) 
across the 3 studies. Furthermore, the results were similar regardless of the analysis population (ITT, 
FAS, mITT) used. 
Other secondary endpoints in lipid parameters also showed significant placebo-adjusted reductions in 
the inclisiran treatment groups across all 3 phase III studies. 
Explorative endpoints evaluating to the effect of inclisiran on MACE (composite of CV death, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke) showed that the number of 
subjects with a MACE event was similar for placebo- and inclisiran-treated subjects across the 3 
studies. The number of subjects with a MACE event was the same for placebo-treated subjects (4.2%; 
10/240) and inclisiran-treated subjects (4.1%; 10/241) in study ORION-9 and was 10.2% (79/778) in 
placebo-treated compared to 7.4% (58/781) in inclisiran-treated subjects in study ORION-10, and 
10.3% (83/804) compared to 7.8% (63/811), respectively, in study ORION-11]. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Analyses of the co-primary endpoints in the 3 phase III studies were conducted using 2 additional 
efficacy analysis populations (FAS and mITT Population). Similar, statistically significant (p<0.0001), 
placebo-adjusted differences were observed for both co-primary endpoints regardless of analysis 
population used. 
Tipping point Analyses 
Tipping point analyses were performed to demonstrate the shift parameters for the value of LDL-C, 
which were needed to switch the result from statistically significant to not statistically significant. The 
analyses showed that a high shift parameter was needed to switch the primary endpoint result to not 
statistically significant across the 3 studies. The tipping point analyses support the robustness of the 
study results.   
Subgroup Analyses of Efficacy 
Study ORION-9 
Subgroup analyses for efficacy were performed based on 21 categories using MMRM to account for 
missing data. Placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions favouring inclisiran were similar across most 
subgroups for percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and time-adjusted percentage 
change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540. A statistically significant interaction 
was observed for above and below the median and quartiles of baseline LDL-C and PCSK9 levels for 
both coprimary endpoints. In all subgroups, inclisiran lowered LDL-C more than placebo (p<0.05) 
Study ORION-10 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on 18 categories. Similar LDL-C reductions were observed 
for all subgroups analysed for both co-primary endpoints, percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to 
Day 510 and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 
Assessment report

540. Similar and statistically significant (p<0.0001) LDL-C reductions in favour of the inclisiran-treated 
group were observed regardless of subgroup analysed for both co-primary endpoints. 
A greater placebo-adjusted percentage reduction in LDL-C was observed in subjects with below median 
baseline LDLR and below quartile baseline LDL, several of which are likely to have some inter-
relationship. 
A greater absolute LDL-C reduction was observed in subjects with below median baseline LDLR and 
below quartile baseline LDL. 
Study ORION-11 
Subgroup analyses for efficacy were performed on 19 categories using MMRM to account for missing 
data. Placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions favouring inclisiran were similar across most subgroups for 
percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 and time adjusted percentage change in LDL-C 
from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540. A statistically significant interaction was observed for 
above and below the median and quartiles of baseline LDL-C and PCSK9 levels for both co-primary 
endpoints. In all subgroups, inclisiran lowered LDL-C more than placebo (p<0.05).

Summary of main studies 
The inclisiran clinical development programme included 3 phase III studies in 3 type of subjects, i.e. 
subjects with HeFH, subjects with ASCVD, and subjects with ASCVD-risk equivalents (type 2 diabetes, 
FH, and including subjects whose 10-year risk of a CV event assessed by Framingham Risk Score or 
equivalent has a target LDL-C of <100 mg/dL). The primary efficacy data are derived from all 3 
confirmatory randomised, placebo-controlled studies in the proposed target population. Supportive 
efficacy data was obtained from the placebo-controlled phase II study ORION-1 conducted in subjects 
with high CV risk. All subjects in the efficacy studies had elevated LDL-C levels despite maximum 
tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 91/143 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who completed ORION-1 to at least Day 210 and whose LDL-C had returned to within 20% of 
the baseline value or who reached Day 360 (ORION-1) with no contraindication to receiving inclisiran 
or evolocumab had the option of participating in the open-label extension study ORION-3. 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the pivotal studies ORION-9, ORION-10, and 
ORION-11 supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the 
discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment in later sections.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In addition to the results presented above, the following pooled data are available. 
In total, 93.5% (3422/3660) of the participating subjects completed the 3 confirmatory phase III 
studies. Pooled analyses were performed for these studies as follows: Efficacy Pool 1 includes all 3 
phase III trials, ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 and Efficacy Pool 2 includes only ORION-10 and 
ORION-11 since ORION-9 includes subjects with HeFH who have different demographics (e.g., younger 
age) and disease profiles. 
Efficacy pool 1 included 3660 subjects (482, 1561, and 1617 subjects in ORION-9, ORION-10, and 
ORION-11, respectively) in the ITT-Population. Overall, 93.5% (3422/3660) of subjects completed the 
phase III studies [92.8% (1695/1827) of placebo-treated subjects and 94.3% (1728/1833) of 
inclisiran-treated subjects]. The most common reasons for discontinuing the study were withdrawn 
consent [placebo 55 (3%), inclisiran 37 (2%)], death [placebo 27 (1.5%), inclisiran 27 (1.5%)], and 
lost to follow-up [placebo 29 ([1.6%), inclisiran 17 (0.9%)]. 
Efficacy pool 2 included 3178 subjects (1561 and 1617 subjects in ORION-10 and ORION-11, 
respectively) in the ITT Population. As in pool 1, most of the placebo- [92.2% (1464/1587)] and 
inclisiran-treated subjects [93.8% (1493/1591)] completed the study. The most common reasons for 
discontinuing the study were withdrawn consent [placebo51 (3.2%), inclisiran 37 (2.3%)], death 
[placebo 26 (1.6%), inclisiran 26 (1.6%)], and lost to follow-up [placebo 27 (1.7%), inclisiran 16 
(1.0%)]. 
Demographic characteristics were adequately balanced between groups in both efficacy pools. Racial 
and ethnic diversity in efficacy pool 1 was adequate to demonstrate efficacy in White [92.3% 
(3378/3660)], Black [6.3% (232/3660)], and Hispanic [6.4% (236/3660)] subjects. A similar racial 
and ethnic profile was observed in efficacy pool 2 while other racial and ethnic groups were under-
represented. Median age in efficacy pool 1 was comparable to efficacy pool 2 (66 and 65 years of age, 
respectively) while efficacy pool 1 had a slightly higher proportion of females included compared to 
efficacy pool 2 (32.5% and 29.4%, respectively). 
Despite aggressive lipid-lowering treatment, in studies ORION-10 and ORION-11, the baseline LDL-C in 
subjects with ASCVD was 105 mg/dL and in ORION-9 in subjects with HeFH 153 mg/dL. Comorbidities 
are well represented within both efficacy pool 1 and efficacy pool 2. Diabetes was reported in 36.0% 
(1318/3660) of subjects and almost all were type II diabetes mellitus [35.1% (1286/3660)]. The 
phase III trials also included a characteristic sample of subjects [72.3% (2,648/3660)] with renal 
impairment which was either mild [55.9% (2,046/3660)], moderate [15.9% (582/3660)], or severe 
[0.5% (20/3660)] as assessed by the central laboratory at screening for study eligibility using eGFR. 
Both efficacy pool 1 and efficacy pool 2 were comprised of a population at high risk for CV events 
(subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents, HeFH). Efficacy Pool 1 included subjects with ASCVD 
[84.9% (3107/3660)] and ASCVD-risk equivalents including HeFH [15.1% (553/3660)]. Efficacy Pool 2 
included 93.6% (2975/3178) subjects with ASCVD and 6.4% (203/3178) subjects with ASCVD-risk 
equivalents. Hypertension was reported at baseline for 79.8% (2919/3660) of subjects in efficacy pool 
1 and 85.5% (2716/3178) in efficacy pool 2. 
Almost all subjects in efficacy pool 1 [94.0% (3441/3660)] and efficacy pool 2 [94.1% (2989/3178)] 
were on statins at study entry and high-intensity statins were prescribed to 73.8% (2701/3660) in

efficacy pool 1 and 73.8% (2345/3178) in efficacy pool 2. In efficacy pool 1 and efficacy pool 2, <10% 
of subjects had new LMT or changed LMT during the study. 
With muscle ache as the most common symptom of statin intolerance there were 17.8% (651/3660) 
subjects with partial or complete statin intolerance in efficacy pool 1 and 16.6% (529/3178) subjects 
with partial or complete statin intolerance in efficacy pool 2. Less than 8% of subjects had complete 
statin intolerance in efficacy pool 1 and efficacy pool 2. Ezetimibe was used by 14.0% (513/3660) in 
efficacy pool 1 and by 8.2% (261/3178) in efficacy pool 2. Nine (9) placebo- and no inclisiran-treated 
subject started a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody during the phase III studies (exclusion criteria).

Co-Primary Endpoints 
Results of the co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that in the observed case placebo-adjusted LDL-C 
percentage change from baseline to Day 510 was -54.7% (95% CI -56.82,-52.61, p<0.0001) in 
efficacy pool 1 and -55.6% (95% CI -57.83,-53.31, p<0.0001) in efficacy pool 2. Using a washout 
model to account for missing data, the placebo-adjusted LDL-C percentage change from baseline to 
Day 510 was -50.7% (95% CI -52.86,-48.43, p<0.0001) in efficacy pool 1 and -51.0% (95% CI -
53.40,-48.61, p<0.0001) in efficacy pool 2. The placebo-adjusted time-adjusted LDL-C percentage 
change from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 was -50.5% (95% CI -52.11,-48.93, p<0.0001) 
in efficacy pool 1 and -51.4% (95% CI -53.15,-49.72, p<0.0001) in efficacy pool 2.

Pool 2-ITT Population 
Key Secondary Endpoints 
Results of the key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant placebo-adjusted absolute 
reductions in LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 of -55.1 (95% CI -57.36,-52.82, p<0.0001) in efficacy 
pool 1 and -52.9 (95% CI -55.22,-50.67, p<0.0001) in efficacy pool 2. 
Placebo-adjusted time-adjusted absolute change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 
540 in efficacy pool 1 was -52.7 (95% CI -54.39,-50.91, p<0.0001) and in efficacy pool 2 was -51.0 
(95% CI -52.79,-49.29, p<0.0001). 
Treatment with inclisiran reduced PCSK9 levels from baseline to Day 510 by >75% consistently in all 3 
phase III studies [efficacy pool1 -80.9 (95% CI -83.78,-78.02, p<0.0001) efficacy pool 2 -81.3 (95% 
CI -84.48,-78.02, p<0.0001)].

Inclisiran lowered TC (-31.49 efficacy pool 1, -31.44 efficacy pool 2), Apo-B (-40.3 efficacy pool 1, -
41.0 efficacy pool 2), and non-HDL-C (-45.0 efficacy pool 1, -45.3 efficacy pool 2) with p-values 
<0.0001, respectively, compared with placebo, consistent with the changes in LDL-C resulting from 
PCSK9 inhibition and consistently across efficacy pool 1 and efficacy pool 2. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The subjects included in the 3 confirmatory studies were ≥18 years of age. No children or adolescents 
≤18 years of age were recruited for the studies. 
Results of the co-primary endpoints in the different age groups in the 3 studies are presented in the 
tables below.

Supportive study 
ORION-2 (MDCO-PCS-16-02) was an open label, single arm, multicentre pilot study in subjects with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH). The study was conducted in 3 countries in Europe, 
North America, and South Africa.  
Four (4) subjects, males and females, ≥12 years of age with a diagnosis of HoFH by genetic 
confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a history of an untreated LDL-C concentration >500 
mg/dL (13 mmol/L) together with either xanthoma before 10 years of age or evidence of HeFH in both 
parents were enrolled and treated with inclisiran sodium 300 mg SC  
The primary endpoint of the study was percentage change in LDL-C following 90 and 180 days of 
treatment. 
The secondary endpoints of the study were absolute change and percentage change in LDL-C from Day 
1 to each subsequent visit until Day 180 or final visit, absolute change and percentage change in 
PCSK9 from Day 1 to each subsequent visit until Day 180 or final visit, and absolute change and 
percentage change in TC, triglycerides, HDL-C, non-HDLC, VLDL-C, Apo-A1 Apo-B, and Lp(a) from Day 
1 to each subsequent visit until Day 180 or final visit. 
The treatment with inclisiran 300 mg SC injections resulted in a significant reduction in PCSK9 levels in 
all 4 subjects. 3 of the 4 subjects had also significant reductions in LDL-C levels while 1 subject did not 
show significant reduced LDL-C levels.  
The mean percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline was 12.3% and 21.0% at Day 90 and Day 180, 
respectively. The maximum reductions in LDL-C were at Day 120 for two subjects and at Day 150 for a 
third subject. Based on this, the greatest reduction in LDL-C seemed to occur after the second dose of 
inclisiran. 
The mean percentage PCSK9 reduction from baseline was 59.0% and 62.9% at Day 90 and Day 180, 
respectively. Decreases in other lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were commensurate with the 
decreases in LDL-C. 
Overall, the treatment with inclisiran in the specified population showed a consistently significant 
reduction in PCSK9 and a varying reduction in LDL-C. 
For the preliminary results of the long-term efficacy in the ongoing open-label study ORION-3 see 
above. 
Study reports from the long-term studies ORION-4, ORION-5, and ORION-8 have not been included in 
the dossier. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
LDL-C elevation despite maximum tolerated statins or statin intolerance 
Many patients with ASCVD treated with statins do not achieve their target LDL-C levels as 
recommended by learned societies3. Inclisiran, a siRNA was developed to inhibit the production of 
3 Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaborators. Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-
analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials. Lancet. 2019; 393: 407-415.

PCSK9, an enzyme that removes LDLRs on the surface of the liver cells and as a consequence leads to 
a reduction of LDL-C, a causal and modifiable factor in ASCVD. 
The applicant performed 3 phase III studies to investigate and confirm the LDL-C lipid lowering 
treatment effect of inclisiran in maximum statin-treated and statin-intolerant patients. Patients with 
high CV risk eligible for further lipid lowering therapy based on their LDL-C level were included.  
Inclusion criteria for the ORION-9 study are appropriate to specifically identify a HeFH population, 
while the inclusion criteria for studies ORION-10 and -11 reflect a population with increased CV risk 
and increased LDL-C levels, eligible for lipid lowering drug intervention in line with the ESC/EAS 
guideline recommendations. An elevated LDL-C level despite maximum statin therapy or statin 
intolerance was common to all subjects. 
The 3 confirmatory studies are characterised by an almost identical double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomised (1:1), parallel-group design, which should allow for an adequate evaluation of the 
inclisiran treatment effect on LDL-C reduction. The time period covered by the co-primary endpoints of 
percentage change from baseline to Day 510 and time adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from 
baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 to estimate the integrated effect on LDL-C over time is 
sufficiently long to establish the maximum stable LDL-C treatment effect. The secondary endpoints 
selected to corroborate effects by demonstrating the time profile for LDL-C reduction, effects on other 
potentially atherogenic lipoproteins, and on plasma PCSK9 levels are supportive for the primary 
endpoint and are acceptable.  
Subjects should be on a stable lipid-lowering therapy ≥30 days prior to screening to stabilise lipid 
medication which is acceptable. To establish baseline LDL-C levels in phase III studies based on Day 1 
(Visit 1) is appropriate. 
Subjects eligible for lipid-lowering therapy were selected based on LDL-C level and CV risk 
classification. Serum LDL-C levels had to be ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) at screening in the HeFH 
population (study ORION-9), ≥1.8 mmol/L (≥70 mg/dL) in the ASCVD population (studies ORION-10 
and -11), and ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) for ASCVD-risk equivalent subjects at screening (study 
ORION-11). 
Subjects on statins should have been receiving a maximally tolerated dose. Maximum tolerated dose 
was defined as the maximum dose of statin that could be taken on a regular basis without intolerable 
AEs. Intolerance to any dose of any statin must have been documented as historical AEs attributed to 
the statin in question. Definition of statin intolerance was rigorously defined as documented evidence 
of intolerance to all doses of at least 2 different statins.  
The exclusion criteria are generally acceptable to optimise study adherence and reduce potential 
dropouts, reduce potential tolerability issues with background medication, and exclude any possible 
relevant confounding. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase II studies 
The phase II programme includes the dose finding study ORION-1 and its long-term extension study 
ORION-3 to evaluate the transition from evolocumab, a PCSK9-antibody, to inclisiran and study 
ORION-2 in subjects with HoFH. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020

ORION-1 was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial in subjects with high CV risk and 
elevated LDL-C, while ORION-3 was an open label, long term extension study in subjects with ASCVD 
or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering 
therapy who have completed study ORION-1. ORION-2 was an open label, single arm, multicentre pilot 
study in subjects with HoFH. The ongoing study ORION-5 will present more data of inclisiran efficacy in 
subjects with HoFH and elevated LDL-C. 
In the single dose groups, the response showed a dose dependency between single doses of 200 mg 
and 300 mg, with no additional effect at a single dose of 500 mg. The maximum mean LDL-C reduction 
of 58.9 mg/dL (50.9%) was observed at Day 60 following administration of a single dose of 300 mg 
inclisiran on Day 1. The LS mean LDL-C reduction was 27.9%, 38.4%, and 41.9% following a single 
dose of 200 mg, 300 mg, and 500 mg inclisiran, respectively, compared to a 2.1% increase in the 
placebo group (all p<0.0001).  
In the double dose groups, the response showed dose dependency across the dose range studied 
(double doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg). The highest dose of 300 mg administered on Day 1 
and Day 90 resulted in a maximum mean LDL-C reduction of 67.7 mg/dL (55.5%) at Day 150. The LS 
mean LDL-C reduction was 35.5%, 44.9%, and 52.6% following two doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 
300 mg inclisiran, respectively, compared to a 1.8% increase in the placebo group (all p<0.0001). As 
expected, the responses were greater in the double inclisiran dose groups compared to the single 
inclisiran dose groups with an additional reduction from a second dose of inclisiran at Day 90 beyond 
that achieved at Day 60. The greatest reduction in LDL-C levels at Day 180 (52.6%) was observed in 
association with the 300 mg dose of inclisiran administered on Day 1 followed by a second dose on Day 
90. 
ORION-3 is an ongoing long-term extension open-label study for subjects who completed ORION-1; 
subjects who received inclisiran in ORION-1 are receiving inclisiran throughout ORION-3 and will be 
referred to as the inclisiran only group. Subjects who received placebo in ORION-1 received 
evolocumab for 1 year and were then transitioned to inclisiran for the remainder of the study; this 
group is referred to as the switching group.  
As of 8 May 2019 (data cut-off date), at Day 210 in study ORION-3 change from baseline LDL-C 
(calculated) was -50.6% (p<0.0001) in the inclisiran only group. The mean percentage change in LDL-
C from ORION-1 baseline in the inclisiran only group at Day 30 was -51.4% and the response to 
inclisiran after each 6-monthly dose was consistent. There was no attenuation of effect as similar 
responses (over 50% reduction in LDL-C) were seen 30 days after each subsequent dose out to Day 
570. Similarly, mean LDL-C levels were consistently changed by at least -63.5 mg/dL 30 days after 
each dose out to Day 570.  
Following the first dose in ORION-3, the mean percentage change in PCSK9 from ORION-1 baseline at 
Day 30 was -72.2%. Response to inclisiran after each 6-monthly dose was consistent. Similar 
responses (percentage change of at least -74.8% in PCSK9) were observed 30 days after each 
subsequent dose out to Day 570. Similarly, changes in mean absolute PCSK9 levels were consistently 
at least -311.8 μg/L 30 days after each dose out to Day 570. 
ORION-2 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre pilot study in subjects with HoFH. Males and 
females, ≥12 years of age with a diagnosis of HoFH by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis 
based on a history of an untreated LDL-C concentration >500 mg/dL (13 mmol/L) together with either 
xanthoma before 10 years of age or evidence of HeFH in both parents were included in the study. 
Inclisiran treatment resulted in robust and durable reductions in PCSK9 levels in all 4 subjects treated 
at a dose of 300 mg. Three (3) of the 4 subjects also had significantly reduced levels of LDL-C. One (1) 
subject had a significant reduction in PCSK9 but not a concomitant reduction in LDL-C. The mean 
Assessment report

Page 110/143 
 
 
 
percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline was 12.3% and 21.0% at Day 90 and Day 180, respectively. 
The maximum reductions in LDL-C were at Day 120 for 2 subjects and at Day 150 for a third subject. 
Therefore, the second dose achieved a greater reduction in LDL-C than a single dose. 
The mean percentage PCSK9 reduction from baseline was 59.0% and 62.9% at Day 90 and Day 180, 
respectively. Decreases in other lipids, lipoproteins, and apo-lipoproteins were according to the 
decreases in LDL-C. 
Phase III studies 
The primary efficacy data obtained in the proposed target population were derived from the 3 pivotal 
phase III studies, study ORION-9 in subjects with HeFH, ORION-10 in subjects with ASCVD, and 
ORION-11 in subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents. 
The 3 phase III studies demonstrate a significant and consistent lipid lowering effect with more than 
50% reduction in LDL-C levels at day 510 compared to placebo in an international population with 
HeFH (ORION-9), an U.S. population with stable ASCVD and elevated LDL-C levels (110mg/dL on 
average) despite maximally tolerated statin therapy (ORION-10), and an international population with 
ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents (ORION-11).  
For the co-primary endpoints inclisiran treatment demonstrated in study ORION-9 a placebo-adjusted 
LDL-C change from baseline to Day 510 of -49.5% (p<0.0001) and from baseline after Day 90 and up 
to Day 540 of -44.3% (p<0.0001) with 99.2% (239/241) responders to inclisiran treatment. 
Furthermore, inclisiran treatment also lowered the lipid parameters (specified as key secondary 
endpoints) PCSK9 (-78.3%, p<0.0001), TC (-31.8%, p<0.0001), Apo-B (-36.1% p<0.0001), and non-
HDL-C (-42.4%, p<0.0001), respectively.  
Of the 482 participants in study ORION-9, 432 were tested of genetic variants. Of these, 256 (80.8%) 
had single LDLR causative variants, of whom 231 (90.2%) had LDLR pathogenic variants, 17 (6.6%) 
had probably pathogenic variants, and 8 (3.1%) had variants that were of uncertain significance. The 
mean between-group difference in the percent change in LDL cholesterol levels in subjects with two 
identified variants was -41.2%. The corresponding between-group difference among the subjects in 
whom a variant could not be identified was -59.2%. In the 50 subjects who did not undergo genetic 
testing, the corresponding between-group difference was -46.8%. 
In study ORION-10, inclisiran treatment demonstrated a placebo-adjusted LDL-C change from baseline 
to Day 510 of -57.6% (p<0.0001) and from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 of -53.8% 
(p<0.0001) for the co-primary endpoints, with 99.6% (762/765) responders to inclisiran treatment. 
Furthermore inclisiran treatment also lowered the lipid parameters (specified as key secondary 
endpoints) PCSK9 (-83.3%, p<0.0001), TC (-33.1%, p<0.0001), Apo-B (-43.1% p<0.0001), and non-
HDL-C (-47.4%, p<0.0001). 
For the co-primary endpoints in study ORION-11, inclisiran treatment demonstrated a placebo-
adjusted LDL-C change from baseline to Day 510 of -53.5% (p<0.0001) and from baseline after Day 
90 and up to Day 540 of -49.2% (p<0.0001) with 99.4% (797/802) responders to inclisiran treatment. 
Furthermore, inclisiran treatment also lowered the lipid parameters (specified as key secondary 
endpoints) PCSK9 (-79.3%, p<0.0001), TC (-29.8%, p<0.0001), Apo-B (-38.9% p<0.0001), and non-
HDL-C (-43.3%, p<0.0001). 
The reductions in LDL-C were seen in the majority of subjects taking high-intensity statins along with 
ezetimibe. 
In the pooled data (482, 1561, and 1617 subjects from ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 included 
in efficacy pool 1; 1561 and 1617 subjects from ORION-10 and ORION-11 included in efficacy pool 2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 111/143 
 
 
 
similar results were observed across the 2 pools. The LDL-C change from baseline to Day 510 (60 days 
after the last dose) was -54.7% in efficacy pool 1 and -55.6% in efficacy pool 2 and was long lasting 
(>50% on average for 6 months).  
The proportion of high-intensity statin use was 73.8% (2701/3660) in efficacy pool 1 and 73.8% 
(2345/3178) in efficacy pool 2 which demonstrate the high efficacy of inclisiran in those subjects with a 
high CV risk taking high intensity lipid modifying drugs. The time-adjusted average LDL-C change from 
baseline within the dosing interval was -50.5% in efficacy pool 1 and -51.4% in efficacy pool 2. The 
LDL-C reduction could theoretically be accompanied by a 25% risk reduction for CV events after a 
treatment of 3 years or longer.  
Reductions in other relevant lipid parameters (e.g., Apo-B, non-HDL-C, TC, Lp(a)) was consistent with 
the observed LDL-C reduction across the 2 pools. 
For the age subgroups, data demonstrate that a robust mean reduction from baseline were observed 
with inclisiran for all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints analysed in the subgroup of 
subjects 65–74 years, 75–84 years and 85+ years which was consistent with those seen in the overall 
population. Even that there was only a small number of elderly 85+ years, it could be demonstrated 
that inclisiran was just as effective as in the other groups observed in reducing the lipid parameters. 
Across the phase III studies inclisiran 300 mg SC injection on Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months 
thereafter resulted in 50 to 58% lowering of LDL-C relative to placebo at Day 510 and a time-averaged 
44 to 54% lowering of LDL-C after Day 90 through Day 540. Other lipid parameter like Apo-B were 
reduced by approximately 40%. 
In all 3 studies sensitivity analyses using imputation for missing values produced similar results. 
Moreover, results of the phase I studies demonstrated the effectiveness of inclisiran in subjects with 
renal and hepatic impairment. 
The 3 ongoing long-term studies, including one dedicated study to evaluate the efficacy of inclisiran on 
CV outcomes, will reveal the impact of inclisiran on CV and overall mortality. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Inclisiran demonstrated a long lasting and robust effect on PCSK9 reduction with a consequent 
reduction of LDL-C levels during 18 months of therapy. Most of the participants completed the efficacy 
studies with only few discontinuations. A strong positive effect could be observed on all primary and 
secondary clinical endpoints. More data on long-term efficacy and safety will be derived from the 
ongoing long-term studies.  
The participants which were studied in the phase III programme adequately represent the target 
population for inclisiran as an adjunct to background lipid-lowering therapy in subjects who require 
further LDL-C lowering. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Patient exposure in the pivotal trials is extensive. Overall, safety from 4332 subjects have been 
provided, 2452 on inclisiran at any dose and 2118 on inclisiran at the recommended 300 mg dose; 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020  
Page 112/143 
 
 
 
 
safety data of more than 1500 subjects in the intended population given the proposed dose for at least 
18 months have been included. Safety of inclisiran for more than 18 months of treatment is currently 
under evaluation in the 3 ongoing studies ORION-3, ORION-8, and ORION-4.  
The phase III studies Safety Pool includes 3655 subjects, 1833 on inclisiran, and 1822 on placebo. Of 
these, 94% (3422/3655) completed the phase III studies, 94.4% (1731/1833) on inclisiran and 92.8% 
(1691/1822) on placebo; 90.6% (1650/1822) of placebo and 90.9% (1666/1833) of inclisiran-treated 
subjects received all 4 doses of study drug. There was no difference in mean subject-days of follow-up, 
523 days in the placebo and 526 days in the inclisiran group. 
In addition, the applicant has presented safety data from phase I and II studies individually, including 
trials in subjects with renal impairment and with hepatic impairment, a thorough QT study, and a pilot 
study in HoFH. The disposition of subjects included in the Safety Pool (phase III safety data) are given 
in the table below.

Adverse events 
Overall, in the phase III trials the incidence and type of common AEs was comparable between the 
placebo and the inclisiran group. In the Safety Pool, 77.3% (1409/1822) placebo and 78.0% 
(1430/1833) inclisiran-treated subjects had ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) occurred in 23.0% (419/1822) on placebo and 20.4% 
(374/1833) on inclisiran.  
The most common AEs occurring more frequently on inclisiran than placebo were diabetes mellitus, 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, bronchitis, cough, headache, 
angina pectoris, dizziness, pain in extremity, dyspnoea, and injection site reaction, while osteoarthritis, 
blood CPK increase, non-cardiac chest pain, and influenza occurred more frequently on placebo than 
inclisiran. However, except for injection site AEs [placebo 1.8% (33/1822); inclisiran 8.2% 
(150/1833)] these differences between groups were small. According to the data provided, injection 
site AEs were localised, predominantly mild or occasionally moderate, transient, and resolved without 
sequelae; no subject on inclisiran had a severe or serious injection site AE. 
The incidence of severe AEs was higher on placebo than inclisiran [15.3% (278/1822) versus 13.0% 
(238/1833)]. The most common severe AEs were acute MI [1.5% (27/1822); 0.8% (14/1833)], 
coronary artery disease [0.9% (16/1822); 1.0% (18/1833)], and cardiac failure congestive [0.6% 
(11/1822); 0.4% (7/1833)].

The incidence of TEAEs assessed by the investigators as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to treatment was 9.7% (177/1822) in the placebo and 15.6% (286/1833) in the inclisiran 
group; the difference was primarily due to TEAEs at the injection site. On placebo, the most common

TEAEs considered related to study drug were CPK increased (0.7%; 13/1822), myalgia (0.6%; 
11/1822), and fatigue (0.5%; 9/1822), while on inclisiran, these were injection site reaction (2.9%; 
53/1833), injection site pain (2.0%; 37/1833), and injection site erythema (1.5%; 27/1833). 
With the limited data available, AEs associated with renal or hepatic safety appear to be balanced 
between placebo and inclisiran groups. 
No significant differences in neurological events and neurocognitive disorders between placebo and 
inclisiran were observed and ophthalmological AEs were balanced between groups.

No additional safety concern was identified in the phase I and II studies. 
Diabetes and glycaemic control 
Overall, AEs associated with the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus were balanced between 
inclisiran and placebo. Slightly more AEs of HbA1c increased (placebo 0.2%, inclisiran 0.5%) and 
hyperglycaemia (0.8%, 1.4%) occurred in the inclisiran compared to the placebo group, but type 2 
diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently on placebo (1.2%) than inclisiran (0.8%).  
Results for subjects with diabetes mellitus at baseline were comparable between the inclisiran and the 
placebo group, while in subjects without diabetes mellitus at baseline numerically slightly more in the 
placebo (4.7%) than in the inclisiran group (4.4%) had a TEAE related to development of diabetes 
mellitus. 
There were no clear clinically meaningful differences between placebo and inclisiran-treated subjects in 
shift from baseline in glucose control based on fasting glucose, HbA1c, and glucose control category 
using last on treatment values, but slightly more subjects in the inclisiran compared to the placebo 
group showed shifts towards a poorer outcome (overall: placebo worsened 21.7%, inclisiran 25.2%; 
placebo improved 2.3%, inclisiran 2.1%; placebo no change 74.9%, inclisiran 71.6%).

In subjects with no diabetes at baseline, new-onset of diabetes mellitus occurred in 4.7% on placebo 
and 4.3% on inclisiran. In subjects with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, new-onset diabetes 
mellitus occurred in 13.8% on placebo and 14.6% on inclisiran. Time to new-onset diabetes was 
comparable between the placebo and the inclisiran groups. 
Cardiac Safety 
Based on assessments of AEs and vital signs, no significant difference in the cardiac safety profile was 
observed between the placebo and the inclisiran group.

Deaths 
The number and percentage of deaths occurring in the phase III trials was comparable between the 
placebo and the inclisiran group; no clear pattern or differences between these groups were observed 
in the phase III studies. However, death due to cardiac disorders occurred in 0.7% on inclisiran and 
0.5% on placebo. The numbers are too small for any clear conclusion; a final conclusion will depend on 
the results of the CV outcome-study which will only be available post-licensing.

In the phase II study ORION-1, 2 subjects died, 1 in the 500 mg inclisiran single-dose group due to MI 
and 1 in the 200 mg inclisiran double-dose group due to device-related infection. In study ORION-3, 1 
subject in group 1 (inclisiran only arm) died. No deaths were reported for subjects treated with 
inclisiran in group 2 (switching arm).  
No deaths were reported in study ORION-2 and the phase I studies. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, serious AEs occurred more often in the placebo than the inclisiran group of the phase III trials; 
the incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) was 23.0% (419/1822) in the 
placebo and 20.4% (374/1833) in the inclisiran group. There was no difference in the frequency or 
nature of TESAEs between groups. TESAEs were predominantly CV events and approximately half of 
these were considered severe. There were no imbalances of TESAE for neoplasms between groups 
[placebo 2.7% (49/1822); inclisiran 2.4% (44/1833)]. Details are given in the table below.

Laboratory findings 
Biochemical Markers of Hepatic Function  
Overall, no clinically meaningful changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin were reported in either the placebo or the 
inclisiran group over the course of the studies. There were no cases meeting the definition of Hy’s Law 
in either group. 
The percentages of subjects with ALT, ALP, and AST >3x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN were 
comparable between groups. Overall, 1.8% in each group (n=32 and 33, respectively) had at least 1 
clinically significant chemistry laboratory value and 5 subjects on inclisiran and 3 on placebo had

increases >3x ULN in both ALT and AST. In both groups, the majority of elevated laboratory levels 
returned to their baseline levels with continued inclisiran or placebo treatment.

Note:  Clinically significant criteria are met when both of the following occur: 
- Post-baseline values meet the thresholds, and  
- Baseline values or any prior post-baseline values do not meet the thresholds. 
The worst post-baseline value was utilised in the analyses.  
Abbreviations:  CS=clinically significant; ULN=upper limit of normal 
However, the percentages of subjects with potentially clinically significant (PCS; >1x to 3x ULN) 
elevations of ALT, as well as AST were higher in the inclisiran, than the placebo group [19.7% 
(361/1833) versus 13.6% (248/1822) and 17.2% (316/1833) versus 11.1% (202/1822), 
respectively].  
According to the applicant, subjects with elevated biochemical markers of hepatic function will be 
followed in the long-term extension study ORION-8. These data will need to be analysed for a final 
conclusion on the influence of inclisiran on hepatic function. 
Biochemical Markers of Renal Function 
No clinically meaningful changes in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran group over the course of 
the studies.

Biochemical Markers of Myopathy 
No clinically meaningful changes in creatinine kinase in either the placebo or the inclisiran group, nor 
significant imbalances in the percentages of subjects with clinically significant changes in creatinine 
kinase between the placebo and the inclisiran group were observed 
Slightly more subjects in the inclisiran, than the placebo group had creatinine kinase >5x ULN, >5x 
and ≤10x ULN, and >10 and ≤20x ULN but numbers were small and no subject in the inclisiran group 
had elevations >20x ULN versus 4 in the placebo group. Furthermore, 1 subject in the placebo group 
had an associated TEAE (myalgia) compared to none in the inclisiran group. The majority subjects with 
normal baseline values remained within normal range (65.6% inclisiran, 64% placebo).

(n placebo, inclisiran): White 1704, 1669; Black 101, 131; Other 17, 33; Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 
116, 120; Not Hispanic or Latino 1706, 1713] and no definite conclusions on AEs by race / ethnicity 
are possible. So far there is no clinical evidence indicating differences in the efficacy or safety of 
inclisiran based on ethnicity and available clinical data of other PCSK9 inhibitors (antibodies) support 
the assumption that efficacy and safety of these medicinal products do not differ by race / ethnicity.  
Renal Function 
Subgroup analyses by normal, mild, and moderate renal impairment did not reveal significant 
differences between placebo and inclisiran; for the subgroup of severe renal impairment, the number 
of subjects is too small for a definite conclusion. 
Hepatic Function 
Analyses of AEs by hepatic impairment is primarily based on safety results from the single-dose, open-
label, hepatic impairment study ORION-6. This study enrolled 28 subjects, 10 with mild hepatic 
impairment, 6 with moderate hepatic impairment, and 12 healthy subjects with normal hepatic

function matched to the subjects with hepatic impairment; 1 subject was withdrawn by the sponsor 
due to entry into a mandatory in house treatment program and was therefore unavailable following the 
day 120 visit. 
According to the applicant hepatic function status was not assessed as part of the study protocol for 
the pivotal phase III trials, but the applicant has provided a post-hoc classification of the hepatic 
function of subjects in the phase III safety pool based on the Child-Pugh hepatic function scoring 
system. According to this post-hoc assignment, the majority of subjects were ascribed a Child-Pugh 
score of 5 (n=3595) or of 6 (n=52), only a few subjects (n=4) of 7, and no subject of > 7. The 
analyses of AEs by hepatic function according to this post-hoc classification has not revealed relevant 
differences between inclisiran and placebo treated subjects although the interpretation is limited by the 
post-hoc assignment of the score as well as the low number of subjects with a Child-Pugh score > 5; 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied which is reflected in the PI. 
Immunological events 
Anti-drug Antibodies 
Samples tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) occurred at low frequency and were comparable 
at pre- and post-dose timepoints; overall, titres were low. No associations between the presence of 
ADA and AEs or changes in LDL-C and PSCK9 levels were identified.  
According to the applicant, the development of ADA will continue to be evaluated in the ongoing long-
term extension studies ORION-3 and ORION-8 and the CV outcomes trial ORION-4. 
Hypersensitivity 
No systemic allergic reactions or signs or symptoms suggestive of systemic allergic reactions were 
observed with the administration of inclisiran. TEAEs related to hypersensitivity did not indicate 
differences between groups except for events at the injection site. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Inclisiran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes or common drug 
transporters and therefore not expected to have clinically significant interactions with other medicinal 
products. Statin drug-drug interaction assessments demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful 
interactions with either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No difference in the frequency or nature of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 
identified between the inclisiran and the placebo group, except for subjects withdrawn from study drug 
due to TEAEs at the injection site [placebo 0% (0/1822); inclisiran 0.2% (4/1833)].

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set for the current application is primarily based on pooled safety results from the 3 
confirmatory, randomised, double-blind, 18-month, placebo-controlled phase III studies ORION-9 
[Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)], ORION-10 [Atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD)], and ORION-11 (ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents), comprising about 3600 
subjects treated for more than a year. Thus, patient exposure in the pivotal trials is considered 
extensive comprising about 1700 subjects in each the inclisiran and the placebo group treated for 18 
months. Safety of inclisiran given for more than 18 months of treatment is currently under evaluation 
including a CV outcomes trial.  
Dropouts were low in the inclisiran, as well as the placebo group with 94.4% and 92.8%, respectively, 
completing the phase III studies, and 90.9% and 90.6%, respectively, receiving all 4 doses of study 
drug. Demographic characteristics, relevant CV risk factors and other comorbidities, lipid-modifying 
therapy usage, and recorded previous and concomitant medications taken at randomisation were 
sufficiently balanced between treatment groups. About one third of the subjects included in the Safety 
Pool were female.  
Overall, in the phase III trials the incidence and type of common AEs was comparable between the 
placebo and the inclisiran group.  
The number and percentage of deaths was comparable between the placebo and the inclisiran group, 
but numbers are too small for clear conclusions; a final conclusion will depend on the results of the CV 
outcome-study which will become available post-licensing. 
The incidence of severe AEs was higher on placebo than inclisiran (15.3% versus 13.0%); the most 
common severe AEs were acute MI (1.5%, 0.8%), coronary artery disease (0.9%, 1.0%), and cardiac 
failure congestive (0.6%, 0.4%). Likewise, overall serious AEs occurred more often in the placebo than 
the inclisiran group, but there were no clear differences in the frequency or nature of AEs between 
groups. Serious AEs were predominantly CV events and approximately half of these were considered 
severe.  
The most common AEs occurring more frequently on inclisiran than placebo were diabetes mellitus, 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, bronchitis, cough, headache, 
angina pectoris, dizziness, pain in extremity, dyspnoea, and injection site reaction, while osteoarthritis, 
blood CPK increase, non-cardiac chest pain, and influenza occurred more frequently on placebo than 
inclisiran. However, except for injection site AEs (placebo 1.8%; inclisiran 8.2%) these differences 
between groups were small.  
Injection site AEs were localised, predominantly mild or occasionally moderate, transient, and resolved 
without sequelae; no subject on inclisiran had a severe or serious injection site AE.  
Overall, AEs associated with the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus were balanced between 
inclisiran and placebo. Slightly more AEs of HbA1c increased (placebo 0.2%, inclisiran 0.5%) and 
hyperglycaemia (0.8%, 1.4%) occurred in the inclisiran compared to the placebo group, but type 2 
diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently on placebo (1.2%) than inclisiran (0.8%). Results for 
subjects with diabetes mellitus at baseline were comparable between the inclisiran and the placebo 
group, while in subjects without diabetes mellitus at baseline numerically slightly more in the placebo 
(4.7%) than in the inclisiran group (4.4%) had a TEAE related to development of diabetes mellitus. 
There were no clear clinically meaningful differences between placebo and inclisiran-treated subjects in 
shift from baseline in glucose control based on fasting glucose, HbA1c, and glucose control category 
using last on treatment values, but slightly more subjects in the inclisiran compared to the placebo 
group showed shifts towards a poorer outcome. In subjects with no diabetes at baseline, new-onset of 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020 
Page 127/143 
 
 
  
diabetes mellitus occurred in 4.7% on placebo and 4.3% on inclisiran. In subjects with impaired 
glucose tolerance at baseline, new-onset diabetes mellitus occurred in 13.8% on placebo and 14.6% 
on inclisiran. Time to new-onset diabetes was comparable between the placebo and the inclisiran 
groups. 
Overall, no clinically meaningful changes in biochemical markers of hepatic function were identified in 
either group; the percentages of subjects with clinically relevant elevations of these markers were 
comparable between groups and in both groups, the majority of elevated laboratory levels returned to 
their baseline levels with continued inclisiran or placebo treatment. However, the percentages of 
subjects with potentially clinically significant elevations of ALT, as well as AST were higher in the 
inclisiran, than the placebo group (19.7% versus 13.6% and 17.2% versus 11.1%, respectively). 
There were no cases meeting the definition of Hy’s Law. According to the applicant, subjects with 
elevated biochemical markers of hepatic function will be followed in the long-term extension study 
ORION-8. 
AEs associated with hepatic safety appear to be balanced between the placebo and the inclisiran group. 
As regards biochemical markers of myopathy, no clinically meaningful changes or significant 
imbalances were observed. Slightly more subjects in the inclisiran, than the placebo group had 
creatinine kinase >5x ULN, >5x and ≤10x ULN, and >10 and ≤20x ULN but numbers were small and 
no subject in the inclisiran group had elevations >20x ULN versus 4 in the placebo group. Furthermore, 
1 subject in the placebo group had an associated TEAE (myalgia) compared to none in the inclisiran 
group. The majority subjects with normal baseline values remained within normal range (65.6% 
inclisiran, 64% placebo). 
No significant differences between the placebo and the inclisiran group were observed in the cardiac 
safety profile, for neurological events and neurocognitive disorders, ophthalmological AEs, AEs 
associated with renal safety, biochemical markers of renal function, changes in hsCRP or shifts in mean 
and median hsCRP values, changes in haematology or coagulation parameters, and between the 
commercial presentation prefilled syringe and the vial and syringe used in earlier clinical studies. 
As regards safety in special populations, no significant differences in TEAE and serious TEAE related to 
age or gender were identified and subgroup analyses by race / ethnicity did not reveal significant 
differences for the predefined groups, but currently the number of subjects in subgroups other than 
‘White’ are limited Subgroup analyses by normal, mild, and moderate renal impairment did not reveal 
significant differences between placebo and inclisiran; for the subgroup of severe renal impairment, the 
number of subjects is too small for a definite conclusion. Analyses of AEs by hepatic function for the 
Safety Pool are based on a post-hoc classification of the hepatic function of subjects in the phase III 
safety pool based on the Child-Pugh hepatic function scoring system, since hepatic function status was 
not assessed as part of the study protocol for the pivotal phase III trials. The analysis of AEs by 
hepatic function according to this post-hoc classification has not revealed relevant differences between 
inclisiran and placebo treated subjects although the interpretation is limited by the post-hoc 
assignment of the score as well as the low number of subjects with a Child-Pugh score >5; subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied which is reflected in the agreed Product 
Information. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) occurred at low frequency and were comparable at pre- and post-dose 
timepoints. No associations between ADA and AEs, changes in LDL-C, or PSCK9 levels were identified. 
According to the applicant, the development of ADA will continue to be evaluated in the ongoing long-
term extension studies and the CV outcomes trial. Also, no systemic allergic reactions or signs or 
symptoms suggestive of systemic allergic reactions were observed with the administration of inclisiran. 
TEAEs related to hypersensitivity did not indicate differences between groups except for events at the 
injection site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020 
Page 128/143 
 
 
  
As regards safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions, based on the available data, 
no clinically relevant interactions with other medications are expected. 
No difference in the frequency or nature of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 
identified between both groups, except for subjects withdrawn from study drug due to TEAEs at the 
injection site (placebo 0%, inclisiran 0.2%). 
No additional safety concerns were identified in the phase I and II studies. 
No post marketing data are currently available. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile appears to be comparable between inclisiran and placebo when given in addition to 
maximal tolerated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy (including no statin in case of statin 
intolerance) and standard of care in the included patient populations (heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
risk equivalents). The safety data set for the current application is extensive, comprising about 1700 
subjects in each the inclisiran and the placebo group treated for 18 months; safety of inclisiran given 
for more than 18 months of treatment is currently under evaluation including a CV outcome trial. 
Treatment compliance in the 3 pivotal phase III trials was high and the number of drop outs low.  
So far, no signs of adverse effects of inclisiran on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality have been 
identified. Numbers of AEs related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are low; relevant clinical 
trials are ongoing and results will be provided post-authorisation.  
The number of deaths was low and comparable between both groups. Severe and serious adverse 
events occurred slightly more often in the placebo, than the inclisiran group, but there were no clear 
differences in the frequency or nature of AEs between groups.  
Overall, in the phase III trials the incidence and type of common AEs was comparable between the 
placebo and the inclisiran group and differences between groups were small, except for injection site 
AEs (placebo 1.8%; inclisiran 8.2%). Injection site AEs were localised, predominantly mild or 
occasionally moderate, transient, and resolved without sequelae; no subject on inclisiran had a severe 
or serious injection site AE.  
No significant effects of inclisiran on known safety issues identified with other lipid lowering therapies, 
such as liver disorders, renal disorders, diabetes, and musculoskeletal disorders, have been identified, 
but slightly more subjects in the inclisiran compared to the placebo group showed shifts towards a 
poorer outcome in AEs associated with the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus and 
potentially clinically significant elevations of ALT (19.7% vs. 13.6%) or AST (17.2% vs. 11.1%). 
According to the applicant, subjects with elevated biochemical markers of hepatic function will be 
followed in the long-term extension study ORION-8. 
No significant differences in TEAE and serious TEAE related to age, gender, race / ethnicity, and 
hepatic or renal safety have been identified.  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) occurred at low frequency and were comparable at pre- and post-dose 
timepoints. No associations between ADA and AEs, changes in LDL-C, or PSCK9 levels have been 
identified.  
Overall, based on the data provided the safety profile of inclisiran is considered acceptable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.  
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of inclisiran with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers inclisiran to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Leqvio (inclisiran) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary hypercholesterolemia by definition is any hypercholesterolaemia, which is caused by a 
disturbance in the lipid metabolism (familial- or nonfamilial) and is not caused by another condition, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition (HeFH) is 
rare and is estimated to occur in 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C levels in affected individuals are 
elevated and, in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still a 2-fold excess of CHD-related deaths 
relative to age-matched controls within this population4. 
Hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by an increased level of cholesterol in the blood. Primary 
hyperlipidaemia is usually due to genetic causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental 
factors, such as diet and lifestyle, and primary nonfamilial hyperlipidaemia is a kind of hyperlipidaemia 
that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, but due to polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidaemia is 
generally defined as elevated LDL-C and high triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. 
A strong positive correlation and causal relationship between LDL-C level and risk of CHD has been 
derived from a large body of clinical and epidemiological data. There is also a strong relationship to 
other clinical manifestations in the body like cerebrovascular disease (i.e. ischaemic stroke) or 
peripheral vascular disease. Numerous clinical studies demonstrated that LDL-C lowering therapy 
especially with statins reduces the risk for CVD and epidemiologic data indicate a continuous increasing 
relative risk of CVD from very low to high levels of LDL-C, with a higher absolute risk in patients at the 
higher end of LDL-C levels. 
Aim of any therapy in hypercholesterolaemia is to reduce LDL-C levels and to achieve LDL-C 
<70 mg/dL in patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and 
other risks, and adding non-statins to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL in severe primary 
hypercholesterolaemia (diagnostic LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL), including familial hypercholesterolaemia 
(FH) 5, 6. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Gold standard in the therapy for patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial 
and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia to reduce LDL-C, as an adjunct to diet, are statins. Statins 
have robustly demonstrated CVD benefits in patients at increased CVD risk and clinical guidelines 
strongly recommend the use of statins in patients with elevated LDL-C levels. If baseline levels are 
between 1.8 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L (70 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL) treatment aims are to reduce LDL-C

levels below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or at least to reduce LDL-C by 50%. There is a need for additional 
therapies for LDL C lowering and CVD prevention in patients at very high risk of CV events who are 
already receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a statin or have limitations in statin tolerability and do 
not reach LDL-C goals. There is no consensus definition for statin intolerance, but there should be 
documented evidence of intolerance due to emerging AEs to at least 2 different statins administered in 
doses required to achieve the target LDL-C level. Statin-associated adverse effects (e.g. muscular 
adverse effects) may occur that limit the ability to take a statin or a high enough dose of statin to 
reach the required LDL-C goal. These subjects are at a higher risk of not achieving their individual LDL-
C target appropriate to their level of CV risk as other lipid-lowering therapies with non-statins, with the 
exception of PCSK9 inhibitors, only provide about 15-20% reduction in LDL-C levels. 
Lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors achieve an additional LDL-C lowering. 
These drugs are indicated in subjects with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C as an on-top therapy to 
statins when additional LDL-C lowering is needed as second line therapy (according to learned society 
guidelines).  
Ezetimibe has demonstrated CVD benefit in the IMPROVE-IT trial7, even if the absolute CV benefit from 
adding ezetimibe was limited in line with its modest effect on LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL-C 
levels very effectively by over 50% and have also demonstrated CVD risk reduction in clinical trials in 
patients with established CVD8, 9. 
The CVD benefit of other lipid lowering therapies (i.e. fibrates) have not been demonstrated although 
even these medicinal products may provide a reduction of some lipid parameters including moderate 
reductions in LDL-C. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The phase III programme to investigate the effects of inclisiran in patients with HeFH and ASCVD or 
ASCVD-risk equivalents with elevated LDL-C levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy include 3 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies: 
• 
• 
• 
ORION-9 (n=482), a 540 Days randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran 300 mg SC compared to placebo added to 
background LMT in patients with HeFH and elevated LDL-C. 
ORION-10 (n=1,571), a 540 Days randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran 300 mg SC compared to placebo added to

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Inclisiran is a chemically modified double-stranded 21-23mer siRNA, conjugated on the sense strand 
with triantennary GalNAc to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, the antisense strand is 
incorporated in the RISC and directs catalytic breakdown of mRNA for PCSK9. This inhibits the 
translation of PCSK9 protein, reduces the intrahepatic PCSK9, and increases LDL-C receptor recycling 
and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, thereby increasing LDL-C uptake and lowering LDL-C 
levels in the circulation. 
Inclisiran sodium at a dose of 300 mg (equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran) SC at Day 1, Day 90, and 
every 180 days thereafter lowers LDL-C by about 50% or more. This lipid-lowering is robust and 
statistically significant and is stable over the time with a slow returning of LDL-C to the baseline level 
after stopping the therapy by about 3% per month.  
Data from the 3 confirmatory studies demonstrated that significantly more patients reached LDL-C 
targets of 2.5 mmol/L and 1.8 mmol/L and had ≥50% LDL-C lowering on inclisiran than on placebo [-
49.52 (95% CI: -55.04, -43.99; p<0.0001) and -44.30 (95% CI: -48.48, -40.12; p<0.0001)] co-
primary endpoints study ORION-9; -57.64 (95% CI: -60.86, -54.43; p<0.0001) and -53.78 (95% CI: -
56.23, -51.33; p<0.0001) study ORION-10; -53.50 (95% CI: -56.66, -50.35; p<0.0001) and -49.92 
(95% CI: -52.29, -47.55; p<0.0001) study ORION-11, respectively], signalling the clinical 
effectiveness of inclisiran therapy. Efficacy was supported by significant reductions in other relevant 
parameters of the cholesterol profile (i.e. PCSK9 (60% to 70%), TC (25% to 34%), Apo-B (33% to 
43%), and non-HDL (35% to 43%).  
The LDL-C effect of inclisiran was consistent across several subgroups, i.e. age, race, gender, ethnicity, 
region, metabolic disease, various genotyping, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, intensity of statin 
treatment, non-statin lipid-lowering therapy, and baseline GFR category. A sustained effect of LDL-C 
reduction has been demonstrated up to 540 days in the 3 placebo-controlled studies on top of statin 
therapy. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the effect on LDL-C was independent of the intensity of 
the statin therapy. 
Subgroup analyses have been presented across the age categories of <65 years - 74 years, 75 – 84 
years, and ≥85 years, respectively, which was consistent with those seen in the overall population. 
Even that there was only a small number of elderly 85+ years, it could be demonstrated that inclisiran 
was just as effective as in the other groups observed in reducing the lipid parameters. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Inclisiran has demonstrated its ability to reduce LDL-C in patients with elevated LDL-C levels, which is 
an approved surrogate marker for CVD risk. However, a favourable impact on CV outcomes has not yet 
been confirmed. Preliminary data from the 3 confirmatory studies on MACE (composite of CV death, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, and stroke [ischaemic or haemorrhagic]) show that it was 
equally distributed (ORION-9) or in favour of inclisiran (ORION-10, ORION-11). An analysis of these 
findings has currently not been provided. However, the overall number of events was low precluding 
firm conclusions. 
The vast majority of participants in the 3 studies were White. Only a small group of Asians and Black 
people were included in the phase III studies. In regard of the Black population the efficacy data was 
consistent with the White population for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The same was 
evident for the small number of the Asian population included in the 3 pivotal studies. 
Furthermore, the effect of inclisiran in LDL-C lowering has been demonstrated up to 18 month and not 
yet beyond.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, in the phase III trials the incidence and type of common AEs was comparable between the 
placebo and the inclisiran group.  
Unfavourable effects associated with inclisiran in the placebo-controlled pivotal trials were adverse 
events reactions at the injection site (placebo 1.8%; inclisiran 8.2%); these adverse events were 
localised, predominantly mild or occasionally moderate, transient, and resolved without sequelae. No 
subject on inclisiran had a severe or serious injection site AE. The most frequently occurring adverse 
events at the injection site in patients treated with inclisiran were injection site reaction (3.1%), 
injection site pain (2.2%), injection site erythema (1.6%), and injection site rash (0.7%). 
Furthermore, while no clinically meaningful changes (>3x ULN) in biochemical markers of hepatic 
function were identified in either group and the percentages of subjects with clinically relevant 
elevations of these markers were comparable between groups, the percentages of subjects with 
potentially clinically significant elevations (>1x to 3x ULN) of ALT, as well as AST were higher in the 
inclisiran, than the placebo group (19.7% versus 13.6% and 17.2% versus 11.1%, respectively). AEs 
associated with hepatic safety are balanced between the placebo and the inclisiran group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number and percentage of deaths was comparable between the placebo and the inclisiran group, 
but numbers are too small for clear conclusions and the duration of treatment is limited to 18 months. 
In addition, no definite data on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are currently available. 
Numbers of AEs related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are low and the available data do not 
indicate a detrimental effect of inclisiran on cardiovascular outcomes. A relevant CV outcome trial is 
ongoing and results will be provided post-authorisation. 
No safety issues identified with other lipid lowering therapies, such as liver disorders, renal disorders, 
diabetes, and musculoskeletal disorders, have been identified with inclisiran, but slightly more subjects 
in the inclisiran compared to the placebo group showed shifts in AEs associated with the development 
or worsening of diabetes mellitus.  
Besides injection site reactions, the most common AEs occurring more frequently on inclisiran than 
placebo were development or worsening of diabetes mellitus, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, 
urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, bronchitis, cough, headache, angina pectoris, dizziness, pain in 
extremity, dyspnoea, while osteoarthritis, blood CPK increase, non-cardiac chest pain, and influenza 
occurred more frequently on placebo than inclisiran, but differences between groups for these 
unfavourable effects were small, not indicating clinically relevant differences and may well be due to 
random variation.  
As regards safety in special populations, for subgroup analyses by race / ethnicity the number of 
subjects in subgroups other than ‘White’ are limited, but data so far do not indicate significant 
differences.  
Analyses of AEs by hepatic function for the phase III studies Safety Pool are based on a post-hoc 
classification of the hepatic function. This analysis has not revealed relevant differences between 
inclisiran- and placebo-treated subjects; subjects with severe hepatic impairment have not been 
studied, which is reflected in the PI. 
No safety concerns are evident in patients with impaired renal function, however, the number of 
subjects with severe renal impairment is too small for a conclusion. Non-clinical toxicology studies 
showed basophilic granules in the kidneys of rats and monkeys indicating accumulation of inclisiran but 
Assessment report

these were not rated as adverse toxicological findings. Inclisiran should be used with caution in 
patients with severe renal impairment

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Inclisiran used in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, mixed dyslipidaemia, and in patients 
with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has demonstrated significant, consistent and clinically 
relevant reductions in LDL-C and other relevant lipid parameters like PCSK9, Total Cholesterol, ApoB, 
and non-HDL. The resulting effects on these lipid parameters were robust across several subgroups like 
age, gender, ethnicity, region, metabolic disease, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, intensity of statin 
treatment, non-statin lipid-lowering therapy, and baseline GFR category.  
Lipid-lowering effects of inclisiran have been investigated in patients with and without co-
administration of a statin. Therefore, the proposed indication is to use in patients on maximally 
tolerated statin therapy.  
The lipid lowering effects of inclisiran are only a, albeit generally accepted, surrogate for beneficial 
effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Positive CV outcome studies are available for 
medicinal products with comparable effects, i.e. alirocumab and evolocumab. Analyses of MACE events 
for inclisiran on top of statins did exclude a trend towards cardiovascular harm, in line with the 
Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
(EMA/CHMP/50549/2015). However, confirmation that the observed lipid-lowering effect will indeed 
result in improved cardiovascular outcome is still missing and needs to be addressed in the post-
authorisation phase. Three long-term studies, including one CV outcome study are currently ongoing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020 
Page 140/143 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Long-term data of inclisiran on top of maximum tolerated statin therapy beyond 18 months of 
treatment can be considered limited, since the intended treatment may be lifelong. However, the data 
available indicate that efficacy is maintained over time and safety so far does not suggest any long-
term major concerns. 
The overall safety profile of inclisiran appears rather benign. AEs that were observed at a relevantly 
higher incidence with inclisiran compared to placebo were injection site reactions. These however were 
not associated with a higher dropout rate or a lower compliance. In fact, the dropout rate in the pivotal 
trials was low and comparable between groups and compliance in these trials was high. Furthermore, 
these injection site reactions might indicate hypersensitivity related to inclisiran, but no systemic 
allergic reactions or signs or symptoms suggestive of systemic allergic reactions were observed with 
the administration of inclisiran and TEAEs related to hypersensitivity did not indicate differences 
between groups except for events at the injection site. These adverse events were localised, 
predominantly mild or occasionally moderate, transient, and resolved without sequelae. No subject on 
inclisiran had a severe or serious injection site AE.  
A higher frequency of mild to moderate ALT or AST elevations (> 1 x to 3 x ULN) were observed with 
inclisiran. However, no clinically meaningful changes (> 3 x ULN) in biochemical markers of hepatic 
function were identified in either group, the percentages of subjects with clinically relevant elevations 
of these markers were comparable between groups, and the percentages of subjects with AEs 
associated with hepatic safety were balanced between the placebo and the inclisiran group.  
3.7.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Inclisiran is a first in class short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) directed against PCSK9, which 
prevents the translation of PSCK9 and thus prevents LDLR degradation. This leads to clinically clearly 
meaningful LDL-C reduction. 
The proposed indication for inclisiran is for use as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin 
therapy for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidaemia (including heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). 
Patients participating in the 3 confirmatory studies were in need of further LDL-C lowering despite 
maximum tolerated statin therapy due to their increased cardiovascular risks. In the inclisiran treated 
patients, a substantial clinically relevant lipid reduction was observed with an acceptable safety profile. 
The safety findings currently do not indicate a significant risk associated with the use of inclisiran 
based on an extensive safety dataset with a treatment period of 18 months and low dropout rates. 
Data in patients with severe hepatic impairment are lacking and are very limited patients with severe 
renal impairment. Inclisiran should be used with caution in these patients.  
The results of the 3 studies demonstrated a robust lipid-lowering in patients taking high intensity 
statins and in patients who were statin intolerant, even as there is no consensus definition for statin 
intolerance.  
A limitation of the dossier is the lack of cardiovascular outcome data. Although a reduction in LDL-C is 
known to be a strong surrogate for cardiovascular risk reduction, this finding is mainly based on 
outcome data in numerous clinical studies obtained with statins. Also, recent studies with ezetimibe 
and PCSK9 inhibitors strengthen the value of LDL-C as a surrogate marker. As inclisiran has a new 
mode of action on LDL-C lowering, a similar relationship has to established. A cardiovascular outcome 
study is already ongoing and final results should provide confirmation of the expected cardiovascular 
benefit.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Leqvio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Leqvio is favourable in the following indication: 
Leqvio is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
Assessment report  
EMA/696912/2020 
Page 142/143 
 
 
  
 
 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that inclisiran is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data  
No significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan P/0321/2018 have been completed, in 
accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, after the entry into force of that 
Regulation.

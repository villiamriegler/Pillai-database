1.  Introduction 
The clinical study reports of studies V102_03 and V102_03E1 are submitted in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. These studies were conducted as part of the 
development program of the investigational meningococcal combination vaccine MenABCWY, intended 
to protect against the five most common Neisseria meningitides serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y) 
responsible for invasive meningococcal disease worldwide. MenABCWY combination vaccine is based 
upon two established GSK vaccine components, Menveo and Bexsero.  
Bexsero was used in study V102_03 as a comparator vaccine, while in study V102_03E1 was evaluated 
the antibody persistence at 24 months after vaccination performed in study V102_03. 
The MAH has also submitted the V102_03 Erratum to the CSR dated 15 December 2014. This Erratum 
was stated to be issued in order to correct some minor transcription errors affecting the original CSR, 
that have no impact on any of the analyses and interpretations of the study results presented in the 
original CSR. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit/risk for Bexsero and 
therefore no amendments to the product information have been identified.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.  Summary of data submitted  
The best option for the control of meningococcal disease would be the use of effective vaccines against 
all 5 of the most common serogroups (A, B, C, W-135, and Y) responsible for invasive meningococcal 
disease in humans. Based upon its extensive clinical experience with the MenACWY vaccine and with 
the rMenB (with or without OMV) vaccine, Novartis is developing such a combination vaccine; this 
study is part of that effort.  
A phase 1 study (V102P1) evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of several 
formulations of a meningococcal ABCWY (MenABCWY) combination vaccine administered to healthy 
adults has been completed. A phase 2 study (V102_02) evaluating the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of 4 different MenABCWY vaccine formulations, with or without OMV, and with 
different amounts of recombinant proteins in healthy adolescents (aged 11 through 18 years), has also 
been completed.  
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 3/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The primary phase 2 study (V102_03) was designed to evaluate 2 MenABCWY formulations 
(MenABCWY+ OMV and MenABCWY+¼OMV) given at a 0, 2 month schedule in order to demonstrate 
that the safety and immunogenicity of the combination vaccine are at least comparable to that of the 
licensed vaccine, Menveo, in adolescents and adults aged 10-25 years. Study results from V102_03 
were used to select the final MenABCWY formulation, ABCWY+OMV to bring forward into clinical 
development.  
The V102_03E1 study is an extension of primary phase 2 study V102_03, conducted in healthy 
subjects who were 10 to 25 years of age at the time of participation in the parent study. The aim of 
the extension study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of the same 
formulation of MenABCWY vaccine received in the parent study V102_03, administered approximately 
24 months after completion of the primary vaccination series in V102_03. Antibody persistence at 24 
and 36 months after the primary vaccination series and 12 months after the booster dose was also to 
be evaluated in study subjects.  
Scientific Discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study V102_03 was a phase 2, observer blinded, controlled, randomized multi-center study in 
adolescents and young adults to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of two different rMenB with OMV 
+ MenACWY combination vaccination formulations. 
Study V102_03E1 was a phase 2, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center 
extension study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of a MenABCWY vaccine 
administered 24 months following the primary series to adolescents and young adults who participated 
in V102_03.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational formulations (MenABCWY+OMV and MenABCWY+qOMV) contained the same 
quantity of oligosaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y (conjugated to CRM-197 
protein) and the same quantity of serogroup B fusion proteins 936-741, 287-953, and 961c, but 
differed in the amount of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) component, containing either a ‘full’ dose of 
25 µg, or a ‘quarter dose’ of 6.25 µg.  
The commercially available formulations of Bexsero and Menveo were used. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Meningococcal meningitis and sepsis are diseases that can result in death within hours, despite the 
availability of effective antibiotics. The diseases are caused by Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative, 
encapsulated bacterium classified into 5 major pathogenic serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) on the 
basis of the chemical composition of distinctive capsular polysaccharides. The reported annual 
incidence of meningococcal disease is highly variable both geographically and temporally within the 
same regions. In the United States, an estimated 800 to 1,200 cases of meningococcal disease 
occurred annually from 2005 through 2011, representing an incidence of 0.3 cases per 100,000 
population (CDC, 2013). In Europe, more than 9600 cases were reported in 2008 and 2009, 
representing an incidence of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100,000 persons per year during that time; the incidence in 
individual European countries during the same period ranged from 0.3 to 3.5 cases per 100,000 
population (ECDC, 2011). Much higher rates are reported from the “meningitis belt” of Africa where 
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 4/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
incidence rates were >1,000 per 100,000 persons per year during large outbreaks (LaForce et al., 
2009). The case-fatality rate ranges from 5% to 15%, and up to 25% of survivors are left with 
neurological sequelae, limb loss, or hearing loss. The disease is most common in children and young 
adults.  
Based upon the successful development of conjugate vaccines designed to prevent disease caused by 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C, 
Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics has developed a conjugate MenACWY vaccine (Menveo®). This 
vaccine contains capsular oligosaccharides from N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y 
conjugated to a protein carrier, CRM197 (a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin). MenACWY vaccine has 
been shown to be generally well tolerated and immunogenic in several age groups (Black et al., 2010; 
Jackson et al., 2009), and received marketing authorization in both the US and the European Union in 
early 2010.  
In contrast, prevention of serogroup B disease by the use of vaccines containing serogroup B capsular 
polysaccharide has been problematic because the B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic and could 
theoretically elicit autoantibodies because it is identical to a carbohydrate moiety that is widely 
distributed in the human body. As a result, research has focused on outer membrane proteins of 
meningococci as potential vaccine candidates. Serogroup B vaccines based on outer membrane 
vesicles containing proteins, referred to as OMV, have been developed from epidemic serogroup B 
strains and used to control outbreaks in several countries, i.e., Norway , Brazil, Cuba, New Zealand 
(Holst et al., 2009; Noronha et al., 1995). Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics has developed a multi-
component recombinant protein meningococcal serogroup B vaccine containing OMV (referred to as 
rMenB+OMV) with broad coverage. This vaccine (Bexsero®) received marketing authorization from the 
European Union in January 2013, from Australia in August 2013, and from Canada in December 2013.

Methods 
Study V102_03 
Objectives 
Immunogenicity 
Primary 
• 
To demonstrate immunologic noninferiority of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY 
vaccine1 to a single dose of MenACWY vaccine2, as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
hSBA seroresponse against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 30 days after the 
second vaccination, in healthy adolescents and young adults aged 10 through 25 years. 
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 5/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
• 
To identify the optimal formulation of MenABCWY vaccine compared with a single dose of Menveo 
(MenACWY) and with 2 doses of rMenB+OMV in healthy adolescents and young adults aged 10 
through 25 years, based on the overall desirability index.  
The overall desirability index is based on immunogenicity parameters (GMT ratios against N. 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y and serogroup B test strains at 30 days after the 
second vaccination) and reactogenicity parameters (percentages of doses associated with severe 
local and severe systemic solicited AEs following any vaccination). 
Secondary 
• 
• 
• 
To estimate the immunogenicity of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine as 
measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5 and hSBA ≥ 1:8 against strains of N. 
meningitidis serogroup B, at 30 days after the second vaccination.  
To compare the immunogenicity of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine with 
that of a single dose of Menveo (MenACWY), as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA 
≥ 1:8 and hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 30 days after the 
second vaccination.  
To compare the immunogenicity of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine with 2 
doses of rMenB+OMV as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5, hSBA ≥ 1:8, 
4-fold rise, and hSBA GMTs against strains of N. meningitidis serogroup B, at 30 days after the 
second vaccination.  
CHMP comment: 
The focus will be on Bexsero in the present procedure. Therefore, results for all the objectives 
described above will not be evaluated in this report.  
Safety  
To evaluate the safety of 2 doses of each of the 2 formulations of MenABCWY vaccine.  
Study design 
This was a phase 2, observer-blinded, controlled, randomized, multicenter study in healthy adolescents 
and young adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 different MenABCWY vaccine 
formulations. Subjects aged 10 through 25 years were to be enrolled in this study.  
A total of approximately 480 healthy subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 4 
groups described below to receive the vaccinations:  
•  Study group ABCWY+OMV received the MenABCWY+OMV vaccine formulation (containing a ‘full 
dose’ of outer membrane vesicles [OMV]) on a 0,2-month schedule.  
•  Study group ABCWY+qOMV received the MenABCWY+qOMV vaccine formulation (containing a 
‘quarter dose’ of OMV) on a 0,2-month schedule.  
•  Study group rMenB+OMV received the rMenB+OMV vaccine (containing a ‘full dose’ of OMV) on a 
0,2-month schedule.  
•  Study group Placebo/MenACWY received a single dose of placebo and a single dose of MenACWY 
vaccine, respectively, on a 0,2-month schedule.  
Subjects were to have 2 blood draws (20 mL [±5 mL] each) during the study period; before the first 
vaccination, on day 1, and 30 days following the second vaccination, on day 91 (-4/+14 days).

Endpoints 
Immunogenicity 
• 
• 
• 
Percentage of subjects with seroresponse to N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y;  
Percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y;  
Percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5, hSBA ≥ 1:8, and 4-fold increase for N. meningitidis 
serogroup B test strains;  
•  GMTs for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y and serogroup B test strains.  
The following serogroup B test strains were used in this study; each strain was selected to test the 
antibody response to a single antigen(antigen specificity is shown in parentheses): M14459 (fHbp), 
M07-0241084 (NHBA), M01-0240364 (NadA), and NZ98/254 (PorA).  
Safety and reactogenicity endpoints  
• 
• 
• 
Local solicited reactions (i.e., pain, erythema, and induration), systemic solicited reactions (i.e., 
chills, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, loss of appetite, headache, rash, and fever [defined as 
body temperature ≥38°C]), unsolicited AEs, and SAEs were to be collected daily for 7 days after 
each vaccination;  
From day 8 through day 91 all unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications were to be 
collected.  
From day 92 (31 days following vaccination 2) through day 241 (180 days following vaccination 2) 
only medically attended AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from the study were to be 
collected.  
Composite endpoints (immunogenicity and reactogenicity)  
• 
The overall desirability index is defined as the weighted geometric mean of individual desirability 
indexes based on the following immunogenicity and reactogenicity parameters:  
•  Between-group ratios of hSBA GMTs, adjusted for prevaccination titer and center, against N. 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y at 30 days after the second vaccination: ABCWY+OMV 
group vs. Placebo/ACWY group and ABCWY+qOMV group vs. Placebo/ACWY group;  
•  Between-group ratios of hSBA GMTs, adjusted for prevaccination titer and center, against N. 
meningitidis serogroup B test strains at 30 days after the second vaccination: ABCWY+OMV group 
vs. rMenB+OMV group and ABCWY+qOMV group vs. rMenB+OMV group;  
• 
• 
Percentage of doses associated with severe local solicited AEs within 3 days following the 
vaccination for the ABCWY+OMV and ABCWY+qOMV groups;  
Percentage of doses associated with severe systemic solicited AEs within 3 days following the 
vaccination for the ABCWY+OMV and ABCWY+qOMV groups. 
Statistical methods 
Noninferiority of immune response against N.meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y  
The null hypothesis associated with the first primary immunogenicity objective was based on 
noninferiority of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine to a single dose of 
MenACWY, as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse against N. meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 30 days after the second vaccination. Two doses of MenABCWY 
vaccine were considered noninferior to a single dose of MenACWY if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) around the difference between study groups (ABCWY – Placebo/ACWY), in 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse, was > –10% for each of the A, C, W-135, and Y serogroups.  
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 7/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Identification of the optimal formulation of MenABCWY vaccine  
No hypothesis testing was associated with this second primary objective. The assessment was based 
on the ranks obtained after computation of the overall desirability index (Derringer & Suich, 1980) for 
each formulation, according to predefined weighting models for combining each of the 10 parameters 
chosen for this purpose. These parameters were, for immunogenicity, GMT ratios against N. 
meningitidis serogroup A, C, W-135, and Y (ABCWY+OMV group or ABCWY+qOMV group vs. 
Placebo/ACWY group) and against the 4 serogroup B test strains (ABCWY+OMV group or 
ABCWY+qOMV group vs. rMenB+OMV group) at 30 days after the second vaccination, and for 
reactogenicity, percentage of doses associated with severe local and with severe systemic solicited AEs 
following any vaccination. The desirability function was defined on a scale between 0 and 1 (0 for 
undesirable response and 1 for highly desirable response). Desirability functions for the A, C, W-135, 
and Y serogroups, for serogroup B test strains, and for local and systemic reactogenicity are presented 
in Figure 2-1. 
Results  
Immunogenicity 
Of 484 enrolled subjects, 480 subjects (99%) received at least 1 study vaccination. The demographic 
variables and baseline characteristics were well balanced across study groups. The mean age of the 
subjects was 15.0 (±4.9) years and the majority (61%) were Caucasian.  
Results involving Bexsero will be presented below: 
The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to assess and compare the immunogenicity of 2 doses 
of 2 different MenABCWY vaccine formulations with a single dose of MenACWY, and with 2 doses of 
rMenB+OMV, using various endpoints, at 30 days after the second vaccination:  
•  As measured by percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroup B test 
strains, both the MenABCWY+OMV and MenABCWY+qOMV formulations induced a robust immune 
response against each of the 4 strains. No notable differences between the formulations were 
observed. The rMenB+OMV vaccine induced a higher immune response than did either MenABCWY 
formulation.  
•  As measured by percentages of subjects with 4-fold increase in hSBA titer against serogroup B test 
strains at 30 days after the second vaccination, the MenABCWY+OMV and MenABCWY+qOMV 
formulations induced comparable responses against all 4 strains. The percentages of subjects with 
such an increase were higher in the rMenB+OMV group than in either ABCWY group for each of the 
test strains.  
•  As measured by hSBA GMTs against serogroup B test strains, there was no meaningful difference 
between the ABCWY+OMV and ABCWY+qOMV groups, however, a trend toward higher 
postvaccination GMTs with the MenABCWY +OMV formulation was observed for 3 of the 4 test 
strains (NHBA, NadA, and PorA). The rMenB+OMV vaccine induced a higher immune response than 
did either MenABCWY formulation for all 4 serogroup B test strains (except for the fHbp strain in 
the ABCWY+qOMV group). 
Exploratory immunogenicity analysis against 2 additional serogroup B test strains (strain 44/76-SL and 
strain 5/99) which express antigens identical in amino acid sequence to vaccine antigens fHbp and 
NadA, respectively, and are high expressers of these antigens, was also performed to further 
characterize the immune response at 30 days after the second vaccination:  
•  Both MenABCWY formulations induced a robust immune response against both of these test 
strains, as measured by percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and percentage of subjects with 
hSBA ≥1:8. Results were comparable across both ABCWY groups and the rMenB+OMV group: 98% 
to 100% of subjects in all 3 groups had hSBA ≥1:5 and hSBA ≥1:8 against both test strains.  
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 8/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  GMTs and GMRs (postvaccination/baseline) also indicated that both MenABCWY formulations 
induced a robust immune response against both of the 44/76-SL and 5/99 test strains. No notable 
difference overall was seen between the MenABCWY formulations. GMTs against both serogroup B 
test strains were higher in the rMenB+OMV group. 
CHMP comment: 
Both of the tested MenABCWY formulations induced robust immune responses to the serogroup B test 
strains. However, the responses following vaccination with Bexsero were higher, which is also reflected 
in the desirability index shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. Desirability index 
Safety 
Among 484 subjects in the enrolled population, 480 (99%) subjects were exposed to a study vaccine. 
Across all study groups, 99% of enrolled subjects provided unsolicited AE data, and 90% and 87% of 
enrolled subjects provided solicited AE data after the first and second vaccinations, respectively.

CHMP comment: 
The frequencies of local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs) after the first study vaccination 
were higher in the rMenB-containing vaccine groups than in the Placebo/ACWY group. It is previously 
known that Bexsero has a higher reactogenicity than certain other vaccines, and therefore the results 
are in line with what is already known regarding Bexsero. 
Frequencies of solicited AEs were generally lower after the second vaccination than after the first 
vaccination in the ABCWY+OMV, ABCWY+qOMV, and rMenB+OMV groups. The most common local 
solicited AE was injection site pain, reported after the first vaccination by 84% to 90% of subjects in 
the ABCWY+OMV, ABCWY+qOMV, and rMenB+OMV groups and 27% of subjects in the Placebo/ACWY 
group, and after the second vaccination by 73% to 83% and 42%, respectively. 
The most commonly reported systemic solicited AEs after the first vaccination were myalgia (49% to 
52% of subjects in rMenB-containing vaccine groups vs. 26% of subjects in the Placebo/ACWY group). 
Also, the most commonly reported severe systemic solicited AEs in rMenB-containing groups were 
myalgia (3% to 13% of subjects after any vaccination). The majority of these reactions were of short 
duration. Myalgia is a previously known AE after vaccination with Bexsero and is already included in 
the SPC section 4.8.

CHMP comment: 
The percentages of subjects with possibly related unsolicited AEs reported during the entire study 
period (days 1 through 241) were 11% and 8% in the ABCWY+OMV and ABCWY+qOMV groups, 
respectively, 13% in the rMenB+OMV group, and 6% in the Placebo/ACWY group. Injection site 
induration, injection site pain, and headache were the only AEs reported by more than 2% of subjects 
in any study group for whom the investigator considered the AE possibly or probably related.  
Two subjects, both in the Bexsero group, reported an AE that led to premature withdrawal. One 
subject (11/040) reported lymphadenopathy, considered possibly related, on day 6 after the first 
vaccination. The other subject (24/066) reported convulsion, considered not related, on day 60 after 
the first vaccination. The subject who reported lymphadenopathy had a slightly raised temperature abd 
a generalized lymphaenopathy according to the listing of comments. It is not possible to conclude 
whether these symptoms actually were due to vaccination or something else, including infection.  
A total of 10 SAEs were reported by 9 subjects (1% to 3% of subjects in each study group). None of 
the SAEs was considered related to study vaccine.  
No new safety concerns regarding Bexsero were identified based on the study results presented from 
this study.

Erratum to the V102_03 SCR  
The rationale for this erratum to the full clinical study report (CSR) dated 17 DEC 13 (presented above) 
was the identification of minor transcription errors in the study disposition flowchart (Figure 10.1-1 on 
page 96 of the original e-published CSR), and errors in the titles of four appendices in section 16.0 
(Correct titles are given in V102_03_10DEC14_app(erratum). In addition, one misattribution of gender 
and two wrongly recorded dates of birth have been identified in the study database. These errors are 
described below.  
CHMP comment: 
It is agreed that the errors appear to have no impact on any of the analyses and interpretations of the 
study results. Therefore, the erratum is considered acceptable.

Study design 
This is a phase 2, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter extension study in 
healthy adolescents and young adults that participated in the parent study, V102_03.  
The subjects were randomized to one of the study groups after obtaining informed consent from 
subjects or their legal guardian.  
In the parent study V102_03, subjects were randomized in 4 vaccine groups. In the present extension 
study these groups were further randomized to receive either one of the MenABCWY vaccine 
formulations or a placebo approximately 24 months after the last vaccination was completed in the 
V102_03 study. Following is the description of the vaccine groups in the parent study and the vaccines 
administered in the present study. 
ABCWY+OMV: This group received 2 doses of MenABCWY + full dose of outer membrane vesicle 
(OMV) (25 μg) at 0, 2 month schedule in parent study V102_03. In V102_03E1, this group was further 
randomized to 2 groups in 1:1 ratio; one group received a third dose of MenABCWY + full OMV and the 
other group received a placebo. These groups are designated as 2OMV_OMV and 2OMV_Pbo 
respectively in this report.  
ABCWY+qOMV: This group received 2 doses of MenABCWY+ ¼ dose of OMV (6.25 μg) at 0, 2 month 
schedule in parent study V102_03. In the present extension study V102_03E1, this group was further 
randomized to 2 groups in 1:1 ratio; one group received a third dose of MenABCWY+ ¼ of OMV and 
the other group received placebo. These groups were designated as 2qOMV_qOMV and 2qOMV_Pbo 
respectively in this report.  
rMenB+OMV: This group received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV at 0, 2 month schedule in parent study 
V102_03. In this extension study V102_03E1, this group was further randomized to 2 groups4 in 1:1 
ratio; one group received the first dose of MenABCWY + full dose of OMV, and the second group 
received MenABCWY+ ¼ dose of OMV. These groups were designated as 2B_OMV and 2B_qOMV 
respectively in this report.  
Placebo/ACWY: This group received placebo as vaccination-1 and MenACWY as vaccination-2 at 0, 2-
month schedule in V102_03. In this extension study this group was further randomized to 3 groups in 
1:1:1 ratio; one group received MenABCWY + full dose of OMV, the second group received 
MenABCWY+ ¼ dose of OMV and the third group received placebo. These groups were designated as 
1M_OMV, 1M_qOMV and 1M_Pbo respectively. 
CHMP comment: 
It is noted that no subjects received Bexsero during this study. 
Results  
Approximately 416 subjects that received all required vaccinations and completed the study 
termination visit in the primary study, V102_03, were to be asked to participate in this extension 
study. In total 480 subjects were enrolled in V102_03 study, out of which 416 subjects, who were 
eligible for the extension study were planned to be enrolled into V102_03E1 study. A total of 190 
subjects who met all the inclusion criteria were enrolled into V102_03E1.  
CHMP comment: 
The low number of subjects in each group is noted. 
Immunogenicity 
As a part of primary objective, the immunogenicity against N meningitidis was assessed in terms of 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse against serogroups A, C, W and Y and HT-hSBA ≥1:5 against 
serogroup B strains. Overall the immune response against serogroups A, C, W, Y and against 
serogroup B strains was good at day 30 after MenABCWY booster vaccination in subjects who 
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 13/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
previously received the same vaccine formulation in study V102_03 across the vaccine groups (Table 
2-5).  
A booster dose of MenABCWY in subjects who had previously received MenABCWY or MenACWY or 
rMenB +OMV resulted in high antibody titers at day 30 against serogroups A, C, W, Y and the 
serogroup B test strains. Differences in titers observed against serogroup A, C, W, and Y strains 
between the subjects previously vaccinated with MenACWY or MenABCWY are attributable to the 
number of doses of vaccine in the primary series: for MenABCWY the subjects in the parent trial 
received 2 doses whereas MenACWY is a single dose primary series.  
Further evaluation of immune response on day 30 in terms of HT-hSBA seroresponse, GMTs and 4-fold 
increase in HT-hSBA response showed an overall better immune response against most of the 
serogroup B strains when subjects received rMenB+OMV boosted with full dose of OMV of MenABCWY 
(2B_OMV).  
CHMP comment: 
The best immune response to serogroup B strains on day 30 was seen in subjects who received 
Bexsero during the primary study and then the MenABCWY formulation containing full dose of OMV in 
the extension study. 
At 24 months after primary vaccination, there was a substantial decrease in HT-hSBA response against 
serogroups A, C, W, Y and serogroup B strains across all the vaccine groups. In comparison to 
rMenB+OMV group and the MenACWY group, the persistence of immune response at 24 months after 
primary vaccination was better in MenABCWY group who received full dose of OMV (MenABCWY+OMV) 
against serogroups C, W, Y. Similarly, for serogroup B strains and serogroup A, the persistence of 
immune response at 24 months after primary vaccination was observed better in subjects who 
received rMenB+OMV. 
CHMP comment: 
It is noted that the persistence of the immune response at 24 months post primary vaccination was 
better in subjects receiving Bexsero compared to the combination formulations. At 36 months post 
primary vaccination, the immune response against serogroup B strains were on the same level as 
baseline in the groups receiving Bexsero in the primary study and thereafter placebo in the extension 
study. The timely decrease in antibody titers has been previously observed after Bexsero vaccination 
and might indicate a potential need of a booster dose.  
Safety 
In total 5 subjects with SAEs and 9 subjects with NOCDs were reported from day 1 through study 
termination of V102_03E1. According to the investigator, none of the SAEs and NOCDs had any causal 
relationship with the study vaccination. Between V102_03 and V102_03E1 studies, asthma (4 
subjects) was the most frequently reported NOCD followed by rhinitis allergic (2 subjects) and obesity 
(2 subjects).  
CHMP comment: 
As Bexsero was not administered during this extension study, it is not possible to draw any conclusions 
on safety for this vaccine based on these study results. However, no new chronic diseases were 
considered related to the study vaccination in either the primary or extension studies.  
Discussion on immunogenicity and safety  
This report contains the clinical study reports of studies V102_03 and V102_03E1. These studies were 
conducted as part of the development program of the investigational meningococcal combination 
vaccine MenABCWY, intended to protect against the five most common Neisseria meningitides 
EMA/682762/2016  
Page 14/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y) responsible for invasive meningococcal disease worldwide. Bexsero was 
used in study V102_03 as a comparator vaccine, while in study V102_03E1 was evaluated the antibody 
persistence at 24 months after vaccination performed in study V102_03.  
In study V102_03, the secondary immunogenicity objectives compared the immunogenicity of each 
MenABCWY formulation with that of MenACWY and Bexsero. Immune response in terms of percentages 
of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5, hSBA ≥1:8, or 4-fold increase in hSBA titer to serogroup B test strains for 
fHbp, NHBA, NadA, and PorA indicated no notable difference between study formulations 
MenABCWY+OMV and MenABCWY+qOMV. Responses following vaccination with Bexsero were higher 
against these test strains than were responses following vaccination with either MenABCWY 
formulation. Comparison of hSBA GMTs also indicated that the Bexsero vaccine induced a higher 
immune response than the MenABCWY formulations against all 4 serogroup B test strains. The 
differences were statistically significant, with the exception of the fHbp strain in the ABCWY+qOMV 
group. 
Reactogenicity profiles of the MenABCWY formulations were comparable to each other and to that of 
Bexsero. No new safety concerns regarding Bexsero were identified from this study. 
In study V102_03E1, a booster dose of MenABCWY in subjects who had previously received 
MenABCWY, MenACWY or Bexsero resulted in high antibody titers at day 30 against serogroups A, C, 
W, Y and the serogroup B test strains. The immune response on day 30 in terms of HT-hSBA 
seroresponse, GMTs and 4-fold increase in HT-hSBA response showed an overall better immune 
response against most of the serogroup B strains when subjects received Bexsero boosted with full 
dose of OMV of MenABCWY compared with other combinations. Similarly, for serogroup B strains and 
serogroup A, the persistence of immune response at 24 months after primary vaccination was 
observed better in subjects who received Bexsero.  
In total 5 subjects with SAEs and 9 subjects with NOCDs were reported from day 1 through study 
termination of V102_03E1, none of which considered related to study vaccination. Between V102_03 
and V102_03E1 studies, asthma (4 subjects) was the most frequently reported NOCD followed by 
rhinitis allergic (2 subjects) and obesity (2 subjects).  
The MAH also submitted the V102_03 Erratum to the CSR. This Erratum was submitted to correct 
some minor transcription errors affecting the original CSR, which were considered not to impact any of 
the analyses and interpretations of the study results presented in the original CSR.

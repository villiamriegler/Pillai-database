1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 3 May 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Bemrist Breezhaler, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 since both actives substances have been 
authorised for the first time after the implementation of the regulation. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 April 2018.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Bemrist Breezhaler is indicated as a once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 
12 years of age and older where use of a combination of long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid 
is appropriate: 
−  patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting 
beta2-agonists, or 
−  patients not adequately controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids. 
(For effects on asthma symptom control and reduction of asthma exacerbations, see section 5.1.). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications for fixed combination products 
The application submitted is a fixed combination medicinal product and is composed of administrative 
information, complete quality data, and with appropriate own applicant’s non-clinical and clinical data. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0292/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0292/2018 is not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.

New active Substance status 
The applicant indicated the active substance indacaterol/mometasone furoate contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a known active substance. 
Scientific advice  
The applicant received Scientific Advice on 24 April 2008 (EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/2008/III), 18 November 2010 
(EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/FU/1/2010/III), 23 June 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/FU/2/2011/II, 
EMEA/H/SA/1007/2/2011/PED/III), 21 June 2012 (EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/FU/3/2012/II), 17 July 2012 
(EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/FU/3/2012/II, EMEA/H/SA/1007/3/FU/1/2012/I), 23 October 2014 
(EMEA/H/SA/1007/1/FU/4/2014/II) for the development programme supporting the indication granted by 
CHMP. The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier: 
Quality: 
•  Proposed procedure to adjust the dose of the indacaterol component in the event that routine CMC 
investigations suggest the acetate salt influences the in-vitro dose delivery performance of Concept1 
device. 
Non-clinical:  
•  Completeness of the non-clinical program to support administration with the QMF Twisthaler and the 
Concept1 device (Breezhaler) in clinical trials and for marketing authorisation application (MAA). 
Bridging studies to support a new indacaterol salt in the combination product. 
•  The need for non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies to support a MAA in the pediatric population. 
Clinical: 
•  Design of a steady-state component interaction study using Concept1 device. Proposed PK exposure 
strategy to bridge the data available on special population PK and DDI safety data from Asmanex 
Twisthaler (mometasone furoate (MF)) and QAB149 (indacaterol) to the QMF149 program. The need 
for a dedicated QTc trial to support the registration of QMF149 via Concept1. 
•  Appropriateness of the therapeutic equivalence study (bridging approach) of MF Twisthaler to MF 
Concept1 to confirm the comparison of MF Twisthaler - MF Concept1 from the pharmacokinetic study 
CQMF149E2101, and to ensure comparable pharmacodynamic effect. 
•  Dose selection strategy for the component monotherapies for the QMF149 combination product in 
Concept1 for asthma. 
•  Design of QMF149 Phase III asthma program consisting of three pivotal studies to support a MAA, 
including elements such as doses of QMF149, patient population, sample size, duration, treatment 
arms, primary endpoint (trough FEV1), secondary endpoints (including health related quality of life, 
asthma control, asthma worsening and nocturnal symptoms), statistical analyses, active comparators 
and safety database. In a follow-up advice a revised Asthma program was proposed comprised of three 
studies; of one 12-week, one 26 week and one 52-week in Adolescents/Adults evaluating low, mid and 
high MF doses in QMF149 vs. MF monotherapy. 
•  The appropriateness of the clinical studies to support registration of a QMF149 combination product

containing an alternative indacaterol salt. 
•  Appropriateness of the therapeutic equivalence study (bridging approach) of MF Twisthaler to MF 
• 
Concept1 to confirm the comparison of MF Twisthaler - MF Concept1 from the pharmacokinetic study 
CQMF149E2101, and to ensure comparable pharmacodynamic effect. 
Issues concerning paediatric development including the lower age limit for children using QMF149; the 
paediatric usability of the device QMF149 Concept1 dry powder inhaler; the Phase II paediatric dose 
selection; the design of the Paediatric Phase III Asthma study. 
•  The adequacy of safety data planned to be collected in the QMF149 asthma development program.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older where use of a combination of long-
acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid is appropriate: - patients not adequately controlled with 
inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists, or - patients not adequately 
controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled corticosteroids. This includes patients with 
mild to moderate asthma not adequately controlled by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) treatment step 
2 or 3.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and hyper-
responsiveness.  
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide. The Global Asthma Report 
estimates that 23.7 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of 
the total global burden. The prevalence in Europe is up to 10%.  
It is estimated in Europe that 17% of patients have difficult to treat asthma and 3-4% have severe asthma 
(GINA). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathophysiology of Asthma is characterised by inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the airways 
and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Inflammation in asthma generally involves the same cells involved in 
the allergic response in the nasal passages and skin, (atopy) and includes mast cells, eosinophils and Th2 
lymphocytes.   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath and cough that vary in frequency and 
intensity and symptoms are associated with variability in airflow. Symptoms occur particularly at night or in 
the early morning. Patients with asthma can experience exacerbations that may be life threatening. 
Factors  that  may  trigger  or  worsen  symptoms  include;  allergens  (e.g.  dust  mite,  pollen),  viral  infections, 
tobacco smoke, exercise, stress and some drugs including beta-blockers and NSAIDs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 9/182 
  
  
 
Diagnosis is based on two key features: 
• 
• 
A history of variable respiratory symptom 
variable expiratory airflow limitation and reversibility 
Patient  scan  be  classified  as  mild,  moderate  and  severe  based  on  symptom  control  and  treatment 
requirements. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The long-term treatment goals are symptom control and risk reduction. Symptom control aims to have only 
occasional daytime symptoms without sleep disturbance or exercise limitation. Risk reduction involves 
preventing exacerbations, preserving lung function and avoiding asthma deaths.  
Patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  a  maintenance  low  dose  ICS  and  ‘as  needed’  short-acting  beta2-
agonists  or  LABA  (GINA  step  2  and  3)  have  the  following  treatment  options  in  addition  to  optimising 
treatment compliance and modifying risk factors; 
•  Combination low dose LABA/ICS with as needed short acting beta2-agonists  
•  Combination low dose formoterol/ICS maintenance and reliever. 
Unmet  need:  Most  available  FDC  LABA/ICS  products  are  approved  with  BD  dosing.  It  is  recognised  that 
inadequate  asthma  control  can  be  due  to  non-adherence  and  that  OD  versus  BD  posology  can  potentially 
improve compliance (GINA). 
About the product 
Bemrist Breezhaler (QMF149) is an orally inhaled o.d. FDC of indacaterol acetate (QAB149), a LABA and 
mometasone furoate (MF), an ICS; indacaterol is a long acting beta agonist. It is a partial agonist at the 
human beta2-adrenoceptor. Indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. It has a rapid onset of 
action and a long duration of action. Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for 
glucocorticoid receptors and anti-inflammatory properties.  
In this application, the application is seeking a maintenance treatment for asthma in adult and adolescent 
patients for administration once daily. 
Three strengths are proposed: 
Each low-strength capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as acetate) and 80 µg of mometasone furoate; this 
provides a delivered dose of indacaterol (as acetate) 125 µg and mometasone furoate 62.5 µg. 
Each medium-strength capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as acetate) and 160 µg of mometasone 
furoate; this provides a delivered dose of indacaterol (as acetate) 125 µg and mometasone furoate 127.5 µg. 
Each high-strength capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as acetate) and 320 µg of mometasone furoate; 
this provides a delivered dose of indacaterol (as acetate) 125 µg and mometasone furoate 260 µg. 
Claimed indication and recommendation for use 
‘indicated as a once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and 
older where use of a combination of long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid is appropriate: 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting beta2-
agonists, or patients not adequately controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled

corticosteroids. (For effects on asthma symptom control and reduction of asthma exacerbations, see section 
5.1.)’  
The maximum recommended dose is Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily. No dose adjustment is 
proposed for renal or hepatic impairment or for patients over 65. 
The same posology is proposed for adults and adolescents 12 years and older. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development program for QMF149 consists of efficacy and safety data primarily from multi-
center, Phase III studies in asthma (GINA Step ≥2). The Phase III controlled studies, [CQVM149B2301, 
CQVM149B2303, and CQVM149B2302] provided the key efficacy and safety data for the proposed indication 
(not adequately controlled asthma).  
For Study CQVM149B2301 and Study CQVM149B2302 presented, two separate clinical study reports (CSRs) 
were planned: a primary analysis CSR I and the final CSR II. 
•  CSR I includes all patients who completed Week 26 (V207) assessments or withdrew from the study. 
It includes primary and key secondary endpoints as well as other pre-specified endpoints at Week 26. 
The endpoints evaluated after Week 26 were treated as exploratory. 
•  CSR II includes all patients who completed Week 52 treatment period, plus 30-day follow-up or 
prematurely discontinued from the study. 
The QMF149 clinical development program was designed in accordance with recommendations from global 
Health Authorities and available regulatory guidance (EMA 2002, EMA 2008, EMA 2015) including:

styrene. Needles and springs are made from stainless steel. 
Active substances 
The product contains two established active substances: indacaterol, as acetate, and mometasone furoate.  
2.2.2.  Active substance – Indacaterol acetate 
General information 
The chemical name of indacaterol acetate is 5,6-Diethyl-N-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-
dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-aminium acetate corresponding to the molecular formula 
(C24H29N2O3)(C2H3O2). It has a relative molecular mass of 452.55 g/mol and the following structure:

Figure 1: Indacaterol acetate structure 
The chemical structure of indacaterol acetate was elucidated by elemental analysis, UV and IR spectroscopy, 
proton NMR, carbon NMR and mass spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by x-ray crystallography (XPRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
Indacaterol acetate is a non-solvated, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline micronised white to yellow or beige 
powder.  
Indacaterol acetate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The chirality is 
controlled in the first step of the synthesis with levels of S-isomer controlled as an impurity by normal phase 
HPLC with UV detection in subsequent intermediates and in the final active substance.  
Polymorphism has been observed for indacaterol acetate. Several crystalline forms were identified during 
polymorphism studies performed during development. Only Form A is manufactured using the proposed 
manufacturing process; the presence of other crystalline forms has never been observed during development 
and batch release testing. Stability studies confirmed that Form A is stable during long term and accelerated 
storage conditions in the selected packaging materials. The identity of Form A is controlled as release 
specification via XPRD analysis. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The upstream manufacturing process, including the relevant in process controls (IPCs), is the same as the 
approved commercial manufacturing process of indacaterol maleate used in Ultibro Breezhaler 
(EMEA/H/C/002679) with additional steps added to produce the acetate salt. Indacaterol acetate is 
synthesized in six main steps with isolated intermediates followed by micronisation. The synthesis uses well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Several critical process parameters (CPPs) and related operating ranges have been identified Adequate IPCs 
are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents are satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities from the starting material, intermediates and active substance were identified 
and assessed for mutagenic potential in line with ICH M7. All mutagenic impurities identified are controlled in 
either the relevant intermediate or in the active substance specifications. The purge and fate of residual 
solvents has been discussed and several residual solvents are controlled in the active substance 
specifications, including benzene which may be introduced as a solvent impurity.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Three manufacturing processes were applied during development which differed in the 
selection of starting materials (initially indacaterol maleate was used) and implementation of variations in the 
final micronisation and deamorphisation steps. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail 
and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Specification 
The specification of indacaterol acetate includes tests for appearance, clarity and colour of the solution (Ph. 
Eur.), particle size (laser light diffraction), identity (IR and XRPD), enantiomer (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay of salt forming agent (titration), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (Headspace GC), water 
content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), amorphous content (microcalorimetry) and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification is in line with ICH Q6A. Impurities present at higher than the qualification 
threshold, according to ICH Q3A, were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate 
specifications have been set. Specifications limits have been set based on regulatory requirements and batch 
analysis data. The specification for particle size and amorphous content is based on the finished product 
requirements and is considered adequate for an inhalation product. The residual solvents specification has 
been set in line with ICH Q3C in light of the experience gained during development and the manufacture of 
commercial scale batches of indacaterol acetate.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (18 batches, including clinical, stability and commercial manufactured at a scale up to 
commercial scale) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pivotal batches of indacaterol acetate from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate 
(30 ºC / 65% RH) conditions and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release, with the exception of assay of salt forming agent and 
residual solvents which were not tested; this is acceptable as these parameters are not stability indicating.  
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
All tested parameters were within the specifications at long term storage conditions, with no significant 
increase in impurities or decrease in assay observed. Under accelerated conditions, discolouration has been 
observed for the tests ‘appearance by visual examination’ and ‘colour of solution’.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The storage conditions 
recommend protection from light.  
Forced degradation studies (high temperature on dry matter, 100 °C, and high temperature in water, acid 
and oxidative conditions in solution for three days and in basic conditions for 4 hours) were performed on one

batch. Results on stress conditions in the solid state (1-month open storage under dry and humid conditions 
at 50 °C and 60 °C), influence of oxygen, nitrogen and water for 1 week at 80°C and forced decomposition (3 
days at 100 °C in the solid state)  were also provided on one batch. A racemisation and an hygroscopicity 
study were also performed on one batch.  
The degradation pathways of the active substance have been identified and the analytical methods have been 
demonstrated to be stability indicating. In the racemisation study concluded that at 37 °C in an aqueous 
solution, at pH close to neutral, only slight racemisation was observed. However, at 50 °C significant 
racemisation was observed in all solutions with highest levels observed in basic solution. The hygroscopicity 
study concluded that the active substance is only slightly hygroscopic. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months substance when stored as ‘do not store 
above 25 °C, protect from light’ in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Active substance – mometasone furoate 
General information 
The chemical name of mometasone furoate is [(8S,9R,10S,11S,13S,14S,16R,17R)-9-chloro-17-(2-
chloroacetyl)-11-hydroxy-10,13,16-trimethyl-3-oxo-6,7,8,11,12,14,15,16-
octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl] furan-2-carboxylate, corresponding to the molecular formula 
C27H30Cl2O6. It has a relative molecular mass of 521.43 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 2: Mometasone furoate structure 
The chemical structure of mometasone furoate was elucidated using elemental analysis, UV, IR, proton NMR, 
carbon NMR, electron ionisation mass spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The 
solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by optical rotation, circular dichroism, XPRD 
and DSC. 
The active substance is a micronised white powder with low solubility in water.  
Mometasone furoate has eight chiral centres; however, it does not exhibit isomerism since the 
stereochemistry is determined by the starting material, derived from a natural product, and ensured 
throughout the synthesis. The optically pure starting material leads to optically pure mometasone furoate, in 
which the configuration at each of the chiral centres is the same as in the starting material, with the 
exception of that at carbon-9, which has been inverted. Enantiomeric purity is also controlled routinely by 
optical rotation in the active substance specification. Mometasone furoate exhibits pseudopolymorphism in

the form of the monohydrate, which can be formed when the active substance is crystallised from organic-
aqueous solvent systems. Only a single polymorphic form of anhydrous mometasone furoate is produced by 
the commercial synthetic process as verified by infrared and X-ray diffraction analyses. 
Momentasone furoate subject to this application is supported by the same quality information as Amanex 
Twisthaler, marketed in Europe. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Mometasone furoate is synthesised in three main synthetic steps using commercially available well-defined 
starting material with acceptable specifications.  
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented and are satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
The potential impurities from the synthesis are known and these correspond to those listed in the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for mometasone furoate with the exception of two additional impurities, which are adequately 
controlled. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was used throughout the clinical program.  
Specification 
Mometasone furoate specification, includes tests for, appearance, particle size (laser light diffraction), identity 
(IR), residual solvents (headspace GC), loss on drying, specific optical rotation, identity, assay and related 
substances (all by HPLC) and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification is in line with the Ph. Eur. Monograph of mometasone furoate. Additionally, the residual 
solvents are adequately controlled within the relevant ICH recommended limits; the specification for particle 
size is based on the finished product requirements and is considered adequate for an inhalation product. The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (six clinical batches and four commercial batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from six commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No changes in assay and related compounds were 
observed under the long term and accelerated storage conditions.

Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The active substance 
shows a decrease in assay after exposure to visible and UV light according to ICH conditions.  
Stress degradation studies are described under the characterisation of impurities and include stress studies in 
solution (65 ºC and acid/base/oxidative/nitrogen purge conditions, basic solution at room temperature, and 
photolytic conditions under fluorescent light) solid stress studies (thermal stress at 170ºC/3 hours and 
accelerated stability conditions - 30ºC/70% RH; 40ºC/75% RH). The degradation impurities observed under 
various stressed conditions have been identified and include impurities listed in the Ph. Eur. Monograph and 
two additional compounds. The analytical methods have been demonstrated to be stability indicating 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored at 25 °C, with 
excursions from 15-30 °C, in the proposed container. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Bemrist Breezhaler is presented as a single-dose inhalation powder in a hard capsule, intended for 
administration using the co-packed ‘Concept 1’ dry-powder inhaler. Three strengths of the finished product 
are proposed: each capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as the acetate), and either 80 µg, 160 µg or 
320 µg of mometasone furoate. 
The inhalation powders consist of the two active substances, indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate, 
and lactose monohydrate as a carrier. The gelatin capsule shells are printed with printing ink of different 
colours to help differentiating the three strengths. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of 
this report. 
The composition of Bemrist Breezhaler was presented including the qualitative compositions of printing inks. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The capsules are packaged into laminated aluminium blister packs. Bemrist  Breezhaler  is  administered using 
the  ‘Concept1’  dry-powder  inhaler,  a  CE-marked  Class  I  medical  device  that  is  used  for  other  ‘Breezhaler’ 
medicinal products currently authorised in the EU. 
The pharmaceutical development utilised the same formulation technology and delivery platform as used in 
the Novartis authorised products Onbrez Breezhaler, Seebri Breezhaler and Ultibro Breezhaler.  
No incompatibilities have been found between the active substances (indacaterol acetate and mometasone 
furoate) and the excipients used (lactose monohydrate and hard gelatin capsule) at the selected composition 
during development and registration stability studies. The two actives loosely bind to the lactose carrier. The 
lactose monohydrate used in the formulation meets requirements of Ph. Eur.  
The pharmaceutical development contains QbD elements. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was 
defined as an oral inhalation dosage form which would deliver a range of doses to meet the needs of the 
target patient population. The strength ranges were based on the current marketed products.  
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of design of 
experiments (DoE) and standalone experiments to identify the critical process parameters.

As the optimal aerodynamic particle size range to achieve lung deposition is considered to be 1-5 μm, 
indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate are micronised. The impact of the active substances particle size 
distribution (PSD) on the finished product pharmaceutical performance by means of the fine particle mass 
(FPM) has been investigated by means of DoE using pilot and production scale batches produced using 
manufacturing equipment that have the same operating principle. Based on the study results, the particle 
size specifications for the active substances were set. The impact of the of the lactose PSD on the FPM was 
assessed and adequate specifications set. 
The impact of the amorphous content of indacaterol acetate on FPM was investigated; the outcome of the 
study confirmed no significant impact on FPM of both actives. However, amorphous content specification for 
indacaterol acetate were established to ensure adequate quality of the finished product. No detectable 
amorphous content was found in mometasone furoate, hence no specification limits were set.  
During manufacturing process development, initial experiments were performed at laboratory scale, to 
assess, among others, the manufacturing process steps, however, most of the trials made to assess the 
blending process and its robustness as well as the encapsulation process were performed at production scale 
at the designated commercial production site.  
A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define the 
critical process steps and CPP. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with 
similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation 
development.  
The CPP have been adequately identified and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP and additional non-
critical process parameters have been derived. The robustness of the manufacturing process within the 
recommended parameter ranges was confirmed for the production scale during process verification.  
The finished product is administered using a unit-dose dry-powder inhaler, the ‘Concept1’ inhaler. The 
Concept1 inhaler is a CE-marked Class I medical device and a declaration of conformity has been submitted. 
To investigate the pharmaceutical performance of the finished product with the Concept1 inhaler, 
pharmaceutical development characterization studies were conducted in line with the requirements outlined 
in the ‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005) for pre-metered dry-powder inhalers.  
The pharmaceutical development is considered satisfactory and robustly supported by the experience of the 
applicant.  
The primary packaging is a PA/Alu/PVC – Alu perforated unit dose blister. The packaging was chosen to 
provide protection from moisture and light. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps as summarised: blending, capsule filling and bulk 
capsules equilibration. As the product is a specialised pharmaceutical dose form in which the contents of 
active substances are less than 2 % of the formulation, the process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 18/182 
  
  
The effect of vibration during transport of the product by air and road was assessed; no significant 
differences were observed for either DDU or FPM between transported and control samples. 
No in-process controls are performed during the manufacture of the bulk inhalation powder, but the process 
parameters of the mixing and sieving operations (blending times and speed, sieve size) have been 
appropriately validated. During encapsulation, the capsules are visually inspected for colour and markings, 
length, and the fill weight is controlled. During primary packaging, the seal integrity of the blister packs is 
checked using dye ingress and air-flow leak-rate tests. 
Process verification was performed using three consecutive commercial scale batches for each product 
strength manufactured by the proposed manufacturing site, using the same process and equipment for 
commercial manufacture. All nine batches met the proposed specification. The process validation scheme, to 
conduct a formal process validation for three production-scale batches, has been provided and it is 
considered acceptable.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The combined finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:  
Appearance of contents and capsule shell, FPM of indacaterol and mometasone (NGI-RPHPLC), degradation 
products of indacaterol and mometasone (RPHPLC), indacaterol S-enantiomer (‘enantiomer C’, relative to 
declared content of indacaterol by chiral HPLC-UV), loss on drying (halogen drying), DDU of indacaterol and 
mometasone (NGI and RPHPLC-UV), average delivered dose of indacaterol and mometasone (Ph.Eur.), 
uniformity of dosage units of mometasone and mometasone (RPHPLC-UV), identity and assay of indacaterol 
and mometasone (RPHPLC-UV), microbiology (Ph.Eur.) 
The specification tests and acceptance criteria have been set in line with the requirement described in the 
‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products’ (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005) 
for pre-metered dry-powder inhalers and with the requirements for inhalation powders in “Preparations for 
Inhalation” Ph. Eur. (monograph 0671). Additional tests to ensure the quality of the finished product have 
also been included. The acceptance criteria for FPM has been set in line with clinical batch data. 
The acceptance criteria for any unspecified related substances related to indacaterol at release and 
throughout the shelf life were set. The acceptance criterion for any unspecified related substances related to 
mometasone at both release and throughout the shelf life were set. These limits are below the identification 
threshold of 1.0 % specified in ICH Q3B, ‘Impurities in new drug products’. The acceptance criteria for 
‘Compound E’, a potential mutagen, are below the threshold of toxicological concern (1.5 μg/day) specified in 
the ‘Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities’ (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006). The acceptance criteria 
for the S-enantiomer of indacaterol at release and throughout the shelf life were established, reflecting the 
higher levels of the impurity observed during stability studies. These specified impurity limits comply with 
ICH Q3B, ‘Impurities in new drug products’, which specifies a qualification threshold of 1.0 %. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 8 batches (2 of 
125/62.5 µg, 3 of 125/127.5 µg and 3 of 125/260 µg) using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. 
Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to 
include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is 
satisfactory.

The potential risk for the presence of nitrosamines has been assessed and a risk evaluation has been 
provided and no risk has been identified. 
The specification tests and limits are considered adequate for this type of pharmaceutical product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards used for the controls of the active substances are used for 
the finished product. 
Batch analysis results are provided for five batches of the 125/62.5 µg capsules (including two clinical 
batches), six batches of the 125/127.5 µg capsules (including three clinical batches), and for batches of the 
125/260 µg capsules (including three clinical batches), confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches for each strength of finished product stored for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH)  and for 
up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance  of  the  contents  and  of  shell,  fine  particle  mass,  degradation  products, 
enantiomer, loss on drying, UDD, assay and microbial enumeration tests. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products and to freeze and thaw cycle test (four complete cycles of -20°C/ambient RH 
for 6 days, followed by 1 day at 25°C/60% RH). 
All  results  for  all  batches  of  the  three  strengths  complied  with  the  proposed  shelf-life  specifications  after 
storage  for  18  months  at  25°C/60%  RH  and  30°C/75%  RH.  The  finished  product  is  not  sensitive  to 
refrigeration  or  freezing  but  it  shows  sensitivity  towards  light.  No  microbial  growth  was  observed  at  any  of 
the storage conditions and durations. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months and “Store in the original package in 
order to protect from light and moisture. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature 
storage conditions”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.

2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. Full satisfactory information has been provided in the application for both 
active substances; additionally, the applicant has a long standing established experience for both actives as 
indacaterol acetate is manufactured using indacaterol maleate, the active substance in Onbrez Breezhaler, as 
intermediate and mometasone furoate is the active substance in Asmanex Twisthaler, a product which is 
authorised in EU member states. The finished product is formulated as a powder for inhalation which is pre-
dispensed into hard capsules. It was developed with the same formulation technology as is currently used for 
the authorised product Onbrez Breezhaler and is administered using the same ‘Concept1’ inhalation device. 
The information provided on the formulation, pharmaceutical development, manufacture, control, container 
closure system, and stability is satisfactory and in accordance with European guidelines. The results of tests 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application is for an orally inhaled once daily fixed-dose combination of indacaterol acetate, a long-acting 
beta-2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) and mometasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). The individual 
components of QMF149 indacaterol (as maleate) and mometasone furoate are widely authorised as 
monotherapies or as combination products.  
The pharmacology profile of QMF149 is driven by the pharmacology of its two individual components.  
The mechanism of action of each component is comprehensively described in the literature; it was well 
characterized in the indacaterol maleate and MF development programs and is also summarised below.  
While the clinical additive effects of LABA-ICS combinations are well established, there are no relevant single 
species in vivo mechanistic or disease models available. Therefore, no in vivo combination pharmacology 
studies were conducted with QMF149. Instead, the efficacy of QMF149 was profiled in vitro under non-GLP 
conditions for effects on expression of asthma relevant genes in human airway epithelial cells.  
The available preclinical information does not suggest any potential for mutual interactions that would 
warrant further investigations. Therefore, non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted, with 
the exception of toxicokinetic assessments supplementing the nonclinical safety studies.  
The nonclinical safety evaluation of QMF149 is based upon the complete toxicology programs conducted for 
both individual monotherapy components that included chronic toxicity, reproductive and development 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. A bridging toxicology program performed for QMF149 
included 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 21/182 
  
  
The QMF149 clinical formulation contains indacaterol as acetate, which is different from the salt formulation 
in the currently authorized indacaterol maleate and the QMF149 13-week bridging toxicology program. A 
single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats and a 4-week toxicity study in dogs were conducted by inhalation 
administration to compare the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of indacaterol acetate with indacaterol 
maleate. The acetate data is intended to bridge to the currently available toxicology data with indacaterol 
maleate to support clinical use of this salt form. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Indacaterol 
Indacaterol is a potent and near full agonist of the human β2-adrenoceptor. It is a weak partial agonist at the 
β1-adrenoceptor and a full agonist at the β3-adrenoceptor, with selectivity ratios based on receptor affinities 
comparable to other clinically used β2-agonists. 
Mometasone  
Mometasone is an ICS with high in vitro binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. While the relative 
receptor affinity of MF is greater than fluticasone propionate and slightly less than fluticasone furoate, all 
three ICS show comparable potencies for functional effects such as inhibition of NF-κB.  
Indacaterol/Mometasone 
The cellular activity of QMF149 was assessed using cultured human BEAS2B bronchial epithelial cells to study 
the additive effects of the monotherapy components of QMF149 on expression of asthma relevant genes. The 
expression of anti-inflammatory genes ACKR1 and RGS2 was synergistically upregulated over a period of 18 
hours with a combination of MF and indacaterol, compared to the effect of either single treatment. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Indacaterol 
Indacaterol, in addition to the affinity for β1- and β3-adrenoceptors noted above, shows weak affinity for α1-
adrenoceptors.  
Mometasone 
Mometasone in common with other clinically used ICS, has affinity for other nuclear hormone receptors 
including the progesterone receptor. 
Indacaterol/mometasone 
No additional studies for QMF149 were performed.

Safety pharmacology programme  
Indacaterol/mometasone 
Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted with QMF149 as potential effects on the central nervous 
system, cardiovascular system and respiratory function were fully assessed as part of the indacaterol and MF 
monotherapy development programs.  
Cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the 13-week inhalation 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs with QMF149. No new or additive effects were observed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
Indacaterol/mometasone 
The pharmacodynamic interactions of indacaterol and mometasone were fully evaluated as part of the 
indacaterol maleate and MF monotherapy development programs. No additional studies for 
QMF149 were performed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of indacaterol and MF are well characterized and have been 
extensively studied non-clinically, as well as clinically.  
The nonclinical studies described in the following sections are referenced from previously submitted study 
reports and literature. The data presented below were mostly obtained from studies conducted after separate 
administration of indacaterol or MF.  
No differences in absorption, bioavailability, tissue distribution and metabolism of indacaterol and MF were 
expected between treatments with individual components and with the combination product QMF149. A lack 
of clinical PK interaction was confirmed in a healthy volunteer study. No dedicated non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with QMF149, with the exception of toxicokinetic assessments 
supplementing the nonclinical safety studies and dedicated indacaterol salt bridging studies (see below). 
Absorption and bioavailability  
Indacaterol 
Indacaterol was rapidly absorbed following oral (p.o.) administration with Tmax ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 
hours in the various species.  
Based on radioactivity data, absorption was observed to be low to moderate for oral dosing (~ 20-34% in 
rats, 58% in mice, 72% in dog and 33-46% in human) and significantly increased (~ 78-90% in rats) for 
intratracheal (i.t.) dosing. Oral bioavailability of indacaterol was extremely low in mouse (1%) and rat (0%, 
plasma concentrations were undetectable) and moderate in dog (33%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 23/182 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results indicate a moderate to large first-pass effect (about 54% in dog and 99-100% in rodents). After 
i.t. application to rats, bioavailability was high and similar to the extent of pulmonary absorption indicating no 
or only limited lung first-pass. In rat and dog, the absolute inhaled bioavailability of indacaterol can be 
roughly estimated to be about 12% and 14%, respectively. 
Mometasone furoate 
The mean absolute systemic bioavailability of single inhaled MF 400 μg dose, delivered via the Twisthaler 
device (inhaler device used for administration of marketed inhaled MF monotherapy) compared to i.v. 400 μg 
dose of MF, was determined to be less than 1% using an assay with a LLOQ of 50 pg/mL. Using a 200-fold 
more sensitive assay (LLOQ=0.25 pg/mL) as part of QMF149 development, the absolute inhaled 
bioavailability was estimated as <9.52% based on cross-study comparison of systemic exposure of MF 
Twisthaler 400 μg vs. intravenous exposure data. Systemic exposure to MF in asthma patients was 
comparable following administration of selected doses via the Concept1 device and corresponding doses via 
the Twisthaler device. Therefore, absolute inhaled bioavailability of MF following administration via the 
Concept1 device is also expected to be low (< 10%).   
Relative oral bioavailability of MF in humans (oral vs. inhaled via Concept1) was low and was estimated to be 
in the range of 9.2 – 10%. Thus, it is considered that swallowed drug following inhalation administration was 
minimally absorbed. 
Distribution  
Indacaterol 
The binding of indacaterol to plasma proteins was high in all species, with bound fractions between 91 and 
95% (Study R00-594). The distribution to red blood cells was moderate, as the drug fraction associated with 
red blood cells was 69-74% in the rat, 53-60% in the dog, and 50-58% in human. Volume of distribution 
(Vss) was generally high (13 L/kg in dog, 26 L/kg in rat and 34 L/kg in mouse) and somewhat lower in rabbit 
(5.3 L/kg). Following administration of radiolabelled indacaterol, drug-related radioactivity was widely 
distributed to most rat tissues with the notable exception of the brain, spinal cord, and testis. 
Mometasone furoate 
The volume of distribution after i.v. administration in humans was 332L. Based on in vitro findings, the drug 
is highly bound to human plasma proteins (98 to 99%) in the concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. 
Metabolism 
Indacaterol 
The metabolism of indacaterol in vitro (mouse, rat, dog, human) and in vivo (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, 
human) following i.v., p.o. and i.t. dosing, involved monohydroxylation, O- and Nglucuronidation, and both 
C- and N-dealkylation. No appreciable metabolism was observed in incubations of either human pulmonary 
microsomes or human lung slices. 
Parent and monohydroxylated indacaterol or glucuronides were the most prominent drug related components 
observed in plasma and excreta of mice, rat, rabbit, dog and human after p.o., i.v. and i.t. (rat only) dosing. 
Following i.v. application, metabolites in the feces of intact rats accounted for less than 2%. However, in bile 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 24/182 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
duct-cannulated rats about 68% of an i.v. dose was excreted as glucuronide metabolites via the bile. Based 
on these results, an integrated metabolism picture of indacaterol can be derived: In humans, indacaterol 
becomes systemically available from the lung, likely without pulmonary metabolism. 
Independent of the species, systematically available drug undergoes hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation 
and glucuronidation followed by hepatobiliary transport (likely via multidrug resistance associated protein 2 
(MRP2)) and possibly subsequent hydrolysis by gut bacteria to parent indacaterol. 
Metabolism, at least in rats, is likely the main clearance pathway of indacaterol. 
Mometasone furoate 
After administration of a single 1mg inhaled dose of radio-labeled MF in healthy adult male volunteers, MF 
was extensively metabolized. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver, at least in part by cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4. 
Metabolic pathways include the enzymatic cleavage of the furoate ester (resulting in the formation of 
mometasone) as well as hydroxylation at C-6 and C-21 of mometasone furoate and/or mometasone.  
Mometasone furoate showed little metabolic conversion in vitro in human plasma and S9 fractions of 
homogenized human lung tissue. 
Elimination/Excretion 
Indacaterol 
Similar to human, the fecal route was the predominant route of excretion in all investigated animal species 
(mouse, rat, dog, rabbit) regardless of the route of administration. After an i.v. dose, unchanged indacaterol 
was excreted in both urine and feces (~ 38% in mouse, ~ 40% in dog, ~ 58% in rabbit and ~ 60% in rat). 
In all species, unchanged indacaterol in urine accounted for less than 2% of the dose, further indicating that 
the major route of excretion of indacaterol was via the feces. In rat, about 68% of an i.v. dose recovered 
within 24 hours was excreted via bile in form of glucuronide metabolites.  
T1/2 of indacaterol following i.v. administration was about 6 hours in mouse, about 8 hours in rat, about 11 
hours in rabbit and 20 hours in dog. Following i.t. dosing in rat, T1/2 values of indacaterol were in the same 
range as observed after i.v. administration. In humans, indacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-
phasic manner with an average terminal half-life ranging from 45.5 to 126 hours. The effective half-life, 
calculated from the accumulation of indacaterol after repeated dosing, ranged from 40 to 52 hours (Onbrez 
Breezhaler SmPC). Clearance of indacaterol following an i.v. dose was high in the mouse (9.4 L/h/kg) and rat 
(3.7 L/h/kg) and moderate in the rabbit (1.3 L/h/kg) and dog (1 L/h/kg). 
Mometasone 
In healthy volunteers administered radio-labeled MF by the Twisthaler device, 74% of the dose was 
recovered in the feces, mostly derived from the proportion of the dose that was deposited in the oropharynx 
and swallowed. Mean urinary recovery was 8% of the dose, while 0–14% was exhaled. 
The elimination half-life of MF after intravenous administration in healthy male volunteers was 4.5 hours and 
the clearance was 53.5 L/ h.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020

Indacaterol/mometasone 
As part of QMF149 development, the terminal half-life was similar following inhalation via the Twisthaler or 
the Concept1 devices (mean T1/2: 12-13 h). 
Pregnant animals and lactation 
Indacaterol 
Indacaterol and/or its metabolites passed the placenta-blood-barrier in pregnant rats and were transferred 
rapidly into the milk of lactating rats. 
Mometasone  
Mometasone furoate was excreted in low doses in the milk of suckling rats (Asmanex Twisthaler SmPC). 
Pharmacokinetics drug interaction 
Indacaterol and mometasone furoate acting as inhibitors or inducers 
In vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that indacaterol has little to no potential to inhibit the cytochrome 
(CYP) P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5, and the 
solute-carrier (SLC) uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1 or MATE2K. 
All determined IC50 or Ki values were appreciably higher than the systemic therapeutic Cmax,ss. In addition, 
indacaterol was not identified as an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP. Consequently, indacaterol is 
unlikely to alter the clearance of drugs that are mainly eliminated through metabolism by the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and/or of drugs whose absorption or disposition is affected by clinically relevant 
drug transporters. 
Indacaterol was examined for its potential to induce human liver enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1) and P-gp and MRP2 in primary human 
hepatocytes (Study R0900287). Based on mRNA as well as activity data there was no in vitro indication for 
induction of the own metabolism or the metabolism of co-administered drugs. 
Mometasone furoate was examined as an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2B6, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and P-gp (Walsky 
et al 2005; Walsky et al 2006; De Bruyn et al 2013; Winter et al 2008). The measured IC50s associated with 
the inhibition of these enzymes were between 0.30 and 6.0 μM. Clinically significant drug interactions 
involving MF as an inhibitor are unlikely when comparing these IC50 values with the plasma unbound MF 
concentrations that are achieved in vivo. The absence of in vivo (auto-)induction by indacaterol and/or MF 
was confirmed by the multiple-dose results from toxicokinetics in animals and by clinical pharmacokinetics in 
human. 
Indacaterol and mometasone furoate acting as substrates 
CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 are the main enzymes responsible for indacaterol metabolism in human. Indacaterol 
was also identified as a P-gp substrate. In clinical studies, co-administration of the CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors 
ketoconazole, erythromycin or verapamil caused a 1.4- to 2-fold increase in average indacaterol AUC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 26/182 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing of MF and the high plasma protein 
binding, clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Mometasone furoate is a substrate of CYP3A4. 
There may be a potential for increased exposure to MF when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co- administered. However, the magnitude of increase in MF 
exposure in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors is small and is unlikely to be clinically relevant (Asmanex 
Twisthaler SmPC). 
Indacaterol and mometasone furoate acting on each other 
Based on the available data, the disposition of indacaterol and MF is unlikely to be affected when the two 
components are co-administered since they did not act as inhibitors and/or inducers in a clinically significant 
manner. Absence of interaction was also demonstrated clinically as indacaterol and MF steady-state 
pharmacokinetics were comparable when given alone or in combination. 
Toxicokinetics  
A bridging toxicology program was completed for the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol maleate and 
mometasone furoate.  A single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats and a 4-week toxicity study in dogs were 
also conducted by inhalation administration to compare the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of 
indacaterol acetate with indacaterol maleate. The toxicokinetic data from these studies are summarized 
below. 
Indacaterol acetate 
QMF149 contains indacaterol as acetate, which is different from the salt formulation of currently authorized 
indacaterol (maleate).  
A 4-week toxicity study in dogs by inhalation administration has been completed to compare the toxicity of 
the indacaterol acetate salt with indacaterol maleate in order to bridge to the currently available data with 
indacaterol maleate. There was no relevant difference in terms of dose normalized exposure between the 
acetate and maleate forms of indacaterol at the target dose of 0.300 mg/kg. 
A single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats by inhalation administration has been completed to compare the 
pharmacokinetic profile of an alternative indacaterol acetate salt with indacaterol maleate in order to bridge 
to the currently available data with indacaterol maleate. There was no relevant difference in terms of dose 
normalized exposure between the acetate and maleate forms of indacaterol. No differences in lung tissue 
exposure were apparent between the two indacaterol salts. 
Comparable systemic exposure following inhaled administration of the indacaterol acetate and maleate salts 
was confirmed clinically in a salt bridging study in asthma patients.  
Indacaterol/mometasone 
Toxicokinetics of indacaterol maleate and MF were evaluated in 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs when given alone or combined at different ratios. In both species, indacaterol and MF exposure 
increased with increasing doses, increased over time upon multiple dose administration and was independent 
of gender. The toxicokinetic parameters of indacaterol and MF when given in combination were similar to the 
toxicokinetic parameters of the individual components when dosed alone.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety evaluation of QMF149 is based upon the complete toxicology programs conducted for 
both individual monotherapy components that included chronic toxicity, reproductive and development 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. A bridging toxicology program performed for the 
combination of QMF149 included 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs. A single dose 
pharmacokinetic study in rats and a 4-week toxicity study in dogs were also conducted by inhalation 
administration to compare the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of indacaterol acetate with indacaterol 
maleate. The acetate data is intended to bridge to the currently available toxicology data with indacaterol 
maleate to support clinical use of this salt form. 
The applicant has submitted a brief summary of the toxicological information from individual agents sourced 
from literature and the original submission dossiers. The data are summarised below:  
Indacaterol  
Inhalation toxicity studies in dogs show the typical alterations expected for inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists 
where high systemic exposure has been achieved (e.g. increased heart rate at most doses, heart lesions at 
higher doses and/or glycogen mediated periportal hepatocellular vacuolation). These changes are in-line with 
the known exaggerated pharmacological response to β2-adrenergic agonists due to systemic exposure and 
are not a result of direct toxicity. β2-adrenergic receptor mediated vasodilation and hypotension is associated 
with reflex tachycardia which, when excessive, causes ischemic damage in the heart. Heart rate increase is 
the most sensitive parameter indicating systemic exposure to indacaterol and it occurred in the absence of 
pathological changes in the heart and the physiological response in the liver. Alterations observed in the 
upper respiratory tract of rats were consistent with mild local irritation.  
Embryo-fetal development studies by subcutaneous administration in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of 
teratogenicity. No effects were observed during a fertility and early embryonic development study or a pre- 
and post-natal development study in rats by subcutaneous administration.  
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies did not indicate any genotoxic potential. Indacaterol was not 
carcinogenic at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in a 26-week oral study in CB6F1/TgrasH2 hemizygous mice. 
Neoplastic findings associated with indacaterol treatment during a 104-week inhalation rat carcinogenicity 
study were not considered relevant for humans during therapeutic use. Increased incidences of ovarian 
leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of the ovarian smooth muscle in females are consistent with the known 
response of rodents to treatment with high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists and are considered a 
consequence of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect. 
Mometasone furoate 
Extensive nonclinical toxicology studies have been conducted in support of the various formulations of MF. 
These studies included chronic, reproductive, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies. No toxicological 
effects unique to MF exposure have been demonstrated during the course of preclinical testing. All findings 
were typical of glucocorticoid class effects and followed the well-established dose-response and dose-duration 
relationships for systemic pharmacologic effects of glucocorticoids. Expected exposure-related glucocorticoid 
effects included alterations in hematology parameters, as well as alopecia/hypotrichosis, growth retardation, 
adrenal suppression, decreased tracheal globular leukocytes, and increased adipose tissue in bone marrow. 
There were expected changes in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism, and on skin and wound healing. 
Expected changes in serum liver enzyme levels and urine volumes and osmolalities also occurred. MF also 
caused typical glucocorticoid lympholytic and immunosuppressive effects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 28/182 
  
  
Like other glucocorticoids, MF is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits.  
There was no effect on fertility in nonclinical studies of reproductive function. Preclinical studies demonstrate 
that MF is devoid of androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or anti-estrogenic activity but, like other 
glucocorticoids, exhibits some anti-uterotrophic activity and delays vaginal opening in animal models (rodent) 
at high concentrations. MF demonstrated a clastogenic potential in vitro at high concentrations as is shown 
with other glucocorticoids. MF was non-mutagenic in a number of genetic toxicity studies, including the 
mouse lymphoma assay, the Salmonella/E. coli/mammalian microsome bioassay, the chromosome aberration 
assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mouse micronucleus assay, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis 
assay. The carcinogenicity potential of inhaled MF (aerosol with CFC propellant and surfactant) was 
investigated in 24-month studies in mice and rats. No statistically significant dose-response relationship was 
detected for any of the tumor types. 
Details of the completed toxicology studies for QMF149 are presented below.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose studies were not conducted with QMF149. Single dose and short-term toxicity were fully 
evaluated in the indacaterol and MF individual development programs. Further single dose toxicity studies 
were not required as the findings during these investigations were consistent with those anticipated for an 
inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist or inhaled corticosteroid. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Findings during the QMF149 13-week repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were consistent with 
those reported in previous repeated dose toxicity studies for each individual monotherapy component and 
were typical of the expected pharmacological actions of indacaterol or MF.  
There was no evidence of any additive or synergistic effects following the administration of QMF149. 
Inhalation administration of MF alone or in combination was associated with decreased total leukocyte, 
lymphocyte and reticulocyte counts and increased neutrophil and erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin and 
hematocrit in rats and minimally decreased eosinophil counts in rats and dogs. Increased serum 
transaminase activities decreased alkaline phosphatase activities and decreased phosphorus excretion 
occurred in rats while increased urine volumes were noted in dogs. Increased plasma proteins in rats and 
increased plasma cholesterol in both species indicated changes in protein and lipid metabolism. Adrenal gland 
suppression was apparent as reduced organ weight, cortical atrophy or vacuolization in both species and low 
or absent levels of cortisol in dogs following an exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) challenge. 
Increased fat was seen in the bone marrow and lymphoid depletion occurred in one or more lymphoid tissues 
(spleen, thymus and lymph nodes often with reduced organ weight, gutassociated lymphoid tissue, nasal 
turbinates, pharynx, larynx and bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue). Mast cell infiltration in the mesenteric 
lymph nodes, accumulation of alveolar macrophages and reduced numbers of globule leukocytes in the 
trachea were apparent in rats. Effects in the reproductive tract included abnormal vaginal mucification in rats 
or reduced vaginal discharge in dogs and findings in both species consistent with delayed maturation of the 
ovaries, uterus or mammary gland.  
As these MF-related changes were generally apparent at all QMF149 dose levels, NOAELs were not identified 
in the 13-week toxicity studies.  
Administration of QMF149 at doses of ≤176.9/40.5 mg/kg/day (indacaterol/MF) or indacaterol alone in dogs 
was associated with marked increases in heart rates after the first administration as reflected by reduced RR 
intervals during electrocardiography evaluations. These changes were associated with shortened QT and 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 29/182 
  
  
lengthened QTc (Fridericia) intervals. There were no significant changes in RR, QT or QTc intervals at 
subsequent evaluations in Weeks 4 and 12 of treatment.  
Reflex tachycardia is a known effect of indacaterol and is secondary to β2-adrenoceptor mediated 
vasodilation and hypotension. The marked changes in heart rate were associated with minimal cardiac 
degeneration/fibrosis or mineralization in one or two individual dogs treated at each dose level of QMF149 or 
with indacaterol alone. Other findings in rats that were associated with the administration indacaterol either 
alone or in combination included minimally decreased serum potassium and glucose concentrations that were 
consistent with known effects of β2 adrenergic agonists. Hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolization and 
increased liver weights were also observed in dogs treated with QMF149, indacaterol alone or MF alone. 
There was no evidence of an additive or synergic effect among QMF149-treated animals. 
Genotoxic potential 
Genotoxicity studies were not performed with QMF149. The genotoxic potential of indacaterol and MF were 
fully evaluated as part of their individual development programs.  
Carcinogenic potential 
The carcinogenic potential of indacaterol and MF were assessed as part of their individual registration 
dossiers. Further studies were not conducted for QMF149. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
Potential effects of indacaterol and MF on fertility and early embryonic development, embryofoetal 
development and pre- and post-natal development were fully evaluated as part of their individual registration 
dossiers.  
MF was teratogenic in rodents and rabbits therefore further studies to evaluate the effects of QMF149 on 
embryo-fetal development were not considered necessary.  
The currently available nonclinical and clinical data for indacaterol and MF given alone or in combination 
together with the clinical experience with other LABA/ICS combinations do not indicate any potential 
developmental risks associated with the administration of the individual components of QMF149 to pediatric 
patients below 11 years old and in adolescents of 12 years old or above. Juvenile toxicity studies were 
therefore not conducted for QMF149. 
Other toxicities studies  
Antigenicity  
The extensive nonclinical and human data for indacaterol and MF do not indicate any potential risk for 
antigenicity. Specific studies were not conducted for QMF149. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity studies were not performed with QMF149. The extensive nonclinical and clinical data 
available for each monotherapy component have fully evaluated any potential for immunotoxicity. The results 
of the 13-week inhalation toxicity studies for QMF149 did not indicate any new or unexpected effects on 
immune function. 
Mechanistic studies 
Mechanistic toxicity studies were not performed for QMF149. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020

Dependence 
Nonclinical and clinical studies for indacaterol and MF have not indicated any potential for dependence. No 
specific investigations were conducted for QMF149. 
Metabolites 
No specific studies were required to evaluate the toxicity profile of individual metabolites to support the 
individual registration dossiers for indacaterol or MF. The toxicity profiles of the indacaterol or MF metabolites 
present in humans and animals were evaluated during the repeated-dose toxicity and carcinogenicity studies 
performed for each monotherapy component. The metabolic profiles of indacaterol or MF in QMF149 are 
expected to be comparable with those assessed in the previous toxicity studies for each monotherapy 
component. No unexpected toxicities that would indicate an altered metabolic profile were observed in the 
13-week toxicity studies with QMF149. Additional toxicological studies to evaluate the individual metabolites 
of QMF149 were not conducted.  
Salt bridging toxicity studies  
A single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats and a 4-week toxicity study in dogs were conducted by inhalation 
administration to compare the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of indacaterol acetate with indacaterol 
maleate in order to bridge to the currently available data with indacaterol maleate. No significant differences 
in achieved dose normalized systemic or lung tissue exposures were seen in rats following administration of 
indacaterol acetate or indacaterol maleate. The overall toxicological profile of indacaterol acetate and maleate 
following inhalation administration to beagle dogs was also consistent with that expected of a β2 
adrenoceptor agonist and no new or unexpected toxicities were observed. Papillary muscle fibrosis was noted 
in the heart of at least one animal in each group given indacaterol acetate or indacaterol maleate and as a 
consequence a NOAEL was not established. 
Impurities and degradation products 
No additional drug substance impurities or degradation products above the threshold for toxicological 
qualification were identified in the QMF149 combination product. 
Formulation excipients and active ingredients 
Lactose used in the QMF149 formulations for the toxicology studies is well characterized and widely used 
pharmaceutical excipients. Lactose was not associated with any toxicological or local respiratory tract 
tolerance issues. The composition of the formulations used during the QMF149 inhalation toxicology studies 
are considered appropriate to support the clinical use of QMF149 dry powder capsules for inhalation that 
contain up to 0.69% indacaterol and 1.28% MF.  
The QMF149 formulations in the 13-week inhalation toxicology studies contained 1.65% indacaterol/6.6% MF 
or 6.6% indacaterol/1.65% MF. Higher amounts of indacaterol and MF were required in the toxicology 
formulations in comparison with those used clinically in order to fully assess the toxicity profile of QMF149 in 
animals at delivered pulmonary doses and systemic exposure levels above those anticipated in humans. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
PEC calculations for both components of the proposed FDC were below the action limit. The maximum daily 
dose for mometasone used in the calculations was 800 µg per day, this is incorrect, but in excess of the 
maximum proposed dose of 320 µg per day and therefore acceptable. The logKow for indacaterol was below 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 31/182 
  
  
the action limit for PBT screening and therefore phase II assessment for these agents was not required in the 
previous assessments.  
For mometasone, Log Kow was assessed in a GLP compliant OECD 107 study via the shake flask method. Log 
Kow was assessed over a range of pH values and found not to be dependent on pH. Log Kow was above the 
trigger value thus requiring the initiation of a full PBT assessment. To assess potential bioaccumulation the 
applicant conducted a fish (Lepomis macrochirus) bioaccumulation study in accordance to OECD 305 and in 
compliance with GLP. The bioaccumulation factors reported are below the relevant trigger value and indicate 
that mometasone is not bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative.  
Adsorption/desorption study was evaluated in an OECD 106 study. This included an assessment of Koc in five 
soils and one sludge. As the sludge Koc was below the relevant trigger value no terrestrial risk assessment is 
required. The applicant has also submitted a study assessing the biodegradability of mometasone in activated 
sludge in accordance with OECD 314B. In this study mometasone underwent primary biodegradation into two 
transformation products over the course of 28-days in activated sludge solution with a calculated t1/2 of 31 
days. In contrast, in abiotic solution no significant degradation was noted. The applicant has also conducted 
an assessment of aerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems in accordance with OECD 308. 
The applicant has also conducted a phase IIa effect analysis including OECD 201, 209, 210 and 211 studies. 
Phase II aquatic toxicity studies met validity criteria. PEC/PNEC for the most sensitive species (Pimephales 
promelas, fish early life study) is less than 1 indicating an acceptable risk to the environment.

An abridged non-clinical data package has been submitted in support of this MAA. No new pharmacology 
studies have been conducted, this is considered acceptable and in line with the EMAs guideline on the 
development of fixed dose combinations (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). A literature review of the 
pharmacology of the individual components has been presented and is considered acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Method validation reports have been submitted for the methods used for the quantification of mometasone 
and indacaterol in PK/Tox studies. In general, these are considered acceptable. 
The applicant has submitted TK data from the 13-week QMF149 mometasone furoate and indacaterol 
maleate combination toxicity studies conducted in rat and dog. Furthermore, comparative single dose study 
in rats and 4 weeks repeat dose inhalation study in dogs has been submitted to bridge the existing 
toxicological and clinical data available for the maleate salt of indacaterol to the acetate salt proposed for use 
in the current product. There are consistent differences in dose normalised exposures between the two salts 
evident in the single dose rat study. A similar (though less pronounced) trend was observed in the dog study. 
Differences in MMAD and inherent variability in inhaled dosing to non-clinical species may play a role. 
Further, the lack of a significant difference in systemic exposure noted clinically between the two salt forms is 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 34/182 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reassuring. In light of these data, the applicant’s justification that this difference is unlikely to be clinically 
relevant is accepted, therefore no further action is considered necessary.   
No dedicated distribution, metabolism or excretion studies for the combination or for the individual drug 
substances have been submitted. Instead, reference is made to previously conducted studies and 
bibliographic data on the distribution of these actives. This approach is reasonable and it is accepted that the 
ADME of the respective agents has been appropriately characterised. 
The applicant has submitted an assessment of the potential for DDI based on data sourced from the dossiers 
for marketed indacaterol products and literature sources for mometasone furoate. These actives are not 
predicted to inhibit/induce metabolic enzymes or drug transporters at systemic exposures predicted following 
clinical administration. Indacaterol is identified as being metabolised via CYP3A4 and as a p-gp substrate and 
thus co-administration of inhibitors of these enzymes/transporters may result in an increase in systemic 
exposure (≈2 fold). A full DDI assessment of mometasone has not been submitted with the justification that 
the metabolism has previously been characterised and the low plasma concentration following inhalation 
administration, combined with high plasma protein binding render the risk of DDI low. Bibliographic data do 
not suggest clinically relevant induction/inhibition of metabolic enzymes. MF is identified as a substrate of 
CYP3A4 and strong inhibitors of this enzyme may alter systemic concentrations, however given the low 
systemic absorption and high degree of plasma protein binding such changes are again unlikely to be or 
clinical relevance. Appropriate information on this risk is included in section 4.5 of the draft SmPC. In 
general, given the well-established clinical use of MF via this route of administration the lack of a full 
assessment of the potential for DDI for MF at uptake/efflux transporters in line with the guideline of the 
investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) is considered acceptable.  
Toxicology 
A summary of the known toxicology of the individual components was presented in the marketing 
authorisation application dossier. Reports for 13-week studies assessing indacaterol/mometasone 
combination toxicity in rat and dog are submitted in this application for assessment. Rat and dog were 
identified as relevant species for non-clinical efficacy and safety studies. 
These studies do not indicate significant synergistic toxicity with target organs identified (lymphatic system, 
adrenals, heart) in line with the known toxicity of the individual components. NOAELS were not defined in 
these studies due to MF mediated effects. Although no margins of exposure from NOAELs identified in pre-
clinical studies with the combination and anticipated clinical exposures have been provided, given the 
extensive clinical experience with similar combinations this is considered acceptable.  
The 4-week bridging study comparing the relative toxicity of acetate and maleate salts of indacaterol 
suggested some minor differences with the acetate salt treated animals exhibiting a mild increase in severity 
of cardiac toxicity relative to maleate treated groups. There are limitations in this study design (i.e. given the 
small numbers of animals in this study, the absence of daily TK data and the accepted technical difficulties 
with achieving consistent exposures to non-clinical species via inhalation) that render a conclusive 
interpretation of the data presented difficult. However, any additional discussion of the results of this study 
will not provide further clarity in relation to the clinical relevance of these findings. Therefore, the clinical 
comparability exercise was considered to be of more relevance and the issue considered resolved. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted an ERA in line with the EMA’s ‘guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use’ (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2). This includes a full phase II and PBT

assessment of the potential environmental risk of mometasone. A full assessment of transformation products 
was not undertaken in the submitted OECD 308 study, but it was performed according to the guidance at the 
time and is considered acceptable. The endpoint chosen for the assessment of potential glucocorticoid 
induced toxicity is not considered the most sensitive. Upon request of CHMP, the applicant committed to 
submit a completed OECD 234 fish sexual development study post-marketing, at the latest by Q4 2022. This 
is accepted.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new pharmacology studies have been conducted, this is considered acceptable and in line with the EMA’s 
guideline on the development of fixed dose combinations (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). The updated 
toxicological programme did not reveal unexpected toxicity. This information has been included in section 5.3 
of the SmPC. Overall, the non-clinical data provided is considered acceptable. 
The CHMP recommended that a completed OECD 234 fish sexual development study should be conducted 
and submitted as a post-approval commitment. A respective letter of commitment has been provided, 
including the expected timeframe for submission.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical PK program for QMF149 was based on the completed clinical programs conducted for the 
authorized individual components reported in previous registration dossiers (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC and 
Asmanex Twisthaler SmPC). New information was based on the evaluation of PK interactions between 
indacaterol acetate and MF administered as QMF149 [Study CQMF149E2102], the indacaterol salt bridging 
study [Study CQVM149B2203], the Japanese ethnic sensitivity study [Study CQMF149E1101], and population 
PK analyses based on Phase III studies for QMF149 and QVM149 [QVM149B-PopPK-Report]. 
2.4.2.1.  Bioanalytical methods 
Pre-Study Bioanalytical Method Validation 
The validations of the bioanalytical methods for the determination of indacaterol (QAB) and mometasome 
furoate (MF) were performed across multiple investigative sites using different bioanalytical methodologies.  
Each bioanalytical method validation report provides data pertaining to specificity; lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ); characterisation of potential matrix interference; calibration curve performance; intra- 
and inter-assay accuracy and precision; carry-over and analyte stability. 
The specificity of each bioanalytical method was assessed by analysing six different batches of blank human 
plasma for interfering substances. Specificity was determined by the assessment of blank samples, with and 
without the inclusion of a suitable IS, prepared from control human plasma. No chromatographic interference 
from the blank samples (i.e. mean signal detection ≤5 and 20% of LLOQ for the IS and analyte, respectively) 
was observed at the retention times of QAB, MF or the internal standards, respectively.  
Back calculated calibrated standards (CS) were within ±20% of the nominal value at the LLOQ, and ±15% 
for all other concentration levels above the LLOQ, using a minimum of 6 non-zero concentration levels. 
Within- and between-run precision (%CV) was acceptable for the Quality Control (QC) sample concentrations 
presented (i.e. %CV for low, medium and high QC samples <15%, respectively). The intra- and inter-assay 
accuracy for each method based on low, medium and high QC samples were within ±15% of the nominal 
values assessed. 
Within-In Study Validation 
During the analysis of participant samples, spiked CS and QC standards were extracted to permit the 
determination of the concentration of indacaterol (QAB) and mometasone (MF), in addition to the assessment 
of intra- and inter-run accuracy and precision. Each analytical run included QC, blank and zero samples, 
respectively. Method reproducibility was assessed via incurred sample reanalysis. Participant samples for 
pivotal trials CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302 were analysed across separate investigative sites using 
different bioanalytical methods. Cross-method validation studies were conducted to investigate concordance 
between analytical techniques and investigative sites for the detection of each analyte using back-up incurred 
samples.  
2.4.2.2.  Population PK analyses 
The popPK analyses focused on PK data from asthma patients enrolled in the two-phase III studies 
[CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302] for whom PK data were retained in the analysis. The phase III study 
[Study CQVM149B2303] and the phase II study [Study CQMF149E2201] provided supplementary data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 40/182 
  
  
Separate population PK models were developed for indacaterol and mometasone furoate (MF). For MF, where 
depending on the formulation, a different nominal dose is required to deliver the same lung dose, a 
multiplicative factor on bioavailability was introduced. 
Indacaterol 
The final popPK model for indacaterol was a two-compartment disposition model with a short zero-order 
absorption of a fraction of the drug followed by a rapid first-order absorption of the rest of the drug and first-
order elimination. To account for differences in Cmax concentrations between study CQVM149B2301 and 
CQVM149B2302, a study effect was estimated on Vc/F. Based on simulations, no difference in the PK of 
indacaterol was identified with different formulations. Covariates included in the final model were body weight 
on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and grouped race (Caucasian/White, Japanese, Other) on Vc/F. The effects of 
these covariates on indacaterol PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma were 
small in magnitude and not clinically relevant. Age, sex, smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline 
were not statistically significant covariates. 
Mometasone furoate 
The final popPK model for MF was a linear two-compartment disposition model with mixed zero/first order 
absorption and first-order elimination. The mixed zero-order/first-order absorption process describes an 
initial very rapid absorption of a fraction of the drug overlaid by slower first-order absorption. Formulation 
effects were introduced on relative bioavailability, central volume and peripheral volume, and a study effect 
on central volume. Covariates included in the final model were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and 
baseline FEV1 on CL/F and Vc/F. The effects of these covariates on MF PK following inhalation of QMF149 or 
QVM149 in patients with asthma were small in magnitude and not clinically relevant. Age, sex, Japanese 
ethnicity, smoking status and baseline eGFR were not statistically significant covariates.  
2.4.2.3.  Indacaterol salt bridging study 
Study CQVM149B2203 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over study 
to assess the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two orally inhaled indacaterol 
salts (maleate and acetate) delivered via the Concept1 inhalation device in patients with asthma. 
On Day 14, upon comparison of indacaterol acetate with indacaterol maleate when including body weight as 
covariate, the geometric mean ratio for AUC0-24h,ss was 0.897 (90% CI: 0.854, 0.942) and for Cmax,ss was 
0.891 (90% CI: 0.847, 0.939). Thus, both AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax fell within the bioequivalence limits (90% 
CI: 0.80-1.25) indicating comparable exposure from both salts (Table 11-10). The inclusion/exclusion of 
bodyweight as a covariate had no impact on the conclusion of the study.

Table 3 Geometric mean ratio (test/reference) and 90% confidence intervals for 
indacaterol PK parameters on Day 14 when including body weight as covariate (PK 
analysis set) 
Study CQAB149D2301 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 4-
way cross-over study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of orally inhaled 
indacaterol salts (maleate, xinafoate and acetate) in patients with persistent asthma. 
The results showed that indacaterol exposure (AUC0-24h and Cmax) was similar for the three different 
indacaterol salts. Indacaterol was rapidly absorbed following inhalation administration and peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) were achieved in less than 0.5 hours post-inhalation for all three salts. Linear and 
semi-logarithmic graphical displays of the arithmetic mean concentration over time curves per treatment 
demonstrate the similarity of the mean concentration time profiles for the three indacaterol salts. The results 
of the statistical analysis of PK parameters AUC0-24h and Cmax on day 7, are shown in Table 11-6. The 
AUC0-24h treatment ratios acetate to maleate and xinafoate to maleate were close to one and the 90% 
confidence intervals contained one. The same applies to the Cmax ratio acetate to maleate. The Cmax ratio 
xinafoate to maleate was 0.885 with a confidence interval of 0.802 to 0.976.

dataset) 
2.4.2.4.  Mometasone device bridging 
MF Twisthaler and MF Concept1 are different with regards to both the inhalation device and the formulations 
they deliver. Therefore, a 3-step bridging approach was used to identify doses of MF in the Concept1 device 
that were comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device.  
Step 1: In a single dose PK study [CQMF149E2101], the estimated average dose of MF in the Concept1 
device expected to provide systemic exposures comparable to the MF dose of 400 μg delivered via the 
Twisthaler device was 195 μg (medium dose ICS). Since the absolute oral bioavailability of MF is low, 
systemic exposure was considered to be an appropriate surrogate for pulmonary exposure to MF, as a 
starting point for the bridging approach. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 42/182 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Step 2: Due to a drug substance coating effect following the first delivered dose from the Concept1 device, a 
slightly increased delivered dose and fine particle mass was observed for the second and subsequent doses. 
The relative difference in FPM for MF 50 μg between the first and second dose was 0.8 μg, i.e. a relative 
increase in FPM of 8% following the initial capsule actuation.  
Since in Study CQMF149E2101 each capsule was delivered using a fresh Concept1 device, the first dose 
effect resulting in an increase of FPM on the second dose was incorporated in the in vitro dose adjustment. 
Following in vitro dose adjustment for the first dose effect, the dose of MF in Concept1 determined to be 
comparable to the MF Twisthaler 2x200 μg dose was adjusted from 195 to 160 μg. 
The doses selected for development were based on the linear relationship between the MF AUClast and in 
vitro FPM corresponding to the doses of MF Concept1 device used in Study CQMF149E2101. Applying this 
approach, the 400 μg medium dose of MF from the Twisthaler was defined as 160 μg from Concept1 device. 
By taking half and double of this defined dose, the doses of MF 80 μg and 320 μg in the Concept1 device 
were selected, as corresponding to MF 200 μg and 800 μg in the Twisthaler device. 
Step 3: A clinical bridging study [Study CQMF149E2201] in patients with asthma confirmed that the MF doses 
of 80 μg and 320 μg delivered via the Concept1 device were comparable to MF doses of 200 μg and 800 μg 
delivered via the Twisthaler device, respectively, in terms of PD effects and systemic exposure. 
Study CQMF149E2101 was an open-label, single-dose, two-part study to compare systemic exposure to 
mometasone furoate when delivered by oral inhalation via the Concept1 and Twisthaler devices and to 
determine the effect of activated charcoal on the absorption of mometasone furoate delivered via the 
Concept1 device in healthy subjects. 
Part 1 - MF was absorbed following oral inhalation with maximum concentrations occurring within 3 hours in 
all subjects following oral inhalation via both Twisthaler and Concept1 devices. Median Tmax occurred earlier 
with all doses following inhalation via Concept1 (0.375 to 2 hours) compared to inhalation via Twisthaler (3 
hours). The terminal half-life of MF was similar following all treatments (approximately 12-13 hours). 
Variability of MF PK parameters was lower following administration via Concept1 compared to Twisthaler with 
CVs for Cmax and AUC parameters ranging from 20.5% to 26.7% (Concept1) compared to 47.3% to 49.8% 
(Twisthaler). Summary statistics of primary PK parameters following single orally inhaled MF via Twisthaler or 
Concept1 are provided in Table 5.

inhaled MF via Twisthaler or Concept0 (Part 1) 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 43/182 
  
  
 
 
Based on primary statistical analysis, the estimated average dose of MF in Concept1 expected to provide 
systemic exposure comparable to Twisthaler 400 μg was 195 μg [90% CI: (175 μg, 215 μg), CV% 9.03%] 
based on AUClast. 
Part 2 - Measurable concentrations of MF were noted following both treatments (i.e. administration of MF with 
or without activated charcoal), allowing for complete characterization of the PK profile and estimation of 
relevant PK parameters. Absorption of MF was slow and variable following oral dosing without activated 
charcoal, with peak concentrations being achieved between 2 and 24 hours after dosing. Tmax was generally 
earlier when MF was administered with activated charcoal (1 to 6 hours). Terminal half-life was similar with 
and without activated charcoal (19-22 hours). Activated charcoal reduced the systemic exposure (AUClast) of 
MF in all subjects. Similar results were also noted for AUCinf and AUC0-24h. Oral absorption of MF was 
suppressed by 74% in the presence of activated charcoal (based on AUClast). However, at least 85% 
suppression was required in the protocol for validation of the charcoal-block method and, hence, Treatments 
H and I (MF via Concept1 with and without activated charcoal) were not administered. 
Study CQMF149E2201 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-week treatment, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of mometasone furoate delivered via Concept1 or 
Twisthaler in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. 
Mean plasma MF concentrations rose rapidly after inhalation dosing via both devices and reached a peak at 
~1 hour post-dose. Mean MF systemic exposure (AUClast, AUC0-23h35min and Cmax) on Day 1 and Day 28 
was slightly lower for the MF Concept1 doses (80μg or 320 μg) vs. corresponding MF TH doses (200 μg or 
800 μg), respectively. Slightly less than proportional increase in exposure (AUClast and Cmax) was observed 
for the high dose groups vs. the low dose groups for both devices on Day 1 and Day 28 (Table 6).

2.4.2.5.  Component interaction within the QMF149 FDC 
Study CQMF149E2102 was a randomized, open-labelled, four-period complete crossover, confirmatory 
study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction following multiple 
inhaled doses of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate delivered in free or in fixed combination 
(QMF149) via the Concept1 device in healthy subjects.  
Mean indacaterol concentrations rose rapidly after oral inhalation via Concept1 and reached a peak at 0.25 
hour post-dose. The profiles of the indacaterol acetate 150 μg (mono), free combination and FDC QMF149 
150/320 μg treatments appeared to be similar. Mean exposure PK parameters AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss 
were similar for the indacaterol alone (monotherapy) and the free combination but slightly higher for 
QMF149. The mean relative bioavailability ratios were slightly higher for the FDC vs. mono comparison (Table 
2-13).  
Mean MF concentrations rose after inhalation dosing and reached a peak at ~1 hour post-dose. Following 
administration of the free combination or the FDC QMF149, the concentrations of MF were slightly higher than 
the concentrations observed following administration of MF alone. Mean exposure PK parameters AUC0-
24h,ss and Cmax,ss were slightly higher for the free combination and QMF149 as compared to the MF alone 
treatment. The mean relative bioavailability ratios were slightly higher for the free combination vs. mono

The 90% confidence intervals for all comparisons were within the bioequivalence limits of 0.80-1.25, except 
for MF Cmax,ss (FDC vs. mono comparison), where the 90% confidence interval was [1.13-1.26] (Table 7). 
Table 7 Study CQMF149E2102: Summary of the relative bioavailability analysis of fixed 
dose  combination (QMF149) versus monotherapy and free combination 
2.4.2.6.  Absorption 
There was no PK interaction between the individual components of QMF149 when administered together as 
the QMF149 FDC. Steady-state systemic exposure (Cmax,ss and AUC0-24h,ss) to the components of QMF149 
was comparable after individual or combined administration as QMF149.  
In healthy subjects, after administration as QMF149 FDC or as monotherapy components, indacaterol and MF 
were rapidly absorbed with median Tmax values of 0.25h and 1h, respectively. No obvious difference in Tmax 
was observed after dosing either as FDC or as monocomponents of QMF149. 
Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of indacaterol was comparable after administration via the Concept1 
device as either indacaterol acetate used in QMF149 or indacaterol maleate used in the approved 
monotherapy product Onbrez Breezhaler. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Systemic exposure to indacaterol is not significantly affected by the low activity UGT1A1 genotypic variation 
(Gilbert’s syndrome genotype) (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC).  
No data were provided for mometasone within the initial submission. 
In this application, no additional information was provided which is acceptable.

2.4.2.7.  Dose proportionality 
To support the QMF149 FDC [QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. (low dose ICS), QMF149 150/160 μg (medium dose 
ICS) and QMF149 150/320 μg (high dose ICS)] development, formal dose proportionality assessments were 
not performed for indacaterol as only one dose was used (150 μg). 
Dose proportionality information for MF systemic exposure following QMF149 administration is based on PK 
data in healthy subjects [Study CQMF149E1101] and in patients with asthma ([QVM149B-PopPK-Report]). 
In healthy subjects, after oral inhalation of QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg via Concept1, a 4-
fold increase in dose of MF from 80 μg to 320 μg led to an approximately 4-fold increase in MF systemic 
exposure (AUC0-24h) on Day 1 and Day 14. 
In patients with asthma, less than dose proportional increase in MF systemic exposure was noted following 
QMF149 administration in patients with asthma. Simulated AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for MF were 1.7-fold 
higher following administration of high dose QMF149 150/320 μg compared to medium dose QMF149 
150/160 μg. Based on cross-study comparisons, simulated mean Cmax,ss for QMF149 150/320 μg was 2.8- 
fold higher compared to the observed concentration at 1 hr post-dose on Day 84 for low dose QMF149 
150/80 μg. 
2.4.2.8.  Distribution and protein binding 
The blood distribution and plasma protein binding of the individual components of QMF149 have been 
previously investigated as part of the monotherapy programs which indicated extensive distribution. The 
distribution and plasma protein binding properties were not expected to be different for the FDC product. 
Therefore, no additional in vitro studies have been performed with the combination drug QMF149. 
2.4.2.9.  Metabolism 
Based on known in vitro and in vivo biotransformation data from the monotherapy development programs for 
indacaterol and MF, there was no potential for drug interaction between the components following 
administration of the QMF149 combination. This was confirmed in the clinical PK component interaction study 
[Study CQMF149E2102] which demonstrated that steady-state systemic exposure (Cmax,ss and AUC0-
24h,ss) to the components of QMF149 was comparable after individual or combined administration as 
QMF149. No additional in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies have been conducted with QMF149.  
2.4.2.10.  Excretion 
Elimination and excretion of the individual components of QMF149, indacaterol and MF have been studied 
extensively. Since no difference was anticipated for the combination drug QMF149, no additional clinical 
studies have been performed with QMF149. 
2.4.2.11.  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In Study CQMF149E2101, systemic exposure (AUClast) of MF increased in a dose proportional manner over 
the dose range of 50 to 400 μg following oral inhalation via Concept1. Similar results were also noted for 
AUCinf and AUC0-24h. Cmax for MF also increased in an approximately dose proportional manner; however, 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 47/182 
  
  
the confidence interval for the slope estimate did not include 1 and therefore the increase in Cmax was not 
statistically dose proportional (Table 8).  
Table 8 Primary statistical analysis of dose proportionality (Part 1) 
In Study CQMF149E1101, after oral inhalation of QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg via 
Concept1 device, a 4-fold increase in dose of MF from 80 μg to 320 μg led to an approximately 4-fold 
increase in MF systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) on Day 1 and Day 14 (Table 9). Minor deviations from dose 
proportionality noted for Cmax were not clinically meaningful. 
Table 9 Geometric mean ratio and 90% confidence interval for MF primary PK 
parameters for the high dose vs. the low dose by ethnic group on Day 1 and Day 14 (PK 
analysis set) 
Dose proportionality information for MF after QMF149 administration in patients with asthma is based on 
pooled population PK analysis [QVM149B-PopPK-Report] of studies [Study CQVM149B2301 and 
CQVM149B2302] in patients with asthma. Both studies included the QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. (medium dose 
ICS) and QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. (high dose ICS) treatments. 
•  Simulated  mean  AUC0-24h,ss  was  1.7-fold  higher  following  administration  of  high  dose  QMF149 
150/320 µg (1590 pg.h/mL) compared to medium dose QMF149 150/160 µg (957 pg.h/mL). 
•  Similarly simulated mean Cmax,ss was 1.7-fold higher following administration of high dose QMF149 
150/320 µg (151 pg/mL) compared to medium dose QMF149 150/160 µg (91 pg/mL).

The trough plasma concentrations of indacaterol and MF were stable from Day 12 to Day 14 when 
administered as QMF149 FDC or as monotherapy indicating that PK steady state was reached by Day 12. 
The indacaterol accumulation ratios (Racc) after once-daily dosing of QMF149 FDC for 14 days were 2.80-
3.16 for AUC0-24h and 1.53-1.61 for Cmax in healthy subjects (Study CQMF149E1101). 
The MF accumulation ratios (Racc) after once-daily dosing of QMF149 FDC for 14 days were 1.61-1.71 for 
AUC0-24h and 1.49-1.58 for Cmax in healthy subjects (Study CQMF149E1101). 
Inter-individual variability 
In the popPK model for indacaterol, between subject variability on the PK parameters CL/F and Vc/F was 0.43 
and 0.40 (base model) and from 0.48 and 0.38 (final model), respectively. 
In the popPK model for mometasone, between subject variability on the PK parameters CL/F and Vc/F was 
0.49 and 0.42 (base model) and 0.49 and 0.39 (final model), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Study CQVM149B2301 was a multi-centre, randomized, 52 weeks treatment, double blind, triple-dummy, 
parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of QMF149 compared with mometasone furoate in 
patients with asthma. Approximately 12.8% of patients were included in the PK subpopulation for exploratory 
PK analysis. A total of 284 patients participated in the PK sub-study. These show similar indacaterol PK 
profiles between QMF149 150/160 µg and QMF149 150/320 µg. The MF PK profiles, however, showed some 
differences depending on how MF was administered – as mono-component via Twisthaler device vs. as FDC 
via Concept1 device at a high dose or at a medium dose (Table 9-8 and Table 9-10). 
Study CQVM149B2302 was a multicentre, randomized, 52-week, double-blind, parallel group, active 
controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of QVM149 with QMF149 in patients with asthma. 
Approximately 8.7% of patients were included in the PK subpopulation for exploratory PK analysis. A total of 
270 patients participated in the PK sub-study. These show similar indacaterol PK profiles between QMF149 
150/160 µg, QMF149 150/320 µg, QVM149 150/50/160 µg, and QVM149 150/50/80 µg. The MF PK profiles 
were also similar between QMF149 150/160 µg and QVM149 150/50/80 µg, and between QMF149 150/320 
µg and QVM149 150/50/160 µg (Table 9-8 and Table 9-10). 
Study CQVM149B2303 was a multi-centre, randomized, 12-week treatment, double blind study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of QMF149 (150/80 μg) compared with mometasone furoate (MF) Twisthaler® (200 
μg) in adult and adolescent patients with asthma. Approximately 12.1% of patients were included in the PK 
subpopulation for exploratory PK analysis. A total of 97 patients participated in the PK sub-study; 50 patients 
received QMF149 and 47 subjects received MF. 
The mean (SD) plasma indacaterol concentrations at pre-dose and 15 min post-dose, at steady state on Day 
84, were 85 (27) pg/mL and 304 (109) pg/mL, respectively. Similar concentrations were noted on Day 30. 
These concentrations were consistent with prior data reported for indacaterol maleate 150 μg administered 
via the Concept1 device in COPD patients (Demin et al 2016).  
The mean (SD) plasma MF concentrations at pre-dose, at steady state on Day 84, were comparable between 
the QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. (7.2 (7.44) pg/mL) and MF Twisthaler 200 μg o.d. (19.6 (39.28) pg/mL) 
treatment groups, considering the overall variability. Similar observations were noted at the 15 min and 
1 hour post-dose time points. Steady state plasma MF concentrations were also comparable between the 
QMF149 and MF Twisthaler treatment at the corresponding time-points on Day 30 (Table 10 and Table 11).

Mean plasma indacaterol concentrations rose rapidly after inhalation at both dose levels and reached a peak 
between 0.250 to 0.309 hours post-dose (median Tmax). Approximately dose dependent increase in 
exposure (AUC0-23h35min, AUClast and Cmax) was observed for the indacaterol acetate 150 μg dose group 
vs. the indacaterol acetate 75 μg dose group on Day 1 and Day 14. Summary statistics of PK parameters 
AUClast, AUC0-23h35min, Cmax and Tmax for all patients in the 24 h PK subgroup are presented in Table 
12.  
Table 12 Summary statistics of indacaterol PK parameters by treatment & profile day 
(24-h PK subgroup) 
For the arithmetic mean (SD) indacaterol trough concentrations (pre-dose or 23h 35 min postdose) for the 
sparse PK samples collected on various occasions throughout the study, indacaterol trough concentrations 
were approximately similar between Day 14 and Day 84 and were approximately 2-fold higher for the 
indacaterol acetate 150 μg dose group vs. the indacaterol acetate 75 μg dose group. Trough concentrations 
were generally similar for the Japanese and non-Japanese patients. A similar trend was noted for 
concentrations of samples collected at 1 h post-dose on Days 1, 14 and 84. 
Study QMF149F2202 was a randomized, double-blind, 12-week treatment, parallel group study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of QMF149 (150 μg/160 μg o.d.) compared with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone 
propionate (50 μg/500 μg b.i.d.) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The data 
presented by the Applicant shows that there are no relevant differences between PK profiles of asthma and 
COPD patients. 
Mean plasma indacaterol and mometasone furoate concentrations rose rapidly after inhalation dosing on Day 
28 and Day 84 and reached a peak at 0.25 h (first post-dose timepoint) and 1 h post-dose, respectively. 
Mean indacaterol systemic exposure (AUClast, AUC0-23h35min and Cmax) on Day 84 was similar to the 
systemic exposure on Day 28. A similar trend was noted for mometasone furoate systemic exposure.

2.4.2.12.  Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
Systemic exposure of indacaterol and MF following QMF149 administration has not been characterized in 
subjects with renal impairment. Systemic exposure between the FDC and monotherapy products was 
comparable based on the results of the PK component interaction study [Study CQMF149E2102] and PK data 
from Phase III studies [QVM149B-PopPK-Report]. In the popPk analyses, eGFR normalised to body surface 
area, was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for indacaterol or MF PK. Based on these data, 
dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment can be extrapolated from the monotherapy 
products to QMF149. Renal elimination has a minor role in the elimination of both indacaterol and MF. 
Therefore, effects of renal impairment on indacaterol or MF PK have not been investigated. No dose 
adjustment is required based on the information for the authorised mono-components. This has been 
reflected in the SmPC.  
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
Systemic exposure of indacaterol and MF following QMF149 administration has not been characterized in 
subjects with hepatic impairment. Systemic exposure between the FDC and monotherapy products was 
comparable based on the results of the PK component interaction study [Study CQMF149E2102] and PK data 
from Phase III studies [QVM149B-PopPK-Report]. Based on these data, dosing recommendations for patients 
with hepatic impairment can be extrapolated from the monotherapy products to QMF149. No data are 
available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, QMF149 should be used in these patients 
only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk. This is in line with information included in the SmPC. 
•  Gender 
In the popPk analyses, gender was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for indacaterol or MF 
PK. 
•  Race

Table 11-4 presents geometric mean ratios (Japanese/Caucasian) and 90% confidence intervals for Cmax 
and AUC0-24h of indacaterol by treatment. Following multiple doses of QMF149, the geometric mean ratios 
(90% CIs) of Cmax on Day 14 for Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects in the QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 
150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.23 (1.11-1.38) and 1.19 (1.07-1.33), respectively. Those for AUC0- 
24h on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) and 
1.19 (1.06-1.33), respectively. Based on the results of exploratory statistical analysis including age and body 
weight as covariates, the geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of Japanese to Caucasian for Cmax on Day 14 in 
QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.13 (1.00-1.28) and 1.09 (0.96-1.24), 
respectively. Those for AUC0-24h on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg groups were 
1.13 (1.00-1.28) and 1.10 (0.97-1.25), respectively. As mean body weight was approximately 14% higher 
for Caucasian vs. Japanese subjects, this was considered to be one of the factors that contributed to the 
slightly higher exposure in Japanese subjects.

treatment groups were 1.24 (1.11-1.38) and 1.17 (1.05-1.30), respectively. Those for AUC0-24h in QMF149 
150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.30 (1.18-1.44) and 1.26 (1.14-1.39), 
respectively. Based on the results of exploratory statistical analysis including age and body weight as 
covariantes, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of Japanese to Caucasian for Cmax on Day 14 in QMF149 
150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.15 (1.02-1.30) and 1.09 (0.97-1.23), 
respectively. Those for AUC0-24h on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment 
groups were 1.20 (1.07-1.35) and 1.16 (1.03-1.31), respectively. As mean body weight was approximately 
14% higher for Caucasian vs. Japanese subjects, this was considered to be one of the factors that 
contributed to the slightly higher exposure in Japanese subjects.

Population PK analyses 
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for indacaterol, AUC0-24h was the same between races. 
Simulated Cmax values varied with race. Japanese patients had a 20% higher mean Cmax than Caucasian 
patients; patients of other ethnicities and races had a 5% higher mean Cmax than Caucasian patients. Race 
was not found to be a statistically significant covariate on MF PK. 
•  Body weight 
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for indacaterol, AUC0-24h varied with body weight. 
Compared to population mean AUC0-24h in patients with 75 kg body weight in study CQVM149B2301, the 
AUC0-24h in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 25% higher and 12% lower, respectively. Simulated Cmax 
values varied with body weight. Compared to population mean Cmax in patients with 75 kg body weight in 
study CQVM149B2301, the Cmax in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 32% higher and 14% lower, 
respectively. 
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for MF, AUC0-24h varied with body weight. Compared to 
population mean AUC0-24h in patients with 75 kg body weight, the AUC0-24h in 35 kg and in 115 kg 
patients was 31% higher and 14% lower, respectively. Simulated Cmax values varied with body weight. 
Compared to population mean Cmax in patients with 75 kg body weight, the mean Cmax in 35 kg and in 115 
kg patients was 29% higher and 14% lower, respectively. 
•  Elderly 
The target patient population for asthma includes elderly patients. In the popPK analyses, age was not found 
to be a statistically significant covariate for indacaterol or MF PK. 
•  Children 
QMF149 is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older. QMF149 has not 
been evaluated in patients below 12 years of age. Based on limited data in adolescent patients, observed 
plasma Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss were similar between adult and adolescent (12-18 years old) patients with

asthma, for both indacaterol and MF, following QMF149 administration in [Study CQVM149B2301]. Based on 
the pooled population PK analysis, there was no effect of age on the PK of indacaterol or MF following 
QMF149 administration. 
2.4.2.13.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new data on in vitro or in vivo drug interactions of indacaterol and mometasone furoate were provided.  
In vitro studies for individual components of QMF149 demonstrated that indacaterol and MF are unlikely to 
alter the clearance of drugs that are mainly eliminated through metabolism by the major cytochrome P450 
enzymes and/or of drugs whose absorption or disposition is affected by clinically relevant drug transporters. 
All mRNA, as well as activity data in primary human hepatocytes, suggest that there would be no clinically 
relevant induction of any metabolic and active transport process by indacaterol at therapeutic concentrations. 
Except for strong CYP3A4 inhibitors which may modulate indacaterol or mometasone furoate metabolism, or 
P-gp inhibitors which may affect indacaterol disposition, co-medications are unlikely to alter the 
pharmacokinetics of QMF149 components. 
The potential for systemic PK interaction between indacaterol acetate and MF is low, based on in vitro data 
and clinical drug interaction studies conducted for the indacaterol maleate and MF monotherapy development 
programs. The clearance mechanisms of indacaterol and MF are not anticipated to interfere with each other 
and the compounds are unlikely to act as inhibitors and/or inducers. Consequently, no drug-drug interactions 
between the individual components of QMF149 are anticipated. The absence of dedicated drug interactions 
studies with the combination is agreed by CHMP.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD profile of QMF149 was characterised in study CQVM149B2209 and pivotal studies CQVM149B2301, 
and CQVM149B2302. These studies are detailed in the clinical efficacy section.  
The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of QMF149 reflect the complementary mechanisms of action of the 
individual components of QMF149; the bronchodilatory action achieved with the LABA indacaterol and the 
anti-inflammatory effects of the ICS MF, an established controller medication in asthma.  
The PD response profile of QMF149 is summarised below. 
•  Rapid onset of action: Study CQVM149B2301 showed clinically relevant bronchodilation from 5 min 
post-dose on Day 1.  
• 
Increased approximated peak FEV1: The LS mean change from baseline following QMF149 high and 
medium doses was 0.241 L and 0.244 L respectively, and 0.234 L following salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 μg b.i.d. in Study CQVM149B2301. The LS mean change from baseline following QMF149 high 
and medium doses was 0.194 L and 0.182 L respectively, and 0.157 L following 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. in Study CQVM149B2302. 
•  Sustained bronchodilation in 24-h FEV1 profile: 24 h post-dose trough FEV1 improvements (as an 
approximation for 24 h duration of action) were demonstrated when compared to corresponding 
doses of MF in Study CQVM149B2301 of 0.082 L and 0.142 L.  
• 
Flexible dosing schedule: Morning and evening dosing of QVM149 improved weighted mean FEV1 (0-
24 h) by 0.610 L and 0.615 L, respectively over placebo [Study CQVM149B2209]. This study is 
considered relevant for QMF149 (which does not contain the LAMA, glycopyrronium) since LAMAs are 
not known to elicit differential pharmacodynamics based on time of dosing (Calverley et al 2003). 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 55/182 
  
  
•  No evidence for tachyphylaxis to the effect of QMF149 over time (up to 52 weeks).  
No studies were conducted to investigate the secondary PD effects of QMF149 or any of its monotherapy 
components, this is acceptable given the existing knowledge and the data available for each compound as 
well as the data provided allowing the bridging between QMF149 and authorized monotherapy products. No 
relevant secondary PD effects of QMF149 related to the QTc interval as well as glucose and potassium levels 
were observed during the QMF149 development program or during the previous development programs of its 
monotherapy components. 
No interaction studies have been conducted with QMF149. The proposed SmPC (Section 4.5) provides 
information regarding the potential interactions, based on approved products containing one or more of these 
components, as follows: 
•  Co-administration  of  QMF149  with  other  long-acting  β2-adrenergic  agonist  containing  medicinal 
products may potentiate known inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist adverse reactions. 
• 
• 
Possible hypokalaemia may be potentiated by concomitant medications 
β-adrenergic  blockers  can  weaken  or  inhibit  the  effect  of  indacaterol.  If  β-adrenergic  blockers  are 
required, cardio-selective β-adrenergic blockers are preferred. 
QMF149  should  be  administered  with  caution  to  patients  being  treated  with  medicinal  products  known  to 
prolong the QTc interval. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Pre-Study Bioanalytical Method Validation 
Each pre-study bioanalytical method validation report provided sufficient data to confirm calibration curve 
performance, specificity and the absence of significant carry-over between sample injections. Further data 
presented suggest the absence of any significant matrix effect interfering with the determination of each 
analyte. Data provided also document QAB and MF stability at room temperature (RT), following a minimum 
of 5 freeze thaw cycles, in addition to long-term storage at approximately ≤-15 and -70oC, respectively.  
The data presented for the QC samples used to determine accuracy and precision were acceptable (i.e. ±15% 
of nominal concentration). While some of the QC samples used during validation did not sufficiently cover the 
entire calibration range, data from within-study validation provided sufficient evidence for accuracy and 
precision of methods across the curve.  
Within Study Validation  
The within-study validation reports exhibit acceptable calibration curve performance and reproducibility based 
on incurred sample analysis. Each analytical run included QC, blank and zero samples, respectively.  
Ultimately, within-study validation data demonstrates acceptable accuracy and precision for the QC samples 
across the calibration curve for each method.  
Cross Method Validation Between Investigative Sites 
Cross-method validation failed for samples collected during pivotal study CQVM149B2302. The calibration 
curve used during cross-validation studies for QAB149 was systematically high due to an error in preparation. 
The applicant has taken appropriate action to identify, discard and replace erroneous calibration standards 
prior to the analysis of participant samples from study CQVM149B2302.

Population PK analyses 
For  the  popPK  analyses,  standard  methods  were  generally  used  and  considered  acceptable.  One  population 
PK model was developed for each compound. 
Indacaterol 
The final popPK model for indacaterol was a two-compartment disposition model with a short zero-order 
absorption of a fraction of the drug followed by a rapid first-order absorption of the rest of the drug and first-
order elimination. To account for differences in Cmax concentrations between study CQVM149B2301 and 
CQVM149B2302, a study effect was estimated on Vc/F. Based on simulations, no difference in the PK of 
indacaterol was identified with different formulations. Covariates included in the final model were body weight 
on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and grouped race (Caucasian/White, Japanese, Other) on Vc/F. The effects of 
these covariates on indacaterol PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma, were 
considered by the applicant to be small in magnitude and not clinically relevant, which is agreed. Age, sex, 
smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline were not statistically significant covariates. 
Overall,  the  final  popPK  model  described  the  indacaterol  plasma  concentrations  reasonably  well.  Model 
parameters were estimated with reasonable precision. GOF plots suggested a slight over-prediction of trough 
values.  However,  this  over-prediction  was  not  seen in  the  NPDE  based  diagnostics  and  the  VPCs.  The  VPCs 
showed  that  the  median  observed  concentration-time  profile  for  indacaterol  was  captured  by  the  model  as 
well as the associated variabilities across studies and treatment groups. 
Mometasone furoate 
The final popPK model for MF was a linear two-compartment disposition model with mixed zero/first order 
absorption and first-order elimination. Formulation effects were introduced on relative bioavailability, central 
volume and peripheral volume, and a study effect on central volume.  
Covariates included in the final model were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and baseline FEV1 on 
CL/F and Vc/F. Covariate effects on MF PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with 
asthma, were considered by the applicant to be small in magnitude and not clinically relevant, which is 
agreed. Age, sex, Japanese ethnicity, smoking status and baseline eGFR were not statistically significant 
covariates. 
Overall, the final popPK model describing the MF plasma concentrations is acceptable. Model parameters 
were estimated with reasonable precision overall. GOF plots were satisfactory. The visual predictive checks 
(VPCs) showed that the model was able to describe the central tendency of the observed data reasonably 
well. There was a tendency for over-prediction of the variability, particularly in the phase II study. Overall, 
the VPCs are considered acceptable. 
• 
Indacaterol salt bridging 
Study CQVM149B2203 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over study to 
assess the PD, safety, tolerability, and PK of the indacaterol maleate and acetate salts in patients with 
asthma. AUC0-24,ss and Cmax0-24,ss values were similar regardless of the indacaterol salt used. 
Bioequivalence analysis demonstrated the 90% CI to be contained with the 80-125% equivalence margins. 
This study suggests the choice of either indacaterol acetate or maleate salt does not have any substantial 
effect on plasma concentration levels of monotherapy indacaterol. 
Study CQAB149D2301 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 4-way cross-over 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of orally inhaled indacaterol salts 
(maleate, xinafoate and acetate) in patients with persistent asthma. AUC0-24 and Cmax values were similar 
Assessment report

regardless of the indacaterol salt that was used. Bioequivalence analysis demonstrated the 90% CI to be 
contained with the 80-125% equivalence margins. This study suggests the choice of acetate, maleate or 
xinafoate indacaterol salt does not have a substantial effect on plasma concentration levels of indacaterol. 
These results are consistent with study CQVM149B2203 which examined the effects of acetate and maleate 
salts on the PK of monotherapy indacaterol. However, this study used a different dose (400ug v 150ug) and 
examined PK on a different day (day 7 v day 15).  
The applicant has provided in vitro data to support similar fine particle mass (FPM) between the maleate and 
acetate salts, suggesting the portion of the drug reaching the lungs to be similar. Differences in larger 
particle sizes were observed and these could potentially have resulted in differences in clinical safety and 
efficacy amongst the different salt forms. The DDI study CQMF149E2102 confirms equivalence between the 
proposed FDC with acetate salt and indacaterol monotherapy with acetate salt. The clinical studies 
CQVM149B2203 and CQAB149D2301 are in agreement and confirm the bioequivalence between indacaterol 
monotherapy acetate and maleate salts. There is no direct comparison between the proposed FDC with 
acetate salt and the indacaterol monotherapy with maleate salt. However, as study CQVM149B2203 
demonstrates similar efficacy and safety results between the different salts, this issue was not pursued 
further during the assessment.  
•  Mometasone device bridging 
MF Twisthaler and MF Concept1 are different devices with regards to both the inhalation device and the 
formulations they deliver. A 3-step bridging approach was used to identify doses of MF in the Concept1 
device that were comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device. It is described below. 
The comparable dose of MF in the Concept1 device compared to MF in the licenced Twisthaler device was 195 
ug (study CQMF149E2101). This dose was then adjusted to 160 µg, based on the increased delivery of MF 
subsequent to the first actuation (i.e. the second dose) and tested in study CQMF149E2201. Upon request by 
CHMP, the applicant confirmed that an update to the SmPC to include information on the need for priming the 
device is not required because the 8% higher dose subsequent to the first actuation is not considered 
clinically relevant as this % is lower than the intra-subject variability. In addition, the design of the inhaler, 
being breath activated, does not require any priming of the device which is agreed.  
Study CQMF149E2101 was an open-label, single-dose, two-part study in healthy volunteers to compare 
systemic exposure of mometasone furoate when delivered by oral inhalation via the proposed Concept1 
device and the licenced MF Twisthaler device, and to determine the effect of activated charcoal on the 
absorption of MF delivered via the Concept1 device.  
Results suggested that 195ug of MF with the Concept1/Breezhaler device produces similar plasma 
concentrations to 400ug of MF with the Twisthaler device. These results are in agreement with the 
preliminary in-vitro technical evaluation cascade impaction data that suggested that a 2- to 4-fold lower dose 
of MF in the Concept1 would be required to provide a lung dose equivalent to that from 2×200 μg MF in the 
Twisthaler device.  
Part 2 of this study aimed to examine oral availability of MF in relation to pulmonary availability by 
performing a charcoal study. However, there was insufficient oral absorption of MF blocked by charcoal (74% 
reduction in oral AUC; protocol required at least 85% reduction) and, therefore, the study was discontinued. 
As the study with charcoal blockade was not completed, only systemic MF exposure was measured. 
Therefore, comparable exposure could be accepted as a surrogate for similar safety between products but not 
as supportive of similar efficacy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 58/182 
  
  
Study CQMF149E2201 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-week treatment, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of mometasone furoate delivered via Concept1 or 
Twisthaler in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. The applicant has clarified the same 
device was used for multiple actuations in the current study E2201, as such results with 80 and 320 ug of MF 
delivered by the Concept1/Breezhaler device should deliver comparable results to MF 200 and 800 ug in the 
Twisthaler device. The results suggest that systemic exposure after 80 ug of MF delivered by the 
Concept1/Breezhaler device was lower compared to 200 ug of MF delivered by the Twisthaler device. 
Therefore, asthma patients may receive lower levels of MF in the proposed FDC than the equivalent licenced 
MF Twisthaler. These results are in contrast to the increased efficacy results reported for this study after 80 
ug of MF was delivered with the Concept1 device compared with MF delivered with the Twisthaler device.  
However, further analysis demonstrated that the degree of ICS sensitivity was by chance not evenly 
distributed between treatment groups at randomisation. Re-analysing the PD data to include a covariate of 
ICS sensitivity showed that the difference between the inhalers is reduced at the corresponding dose levels. 
This issue was therefore resolved. 
Overall, there were 4 studies which compared the MF exposure via Concept1 and Twisthaler devices: the two 
bioequivalence studies discussed above, and 2 pivotal phase 3 studies discussed later in this report. A direct 
comparison between all 4 studies comparing the Concept1 and Twisthaler devices is difficult since different 
doses, different populations (healthy volunteer’s v patients), and different assays were used. However, the 
results are not consistent across all device studies. Bioequivalence between MF in Twisthaler and Concept1 
inhalers was demonstrated for study CQMF149E2101 in healthy volunteers and similar results were observed 
for pivotal study CQVM149B2303. In study CQMF149E2201 lower plasma levels were obtained for low dose 
MF in the Concept1 inhaler compared to low dose MF in the Twisthaler device, while in study CQVM149B2301 
higher plasma levels were obtained for MF in the Concept1 compared to MF in the Twisthaler.  
Therefore,  as  the  PK  data  are  not  sufficient  to  determine  the  equivalent  exposure  for  mometasone  in  the 
Concept1 inhaler, safety and efficacy data must be used to determine therapeutic equivalence instead, as per 
the OIP guideline CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1.  
•  Component interaction within the QMF149 FDC 
Study QMF149E2102 was a randomized, open-labeled, four-period complete crossover, DDI study in healthy 
volunteers, evaluating indacaterol and MF delivered in free or in fixed combination (QMF149) via the 
Concept1 device. The PK data for this multiple dose study were collected on day 14 of each period. When 
comparing plasma levels on day 12, 13 and 14, the ratio of adjusted geometric means of 90% CIs for both 
actives substances was contained within the bioequivalence margins of 80 -125%, indicating steady state had 
been reached. While the mean PK parameters (AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss) for both actives substances 
appear higher in the FDC compared to the monotherapy treatments, the ratio of adjusted geometric means of 
90% CIs was contained within the bioequivalence margins of 80 -125% for all pairwise comparisons, with the 
exception of MF FDC versus MF monotherapy where the 90% CI for Cmax was 1.13 to 1.26. As this result is 
only slightly above the threshold of 1.25 for a single comparison, it is agreed that there is no apparent DDI 
between the active components in QMF149. Despite demonstrating comparable systemic exposure, this 
doesn’t definitely rule out potential PD interactions in patients where bronchodilation may enhance lung 
deposition, since bronchodilation may not occur to the same extent in healthy volunteers. Therefore, studies 
in patients are also required to examine pharmacodynamic parameter of the FDC. Such studies have been 
performed and are discussed in this report.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 59/182 
  
  
Genetic polymorphism related variability is not expected to affect MF systemic exposure or have any clinically 
relevant consequences. 
Dose proportionality 
In Study CQMF149E2101, conducting in healthy subjects, mometasone in the Concept1 inhaler illustrated 
dose proportionality for AUC parameters between the doses of 50 ug and 400 ug. In Study CQMF149E1101, 
MF was also shown to be approximately dose proportional between QMF149 150/80 µg and QMF149 
150/320 µg in healthy subjects. Less than dose proportional increase in MF systemic exposure was noted 
following QMF149 administration in patients with asthma, based on simulations using the final popPK model. 
Formal dose proportionality assessments were not performed for indacaterol as only one dose was used for 
the monocomponent (i.e. 150 μg for indacaterol). This is accepted by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Indacaterol plasma concentrations were similar across all 3 pivotal efficacy trials (CQVM149B2301, 
CQVM149B2302 and CQVM149B2303). 
PK sub-studies comparing the different inhalation devices were also performed for pivotal studies 
CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2303. Results from CQVM149B2301 indicate that 160 ug of MF in Concept1 
results in higher plasma concentrations than 400 ug of MF in the Twisthaler device. Results from 
CQVM149B2303 indicate that 80 ug of MF in Concept1 results in similar plasma concentrations to 200 ug of 
MF in the Twisthaler device. 
The pivotal efficacy study CQVM149B2302 did not involve MF in the Twisthaler device, only MF in the 
Concept1 device. Results indicated a difference in plasma levels between MF in the double therapy compared 
to the triple therapy. Comparable doses between the double and triple therapy were supposed to be 320 ug 
QMF149 and 160 ug QVM149, and 160 ug QMF149 and 80 ug QVM149. However, the MF in the triple therapy 
QVM149 resulted in higher plasma concentrations compared to the ‘equivalent’ doses in the double therapy 
QMF149 (e.g. at day 30, the MF high dose of QVM149 resulted in a Ctrough of 146 pg/mL, while for QMF149 
it was 118 pg/mL). Upon request by CHMP, the applicant clarified that mean simulated AUC0-24h,ss values 
were the same between QVM149 and QMF149 for the corresponding treatments at the medium and high ICS 
dose levels. Similarly, simulated Ctrough,ss was also comparable between QVM149 and QMF149 for the 
corresponding treatments. Further, based on the Pop PK model, simulated median MF Cmax values are 
predicted to be 22% larger for QVM149 compared to the corresponding dose of QMF149. These differences 
are small and not considered to be clinically relevant in view of: (i) observed clinical safety in patients, (ii) 
available safety data at total daily doses up to 1600 μg for MF administered via the Twisthaler device in 
asthma patients and (iii) overall high variability. Factors contributing to the high variability include sparse PK 
sampling scheme, batch-to-batch variability in FPM for the products and, importantly, unexplained between 
subject variability. Overall, plasma MF PK is considered to be comparable between QVM149 and QMF149 at 
the corresponding ICS dose levels. Minor differences noted for Cmax,ss are not clinically relevant in the 
context of the wide exposure range noted in the Phase 3 studies. This was accepted by CHMP. 
CQMF149E2203 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week treatment, parallel-group 
study to assess the efficacy, safety and PK of indacaterol acetate (75 and 150 µg o.d.) in patients with 
persistent asthma. 24 hour PK data was presented for a sub-set of patients, while sparse sampling data and 
Ctrough measurements were presented for all patients. For the 24 hour PK data, results indicate an 
approximate doubling of plasma concentrations at day 14 between 75 and 150 ug. Since a large percentage 
of samples were excluded due to plasma levels below LLOQ or due to high pre-dose levels; the applicant was 
requested to perform a sensitivity analysis to include subjects with high pre-dose samples. Summary

statistics of PK concentrations and PK parameters (AUClast, Cmax) derived for the sensitivity analysis showed 
higher variability and did not impact the overall assessment that an approximately dose dependent increase 
in systemic exposure was observed for the indacaterol acetate 150 μg dose group vs. the indacaterol acetate 
75 μg dose group on Day 1 and Day 14. The summary statistics for indacaterol PK parameters from the 
original analysis and from a sensitivity analysis including high pre-dose samples, are presented in Table 16. 
Table 16 Study CQMF149E2203: Summary of plasma indacaterol PK parameters 
Overall the trend in the results remain the same. This is issue is considered to be resolved and was not 
pursued further. 
Special populations 
•  Renal impairment 
Based on the information for monotherapy components, no significant differences in indacaterol and MF PK 
are expected in patients with renal impairment treated with the FDC. The recommendations in the proposed 
SmPC are considered adequate i.e. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
•  Hepatic impairment 
The findings for the monotherapy components of hepatically impaired subjects/patients are considered valid 
for QMF149. The proposed SmPC section 4.2 for QMF149 states “No dose adjustment is required in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available for the use of Bemrist Breezhaler in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment, therefore Bemrist Breezhaler should be used in these patients only if the 
expected benefit outweighs the potential risk” which is acceptable.  
•  Gender 
Based on the popPK analysis, there was no relevant effect of gender on the PK of either indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium or MF following QVM149 administration. 
•  Race

Study QMF149E1101 was an open-label, randomized, multiple dose, two-treatment, two period, complete 
cross-over study to assess PK of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate in Japanese and Caucasian 
healthy subjects following multiple inhaled doses of QMF149 via Concept1. The PK data for this multiple dose 
study was collected on day 14 of each period. When comparing plasma levels on day 12, 13 and 14, the ratio 
of adjusted geometric means 90% CIs for both actives were contained within the bioequivalence margins of 
80 -125%, indicating steady state had been reached. This is also in agreement with the Hirobriz Breezhaler 
SmPC, which indicates that steady state with Indacaterol is reached within 12 to 14 days. Results 
demonstrated that 90% CI for AUC and Cmax values for indacaterol were higher for Japanese subjects 
compared to Caucasian subjects by approximately 20% for both day 1 and day 14 data and for both 
concentrations 80 and 320 ug. As a result none of the 90% CI for any pairwise comparison was contained 
within the standard bioequivalence limits of 80-125%. As an example, for AUC0-24h,ss with 320ug MF, the 
upper limit of the 90% CI reached 1.45. Similar results were observed for mometasone.  
In  the  popPK  analysis,  the  effect  of  race  on  indacaterol  PK  following  inhalation  of  QMF149  or  QVM149  in 
patients with asthma was negligible for AUC0-24 and relatively small in magnitude for Cmax in a patient with 
a body weight of 75 kg. It is agreed that this effect is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Race was not found 
to be a statistically significant covariate on MF PK. 
•  Body weight 
Based on the popPK analyses, the effect of body weight on both indacaterol and MF PK following inhalation of 
QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma was relatively small in magnitude. It is agreed that this effect is 
unlikely to be of clinically relevance for both of these compounds. 
•  Elderly 
In the popPk analyses, age was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for either indacaterol or MF 
PK. The following text is proposed to be added in the SmPC: “No dose adjustment is required in elderly 
patients (65 years of age or older)”.  
Only 2 patients 75-84 years of age were included in the phase III studies. While higher values of 
mometasone furoate Cmax were shown in patients 65-74 years of age, compared to younger patients; 
mometasone furoate Cmax was significantly lower in 75-84 years of age, compared to younger patients. 
However, based on the knowledge on individual components in the post-marketing settings, despite a limited 
number of included elderly patients, it can be concluded that no clinically relevant differences in efficacy and 
safety should be expected. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Table 17 Number of elderly patients who participated in PK sub-studies 
Assessment report

•  Children 
QMF149 has not been evaluated in patients <12 years of age. This is acceptable since QMF149 is indicated 
for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. The PK of QMF149 appears similar 
between adolescents and adults. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary.  
Interactions 
No new data on in vitro or in vivo drug interactions of indacaterol and mometasone furoate were provided. 
This is acceptable in this type of application. Studies of indacaterol and mometasone furoate have been 
previously submitted to support the approval of products already on the market. 
As the co-administration of QMF149 with other long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABAs) and long acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMAs) has not been studied, the following information has been included in section 
4.5 of the SmPC:  
“Other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists 
The co-administration of Bemrist Breezhaler with other medicinal products containing long-acting beta2-
adrenergic agonists has not been studied and is not recommended as it may potentiate adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.8 and 4.9).” 
Pharmacodynamics 
The PD profile of QMF149 was characterised in study CQVM149B2209 and pivotal studies CQVM149B2301, 
and CQVM149B2302. Complete results and discussion of these studies are provided in the Clinical Efficacy 
section. No studies of the secondary pharmacology effects of QMF149 or any of its constituents were 
conducted. However, the components are well known and have been previously investigated. Additionally, no 
studies of pharmacodynamic interactions with QMF149 were conducted which is acceptable by CHMP. The 
proposed SmPC provides adequate information regarding potential interactions, based on approved products 
containing one or more of these components. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of indacaterol and mometasone with QMF149 have 
been sufficiently characterised to support this application for the treatment of asthma. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Three dose strengths of QMF149 are proposed in this application; the strengths differ in the dose of MF. The 
doses of the individual components of the FDC are based on the approved doses of monotherapy products. Of 
note, there was some adjustments in the doses as discussed in the PK section. The applicant submitted 4 
studies in asthma patients to support dose selection for the monotherapy components in the double 
combination QMF149. These studies are presented briefly below and in the discussion on clinical efficacy and 
focus on primary and secondary efficacy.  
Mometasone studies to support dose selection for the Concept 1 device 
The applicant has developed their double (LABA/ICS) combination using the Concept 1 device. The MF 
Twisthaler and MF Concept1 differ with regards to the inhalation device and the formulations delivered. The

applicant used a 3-step bridging approach to identify doses of MF via the Concept1 device that were 
comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device. 
In this 3-step MF bridging approach, the step 1 consisted in results of MF PK study CQMF149E2101, the 
application of in-vitro data correlations was performed as step 2 and the study CQMF149E2201 was the step 
3 of the bridging strategy. The overall aim was to support the selection of low, mid and high dose MF 
Concept1 doses to be combined with indacaterol acetate in the QMF149 FDC for the Phase III asthma 
programme.  
Study CQMF149E2201  
A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-week treatment, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of two doses of mometasone furoate delivered via Concept1 or Twisthaler 
in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma 
Study participants A total of 739 patients were randomized and 735 included in the FAS. 
Primary objectives and primary endpoint 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with MF 80 μg and 320 
μg od via Concept1 to MF 200 μg and 800 μg od via Twisthaler in terms of 24 h post-dose trough FEV1 after 
4 weeks of treatment. 
Primary efficacy results 
Primary endpoint: Trough FEV1 at 4 weeks 
Table 18  
The study met its primary endpoints and was consistent on secondary endpoints. For the primary efficacy 
endpoint, the difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 80 μg in Concept1 and MF 200 μg in 
Twisthaler groups was 68 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of 0 mL.  
The difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 320 μg in Concept1 and MF 800 μg in 
Twisthaler groups was 25 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of -42.7 mL.

Overall the study demonstrated non-inferiority based on the primary efficacy endpoint for MF delivered via 
the Concept1 device compared to the previously approved MF doses in the Twisthaler and therefore supports 
the dose range used in the pivotal studies.

doses of indacaterol maleate (27.5 μg b.i.d., 37.5 μg o.d., 55 μg o.d., 75 μg o.d., and 150 μg o.d.) versus 
placebo on FEV1 AUC(0-24h) in patients with asthma. 
Key secondary endpoint Trough FEV1 
Study CQAB149B2357: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, parallel-
group study to assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of indacaterol in adult patients 
with persistent asthma, using salmeterol as an active control 
Study participants A total of 511 patients were randomized and 483 completed the study. 
Primary objectives and primary endpoint 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the dose response relationship among four doses of 
indacaterol (18.75, 37.5, 75, and 150 μg o.d.), placebo and salmeterol 50 μg twice a day (b.i.d.) as 
measured by trough FEV1 at day 15.  
Primary efficacy results 
Study CQMF149E2203 met its primary endpoint.  Both 75 μg and 150 μg indacaterol acetate groups 
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in trough FEV1 at 12 weeks compared with placebo 
(0.106L and 0.080L) There was a numerically greater improvement in the indacaterol acetate 150 μg group 
compared with the indacaterol acetate 75 μg group.  
Study QVA149A2210 met its primary endpoint. After one day of treatment, all 5 indacaterol maleate 
treatments showed a clinically meaningful effect throughout the 24-hours compared to placebo. Estimated 
treatment differences of change from period baseline in FEV1 AUC(0-24h) for indacaterol 37.5 μg o.d. 
(0.09L), 75 μg o.d. (0.137L) and 150 μg o.d. (0.183L) treatments were statistically significant compared to 
placebo. A dose-ordered response was demonstrated.  
For the secondary endpoint, change from baseline in trough FEV1, all 5 indacaterol treatments showed a 
statistically significant change from period baseline in trough FEV1 compared to placebo, with clinically 
important difference in the 150 mg dose. 
Study CQAB149B2357  
The primary endpoint of Trough FEV1 day 15 reflects the 14-day time to reach PK steady state.  The 
applicant chose 0.2L (Pellegrino 20050 as a pre-specified MCID for a treatment difference against placebo. 
The greatest treatment difference between an active treatment group (indacaterol or salmeterol) and the 
placebo group was achieved in the indacaterol 75 μg treatment group (0.17 L). The treatment differences 
compared with the placebo group were the same in the indacaterol 150 μg and salmeterol treatment groups 
(both 0.13 L). The smallest treatment differences compared with the placebo group were observed in the 
indacaterol 18.75 and 37.5 μg treatment groups (both 0.10 L). 
Indacaterol salt bridging studies to support the acetate formulation for the Concept 1 device 
Indacaterol is approved for use in COPD in the maleate salt form. The applicant used the acetate salt form in 
the development of QVM149 and performed two studies (CQVM149B2203 and CQAB149D2301) to 
demonstrate comparable efficacy between the maleate and acetate salts.

In study CQVM149B2203 both indacaterol salts showed significant and clinically relevant improvements in 
trough FEV1 at day 14 compared to placebo (0.186L and 0.146L). The treatment difference between the 
maleate and acetate was 0.04L.  
In study CQAB149D2301 all three indacaterol salt treatments demonstrated a clinically relevant increase in 
trough FEV1 at day 7 compared to placebo and the differences between each form (acetate, maleate, 
xinofoate) were close to zero.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two pivotal Phase III controlled studies [Study 2301 and Study 2303] were conducted to demonstrate the 
efficacy of QMF149 in either low 150/80 μg o.d., medium QMF149 150/160 μg o.d., or high QMF149 150/320 
μg o.d. doses compared to their corresponding MF doses. The objective of these studies was to establish the 
contribution of indacaterol in a FDC (QMF149) compared with MF monotherapy. Phase III study, 
CQVM149B2302, contains QMF149 as an active comparator and provides supportive efficacy data. 
2.5.2.1.  Study CQVM149B2303 
Title of Study: 
A multi-centre, randomized, 12-week treatment, double blind study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
QMF149 (150/80 μg) compared with mometasone furoate (MF) Twisthaler (200 μg) in adult and adolescent 
patients with asthma. 
Methods 
Study design 
This study used a 12-week treatment, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design. The 
12-week treatment epoch was followed by a 30-day Follow-up epoch. All patients were required to be on a 
stable dose of low ICS (with or without LABA) for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1. 
At the Run-in epoch (Visit 101), all patients received an open-label fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. 
delivered via Accuhaler. 
At Visit 1 (Screening), all patients were given salbutamol/albuterol to use as rescue medication throughout 
the study. 
Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at Visit 102 were randomized to one of the following two treatment 
groups with an equal (1:1) randomization ratio: 
•  QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 
•  MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler 
Randomized patients were required to have FEV1 between 60% and < 90% of predicted normal at both Visit 
101 and Visit 102 and they must have qualified for treatment with low dose ICS plus LABA as per GINA 2016 
guidelines.

Figure 3 Study design, study B2303 
The aim of this study was to assess benefits of the addition of a LABA in a fixed dose combination with low 
dose ICS as compared to low dose ICS monotherapy. During the run-in period all patients received low dose 
of ICS e.g. fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler. During the treatment period patients 
were randomised to either QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 or MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via 
Twisthaler. This study utilised the double-dummy design therefore in addition to active treatment in the 
QMF149 group patients received placebo delivered as powder via Twisthaler whereas in the compactor group 
patients received placebo delivered as powder in capsules via Concept1.

o 
If taking low dose ICS / LABA, patients were included only if ACQ-7 score ≥ 1 and < 1.5 at 
Visit 101 (i.e., adequately controlled). However, ACQ-7 score was required to be ≥ 1.5 at 
Visit 102, directly prior to randomization. 
Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 60% and < 90% of the predicted normal value for the patient according to 
ATS/ERS criteria after withholding bronchodilators at both Visit 101 and Visit 102.

If reversibility was not demonstrated at Visit 101: 
o  Reversibility was first repeated once. 
• 
• 
• 
o 
 If the retest showed no reversibility, patients were permitted to enter the study with 
documented historical evidence of reversibility that was performed according to ATS/ERS 
guidelines within 2 years prior to Visit 1. Alternatively, patients were permitted to enter the 
study with a historical positive broncho-provocation test that was performed within 2 years 
prior to Visit 1. 
Main exclusion criteria:

delivered via Concept1 (in the evening) 
The low dose fluticasone propionate (100 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler or 125 μg b.i.d via MDI) were used during 
the Run-in epoch.  
Concomitant treatment 
At Visit 1 (Screening) patients were provided with SABA (salbutamol/albuterol) inhaler to use as a rescue 
medication throughout the study.  
Intra-nasal corticosteroids and topical corticosteroids for the treatment of eczema were allowed provided that 
the dose was stabilized for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Parenteral or oral corticosteroids were not 
allowed unless used for the treatment of asthma exacerbations. Medications with potential to significantly 
prolong the QT interval were not allowed.

Outcomes/endpoints 
In general, baseline was defined as the last measurement before the first dose of study treatment at the 
evening of Day 1. 
Primary endpoint - trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/80 μg to MF 200 μg delivered via 
Twisthaler in terms of trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the two FEV1 measurements taken 23 hr. 15 min and 23 hr. 45 
min post-evening dose. Trough measurements were done at Day 2 and Day 85 (Week 12, the primary 
endpoint). The baseline FEV1 and PEF for the treatment epoch is taken at treatment Day 1. 
Key secondary endpoint - ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment  
The ACQ-7 measured asthma symptom control and consisted of seven items: five on symptom assessment, 
one on rescue bronchodilator use and one on airway calibre (FEV1 % predicted). Patient recall was one week. 
Other secondary endpoints: 
Lung function parameters – spirometry  
• 
• 
• 
Trough FEV1 at Day 2 of treatment period (defined as the mean of 23 hours 15 min and 23 hours 45 
min FEV1 values post dose of Day 1) 
Pre-dose  FEV1  (defined  as  the  mean  of  −45  min  and  −15  min  FEV1  values  pre-evening  dose)  at  4 
weeks

75) over 12 weeks 
Morning and Evening Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) over 4 and 12 weeks 
All the patients were instructed to record PEF twice daily using an electronic PEF meter, once in the morning 
and once approximately 12 hours later in the evening (prior to evening dose), from Run in Visit 101 and 
throughout the study. PEF (liters/min) was averaged separately for morning and evening values with means 
over the 12 weeks treatment phase and the 3 weeks baseline Run-in phase. Mean morning/evening PEF over 
12 weeks of treatment phase was summarized by treatment. 
Percent of patients achieving the minimal important difference (MID) in ACQ-7 
Percentage  of  asthma  symptoms  free  days,  the  percentage  of  nights  without  night-time 
awakenings,  and  the  percentage  of  mornings  without  symptoms  on  awakening  as  recorded  by 
daily electronic Diary (eDiary) over 12 weeks of treatment 
The night-time symptom score consisted of one question 'How did you sleep last night?' which has to be 
answered with scores from 0 to up to 4. The morning score consisted of the question 'Did you have asthma 
symptoms upon awakening in the morning?' There are 5 questions including the today's severity of shortness 
of breath, wheeze, cough, and chest tightness during the past 12 hours, and 'Did your respiratory symptoms 
stop you from performing your usual daily activities?' which are part of the daytime symptom score.

Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) 
AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that were most 
important to patients with asthma, with a recall time of two weeks and each question to be answered on a 7-
point scale. 
Exacerbations 
All analyses were based on data as reported on the "Asthma Exacerbation Episodes" eCRF. The analysis was 
performed by exacerbation categories: all (mild, moderate, severe), and the combination of moderate or 
severe. The results on Time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category and the annual rate of 
asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category were presented.  
A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as an aggravation of asthma symptoms (like shortness of breath, 
cough, wheezing, or chest tightness) that requires systemic corticosteroids (SCS) for at least three 
consecutive days and/or a need for an ER visit (or local equivalent structure), hospitalization due to asthma 
or death due to asthma. 
A moderate asthma exacerbation was defined as the occurrence of 2 or more of the following: 
• 
Progressive  increase  of  at  least  one  of  the  asthma  symptoms  like  shortness  of  breath,  cough, 
wheezing,  or  chest  tightness.  The  symptoms  should  have  been  outside  the  patient’s  usual  range  of 
day-to-day asthma and should last at least 2 consecutive days. 
• 
Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators 
•  Deterioration in lung function, which last for 2 days or more but usually not severe enough to warrant 
systemic corticosteroids for more than 2 days or hospitalization 
A mild asthma exacerbation was defined as the occurrence of one of the following criteria: 
• 
 Deterioration  of  at  least  one  asthma  symptoms  like  shortness  of  breath,  cough,  wheezing  or  chest 
tightness. 
• 
Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators  
•  Deterioration in lung function, which last for 2 days or more but usually not severe enough to warrant 
systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization. This deterioration was defined by: 
• 
20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline value Or 
•  ≥  20%  decrease  in  am  or  pm  PEF  from  baseline  on  2  out  of  any  3  consecutive  days  compared  to 
baseline 
•  < 60% of PEF compared to baseline 
“Start and end dates” of each reported event 
If a second exacerbation was reported less than 7 days after the end date of a previous episode, then this 
was assumed to be one continuous exacerbation with the start date taken from the first episode and the end 
date from the second or last episode. If 2 events were merged based on this “7-day rule”, the highest 
reported severity was used to describe the overall severity of the prolonged event. 
Sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 72/182 
  
  
 
The initial sample size calculation for the CQVM149B2301 study was updated in Protocol Amendment 2 
(dated 20 MAR 2018). The sample size calculation took into account the following considerations: 
- 
- 
To achieve at least 90% power for the primary endpoint trough FEV1 with a treatment difference of 
100 mL between QMF149 vs MF, assuming a standard deviation of 380 mL based on internal QMF149 
studies (A2210, E2201, E2203) and literature data, where the most observed treatment effects 
ranged approximately 80 mL to 120 mL. 
To achieve at least 75% power (with multiplicity adjustment) for the secondary endpoint ACQ-7 with 
a treatment difference of −0.18 between QMF149 vs MF, assuming a standard deviation of 0.80 
based on QMF149 study (A2210), where observed treatment difference was −0.21 with 95% CI 
(−0.28, −0.15) 
If 10% dropout rate was assumed, then calculation showed that the sample size of 750 patients (i.e. 
375/group) was expected to provide approximately 93% power for item 1 and 77% power for item 2 with 
multiplicity adjustment. 
The sample size calculation was performed in PASS software. 
Randomisation 
At Visit 201, all eligible patients were randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the 
treatment groups. Randomization was stratified by factors of age (≥ 12 to < 18 years or ≥ 18) and by region. 
Blinding (masking)  
This study had the double-dummy design using the following placebos.  
• 
• 
Placebo delivered as powder via Twisthaler (in the evening) 
Placebo delivered as powder in capsules via Concept1 (in the evening) 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses were conducted according to Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment 2.  
Analysis Sets 
The randomized (RAN) set consisted of all patients who were assigned a randomization number, regardless of 
whether or not they actually received study medication. Patients in RAN were to be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were randomized to. The RAN set was used for summary of patient disposition, demographics 
and baseline characteristics. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients in the RAN set who received at least one dose of study 
medication. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were to be analyzed according to the treatment 
they were assigned to at randomization. The FAS was used in the analysis of all efficacy variables. 
The Per-Protocol set (PPS) included all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol deviations. 
Major protocol deviations were/will be defined in the validation analysis plan prior to database lock and the 
un-blinding of the study. Patients were to be analysed according to the treatment they received. The PPS was 
used for supportive analysis of the primary analysis only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 73/182 
  
  
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication including non-
randomized patients who received study drug in error. Patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment they received. The safety set was used in the analysis of all safety variables. 
The PK profiling subset included all randomized patients who consented to participate in the additional PK 
analysis and had at least one PK measurement. Patients were analysed according to the treatment they 
received. 
Statistical hypotheses for primary endpoint 
The comparison of QMF149 150/80 μg versus MF 200 μg delivered via Twisthaler were evaluated by testing 
the following null hypothesis (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha): 
H0: QMF149 treatment group is equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 12 
Ha: QMF149 treatment group is not equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 12 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Trough FEV1 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the FAS.  
The following (mixed model repeated measures) MMRM ANCOVA was used for trough FEV1, ACQ-7 and other 
data (if not stated otherwise): 
Dependent variable = intercept + treatment + region + baseline value + FEV1 prior to inhalation + FEV1 15 
to 30 min post inhalation + visit + treatment*visit + baseline value*visit + random 
effect of center nested within region + error 
The within-patient correlation was modelled using an unstructured covariance matrix in the mixed model. The 
Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom (Kenward and Roger, 
1997). 
Results were presented with least square mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) for treatment effects and LSM, 
SE, associated two-sided 95% confidence interval, and two-sided p-value for the treatment contrast. 
Sensitivity analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Trough FEV1 
As a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of missing data, a tipping point analysis was performed for 
the primary endpoint trough FEV1 at Week 12. The delta-adjusting approach described in Ratitch et al (2013) 
was used to find the tipping point, in a spectrum of conservative missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions, 
at which conclusions change from being favorable to QMF149 to being unfavorable.  
The same MMRM used in the primary analysis in the FAS was also performed on the PPS as a supportive 
analysis. 
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy endpoint – ACQ-7 
The key secondary variable is ACQ-7 after 26 weeks of treatment. 
This was analyzed using the same MMRM model (including all available visits) on the FAS as used for the 
primary analysis but includes baseline ACQ-7 score instead of baseline FEV1. 
The proportions of patients who achieved a clinically relevant improvement in ACQ-7 score (i.e., decrease of 
ACQ-7 score of at least 0.5 from baseline) at the scheduled post-baseline visits was analyzed using a logistic 
regression GEE model following multiple imputation of missing ACQ-7 values under MAR.

Analysis of Other Secondary Efficacy endpoints – Asthma Exacerbations 
The following asthma exacerbation-related parameters were summarized considering the whole 12 weeks of 
double-blind treatment. The analyses were performed by exacerbation categories: all (mild, moderate, 
severe), and the combination of moderate or severe. 
-Time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category  
-The annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category In patients with multiple exacerbations, if 
the start date of an exacerbation was less than 7 days after the end date of a previous episode, then this was 
assumed to be one continuous exacerbation with the start date taken from the first episode and the end date 
from the second or last episode. The worst severity of these episodes was taken as the severity of the 
collapsed exacerbation. Collapsing of exacerbation episodes was only be done for efficacy analyses but not 
for safety analyses of AEs which includes asthma exacerbations. 
-Asthma exacerbations starting after the first dose and not later than one day after the date of last dose was 
included in the analyses of efficacy. 
-Time-to-event variables was analyzed using a Cox regression model stratified by age (12 to 17 or ≥ 18 
years). The model included treatment, region and history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to 
screening (Yes, No) as fixed-effect factors, and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 within 15 to 30 min post 
inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA reversibility) as covariates. The estimated adjusted 
hazard ratio for QMF149 over MF was displayed along with the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval 
and corresponding p-value. Kaplan-Meier analysis stratified by treatment group was also presented and 
displayed graphically. Patients without any asthma exacerbation was censored at the earliest date of (last 
dose of study treatment + 1, death, last visit). 
-The annual rate of asthma exacerbations were analyzed using a generalized linear model assuming the 
negative binomial distribution including treatment, age (12 to 17 or ≥ 18), and region and history of asthma 
exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No) as fixed-effect factors, and FEV1 prior to 
inhalation and FEV1 within 15 to 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA 
reversibility) as covariates. The time at risk for a patient was defined as the duration of exposure in days + 1 
day and the log(time at risk in years) was used as the offset variable in the model. The estimated rate ratio 
along with two-sided95% interval and corresponding p-value will be provided. 
Subgroup analysis 
At week 12, the following subgroups were used for supporting analyses of primary endpoint trough FEV1: 
•  Age group (12 to 17 years, ≥ 18 years) 
•  Race (Caucasian, Asian, Black and other) 
•  Gender (male, female) 
•  History of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No) 
•  Patients’  prior  therapies  before  run-in  period  (e.g.  low  dose  ICS  without  LABA,  low  dose  ICS  with 
LABA) 
•  FEV1 response according to % predicted FEV1 range at baseline (60 % to < 70%, 70% to < 90%) 
•  ACQ-7 at baseline (1.5 to < 2, 2 to < 2.5, ≥ 2.5)

Multiplicity adjustment 
For multiplicity adjustment, a hierarchical testing procedure was applied to control the type-I error rate for 
the primary and the key secondary endpoints, i.e., the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 was tested only if the 
primary endpoint (trough FEV1) was significant at the 2-sided 0.05 level. 
Interim analysis 
No interim analysis was pre-specified in the study protocol.  
Protocol Amendment 2 provided for a reduction in the sample size from 1000 to approximately 750 patients 
based on evaluation of treatment differences for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 in study A2210. 
Deviations from the pre-specified statistical analysis plan in the CSR 
For the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), all the analyses described for ACQ-7 were included for ACQ-5. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A total of 1362 patients were screened, of which 802 patients were randomized to receive QMF149 150/80 μg 
o.d. delivered via Concept1 (n=398) or MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler (n=404). 
A total of 777 (96.9%) patients completed the planned treatment phase, including those who discontinued 
the treatment but remained in the treatment phase. The overall proportion of patients who prematurely 
discontinued the treatment phase was low and was lower in the QMF149 treatment group than the MF 
treatment group. The primary reasons for premature discontinuation of the treatment phase were AEs 
(1.1%) and protocol deviations (0.9%).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviation  
A total of 74 (9.2%) patients were excluded from the PPS due to major deviations, which were generally 
balanced across the 2 treatment groups. The most common major protocol deviation category was “selection 
criteria not met”, reported in 47 (5.9%) patients. Overall, 1 (0.1%) patient was excluded from the FAS due 
to a major protocol deviation of “patient randomized more than once in this study or randomized in another 
study”. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
The mean age was 45.6 years with 13.5% of the randomized patients aged 65 years or older. This study also 
included 64 (8.0%) adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years old). The majority of randomized patients 
were Caucasian (65.7%) and there were more females (60.8%). Approximately, 25% of patients were Asian. 
Baseline disease characteristics 
The asthma disease characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The mean (SD) 
duration of asthma in all patients was 14.0 (12.83) years with > 50% patients having > 10 years duration of 
asthma. In the 12 months prior to screening, the majority of patients (80.2%) had no asthma exacerbations 
that required treatment. The mean (SD) of ACQ-7 score was 2.27 (0.393) at baseline. The majority of 
patients (86.7%) had never smoked and were treated with ICS low dose (42.9%) or LABA/ICS low dose 
(56.0%) prior to the study. 
Prior asthma treatment  
72.8% patients were on SABA, 70.4% on corticosteroids (69.2% on ICS) and 60.9% were receiving 
LABA/ICS (inhalational). Other asthma related medications (in >3% of patients) included leukotriene 
modifiers (11.3%), LABA (3.9%), antibiotics (3.4%), xanthines (3.3%) and antihistamines (3.3%). 
Concomitant therapy 
Concomitant asthma medications were used by 8.6% patients on QMF149 group and 9.3% patient on the MF 
group during the study including corticosteroids (2.5% vs. 5.5%), antihistamines (4.8% vs. 3.8%) and 
antibiotics (0.8% vs. 1.8%). Other concomitant asthma medications used by < 1% patients in QMF149 and 
MF groups respectively, were leukotriene modifier (0.5% each), SABA (0.5% each), xanthine (0.5% each) 
and LABA/ICS (0.3% each).

Table 20: Analysis sets (screened patients set) 
Screening spirometry and reversibility test 
The majority of the patients (99%) had pre-bronchodilator FEV1 60% to < 90% of the predicted normal 
value at Visit 101. Mean FEV1 pre-bronchodilator (% predicted FEV1) showing eligibility was 73.3% at the 
start of Run-in visit (Visit 101) and 75.1% at the end of Run-in visit (Visit 102). The mean FEV1 reversibility 
after inhalation of SABA was 20.7% with a mean increase in FEV1 of 0.456 L. Overall, 87% of patients 
demonstrated reversibility at Visit 101. The study also allowed patients with documented historical 
reversibility/bronchoprovocation within 2 years prior to the study, if the patient failed to demonstrate 
reversibility at Visit 101. Approximately, 10.5% patients were included based on this historical reversibility 
and 1.5% patients were included based on positive bronchoprovocation. 
Medical history and current medical conditions 
42.8% of enrolled patients had a history of rhinitis allergic. 
Outcomes and estimation 
1.  Primary efficacy endpoint - trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment (FAS) 
The primary efficacy objective of the study was met, with once-daily QMF149 150/80 μg demonstrating 
superiority to MF 200 μg delivered via Twisthaler in terms of trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment in 
(adult and adolescent) patients with asthma. The LS mean treatment difference (for QMF149 – MF) in trough 
FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 12) was 0.182 L (95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p < 0.001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 79/182 
  
  
 
 
Supportive analyses 
•  The per-protocol set 
The results in the PPS at Week 12 were consistent with the primary analysis results in the FAS. The LS means 
treatment difference for trough FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 12) was 0.169 L (95% CI: 0.134, 0.204; p < 0.001) in 
favor of QMF149, which was clinically meaningful. 
Sensitivity analysis 
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary endpoint to evaluate the impact of a deviation from the 
missing at random (MAR) assumption of missing data for trough FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 12). The tipping point 
(for comparison vs MF) occurred with a delta of 2.70 L. This implied that the average of the Day 85 trough 
FEV1 values among patients from the QMF149 treatment group with a missing Day 85 measurement would 
need to be 2.70 L lower than that of the average for the QMF149 treatment completers in order for the study 
conclusion to be reversed. 
2.  Key secondary efficacy results-ACQ-7 score after 12 weeks of treatment 
The key secondary objective of the study was met with QMF149 demonstrating superiority to MF in terms of 
ACQ-7 scores after 12 weeks of treatment in (adult and adolescent) patients with asthma. The LS mean 
treatment difference (for QMF149 – MF) in ACQ-7 score at Day 85 (Week 12) was statistically significant 
(−0.218, 95% CI: −0.293, −0.143) 
Table 21: Confirmatory testing procedure for primary and key secondary endpoints (Full 
analysis set) 
Other secondary endpoints  
Trough FEV1(by visit), pre-dose FEV1, post dose FEV1, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow were investigated 
as secondary endpoints.  
The difference between the QMF149 150/80 arm and comparator was seen as early as at day 2.  The LS 
mean treatment difference (QMF149 versus MF 200) in the change from baseline for the morning PEF was 
27.2 L/min, and for the evening PEF was 26.1 L/min.  
The proposition of ACQ-7 responders (patients achieved an improvement of at least 0.5 units in the ACQ-7 
score) was higher in the QMF149 group (74.7% at week 12) as compared to MF 200 group (64.9% at week 
12) and the difference was statistically (nominally) significant.   
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 80/182 
  
  
 
 
Rescue medications (salbutamol 100 μg or albuterol 90 μg via MDI) were used less frequently in patients 
receiving treatment with QMF149 as compared to those on MF200. The treatment differences for the mean 
daily number of puffs of rescue medication was 0.26 (95% CI: −0.37, −0.14).  
Asthma exacerbations 
The proportion of patients with all (mild, moderate or severe) asthma exacerbations was lower in the 
QMF149 group (5.1%) compared with the MF group (15.0%), including a lower proportion of each type of 
exacerbation in the QMF149 group compared with the MF group. The rate of moderate to severe 
exacerbations was 75% lower in the QMF149 group compared to the MF group (Rate ratio: 0.25, 95% CI: 
0.12, 0.52). All (mild, moderate, severe) asthma exacerbations were reduced by 70% (Rate ratio: 0.30, 95% 
CI: 0.18, 0.50) in the QMF149 group vs. the MF group. 
The Cox regression analysis of time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category shows that there 
was a lower risk of first asthma exacerbation in patients on QMF149 vs. MF for moderate to severe asthma 
exacerbations (Hazard ratio: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.59), and all asthma exacerbations (Hazard ratio: 0.30, 
95% CI: 0.18, 0.50)

2.5.2.2.  Study CQVM149B2301 
Title of study: 
A multi-centre, randomized, 52-week treatment, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of QMF149 compared with mometasone furoate in patients with asthma. 
Methods 
This study is a 52-week treatment, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group design. The 
primary and key secondary endpoints were evaluated over 26 weeks. 
The study consisted of 4 epochs: Screening Epoch (up to 2 weeks), Run-In Epoch (2 weeks), double-blind 
Treatment Epoch (52 weeks: from randomization to Week 52), and Follow-up Epoch (30 days) 
Screening 
All patients must have used inhaled medium or high dose corticosteroids and/or low dose LABA/ICS for at 
least 3 months and on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1. 
At Visit 1 (Screening), all patients were given salbutamol/albuterol (SABA) to use as rescue medication 
throughout the study. They were issued an electronic diary (eDiary) combined with a Peak Flow (PEF) meter 
(AM3 device) to record asthma symptoms and rescue medication use. 
Run-In Epoch 
At Visit 101, all patients received open-label fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler (if 
not available in a specific country, open-label fluticasone propionate 125 μg b.i.d. via MDI or fluticasone low 
dose equivalent could be used throughout the Run-In epoch and stopped at Visit 102 (end of Run-In epoch). 
Treatment Epoch (Randomization to Week 52) 
The Treatment epoch is the period from randomization (baseline) through Week 52. At the start of the 
Treatment epoch (Visit 102/201), eligible patients were randomized to 1 of the 5 treatment groups with an 
equal (1:1:1:1:1) randomization ratio: 
•  QMF149 150/160 μg delivered via Concept1 o.d. (medium QMF149 dose) 
•  QMF149 150/320 μg delivered via Concept1 o.d. (high QMF149 dose) 
•  MF 400 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler (medium MF dose) 
•  MF 800 μg (as 400 μg b.i.d.) delivered via Twisthaler (high MF dose) 
•  Salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler (Seretide) 
Follow-up epoch 
Patients who prematurely discontinued the Treatment Epoch entered the safety Follow-up Epoch. A final 
telephone contact was to be/must be conducted at 30-days after last treatment date (telephone visit 301 or 
unscheduled visit safety call for patients who discontinue treatment earlier than 52 weeks).

Figure 4: Study design, study B2301 
The aim of study 2301 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of medium (QMF149 150/160 μg o.d.) and 
high (QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.) doses over a 52-week study duration. In this study, patients were 
randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups and received either QMF149 150/160 μg o.d., QMF149 150/320 μg 
o.d., MF 400 μg o.d., MF 800 μg (400 μg b.i.d.) or an active comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone 
propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). The study had a triple-dummy design and each patient received 5 inhalations 
(3 in the evening and 2 in the morning).  
Study participants  
This study enrolled multi-nationally and patients were stratified according to prognostic factors of age (12 to 
17 years or ≥ 18 years) and non-prognostic factor (region) to achieve improved homogeneity within each 
stratum. 
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Male and female adult and adolescent patients aged ≥ 12 years old (or ≥ 18 years old depending 
upon regulatory and/or IRB/IEC/REB approval and/or country participation) and ≤ 75 years.

Concomitant treatment  
Intra-nasal corticosteroids and topical corticosteroids for the treatment of eczema were allowed provided that 
the dose was stabilized for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Parenteral or oral corticosteroids were not 
allowed unless used for the treatment of asthma exacerbations.  Medications with potential to significantly 
prolong the QT interval were not allowed.  
Objectives 
The comparisons of QMF149 150/160 μg versus MF 400 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg versus MF 800 μg are 
evaluated by testing the following null hypothesis (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha): 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 84/182 
  
  
H0: QMF149 treatment group is equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 26 
Ha: QMF149 treatment group is not equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 26 
The primary variable was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) on the FAS. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary objective 
To demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/160 μg delivered via Concept1 o.d. (in the evening) to MF 
400 μg o.d (in the evening) delivered via Twisthaler or QMF149 150/320 μg delivered via Concept1 o.d. (in 
the evening) to MF 800 μg delivered via Twisthaler (delivered as 400 μg b.i.d.) in terms of trough forced 
expiratory volume in one second (trough FEV1) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma. 
Secondary objectives 
The key secondary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 (150/160 and 150/320 μg 
combined) to MF (400 μg and 800 μg combined) in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) after 26 
weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

•  QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared with MF 400 μg b.i.d. delivered via 
Twisthaler 
Note: Out of the following secondary objectives, those evaluated at 52 weeks are treated as exploratory 
(except for asthma exacerbation which is secondary) in CSR I; final results are provided for these objectives 
in CSR II. 
Efficacy was evaluated in terms of: 
• 
• 
• 
Trough FEV1 at Week 52 
Pre-dose FEV1 (defined as the mean of -45 min and -15 min FEV1 values pre-evening dose) at Week 
4 and Week 12 
FEV1, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-
75) over 52 weeks 
•  Morning and evening Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) over 26 and 52 weeks of treatment 
•  Asthma control as assessed by the ACQ-7 at Week 4, Week 12 and Week 52 
• 
Percentage of patients achieving the minimal important difference (MCID) ACQ ≥ 0.5 at Week 26 and 
Week 5 
•  Daily electronic diary (e-Diary) recordings of the percentage of asthma symptom-free days, no day-
time symptoms, the percentage of nights with no night-time awakenings and the percentage of 
mornings with o symptoms on awakening over 52 weeks of treatment 
• 
e-Diary recordings of rescue salbutamol/albuterol usage 
•  Assessment of exacerbations (including the assessment of Time to first asthma exacerbation by 
exacerbation category, Time to first hospitalization for asthma exacerbation, Annual rate of asthma 
exacerbations by exacerbation category).

An additional secondary comparison, QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 vs. salmeterol 
xinafoate/fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. (delivered via the Accuhaler device also known as the 
Diskus device in some countries) for all the listed secondary endpoints above and as follows: 
• 
Trough FEV1 measured after 26 weeks of treatment* 
*Trough  FEV1  tested  for  non-inferiority  versus  salmeterol/fluticasone  50/500  μg  b.i.d.  If  non-inferiority 
criteria was met, then tested for superiority. 
•  Asthma control as assessed by the ACQ-7 after 26 weeks treatment 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation took into account the following considerations: 
• 
• 
To achieve at least 90% power (with multiplicity adjustment) for primary endpoint trough FEV1 with 
a treatment difference of 100 mL between QMF149 vs. MF at the corresponding doses, assuming 
standard deviation of 380 mL based on internal studies QMF149A2210, QMF149E2201, QMF149E2203 
and Kerstjens et al (2012). 
To achieve at least 80% power (with multiplicity adjustment) for key secondary endpoint (ACQ-7) 
with a treatment difference of 0.15 between QMF149 vs. MF based on pooled doses, assuming 
standard deviation of 0.80 based on studies QMF149A2210, QMF149E2201, QMF149E2203 and 
Kerstjens et al (2012). 
If a 10 % dropout rate was assumed, then calculations show the sample size of 2000 patients (i.e. 400/arm) 
provide 94% power for item 1 and 85% power for item 2, with multiplicity adjustment as described in the 
protocol. 
Randomisation 
At Visit 201, all eligible patients were randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the 
treatment arms. Randomization was stratified by factors of age (12 to 17 years or ≥ 18) and region. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study had the triple-dummy design. Each patient received 5 inhalations (3 in the evening and 2 in the 
morning). 
Unblinding for CSR I ‘primary’ analysis 
A limited number of pre-specified members of the program team from the sponsor were unblended in a 
phasic manner for CSR I. The study is ongoing under the management of a separate blinded team, replacing 
pre-specified unblinded team members, who are now responsible for study conduct after the primary analysis 
(at 26 week) until study completion. In order to maintain the integrity of the study data, the blinded team 
members did not have access to any of the unblended data. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses were conducted according to Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment 5.  
Protocol amendment 5 provided for conduct of the primary analysis after the last patient has completed at 
least 26 weeks treatment or prematurely discontinued: 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 86/182 
  
  
In terms of reporting, two separate CSRs were written, primary analysis CSR (CSR I) and the final CSR (CSR 
II). CSR I is based on the primary database freeze (cut-off date: 21 NOV 2018), which includes all patients 
who complete Week 26 (V207) assessments or withdraw from the study. The CSR I included primary and key 
secondary endpoints as well as other pre-specified endpoints at Week 26. The endpoints to be evaluated after 
Week 26 were treated as exploratory. The applicant provided CSR II. 
Protocol Amendment 5 also provided for the following changes: 
•  Revise the key secondary objective to demonstrate the superiority of add-on indacaterol (QAB149) 
150 μg by demonstrating superiority of QMF149 (150/160 and 150/320 μg combined) to MF doses 
(MF, 400 μg and 800 μg combined) in terms of ACQ-7 after 26 weeks of treatment. 
•  Changed the multiple testing strategy to reflect updated key secondary objective. 
•  Reduction in sample size from 2650 to approximately 2000. 
•  Revised targeted number of adolescents from 10% of sample size to approximately 5% (from 265 to 
approximately 100). 
Protocol Amendment 4, dated 09 JUL 2017, included a revision of the sample size (from 2800 to 2650) based 
on the re-estimation of drop-out rate at Week 26 at which time the primary and key secondary objectives are 
evaluated. 
Deviations from the pre-specified statistical analysis plan in the CSR 
The logistic regression analysis for the percentage of patients with at least one asthma exacerbation by 
exacerbation category was removed because of the existence of time to event 
analysis. The percentages were presented in the time to event tables. Similarly, the logistic regression for the 
percentage of patients who permanently discontinued study medication due to asthma exacerbations were 
removed. 
In consideration of the GCP non-compliance at site 2314 in India, a sensitivity analysis was performed by 
assessing for primary, key secondary endpoints and AEs/SAEs both with and without patient data from the 
site in order to evaluate whether the data from this site has an impact on overall results.

The randomized (RAN) set consisted of all patients who were assigned a randomization number, regardless of 
whether or not they actually received study medication. Patients in RAN were to be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were randomized to. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients in the RAN set who received at least one dose of study 
medication. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were to be analyzed according to the treatment 
they were assigned to at randomization. 
The Per-Protocol set (PPS) included all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol deviations. 
Major protocol deviations were/will be defined in the validation analysis plan prior to database lock and the 
un-blinding of the study. Patients were to be analysed according to the treatment they received. 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication including non-
randomized patients who received study drug in error. Patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment they received. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 87/182 
  
  
The FAS was used in the analysis of all efficacy variables. Patients in the RAN set was used for a summary of 
patient disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics. The safety set was used in the analysis of all 
safety variables. The PPS was used for supportive analysis of the primary analysis only. If patients switched 
double-blind treatment during the study, they were counted and analyzed only once according to their initial 
treatment. 
Statistical hypotheses for primary endpoint 
The comparisons of QMF149 150/160 μg versus MF 400 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg versus MF 800 μg are 
evaluated by testing the following null hypothesis (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha): 
H0: QMF149 treatment group is equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 26 
Ha: QMF149 treatment group is not equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV1 at Week 26 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Trough FEV1 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the FAS.  
The following (mixed model repeated measures) MMRM ANCOVA was used for trough FEV1, ACQ-7 and other 
data (if not stated otherwise): 
Dependent variable = intercept + treatment + region + baseline value + FEV1 prior to inhalation + FEV1 15 
to 30 min post inhalation + visit + treatment*visit + baseline value*visit + random effect of center nested 
within region + error 
The within-patient correlation was modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix in the mixed model. The 
Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom (Kenward and Roger, 
1997). 
Results were presented with LSM and standard error (SE) for treatment effects and LSM, SE, associated two-
sided 95% confidence interval, and two-sided p-value for all relevant treatment contrasts. 
The combined effects of QMF149 (150/160 & 150/320 μg) and MF (400 & 800 μg) was derived by weighting 
treatment groups equally. 
Sensitivity analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Trough FEV1 
As a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of missing data, a tipping point analysis was performed for 
the primary endpoint trough FEV1 at Week 26. The delta-adjusting approach described in Ratitch et al (2013) 
was used to find the tipping point, in a spectrum of conservative missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions, 
at which conclusions change from being favorable to QVM149 to being unfavorable. Different delta values 
were possible for QMF149 150/160 μg vs. MF 400 μg and QMF149 150/320 vs MF 800 μg. 
The same MMRM used in the primary analysis in the FAS was also performed on the PPS. 
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy endpoint – ACQ-7 
The key secondary variable is ACQ-7 after 26 weeks of treatment. 
This was analyzed using the same MMRM model (including all available visits) on the FAS as used for the 
primary analysis but includes baseline ACQ-7 score instead of baseline FEV1. 
To demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 (150/160 and 150/320 combined) to MF (400 μg and 800 μg 
combined), the average of following treatment contrasts was computed: 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 88/182 
  
  
-  QMF149 (150/160 μg) vs. MF 400 μg 
-  QMF149 (150/320 μg) vs. MF 800 μg 
Least squares means (95% CI) were presented graphically to assess the interaction between indacaterol and 
dose levels of MF. 
The proportions of patients who achieved a clinically relevant improvement in ACQ-7 score (i.e., decrease of 
ACQ-7 score of at least 0.5 from baseline) at the scheduled post-baseline visits was analyzed using a logistic 
regression GEE model following multiple imputation of missing ACQ-7 values under MAR. 
The combined effects of QMF149 (150/160 & 150/320 μg) and MF (400 & 800 μg) was intended to estimate 
the add-on effect of indacaterol (irrespective of the MF dose). In MF arms, there is a difference between 
effects of medium and high doses on ACQ-7. The same effect is not seen in QMF arms. Because of this 
phenomenon, the applicant stated that results from the pooled analysis should be interpreted with caution. 
Analysis of Other Secondary Efficacy endpoints – Asthma Exacerbations 
The following asthma exacerbation-related parameters over the 52 weeks were summarized by 
treatment. The analysis was performed by exacerbation category wherever specified. The exacerbation 
categories were: All (mild, moderate, severe), and the combination of moderate or severe, and severe. 
•  Time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category 
•  Time to first hospitalization for asthma exacerbation 
•  The annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category 
•  Duration of asthma exacerbations in days by exacerbation category 
•  The percentage of patients with at least 1 asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category 
•  Time to permanent study drug discontinuation due to asthma exacerbation 
•  Total amounts (in doses) of oral corticosteroids used to treat asthma exacerbations 
Time-to-event variables were analyzed using a Cox regression model stratified by age (12 to 17 or ≥ 18). 
The model includes treatment, region and history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening 
(Yes, No) as fixed-effect factors, and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 15 to 30 min post inhalation of 
salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA reversibility) as covariates. The estimated adjusted hazard ratio 
for QMF149 over MF were displayed along with the associated 2-sided 95% CI and corresponding p-value. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis stratified by treatment group was also presented and displayed graphically. 
The annual rate of asthma exacerbations (by exacerbation category) was analyzed using a generalized linear 
model assuming a negative binomial distribution. The model included terms for treatment, age (12 – 17, ≥ 
18 years), region, history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No), FEV1 prior 
to inhalation and FEV1 within 15 to 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol components of SABA 
reversibility). The time at risk for a patient was defined as the duration of exposure in days + 1 day and the 
log (time at risk in years) was used as the offset variable in the model. 
Treatment group ratios of exacerbation rates were presented together with 95% confidence intervals and 
two-sided p-values. The combined effects of QMF149 (150/160 & 150/320 μg) and MF (400 & 800 μg) were 
derived by weighting treatment groups equally. No sensitivity analyses were planned for this endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 89/182 
  
  
The duration of asthma exacerbations (= the sum of days with an exacerbation, summarized by exacerbation 
category) were analyzed for treatment group differences using the van Elteren test stratified for age (12 to 
17, or ≥ 18), region and history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No). 
Subgroup analysis 
The following exploratory subgroup analyses for trough FEV1 at Week 26 using MMRM were performed (using 
the appropriate interaction term in the model and additional covariate as a fixed effect if necessary) for the 
FAS to explore the treatment effect in: 
•  Age group (12 to 17 years, ≥ 18 years) 
•  Race (Caucasian, Asian, Black and other) 
•  Sex (male, female) 
•  History of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No) 
•  Patients’ prior therapies before run-in period (e.g. medium dose ICS, high dose ICS and 
• 
low dose LABA/ICS) 
•  FEV1 response according to % predicted FEV1 range at baseline (50% to < 60%, 60% to 
•  < 85%) 
•  ACQ-7 at baseline (1.5 to < 2, 2 to < 2.5, ≥ 2.5) 
The subgroup analyses for patient's prior therapies before run-in period (medium and high dose ICS/LABA) 
were performed for endpoints ACQ-7 and AQLQ at Week 26. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
To control the family-wise type-I error rate at the two-sided 5% significance level, a multiple testing 
procedure based on the trimmed Simes test as described in Brannath et al (2009) was used. The family for 
the overall type-I error rate control contains three hypotheses: two hypotheses for the primary endpoint 
trough FEV1 and one hypothesis for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7. The two hypotheses for the primary 
endpoint compared QMF149 150/160 μg vs. MF 400 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg vs. MF 800 μg respectively. 
The hypothesis for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 compared QMF149 vs. MF combined doses. 
Other than the 3 treatment comparisons mentioned above for the primary and the key secondary endpoint, 
all other analyses were to be performed at the nominal 2-sided 0.05 level without multiplicity adjustment. 
Interim analysis 
The primary analysis was performed once all patients have completed 26 weeks of treatment (Visit 207) or 
prematurely withdrawn from the study. The study continues as planned in a blinded manner for full 52 weeks 
period (plus 30 days of safety follow-up). 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 3890 patients were screened, of whom 2216 were randomized to receive high and medium doses of 
QMF149,  MF,  or  salmeterol/fluticasone.  The  patient  population  was  balanced  across  treatment  groups.  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  the  treatment  phase  was  low  (7.3%)  and  generally 
balanced across treatment groups.

Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analyses 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended 5 times.  
As a part of first amendment, the study population was restricted to patients on medium or high dose ICS or 
low dose of LABA/ICS at baseline. 
As a part of amendment 2, the inclusion criteria were modified from ACQ≥2 to ACQ≥1.5.   
In amendment 3, there was a change in e-Diary alert handling during run-in epoch due to asthma worsening. 
Protocol Amendment 4 included a revision of the sample size (from 2800 to 2650) based on the re-estimation 
of drop-out rate at Week 26 at which time the primary and key secondary objectives are evaluated. 
In amendment 5 it was decided to perform primary analysis once all patients completed the 26 weeks of 
treatment (Visit 207) or prematurely withdrawn from the study. This analysis included an assessment of 
primary and key secondary objectives as well as other prespecified objectives up to and including Week 26.  
The remaining analysis was planned to be performed once the study is ended. In addition, as a part of this 
amendment it was decided to perform combined analysis of the key secondary endpoint, ACQ-7 score.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 91/182 
  
  
 
 
Other changes in study conduct 
Site No. 2314 was prematurely closed due to GCP related deviations which had the potential to affect data 
integrity. For the patients randomized at this site, a sensitivity analysis was conducted assessing for primary, 
key secondary endpoints and AEs/SAEs both with and without patient data from this site. Health Authorities 
were notified of the premature closure for the site. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 309 (13.9%) patients were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations, which were 
generally balanced across treatment groups. The most common major protocol deviation category was 
selection criteria not met (10.7%). 
•  Baseline data 
Overall, the mean age was 47.9 years with adolescents (12-17 years) comprising 4.8% (n=107) of the 
population and 13.4% of patients ≥65 years of age. The majority of randomized patients were female 
(58.3%) and Caucasian (70.4%). Asian patients comprised 22.2% of the population. Demographic 
characteristics were generally balanced across the 5 treatment groups in terms of age, gender, race, height, 
and weight. 
Disease characteristics (Randomized set) 
The mean duration of asthma in all patients was 14.6 years with >50% of the patients having had asthma for 
>10 years. About 70% of patients had no asthma exacerbations in the previous year and 30% of patients 
had a history of ≥1 asthma exacerbation. Approximately 70% of patients had been treated with low dose 
LABA/ICS and approximately 27% had been treated with medium or high dose ICS prior to the study. The 
mean ACQ-7 score at baseline was 2.3. 
Screening spirometry and reversibility testing 
Mean pre-bronchodilator 
FEV1 values showing eligibility at Visit 101 were balanced across groups (66.2% of predicted overall). Nearly 
all patients (>99%) had pre-bronchodilator FEV1 < 85% of the predicted normal value. Mean pre-
bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 was 65.4% at the start of Run-in (Visit 101) and 67.3% at the end of 
Run-in (Visit 102). The mean FEV1 reversibility was 22.8% with a mean increase in FEV1 of approximately 
0.45 L; overall, 90.1% of patients demonstrated reversibility at Visit 101. 
Medical history and current medical conditions 
As expected, the most commonly reported SOC was respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders with 
100% of patients reporting asthma, and 26% reporting rhinitis allergic. 
Prior therapy 
All patients (100%) were on asthma medications in line with the inclusion criteria; of them, 72% of patients 
overall were on FDC of LABA/ICS (inhalation) with the most common as inhaled budesonide-formoterol 
(44.2%), salmeterol/fluticasone (15.2%), and beclomethasone/formoterol (12.0%). Frequently used asthma 
Assessment report

medications also included SABAs (61.9%) and corticosteroids (61.4%). Other asthma-related medications 
were used at rates of ~10%. 
Treatment compliance  
Compliance was calculated by counting the days where study drug was administered "As per protocol" 
according to the records on the Dosage Administration Record Summary eCRF. Most patients (> 94%) were 
compliant with the study medication as per protocol (categorized compliance as 80% to 100%) with similar 
rates between treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
Almost all patients (> 99%) were included in the FAS and safety sets, while 85.8% of patients were included 
in the PPS and 12.8% in PK profiling subset. 
Table 25: Analysis sets (all Screened patients) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy objective was met, with both high and medium QMF149 doses demonstrating superiority 
compared with the corresponding MF monotherapy doses. After 26 weeks of treatment, the estimated 
treatment difference in trough FEV1 was 0.132 L (95% CI: 0.088 to 0.176) for QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. vs 
MF 800 μg (administered as 400 μg b.i.d.) and 0.211 L (95% CI: 0.167 to 0.255) for QMF149 150/160 μg 
o.d. vs MF 400 μg o.d. (both p<0.001). 
The treatment difference between QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. was 
0.036 L (95% CI: -0.007 to 0.080). Since the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than the pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin of -0.090 L, the non-inferiority objective was met.

Supportive analyses for the primary efficacy results (trough FEV1) 
To assess the treatment effects in the PPS, a supportive analysis was performed for trough FEV1 at Week 26. 
The results were consistent with the primary analysis for both high and medium doses of QMF149 versus the 
corresponding doses of MF. 
Sensitivity analysis 
A sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the impact of a deviation from the missing at random assumption of 
missing data was performed for the primary endpoint (trough FEV1) at Day 184 (Week 26). 
The tipping point for high dose QMF149 versus high dose MF in trough FEV1 occurred with a delta of 0.80 L. 
This implied that the average of the Day 184 trough FEV1 values among patients from the high dose QMF149 
treatment group with a missing Day 184 measurement would need to be 0.80 L lower than that of the high 
dose QMF149 treatment completers in order for the study conclusion on high dose QMF149 vs high dose MF 
to be reversed. For medium dose QMF149 versus medium dose MF, the tipping point occurred with adelta of 
1.40 L. Both tipping points found are clinically implausible, therefore supporting that the results of the 
primary endpoint are robust to the departure from the missing at random assumption.

Key secondary endpoint - ACQ-7 score after 26 weeks of treatment 
The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 (150/160 μg and 150/320 μg 
o.d. combined) to MF (400 and 800 μg combined) in terms of ACQ-7 after 26 weeks of treatment in patients 
with asthma.  
After 26 weeks of treatment (Day 183), key secondary objective was met; the LS mean treatment difference 
in ACQ-7 score for pooled QMF149 vs MF doses improved (decreased) by -0.209 (95% CI: -0.270, -0.149, 
p<0.001)

A steady improvement in ACQ-7 scores was observed over the course of treatment (Day 364) for pooled high 
and medium QMF149 doses with a LS mean change from baseline of -1.090 compared with -0.887 for pooled 
MF doses, 
Other secondary objectives  
There were a number of additional secondary endpoints which investigated lung function parameters in the 
study including trough FEV1(by visit), pre-dose and post-dose FEV1 and trough, FVC by all visits as well as 
peak expiratory flow. The estimated treatment differences in trough FEV1 for both high dose QMF149 and 
medium dose QMF149 were generally consistent at all visits over 52 weeks compared with the corresponding 
doses of MF starting as early as Day 2. 
Asthma exacerbations 
Overall, the proportion of patients with each type of asthma exacerbation on study treatment was lower in 
high and medium dose QMF149 treatment groups than in the corresponding MF treatment groups. Few 
patients had asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization or exacerbations causing permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment across treatment groups, with lower rates in the QMF149 treatment 
groups compared with corresponding MF treatment groups. No patients on either high or medium dose 
QMF149 had asthma exacerbations causing permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Asthma exacerbation rates were slightly lower with high dose QMF149 compared with salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 μg b.i.d., with the exception of asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization.

Table 28: Overview of the number of patients with asthma exacerbations, by 
exacerbation category (Full analysis set) 
There were clinically meaningful reductions in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations for both high and 
medium doses of QMF149 compared with the corresponding MF doses. In study 2301 during 52 weeks of 
treatment, a reduction in exacerbation rate was seen in both the QMF149 groups investigated in this study as 
compared to the MF groups. A rate ratio of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.89), i.e. 35% reduction, was reported for 
high dose comparisons, and a rate ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.64), i.e. 53% reduction, was reported 
medium dose comparisons.  
The rate ratio between high dose QMF149 and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. was 0.93 (i.e. 7% 
reduction, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.29) for moderate or severe exacerbations.

Clinically meaningful results in the time to first asthma exacerbation showed that both high and medium 
QMF149 doses reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations (moderate or severe, severe, and all mild, moderate 
and severe exacerbations) compared with the corresponding MF doses.  
Treatment differences were not clinically meaningful for high dose QMF149 compared with 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.

ACQ-7 responder rate 
At Week 26, 66.9% to 76.4% of patients achieved a MCID (decrease from baseline of ≥0.5) improvement in 
ACQ-7 score (responders) across treatment groups, with a higher proportion of patients on high and medium 
doses of QMF149 compared with the corresponding doses of MF achieving the MCID across visits. The 
improvements were generally consistent at Week 52; 69.2% to 82.1% of patients achieved a MCID (decrease 
from baseline of ≥0.5) improvement in ACQ-7 score (responders) across treatment groups. There were no 
meaningful differences in the proportion of patients achieving the MCID improvement between high dose 
QMF149 or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. treatment groups at any visit across 52 weeks. 
Asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ)-S+12 
At Week 26, the LS mean change from baseline in AQLQ-S+12 overall score was higher in both high and 
medium QMF149 groups compared with the corresponding MF groups  
Rescue medication use 
A reduction in rescue medication use over 26 weeks was noted for both high and medium dose QMF149 
versus the corresponding MF doses. Treatment improvements were comparable in the mean number of puffs 
of rescue medication during Weeks 1-26 with high dose QMF149 and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following exploratory subgroup analyses for trough FEV1 at Week 26 using MMRM were performed (using 
the appropriate interaction term in the model and additional covariate as a fixed effect if necessary) for the 
FAS to explore the treatment effect in: 
•  Age group (12 to 17 years, ≥ 18 years) 
•  Race (Caucasian, Black, Asian, Other) 
•  Sex (male, female) 
•  History of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (Yes, No)

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In  addition  to  the  individual  CSR  for  each  Phase  III  study,  data  from  Study  B2301  was  pooled  with  Study 
B2302  (FAS  1-2)  and  Study  B2303  (FAS  1-3)  into a  combined  efficacy  analyses  in  order to  further  support 
the  efficacy  results  observed  for  the  individual  trials.  The  combined  efficacy  analyses  (pooled  data)  were 
based on the FAS and are presented below for: 
• 
• 
• 
FAS 1 (Study B2301 including pooled QMF149 medium + high doses vs MF medium + high doses) 
FAS1-2 (Studies B2301 and B2302) 
FAS1-3 (Studies B2301 and B2303) 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy data of all 3 studies was grouped into one single clinical trial efficacy database (Asthma E-db) as 
the 3 studies include QMF149 treatment group(s) either compared to MF and/or salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 μg b.i.d. The analyses were adjusted for population differences to validate the observed effect since 
the asthma populations are study specific. All data collected between the first dose and no later than one day 
after the date of last dose are included in the analyses.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No additional efficacy studies in special populations were performed.   
Both studies enrolled adolescent patients. Study 2303 enrolled 64 (8.0%) adolescent patients whereas study 
2301 enrolled 107 (4.8%) adolescent patients. The number of adolescents to be recruited to both pivotal 
studies were discussed with PDCO. It was agreed that at least 100 adolescents should be enrolled to study 
2301 and at least 50 adolescents should be enrolled to study 2303.  
For adolescents in study 2303, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 12) was 
0.251 L (95% CI: 0.130, 0.371). 
For adolescents in study 2301, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at week 26 was 0.39 L for 
medium dose comparisons and 0.183 L for high dose comparisons. For the high dose comparison, the 
difference between groups was not statistically significant.  For the adolescent subgroups, improvements in 
lung function, symptoms and exacerbations (assessed at week 52) were consistent with the overall 
population.  
Supportive study  
Efficacy: Dose timing 
The pivotal studies for QMF149 were based on evening dosing. The applicant submitted one study in support 
of a flexible once daily dose timing (AM or PM) CQVM149B2209 conducted with QVM149, a FDC of 
indacaterol acetate/glycopyrronium bromide/mometasone furate 150/50/80 μg. 
Study CQVM149B2209 was a randomized, double-blind, repeat dose cross-over study in 35 patients with 
asthma to assess the bronchodilator effects of once daily QVM149 following morning or evening dosing for 14 
days compared to placebo in patients with asthma. It demonstrated a clinically significant increase in 
FEV1(AUC 0-24h) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg dosed in the morning (0.6096L) or evening (0.6152L) with no 
clinically relevant difference between timing of dosing. The applicant states that this study can be 
extrapolated to QMF149 (double combination, this application) since LAMAs are not known to elicit 
differential PD based on time of dosing. This was agreed by CHMP.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose response studies 
The study design, subject disposition and recruitment criteria were appropriate in the studies submitted in 
support of dose selection for the monotherapy components in the applied for double FDC QMF149. The 
studied populations were relevant to the enrolled populations in pivotal studies and the efficacy endpoints 
(trough FEV1) were clinically relevant.  
Indacaterol 
The indacaterol 150 μg dose was selected based on the approved dose in COPD and supported by studies 
CQMF149E2203, CQVA149A2210 and CQAB149B2357, this was in line with CHMP scientific advice. 
Indacaterol as maleate salt form is approved in COPD. The applicant developed the acetate salt form for the 
asthma combination product. Two salt bridging studies CQVM149B2203 and CQAB149D2301 demonstrated 
comparable efficacy between the acetate and maleate salt forms. A dose-response was demonstrated from 
low to higher doses although the superiority between indacaterol 75 μg and 150 μg was not statistically 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 114/182 
  
  
significant. Overall, these studies are supportive of indacaterol efficacy in asthma however superior efficacy 
for the 150 μg dose compared to the 75 μg was not entirely demonstrated.  
Mometasone 
The mometasone dose selected for QMF149 was supported by study CQMF149E2201. The objective of the 
study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with MF 80 μg and 320 μg od via Concept1 to the 
already approved MF 200 μg and 800 μg od via Twisthaler. Overall the study demonstrated non-inferiority 
based on the primary efficacy endpoint for MF delivered via the Concept1 device compared to the previously 
approved MF doses in the Twisthaler and therefore supports the dose range used in the pivotal studies. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 80 μg in 
Concept1 and MF 200 μg in Twisthaler groups was 68 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of 0 
mL. The CHMP agreed that 90ml was a conservative and acceptable non-inferiority margin.  
Furthermore, although pre-specified non-inferiority was met, there was a trend towards superiority in the MF 
80 μg dose via Concept1 compared to MF doses of 200 μg delivered by Twisthaler. This combined with PK 
and PD results from MF bridging studies raises uncertainties as to whether doses of MF delivered from the 
applicant’s Concept 1 inhaler are equivalent to those delivered from Twisthaler; those are summarised below: 
PK data 
The applicant used 3-step bridging approach to determine these doses, which in principle could be agreed. 
However, the PK data collected in phase II and III studies show differences in the exposure. In some studies, 
exposure of mometasone from Concept 1 was lower than from Twisthaler. In other studies, opposite results 
were reported.  
• 
For example, in phase 2 study (2201) Mean MF systemic exposure (AUClast, AUC0-23h35min and 
Cmax) on Day 1 and Day 28 was lower in both the low and high dose of MF Concept1 groups 
compared with the corresponding low and high dose of MF Twisthaler groups. 
•  On the other hand, Pop PK simulations for mometasone showed higher MF exposure in QMF149 or 
QVM149 (up to 37 % increase in AUC0-24h) compared with the MF Twisthaler device, despite using a 
multiplicative factor on bioavailability to adjust for different MF doses in different formulations.   
PD data 
Uncertainty in relation to the equivalence of MF dose delivered by Concept 1 versus Twisthaler also arises 
from the PD data.  
In study 2201, MF doses of 80 μg o.d. in QMF149 delivered by Concept1 could be considered superior in 
respect to trough FEV1 as compared MF doses of 200 μg o.d. and delivered by Twisthaler.  
It needs to be noted that due to low bioavailability of MF, systemic exposure was considered by the applicant 
as an appropriate surrogate for pulmonary exposure, although charcoal study was not performed. These 
uncertainties have implication for the efficacy and safety assessment: 
Efficacy  
As required by the guideline on clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products 
(EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), the contribution of a new component included in a FDC needs to be quantified. In 
addition, for fair comparison the doses of ICS in FDC product and in Twisthaler should be equivalent.  
While the FDC has been compared to mometasone monotherapy in the 2 pivotal studies, the assessment of 
contribution of indacaterol in a FDC (QMF149) compared with MF monotherapy is confounded by the fact that 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 115/182 
  
  
mometasone used in QMF149 combination cannot be considered as therapeutically equivalent to mometasone 
delivered as a monotherapy through Twisthaler. Further clarification were obtained from the applicant on the 
non-inferiority margin chosen for the studies, there was no longer considered to be any clinically relevant 
difference between the MF doses used and the above issue could therefore be considered solved.  
The applicant was also requested to further discuss and justify the equivalence of MF doses regarding the 
clinical relevance of the observed differences in exposure as well as implications for safety and efficacy 
assessment. The applicant provided a detailed response and CHMP concluded that the totality of data 
demonstrated that despite some inconsistency observed for PK, there is no clinically important difference and 
the MF delivered via Concept1 (at both lower and higher doses) can be considered comparable to MF doses 
delivered by Twisthaler.  
Dose timing 
Study CQVM149B2209 supports the applied posology of once daily dosing for the triple combination QVM149 
(parallel application), with morning or evening dosing. No efficacy or safety concerns were raised. The 
applicant stated that this study can be extrapolated to the double combination QMF149 since LAMAs are not 
known to elicit differential PD based on time of dosing. This concept is accepted in principle and it is 
acknowledged that the LAMA tiotropium is approved for O.D. without any particular dosing time. The 
applicant supplied appropriate literature to support this rationale which was therefore endorsed by CHMP.  
Main studies 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted two pivotal Phase III controlled studies [Study 2301 and Study 2303] supporting the 
use of QMF149 in either low (QMF149 150/80 μg o.d.), medium (QMF149 150/160 μg o.d.), or high (QMF149 
150/320 μg o.d.) dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma.  
The aim of study 2303 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the lowest dose of the combination. In 
this study, during the 12-week treatment period patients received either QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. delivered 
via Concept1 or MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler. This study utilised a double-dummy design. 
The aim of study 2301 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of medium (QMF149 150/160 μg o.d.) and 
high (QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.) doses over a 52-week study duration. In this study, patients were 
randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups and received either QMF149 150/160 μg o.d., QMF149 150/320 μg 
o.d., MF 400 μg o.d., MF 800 μg (400 μg b.i.d.) or an active comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone 
propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). The study had a triple-dummy design and each patient received 5 inhalations 
(3 in the evening and 2 in the morning).  
Run in period  
In both pivotal studies (2303 and 2301), during the run-in period, all patients, irrespective of previous 
treatment and severity of the disease, received treatment with a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids i.e. 
fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler. For some patients, especially for those receiving 
high ICS dose at baseline this was de-escalation of therapy which was likely to have clinical consequences 
and cause further deterioration of the disease control. Upon request by CHMP, the applicant provided further 
discussion on this issue and confirmed that there was no evidence of asthma worsening (FEV1, ACQ-7 and 
PEF) during the run-in period. Therefore, no meaningful influence on study results are expected. Further, in 
Study B2301 patients taking low dose ICS/LABA at baseline and subsequently randomized to high dose 
ICS/LABA were not considered overtreated, since they were symptomatic at time of enrolment and were 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 116/182 
  
  
appropriated for step up therapy. In accordance with GINA guidelines, step-up can be to either medium or 
high dose ICS/LABA (i.e. does not require step up to medium dose ICS/LABA prior to high dose ICS/LABA). 
This was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Inclusion end exclusion criteria  
Study 2303 enrolled adult and adolescent patients with inadequately controlled asthma (defined as ACQ-7 
score ≥ 1.5 at randomisation) despite treatments with low dose ICS, with or without another controller 
therapy (i.e., LABA, Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist (LTRA). These inclusion criteria allowed for enrolment of 
uncontrolled patients within two disease severity levels e.g. patients on daily low dose of ICS (GINA 2019 
step 2) or patients on low dose ICS/LABA (GINA 2019 step 3).  
Enrolment of patients with different grades of severity (e.g. uncontrolled on GINA 2019 steps 2 or 3) to study 
B2303 was not supported by PDCO. For this reason, the applicant amended the inclusion criteria in line with 
PDCO comments. However, notably only the inclusion criteria for adolescents were amended. Therefore, the 
study enrolled adolescent patients receiving low ICS+LABA combination only if they were controlled at 
baseline (ACQ-7<1.5), whereas adult patients receiving low ICS+LABA combination at baseline had to be 
uncontrolled (ACQ-7 ≥ 1.5). At randomisation all patients (adults and adolescents) were required to be 
symptomatic (ACQ-7 ≥ 1.5). Due to a small number of adolescents enrolled to the study, it was considered 
that some differences in the inclusion criteria were unlikely to change the overall study results. 
Patients with different grades of severity (as per GINA 2019) were also enrolled in study B2301. Study B2301 
enrolled adults and adolescent patients with inadequately controlled asthma (defined as ACQ-7 score ≥ 1.5 at 
randomisation) despite treatment with medium or high dose ICS or low dose of LABA/ICS combination. These 
patients were within GINA 2019 step 3 (patients on medium dose of ICS or low dose of LABA/ICS at baseline) 
or GINA 2019 step 4 (patients high dose ICS at baseline).  
It is acknowledged that at the time when this study was started, all patients enrolled to this where within the 
same GINA 2015 disease severity category (GINA step 3). However, GINA recommendations were amended 
significantly in 2019 and therefore the trial design and used treatment escalation strategy did not follow the 
current treatment recommendations.  
Study 2303 enrolled patients with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 after withholding bronchodilators ≥ 65% and < 
90% of the predicted normal value, whereas study 2301 enrolled patients with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 after 
withholding bronchodilators ≥ 50% and < 85% of the predicted normal value.  
It is considered that in study B2301 benefits of the treatment with the higher dose was not assessed in 
sufficiently severe population i.e. the population of patients which will be using this treatment in clinical 
practice although some additional benefits of the higher dose (i.e. QMF 150/320 versus QMF 150/160) were 
seen in study B2302. It could be argued however, that high dose ICS/LABA combinations have already an 
established role in the treatment of asthma. This was adequately amended in section 5.1 of the SmPC by the 
applicant.  
It is noted that current smokers and patients with a significant smoking history were excluded from the 
study. In line with the guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1): sufficient numbers of smokers should be included in the studies to 
explore whether the size of clinical benefit in smokers is consistent with that seen in non-smokers. The 
applicant clarified that current smokers and former smoker with significant smoking history (>10 pack-years) 
were excluded from the study to help ensure that potential COPD patients were not enrolled. CQVM149B2301 
permitted enrolment of patients with a modest smoking history (less than 10 pack-years). Current smokers 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 117/182 
  
  
were excluded from the study, however, approximately 18% of the study population were former smokers, 
and subgroup analysis demonstrates consistent improvement in trough FEV1 in this population compared to 
those that have never smoked. This provides support to the overall bronchodilator benefit in patients with 
asthma who have a smoking history.  
Endpoints, and analysis  
In both pivotal studies, the assessment of trough FEV1 was selected as a primary endpoint.  
In line with the asthma guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) measurement of lung function parameters 
alone is considered to be insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect. Therefore, the applicant 
selected the assessment of “asthma control” as a key secondary endpoint. Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ)-7 was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment in study 2303 and after 26 weeks of treatment in study 
2301. For multiplicity adjustment, a hierarchical testing procedure was applied to control the type-I error rate 
for the primary and the key secondary endpoint. This approach is considered acceptable for study 2303. 
However, in study 2301, type-I error control was only applied to the assessment of the combined results for 
both strengths (150/160 and 150/320 μg) which were compared to the combined results of comparators (MF 
400 μg and 800 μg combined). Nevertheless, the pooled results were consistent with the individual 
comparisons and demonstrate the benefit of QMF149 compared to MF in terms of ACQ-7 at Week 26. 
The applicant selected the 7-point Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) as a key secondary outcome 
measure to provide a patient-derived outcome to meet the requirements set out in the EMA Asthma guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev 1) to assess improvements in asthma symptoms control. Since this version of the 
questionnaire includes the assessment of pre-bronchodilator FEV1%, it is possible that the pre-bronchodilator 
FEV1% score is driving, at least in part, the positive results of this endpoint and as such, it does not provide 
a clear patient-derived benefit.  
The applicant was requested to discuss and present the data for Asthma Control Questionnaire without 
FEV1% score included. The applicant provided the results of ACQ-5.  It is clear that for the QMF versus MF 
comparisons the better results were obtained for ACQ-7 (which includes the lung function data) as compared 
to ACQ-5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pre-bronchodilator FEV1% score in the questionnaire is 
partially driving the positive results of this endpoints. Nevertheless, for both versions of the questionnaire 
(ACQ-5 and ACQ-7) statistically better results were reported in the QMF149 groups versus the MF groups 
therefore this issue is considered as resolved.  
Analyses of other secondary endpoints was performed at the nominal 2-sided 0.05 level (2-sided) without 
multiplicity adjustment. 
Exacerbations (definition and proposed time for assessment) 
The assessment of the effect on exacerbation is considered to be particularly important as concern has been 
expressed that the addition of a LABA to ICS may enhance current control but mask inflammation, therefore 
increasing future risk of exacerbation. This is reflected in the CHMP guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) 
which states: for a new long-acting bronchodilator drug to be administered as concomitant medication with 
inhaled corticosteroids, an effect on both lung function and exacerbations should be demonstrated. For a new 
controller treatment, the preferred primary endpoint is exacerbations 
The effect on exacerbations (including the assessment of time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation 
category and annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category) was analysed as a secondary 
endpoint without adjustment for multiplicity. Multiplicity control was not included due to sample size 
considerations. The applicant considered that exacerbations reductions and magnitude of effect are clinically 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 118/182 
  
  
meaningful irrespective of multiplicity control and that despite not being controlled for multiplicity, this did 
not diminish the relevance of results.  
The applicant was asked to justify the definition used for mild exacerbation as in line with the CHMP guideline 
the definition of “mild exacerbation” is difficult and should be avoided as its characteristics are similar to the 
normal variation seen in asthma control. Therefore, it is considered that the data on mild exacerbations are 
supportive only and should not be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The data on mild exacerbations were 
removed from section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Population enrolled  
802 patients were randomized to study 2303 and 398 of these patients received treatment with QMF149 
150/80 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 and 404 patients received MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler. 
The majority of patients (96.9%) completed the treatment phase. The primary reasons for premature 
discontinuation of the treatment phase were AEs (1.1%) and protocol deviations (0.9%). 
The second pivotal study (2301) was larger and randomized 2216 patients to receive either high and medium 
doses of QMF149, MF, or salmeterol/fluticasone. Of the 2216 randomized patients, 234 (10.6%) patients 
permanently discontinued the study treatment prematurely. The highest discontinuation rate was in the MF 
400 group (9.2 %). 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics of patients enrolled to both pivotal studies were very 
similar.  
The mean age of randomised patients was 45.6 years in study 2303 and 47.9 years in study 2301. In both 
studies only around of 13% of the randomized patients were aged 65 years or older. Both studies enrolled a 
small number of adolescents (64 in study 2303 and 107 in study 2301). The number of adolescents to be 
enrolled to planned studies in asthma was discussed and agreed with the PDCO.   
Both studies enrolled patients with uncontrolled asthma with the baseline mean ACQ-7 score of 2.3. The 
majority of patients (>80%) had never smoked and the majority of patients (>70%) had no asthma 
exacerbations that required treatment. Study 2303 enrolled patients on low ICS dose (43%) or patients on 
low ICS/LABA combination (56%) at baseline whereas study 2301 enrolled patients on medium (19.8%), 
high ICS dose (6.9%) or low ICS/LABA combination (68.7%). 
Results of the study endpoints 
In both pivotal studies the primary objectives were met.  
QMF149 150/80 demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 
as compared to MF 200 and the observed difference (mean 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p < 0.001) is 
likely to be clinically relevant.  
In study 2301, both high and medium QMF149 doses demonstrating superiority compared with the 
corresponding MF monotherapy doses. The observed difference for medium ICS doses (QMF149 150/160 
versus MF 400) was 211 ml whereas the difference for higher ICS doses (QMF149 150/320 versus MF 800) 
was smaller e.g. 132 ml.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 119/182 
  
  
 
In both pivotal studies, statistically significant improvement was reported in the QMF149 groups as compared 
to the MF groups however the mean difference between the treatment groups was below the MCID (decrease 
from baseline of ≥0.5). The proportion of ACQ-7 responders (patients who achieved an improvement of at 
least 0.5 units in the ACQ-7 score) was higher in the QMF149 150/80 and 150/160 group as compared to the 
MF 200 and 400 groups. However, the differences between the higher QMF149 150/320 group and the 800 
MF group was not statistically significant.  
The applicant discussed also the results of ACQ-5 which showed statistically better results in the QMF149 
groups versus in the MF groups. 
Results of the other secondary endpoints which investigated lung function in general support the results of 
the primary endpoint. QMF149 demonstrated improvement as compared to the corresponding MF doses in 
trough FEV1(by visit) FEV1, pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow. In addition, a reduction in rescue 
medication use was noted for all QMF149 groups versus the corresponding MF groups over the course of 52 
weeks. 
Exacerbations 
The effect on exacerbations was assessed as a secondary endpoint in both studies.  
Study 2303 had only 12 weeks’ duration and therefore could be considered as too short for the assessment 
on the effect on exacerbations as recommended in the Asthma guideline. Of note, fewer exacerbations were 
recorded in the QMF149 group as compared to the MF group.   
In study 2301 during 52 weeks of treatment, a reduction in exacerbation rate was seen in both the QMF149 
groups investigated in this study as compared to the MF groups.  For moderate or severe asthma 
exacerbation, a rate ratio of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.89) i.e. 35% reduction, was reported for high dose 
comparisons, and a rate ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) i.e. 53% reduction, was reported medium dose 
comparisons. However, the difference in absolute terms was small. 
The 52 week results on exacerbations from B2301 are presented below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 120/182 
  
  
Table 33: Rate of asthma exacerbations, by exacerbation category (FAS) 
In addition, the overall rate of exacerbations for high dose QMF149 was comparable to an approved standard 
of care, salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg (high dose), which is a similar ICS dose strength as QMF149 
150/320 μg. The rate of exacerbations for high dose QMF149 was 0.25 per patient/yr. and for 
salmeterol/fluticasone was 0.27 per patient/yr, which corresponds to a reduction in rate ranging from 7-11% 
(RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67, 1.29 for mod/severe and RR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.58, 1.37, for severe) 
Based on the full 52-week exacerbation data presented, it was agreed with applicant that the magnitude of 
reduction in moderate to severe and severe exacerbations for high dose QMF149 vs high dose MF (29-35%) 
and medium dose QMF149 vs medium dose MF (53-54%) is considered clinically relevant. Nevertheless, 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 121/182 
  
  
 
 
CHMP was of the opinion that it should be clearly stated in section 5.1 of the SmPC that exacerbations were 
assessed as secondary endpoints only without and as such nominal P value should not be stated. 
The addition of a LABA to ICS in the treatment of asthma may well be corticosteroid-sparing and therefore 
allow a lower dose of ICS to be used to achieve control of the asthma. Therefore, the efficacy of the higher 
doses of QMF149 should have been compared to the lower doses in order to demonstrate an additional 
benefit of the higher doses over the lower dose. The applicant was asked to compare the efficacy results of 
the higher QMF 150/320 versus QMF 150/160 in order to justify the use of the higher dose. It needs to be 
highlighted again that both doses were investigated in the same population of less severe patients.  
The provided comparisons in study B2301 indicates that there are only small additional benefits of the higher 
dose in the enrolled patient population.  
There were no significant differences between the annualized rate of moderate and severe exacerbations 
reported in the QMF 150/320 group as compared to the QMF 150/160 group (0.25 and 0.27 respectively). 
The rate of severe exacerbations in these groups was the same (i.e. 0.13). It could be hypothesized that the 
enrolled study population (B2301) was not severe enough to show additional benefits of the higher dose. On 
the other hand, additional benefits of the higher dose (QMF 150/320) versus medium dose (QMF 150/160) 
were seen in study B2302 in which QMF was used as a comparator.  
Some additional benefits of the higher dose (QMF 150/320) versus medium dose (QMF 150/160) was seen in 
study B2302.  In the exploratory analysis, high dose QMF149 after 52 weeks of treatment showed an 
important reduction of 19% (RR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) in moderate to severe exacerbations and 18% 
(RR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.03) in severe exacerbation. In addition to the exacerbation benefit high dose 
QMF149 showed a numerical incremental benefit in trough FEV1 at week 26 compared to medium dose 
QMF149 that was maintained at week 52 (32 and 35 ml, respectively).  
On balance, taking into consideration that high dose ICS/LABA combinations have an established role in the 
treatment of asthma, the approval of the high dose could be accepted. Severity of the enrolled population is 
clearly described in the SmPC.  
In study 2301 the efficacy of the QMF149 high dose e.g. 150/320 was compared to an active comparator 
(salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). Since these comparisons were made without 
multiplicity adjustment, they are considered as supportive only. Trough FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment 
was tested for non-inferiority with 90 ml non-inferiority margin. QMF149 150/320 was not inferior to 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. in respect to trough FEV1 after 26 weeks. The treatment difference 
was 0.036 L (95% CI: -0.007 to 0.080). For other endpoints no significant differences between QMF149 
150/320 and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 were recorded; however, for these endpoints no formal non-
inferiority testing was performed. 
Indications 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
Bemrist Breezhaler is indicated as a once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 
12 years of age and older where use of a combination of long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid 
is appropriate: 
- 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting 
beta2-agonists, or 
- 
patients not adequately controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 122/182 
  
  
 
corticosteroids. 
(For effects on asthma symptom control and reduction of asthma exacerbations, see section 5.1.). 
Several uncertainties were raised by CHMP in relation to the above proposed indication. The second part of 
the indication (i.e. patients not adequately controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids) was not considered to be sufficiently justified considering that in the pivotal studies each 
QMF149 dose was compared to ICS monotherapy only and not to low dose of ICS/LABA. These pivotal 
studies did not provide any direct evidence of superiority over low dose ICS/LABA to support this indication. 
The applicant clarified that the studies were designed to show superiority of all three doses of QMF149 over 
respective doses of mometasone furoate (MF) but were not designed to show differentiation between QMF149 
doses.  
The CHMP considered that low dose LABA/ICS was not used as an active comparator and therefore it was not 
clear what treatment effects would be achieved when the efficacy of medium and high doses of 
BemristBreehaler is compared to low dose LABA/ICS. Further, the efficacy of Bemrist Breezhaler was only 
compared to ICS monotherapy and this should therefore be reflected in the approved indication to which the 
applicant agreed.  
In addition, the inclusion of the text ‘for effects on asthma symptom control and reduction of asthma 
exacerbations, see section 5.1’ was not supported by CHMP as study endpoints should not be specified in the 
text of the indication; the SmPC was therefore amended accordingly by the application.  
In light of the above and in order to better reflects the treatment, which was used in the comparator arms, 
the applicant agreed to revise the indication as follows:  
Bemrist Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short acting beta2-agonists.   
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy  
Efficacy in adolescents  
Both studies enrolled adolescent patients. Study 2303 enrolled 64 (8.0%) adolescent patients whereas study 
2301 enrolled 107 (4.8%) adolescent patients. The number of adolescents to be recruited to both pivotal 
studies were discussed with PDCO. It was agreed at least 100 adolescents should be enrolled and available 
for the primary endpoint analysis to study 2301 and at least 50 adolescents should be enrolled to study 
2303.  
For adolescents enrolled to study 2303, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 
12) was 0.251 L (95% CI: 0.130, 0.371). 
For adolescents in study 2301, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at week 26 was 0.39 L for 
medium dose comparisons and 0.183 L for high dose comparisons. For the high dose comparison, the 
difference between groups was not statistically significant. For the adolescent subgroups, improvements in 
lung function, symptoms and exacerbations were consistent with the overall population. he data provided in 
the adolescent population were considered sufficient to support an indication in this population.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In both pivotal studies (2301 and 2303) the primary objectives were met. QMF149 150/80 demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 as compared to MF 200 and the 
observed difference (mean 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p < 0.001) is clinically relevant. In study 2301, 
both high and medium QMF149 doses demonstrating superiority compared with the corresponding MF 
monotherapy doses. The observed difference for medium ICS doses (QMF149 150/160 versus MF 400) was 
211 ml whereas the difference for higher ICS doses (QMF149 150/320 versus MF 800) was smaller e.g. 132 
ml.  
With regards to the key secondary objective of both pivotal studies (i.e. Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ)-7), in both pivotal studies statistically significant improvement was reported in the QMF149 groups as 
compared to the MF groups however the mean difference between the treatment groups was below the MCID 
(decrease from baseline of ≥0.5). The proportion of ACQ-7 responders (patients who achieved an 
improvement of at least 0.5 units in the ACQ-7 score) was higher in the QMF149 150/80 and 150/160 group 
as compared to the MF 200 and 400 groups. However, the differences between the higher QMF149 150/320 
group and the 800 MF group was not statistically significant.  
Results of the other secondary endpoints which investigated lung function in general support the results of 
the primary endpoint. QMF149 demonstrated improvement as compared to the corresponding MF doses in 
trough FEV1(by visit) FEV1, pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow. In addition, a reduction in rescue 
medication use was noted for all QMF149 groups versus the corresponding MF groups over the course of 52 
weeks. 
Overall, both pivotal studies convincingly demonstrate the advantage of the QMF149 double fixed-dose 
combination of ICS/LABA compared with ICS monotherapy, In the pivotal studies each QMF149 dose was 
compared to ICS monotherapy only and not to low dose of ICS/LABA. These pivotal studies do therefore not 
provide any direct evidence of superiority over low dose ICS/LABA to support the step-up indication sought 
by the applicant. The applicant was therefore advised that the therapeutic indication should reflect the clinical 
studies performed and be more accurately tailored to the Asthma population studied in the clinical 
programme.  
In light of the above and in order to better reflects the treatment, which was used in the comparator arms, 
the approved indication for Bemrist Breezhaler is as follows:   
Bemrist Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short acting beta2-agonists.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Mometasone furoate is an already established treatment option for patients with asthma >/=12 years. 
Indacaterol, however, is approved only in COPD (as a different salt) and is not approved for use in patients 
with asthma, thus analysis of safety findings with its addition to MF in this FDC inhaler is considered critical. 
Safety data to support the initial MAA for QMF149 are pooled from 3 key studies: CQVM149B2301, 
CQVM149B2303, and CQVM149B2302 (see table below).

Pooled safety data analyses 
The following two pooled safety databases (1-year Asthma S-db and 6-month Asthma S-db) were 
constructed (see table below).  
The applicant has focused the primary safety assessment on the Asthma S-db (all available data for the three 
studies). The Asthma S-db presents all available safety data up to the respective data lock points for ongoing 
studies 2301 and 2302, and completed study 2303, meaning there is variable exposure duration for each 
patient, depending on their duration of treatment at time of database lock/study completion. The incidence of 
AEs in the Asthma S-db are presented as an exposure adjusted safety assessment. The applicant considers 
this database to provide a safety assessment of the addition of the indacaterol acetate (LABA) component in 
the FDC QMF149, compared to MF (ICS) alone.  
The Asthma 6-month S-db includes data from the two pivotal studies 2301 and 2302, only up to Week 26 
assessment and the applicant considers this safety information as supportive to the Asthma S-db above. This 
Asthma 6-month S-db provides non-exposure-adjusted incidence rates for QMF-149 medium and high vs MF 
medium + high and QMF149 high dose vs salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500micrograms bid.

Despite the differences in asthma severity between the three studies, all patients were randomized with an 
equal randomization ratio.  Further, these were double-blinded, parallel-group, controlled studies and had 
similar key inclusion criteria (i.e., patients with documented diagnosis of asthma on a stable dose of 
bronchodilators for at least 1 month prior to screening, had ACQ-7 score ≥1.5, and same FEV1  reversibility 
requirement). These similarities justified pooling across the different studies.

Supportive Safety Data 
The safety evaluation of QMF149 is supported by the safety data obtained from one Phase III supportive 
safety study Study CQVM149B1305 in Japanese patients with asthma and two Phase II studies, Study 
CQMF149A2210 a long-term event driven study in  adult  and adolescent patients with persistent asthma, and 
Study CQMF149F2202, an efficacy, safety and tolerability study in patients with moderate to very severe COPD 
(see table below).

Overall, duration of treatment exposure was comparable amongst the treatment arms in the Asthma S-db. 
Table 1-6 above showed that 52 weeks of treatment was completed by 1413 (63.8%) patients in Study 
CQVM149B2301 and 1884 patients (60.9%) in Study CQVM149B2302.  
In QMF149 ‘medium+high’ dose group 502 patients (57%) received >/=52 weeks treatment, in QMF ‘all’

Table 38 Patient disposition in the Asthma S-db 
Overall patient discontinuation rates were balanced between groups. Compared to the MF alone 
groups, there were lower numbers of premature discontinuations overall in the QMF149 groups. The 
most common reason for premature discontinuation for all treatment groups was subject/guardian 
decision.  
There were fewer premature discontinuations due to AEs for all QMF149 groups (medium+high, all 
and high) compared to both MF alone (medium+high and all) and S/F groups. 
There were three deaths in the QMF149 high dose group and 1 death in the MF medium+ high dose 
group (Deaths are further discussed below). 
There were no notable differences in the adolescent population compared to the adult population for 
premature discontinuations. In study 2301, discontinuations due to AEs were also lower in QMF149 
treated adolescent patients (n=2) compared to MF treated adolescent patients (n=7).

Adverse events 
Common adverse events  
Asthma S-db 
The exposure-adjusted AEs by primary SOC in the Asthma S-db are summarized in Table 39.

Table 41 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 133/182 
  
  
 
The most commonly reported AE by PT (with occurrence rate ≥ 46.5 per 100 PY in any treatment group) was 
asthma (exacerbations) with an occurrence rate (per 100 PY) that was lower in the QMF149 treatment groups 
than the corresponding MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d (Table 2-2). 
The other most commonly reported AE was nasopharyngitis with an occurrence rate lower in the QMF149 
treatment groups compared with the corresponding MF groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 134/182 
  
  
 
Table 42 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 135/182 
  
  
 
Within the primary safety analysis (Asthma S-db), AEs are described as occurrence rates calculated with 
episode per 100 PY, accounting for the variable length of follow up time for patients within this pooled data 
set. In the supportive safety analysis (6-month Asthma S-db), AEs are presented as the percentage of 
patients who reported the event. 
Finally, within the individual CSRs the applicant presents incidence rates (IR) given the exposure period was 
variable. 
The 5 most frequently reported AEs overall, consistent with this class of medicines, were asthma 
exacerbations, nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, and bronchitis. There were 
lower occurrence rates of asthma exacerbation, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections for 
patients in QMF149 (medium+high and all) groups compared to MF alone (medium+high and all) groups, and 
there was no meaningful difference in occurrence rates of headache or bronchitis between these groups. 
Similarly, for the QMF149 high dose group compared to S/F group, there was a lower occurrence rate of 
asthma exacerbations, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and URTIs. However, there was a slight trend for 
increased occurrence rate of headache in QMF149 high dose group compared to S/F 50/500 group (6.9 vs 6.4 
respectively). The rate ratio for headache between these groups was 1.08 (0.67, 1.73).  
There was an increased occurrence rate of dysphonia for patients treated with QMF149 (medium+high, all 
and high) groups compared to the MF (medium+high and all) and S/F groups. Occurrence rates overall were 
still relatively low, not exceeding 2.5, and dysphonia has been appropriately identified as a common adverse 
event in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Consistent with the Asthma S-db, the Asthma 6-month S-db also showed a lower overall proportion of AEs in 
the QMF149 medium+high treatment group vs. MF medium+high group (51.1% vs. 58.2%) and QMF149 
high group vs. salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group (55.5% vs. 59.7%).   
Potential relationship of adverse events to study treatment 
Overall, adverse events considered to be study drug related were quite low across treatment groups. 
In the Asthma S-db, there were lower occurrence rates of drug-related ADRs reported for QMF149 
(medium+high dose, all and high) groups compared to MF (medium+high dose and all) and S/F groups. 
For GI disorders, occurrence rates of AEs related to study drug for QMF149 treated patients was slightly 
higher in QMF149 medium + high (0.9) vs MF medium + high (0.7) and between QMF149 all (1.7) and MF all 
(0.8). However, overall numbers were very low and almost all drug related PTs within the SOC were 
individual AEs, except for n=2 cases of dry mouth in the QMF149 high dose group. Similarly, occurrence rates 
of dysphonia suspected to be drug related were also higher in the QMF 149 medium + high (1.2) compared 
to MF medium and high (0.7) and in the QMF all (1.5) compared to MF all group (0.8).  
For cardiac disorders there were a higher rate of reported drug related AEs in the QMF149 high dose group 
compared to S/F group (1.3 vs 0.7 respectively). In the QMF149 high dose group of these 12 cases, there 
were 2 cases of 1st degree AV block, 2 cases of tachycardia and 3 cases of ventricular extrasystoles. There 
was 1 case each of Atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, SVT, sinus tachycardia and myocardial infarction. 
Otherwise, AEs suspected to be drug related were overall lower or comparable for the QMF149 treatment 
groups compared to MF or S/F treated groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 136/182 
  
  
 
In Study 2301 comparing the QMF149 high vs medium dose, there were higher IR of suspected drug related 
AEs for the higher dose (9.2 vs 6.9). 
Considering, the study was blinded, the significance of reported drug-related AEs is considered limited. 
Analysis of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AEs  of  special  interest  for  QMF149  were  identified  based  on  the  known  or  suspected  risks  of  the  individual 
components of indacaterol and MF and those with occurrence rates ≥ 3.0 per 100 PY in any treatment group.  
Table 43 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 137/182 
  
  
 
The applicant has defined the most common AESIs (adverse events of special interest) as hypersensitivity, 
immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus/hyperglycaemia and CCV events.  
Hypersensitivity and immunosuppression 
For the AESI hypersensitivity, the PTs asthma and less frequently, allergic rhinitis, comprised the bulk of the 
AEs. Lower occurrence rates were seen for QMF149 (medium+high, all and high) groups compared to MF 
(medium+high and all) or S/F groups. Less common PTs that were slightly more commonly reported for 
QMF149 than for MF alone was hypersensitivity (PT), conjunctivitis allergic and sneezing, but all occurrence 
rates were 0.5 and below, thus their significance is undetermined. 
Immunosuppression AESI’s were also overall lower for QMF149 groups compared to MF alone or S/F groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 138/182 
  
  
 
 
CCV events 
For the Asthma S-db there was a trend towards higher total occurrence rate of CCV events for QMF149 
treatment groups; QMF149 medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (3.9 vs 3.7), QMF149 all vs MF all 
(3.7 vs 3.5) and between QMF149 high dose vs S/F (5.2 vs 4.2). upon request by CHMP, the applicant 
presented a thorough review of the available data. CHMP agreed with the applicant conclusion that the 
imbalance observed between QMF149 high and medium dose treated patients in terms of CCV events and 
deaths is most likely due to chance, considering that in comparison of the pooled QMF149 high dose group 
from B2301 and B2302 and pooled QMF149 medium dose group from B2301 and B2302, there were higher 
occurrence of death and CCV events in the high dose group, yet when reviewing study B2302 alone there 
were 7 MACE events in the QMF149 medium dose group compared to only 1 event in the QMF149 high dose 
group. The applicant rationale that there is no biological plausibility for why a higher or indeed a lower steroid 
dose in combination with the same LABA would influence CV outcomes or deaths is considered reasonable 
and can be accepted. 
The applicant also highlighted the available literature data including recent Cochrane reviews for SAEs with 
inhaled steroids in the setting of LABA use in asthma, as well as the Busse publication describing the 
combined analysis of asthma safety trials of LABAs, which could also be considered supportive.  
Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycaemia 
Across all 6 treatment groups, the occurrence rates of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia were comparable: 
2.6 vs 2.2 per 100 PY, respectively in the QMF149 medium+high and MF medium+high treatment groups; 
2.6 vs 2.2 per 100 PY for the QMF149 all and MF all groups and 3.3 vs 2.7 per 100 PY in the QMF149 high 
and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d. treatment groups. For the PT of diabetes mellitus, the 
occurrence rate ranged between 0.1 and 0.7 per 100 PY across treatment groups.  
Overall, no meaningful differences across treatment groups were observed in the risk of diabetes 
mellitus/hyperglycaemia and no consistent patterns were observed for each of the PT associated with this 
risk. However, it was considered that there was a trend towards higher occurrence rate of this AE in all 
QMF149 groups therefore it was included as an ADR in section 4.8 of SmPC.  
Of  note  the  exclusion  criteria  did  not  allow  enrolment  of  patients  with  Type  1  diabetes  mellitus  or 
uncontrolled Type 2 DM. This was clearly indicated in the SmPC. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Asthma S-db 
The SAEs by primary SOC in the Asthma S-db are summarized in Table 2-8. Overall, the occurrence rates of 
SAEs were comparable between the QMF149 treatment groups and the corresponding MF treatment groups 
or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d in the Asthma S-db. The SOCs with the most frequently reported 
SAEs were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (specifically due to PT asthma (exacerbations) and 
infections and infestations (specifically due to PT pneumonia). Other SOCs reported SAEs with lower 
occurrence rates (i.e., ≤1.4 per 100 PY in any treatment group) in the Asthma S-db.

Table 44 
In the Asthma S-db, the most commonly reported SAE by PT (with occurrence rate ≥ 0.5 per 100 PY in any 
treatment group) were asthma (exacerbations) and pneumonia with occurrence rates comparable between 
the QMF149 treatment groups and the corresponding MF treatment groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 
µg b.i.d group (Table 2-9).  
The occurrence rate of asthma (exacerbation) was 0.6 vs.1.8 per 100 PY in the QMF149 medium+high vs. MF 
medium+high treatment groups, 0.7 vs. 1.8 per 100 PY in the QMF149 all vs. MF all treatment groups and 
1.9 vs. 1.2 per 100 PY in the QMF149 high vs. salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d groups. The occurrence 
rate of pneumonia was 0.5 vs. 0.9 per 100 PY in the QMF149 medium+high vs. MF medium+high treatment 
groups, 0.5 vs. 0.8 per 100 PY in the QMF149 all vs. MF all treatment groups and 0.2 vs. 0.5 per 100 PY in 
the QMF149 high vs. salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d groups.

Other SAEs were reported with lower occurrence rates (i.e., ≤ 0.3 per 100 PY in any treatment group), which 
were comparable between the QMF149 treatment groups and the corresponding MF treatment groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. 
Table 45 
In the Asthma S-db, there were no meaningful differences in the risk ratios and rate differences for the 5 
most frequently reported SAEs (asthma, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, appendicitis and 
cholelithiasis) between the QMF149 treatment groups and the corresponding MF treatment groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group.

On review of SAEs per SOC, occurrence rates overall were lower in the QMF149 medium + high and QMF149 
all dose arms compared to the respective MF arms. Occurrence rates of all SAEs were however slightly higher 
in the QMF149 high dose treated patients (10.7) compared to S/F 50/500 treated patients (8.9).  
There was an observed trend towards more SAEs including asthma exacerbation for QMF149 high dose group 
(1.9) when compared to an established combination treatment S/F 50/500 (1.2). The applicant was asked to 
comment on this observed unfavourable trend of higher SAEs, including serious asthma outcomes as 
discussed below, for the high dose QMF149 compared to S/F.  
SAEs of acute MI and appendicitis both occurred more commonly in both QMF149 groups compared to MF 
groups as shown above, however overall events were low, 0.3 episodes per 100 PY or less, and review of the 
rate difference was not significant. 
In the QMF149 high dose group there were 3 SAEs of pulmonary embolism and 3 SAEs of cataract with no 
corresponding SAEs in the S/F comparator group. Further information was requested by CHMP (see 
discussion on clinical safety). 
Specific SAEs 
Adjudicated serious CCV AEs by MACE outcome 
Serious CCV events were evaluated by an independent adjudication committee and were adjudicated by 
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome only in Study CQVM149B2302, to assess potential 
incremental cardiovascular risk with LAMA use. In recent years, the safety of LAMAs in COPD patients (who 
generally suffer from more comorbidities than patients with asthma), has been well established, providing 
reassurance on cardiovascular safety within this class of medications (Wise et al 2013). For this, an 
independent, external adjudication committee to prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular safety (including 
MACE) in the Study CQVM149B2302 was established. 
In Study CQVM149B2302, adjudicated serious MACE were reported in 7 patients in the QMF149 treatment 
groups (1 patient on QMF149 high dose and 6 patients on QMF149 medium dose), 3 patients in the QVM149 
treatment groups (2 patients on QVM149 high dose and 1 patient on QVM149 medium dose) and 1 patient in 
the salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. None of the MACE outcomes were considered as related to 
study medication by the investigator. The majority of patients with adjudicated serious MACE had underlying 
confounding factors which could have potentially contributed to these events.  
Table 47 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 143/182 
  
  
The imbalance observed between QMF149 high and QMF149 medium dose treated patients in terms of CCV 
events and deaths is most likely due to chance, considering that in comparison of the pooled QMF149 high 
dose group from B2301 and B2302 and pooled QMF149 medium dose group from B2301 and B2302, there 
were higher occurrence of death and CCV events in the high dose group, yet when reviewing study B2302 
alone there were 7 MACE events in the QMF149 medium dose group compared to only 1 event in the QMF149 
high dose group. The applicant rationale that there is no biological plausibility for why a higher or indeed a 
lower steroid dose in combination with the same LABA would influence CV outcomes or deaths is considered 
reasonable and can be supported. The applicant also highlights the available literature data including recent 
Cochrane reviews for SAEs with inhaled steroids in the setting of LABA use in asthma, as well as the Busse 
publication describing the combined analysis of asthma safety trials of LABAs, which could also be considered 
supportive 
Adjudicated serious asthma outcomes 
An independent external adjudication committee was established to assess serious asthma outcomes 
(asthma-related hospitalizations, intubations and deaths). All serious asthma outcomes and deaths occurring 
from the time of randomization until 30 days after the permanent discontinuation of study drug, where 
applicable, were adjudicated. The committee consisted exclusively of external experts who were not involved 
in the study conduct, who periodically reviewed blinded, pertinent patient data and the supporting 
documentation to achieve the specified adjudication objectives. 
Asthma S-db 
In the Asthma S-db, lower occurrence rates of adjudicated serious asthma outcomes were observed in the 
QMF149 medium+high treatment group compared to the MF medium+ high treatment group for asthma-
related hospitalization (Table 2-6). There was 1 adjudicated asthma-related death in the MF medium dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 144/182 
  
  
 
 
group and no asthma-related deaths in the QMF149 groups. There was no adjudicated asthma-related 
intubation in either treatment group. 
Table 48 
Results for the QMF149 all and MF all treatment groups were consistent with those of the QMF149 
medium+high and MF medium+high treatment groups. 
In the Asthma S-db, the occurrence rate of adjudicated asthma-related hospitalization was 1.7 per 100 PY on 
QMF149 high dose and 1.0 per 100 PY on salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d., with the same rates 
observed for the composite endpoint, and no meaningful imbalance between the 2 treatment groups as 
indicated by the 95% CI for the rate difference for adjudicated asthma-related hospitalization (0.8, 95% CI: 
−0.3, 1.8) and composite endpoint (0.8, 95% CI: −0.3, 1.8) (Table 47).  
Table 49 
Asthma 6-month S-db 
Overall, results for the 6-month Asthma S-db were consistent with those of the 1-year Asthma S-db. The 
odds ratios and risk differences for the comparisons of the QMF149 medium+high treatment group vs. MF 
medium+high treatment group as well as the QMF149 high dose treatment group and the 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group for adjudicated serious asthma outcomes in the Asthma 6-
month S-db are presented in SCS Appendix. 
The applicant presented justification regarding the composite endpoint asthma related endpoints, firstly in 
that the rate difference between the composite endpoint asthma related hospitalisation of 0.8 CI (-0.2-1.8) 
as not being clinically meaningful. Whilst the total numbers are 17 vs 9 patients for QMF149 high and S/F 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 145/182 
  
  
 
 
respectively the applicant points out that one patient contributed 4 serious events (hospitalisation) and thus 
the difference in individual patients is actually 14 vs 9, which is more reassuring. The applicant also 
considered the secondary endpoint regarding the rate of severe exacerbations between QMF149 high and S/F 
as being supportive, in that there was no meaningful difference in serious asthma outcomes between QMF149 
high and S/F. Overall this data is considered reassuring and the incidence of adjudicated moderate or severe 
and severe asthma exacerbations is not different between QMF149 high dose and S/F. 
Deaths 
All death cases were evaluated by an independent adjudication committee. No asthma related deaths were 
reported in the QMF149 groups.  
In the Asthma S-db, a total of 4 deaths were reported in the QMF149 treatment group where all cases were 
reported in the QMF149 high dose group in Study CQVM149B2302. The study population of CQVM149B2302 
was older, had more severe asthma, and more comorbidities compared with patients in Study 
CQVM149B2301. One death occurred in the MF medium dose group in Study CQVM149B2301.  
Overall, there were 4 deaths in total in the QMF149 treated patients vs 1 in the MF treated patients. Of these, 
two were CV sudden deaths on the QMF149 arm (one occurred in a patient with significant CV history at 
baseline and thus this confounds a causality assessment and makes attribution to study treatment less likely; 
and the second cardiac fatality was in a patient without medical history and could be more plausible for 
relatedness to treatment). The remaining two cases of cancer and accidental death are not considered related 
to QMF149 and its safety. However, autopsy was not performed for either patient. It is notable that all deaths 
in study B2302 occurred in patients on the experimental treatments QVM 149 and QMF149 high dose with no 
corresponding deaths in the comparator S/F arm. However, as discussed above, effect of treatment 
relatedness to death is highly unlikely for 3 of 4 deaths in the QMF149 arm and there is not enough 
information on the second cardiac fatality above to make a clinical determination.  
Laboratory findings 
Safety laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, evening plasma cortisol) were 
performed as per the visit schedule as applicable for individual study protocols. 
Exposure adjusted laboratory results for the Asthma S-db were not analyzed. However, the detailed 
laboratory results are captured in the individual CSRs.  
Laboratory results in the Asthma 6-month S-db were supportive to the findings reported in the individual 
CSRs. Overall, the laboratory results in the Asthma 6-month S-db were generally consistent with the 
laboratory results in the individual studies. 
Liver function tests were done to evaluate potential drug-induced liver injury, newly occurring or worsening 
abnormalities in liver function tests was evaluated based on notable liver function test values available in 
individual CSRs.  
Hematology in the Asthma 6-month S-db 
Overall, the majority of patients had hematology values that remained within normal range at the worst post-
baseline assessment. The proportion of patients with newly occurring or worsening clinically notable 
hematological values at any time post-baseline for the Asthma 6month S-db were low and comparable 
between the QMF149 treatment groups and corresponding MF or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d 
groups (Table 3-1). The findings were generally consistent with the CSR findings, which measured all patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 146/182 
  
  
at any given time post baseline. There were no meaningful mean or median changes from baseline in 
hematology parameters for the Asthma 6-month S-db. 
Overall based on the 6-month Asthma S-db there was no demonstrable adverse haematological changes 
associated with QMF149 treatment compared to MF alone or S/F. However, it is worth considering that these 
data represent only six months of treatment with QMF149. On review of the number and percentage of 
patients with newly occurring or worsening clinically notable haematology values by visit and time point in 
the SCS Appendix, there were no consistent patterns of abnormal haematological changes. Most changes in 
haematological parameters occurred at low frequency, with the highest changes seen in reduction of 
haemoglobin, but this was relatively comparable amongst the different treatment arms.

Clinical chemistry 
Clinical chemistry in the Asthma 6-month S-db 
Overall, the majority of patients had clinical chemistry values that remained within normal range at the worst 
post-baseline assessment. The proportion of patients with newly occurring or worsening clinically notable 
clinical chemistry values at any time post-baseline for the Asthma 6-month S-db were low and comparable 
between the QMF149 treatment groups and corresponding MF or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d 
groups (Table 3-2).

Potassium 
A notable decrease in potassium (< 3 mmol/L) was recorded in 1 patient each in the MF medium+high 
treatment group and QMF149 high dose treatment group, but the notable increase in potassium (> 6 
mmol/L) was recorded in 2.4% to 3.3% patients across treatment groups (Table 3-2). 
During the study, it was discovered that high potassium values were observed (> 6 mmol/L) in some patients 
in CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302 study. These were reported for different patients over different visits 
and time points with no discernible pattern. Based on an investigation with the laboratory vendor, it was 
determined that the most likely reason was an error of sample handling before analysis (pre-analytical error) 
either at the site level or during transport. Despite suspected sample handling error by the laboratory, a 
thorough safety assessment was still done. There was no apparent relation of hyperkalemia to treatment 
timing (occurred at both baseline and post baseline) and no patients with elevated potassium had safety 
issues which may be associated with hyperkalemia (i.e. ECG changes). 
Although, high potassium levels (> 6.0 mmol/L) were observed in 2.5% to 4.3% patients across all 
treatment groups in Study CQVM149B2301 and in 3.6% to 6.8% patients across all treatment groups in 
Study CQVM149B2302, no consistent pattern was found with respect to the study treatments across the 
treatment groups.  
Hypokalemia is one of the known risks for β2 agonists, therefore serum potassium data, (excluding flagged 
values > 6.0 mmol/L), were summarized in order to evaluate the decline of serum potassium from baseline. 
No decrease from baseline of serum potassium value for mean and median values was observed in any 
treatment group.  
Glucose 
Overall, the proportion of patients with a notable increase in glucose (>9.99 mmol/L) was low (≤3.9% in any 
treatment group), with marginal differences between the QMF149 treatment groups compared with the 
corresponding MF group (2.7% vs. 3.5%, respectively) or QMF149 high dose treatment group compared with 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group (3.9% vs. 3.3%, respectively) (Table 49).

Overall, the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 newly occurring or worsening liver function test elevations were 
low (≤ 2.7% in any treatment group) and comparable between the treatment groups.  Combinations of total 
bilirubin elevation with Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate Aminotransferase (ALT/AST) elevations or 
alkaline phosphatase elevations were not seen for any of the treatment groups. 
Plasma cortisol 
On review of plasma cortisol changes between treatment arms, the maximum post baseline change for 
QMF149 medium+high was 4.7 compared to 2.8nmol/L for the MF medium+high dose and for the high dose 
QMF149 was 4.1 compared to S/F 50/500 which was -13.8nmol/L. Therefore, treatment with QMF149 
appeared to have more modest effects on plasma cortisol levels with time, compared to S/F 50/500 and did 
not show any evidence of plasma cortisol level suppression. However, it is acknowledged that study duration 
was <1 year for many of the included patients and thus effects on HPA axis, a known steroid side effect, may 
not be fully characterised for QMF149. 
Urinalysis for the Asthma 6-month S-db 
There were no meaningful changes from baseline in any urinalysis parameters for the Asthma 6-month S-db. 
Vital signs data presentation and results 
Asthma 6-month S-db 
Overall, the majority of patients had vital signs values that remained within normal range at the worst post-
baseline assessment. The proportion of patients with newly occurring or worsening clinically notable vital 
signs at any time post baseline for the Asthma 6-month S-db were low (≤1% in any treatment group) and 
comparable between the QMF149 treatment groups and corresponding MF or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 
µg b.i.d groups (Table 50).  
Table 52 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 150/182 
  
  
 
Overall there were no major differences in vital sign results during treatment with QMF149 compared to MF 
alone or S/F. The only notable finding was potentially higher systolic and diastolic BP values with QMF149 
high dose compared to equivalent dose S/F treatment. However overall numbers were low.  
Height and weight 
Vital signs with summary statistics including change from baseline of height and weight of adolescent 
patients at Week 26 for the Asthma 6-month S-db are presented in Table 4-2. For the height and weight of 
adolescent patients in the Asthma 6-month S-db, the analysis of minimum and maximum values, and the 
analysis of change from baseline did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences between the treatment 
groups. 
Table 53 
Overall  there  did  not  appear  to  be  any  consistent  trends  for  adverse  changes  in  height  or  weight  for  the 
adolescent  subjects,  however,  it  is  noted  that  there  were  low  numbers  included  in  this  analysis  and  that 
there was only 6 months of treatment, thus making results difficult to interpret. 
Electrocardiograms 
ECG  measurements  included  ventricular  rate,  QT  interval,  RR  interval,  PR  interval,  QRS  duration,  and 
Fridericia’s QTc (calculated as QTcF = QT / 3√RR (in seconds), where 3√ denotes the cube root).

Electrocardiogram data presentation and results 
Asthma 6-months S-db 
Overall, the majority of patients had Fridericia’s QTc values that remained within normal range at the worst 
post-baseline assessment. The proportion of patients with newly occurring or worsening Fridericia’s QTc 
values at any time post baseline for the Asthma 6-month S-db were comparable between the QMF149 
treatment groups and corresponding MF or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d groups (Table 4-3). There 
were no patients with recorded newly occurring or worsening Fridericia’s QTc values > 500 ms at any time 
post baseline. Overall, increase from baseline in Fridericia’s QTc > 60 ms was noted in 1 patient each in the 
QMF149 medium+high and MF medium+high groups, but no increase > 60 ms was noted on QMF149 high or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d groups.  
Table 54 
There were no meaningful mean or median changes from baseline in ECG parameters for the Asthma 6-
month S-db. There were no meaningful differences between the treatment groups. 
No formal TQT study has been performed for QMF149 and the applicant has not discussed this in the SCS.  
Safety in special populations 
No dedicated studies were conducted in special safety populations such as patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. The clinical pharmacology program for QMF149 was based on data from the authorized 
individual components.  
Intrinsic factors  
Subgroup analyses were performed on the Asthma S-db for the following safety topics: 
•  Duration of exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 153/182 
  
  
 
 
•  AEs 
•  SAEs 
•  AEs of special interest 
Subgroup analyses by duration of exposure 
In general, exposure by subgroups was consistent with the overall exposure within each treatment group.  
Subgroup analyses of non-serious AEs 
In summary, subgroup analyses of non-serious AEs were consistent with the primary safety analysis where a 
lower occurrence rate of AEs were observed across the QMF149 treatment groups (the QMF149 
medium+high, QMF all and QMF149 high dose treatment groups) compared to their respective comparators 
(MF medium+high, MF all and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d. treatment groups). Overall, review of 
pooled subgroup data did not reveal any outliers in non-serious AEs that would alter the interpretation of 
safety of QMF149. 
Subgroup analysis of non-serious AEs by age groups 
By age (< 18 years, ≥ 18 years) 
For the subgroup of patients <18 years as well as those ≥18 years, results were consistent with the primary 
safety analyses, i.e., a lower occurrence rate of total AEs were observed across all QMF149 treatment groups 
compared to their respective comparators.  
The most frequently reported AE in the < 18 years age group was asthma (exacerbations) with an occurrence 
rate that was lower in the QMF149 treatment groups than the corresponding MF groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group.  
Other AEs showed similar trends in general (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and virus 
upper respiratory tract infection) or lower occurrence rates. None of the AEs related to suppression of growth 
were reported. In addition, as shown above in Table 4-2, the analysis of minimum and maximum values, and 
the analysis of change from baseline of height and weight did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences 
between the treatment groups in the adolescent population. 
By age (12 to 15 years, 16 to < 18 years, 18 to 64 years, ≥ 65 years) 
The largest subgroup category in this analysis were those patients between 18 to 64 years, reflective of the 
age inclusion criteria across the 3 key safety studies. For the subgroup of patients between 18 to 64 years, 
consistent with the main safety analyses, the occurrence rate of total AEs across treatment groups were 
lower in the QMF149 treatment groups vs. their respective comparators. 
For the subgroup of patients aged 12 to 15 years and 16 to < 18 years, no meaningful differences were 
observed between treatment groups in total AEs as the number of patients were too small to make 
meaningful conclusions. 
In the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 years, consistent with the safety analyses in the overall population, the 
occurrence rate of total AEs across treatment groups were lower across QMF149 treatment groups compared 
with MF treatment groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most commonly affected 
SOCs were respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders (specifically due to PT asthma (exacerbations)) and 
infections and infestations (mainly due to PT nasopharyngitis), with lower occurrence rates in the QMF149 
treatment groups compared to their respective comparators. 
Assessment report

Subgroup analyses of Serious AEs (SAEs) 
Subgroup analyses of SAEs were consistent with the SAE analysis in the overall population for the Asthma S-
db. The occurrence rates of SAEs in the QMF149 treatment groups were comparable with the corresponding 
MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most commonly affected SOC across all SAE 
subgroups (i.e., by age, gender, race etc.) was infections and infestations (specifically due to PT pneumonia). 
Review of SAE subgroup data did not reveal any outliers that would alter the interpretation of safety of 
QMF149 therapy. Note, the number of patients in some of the subgroups were low and hence, results should 
be interpreted with caution.  
Subgroup analysis of SAEs by age groups:  
By age (< 18 years, ≥ 18 years) 
The SAEs adjusted for exposure, by age (< 18 years, ≥ 18 years), primary SOC and PT in the Asthma S-db 
are provided in SCS Appendix. In the subgroup of patients < 18 years, all SAEs were single events with no 
obvious clustering in any SOC, and no meaningful differences were observed between the QMF149 treatment 
groups and corresponding MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. 
Consistent with the SAE analyses in the overall population, the occurrence rates of SAEs in the 
subgroup of patients ≥ 18 years were comparable between the QMF149 treatment groups and the 
corresponding MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most commonly 
affected SOC in this age group was infections and infestations (primarily driven by PT 
pneumonia). One adolescent patient on MF 400 µg (medium dose) in Study CQVM149B2301 died 
on Day 314 due to status asthmaticus, as referred to previously.By age (12 to 15 years, 16 to < 18 
years, 18 to 64 years, ≥ 65 years) 
The largest subgroup age category in this analysis were patients aged 18 to 64 years, reflective of the age 
inclusion criteria across the 3 pivotal studies. For the subgroup of patients between 18 to 64 years, consistent 
with the SAE analyses for the overall population, the occurrence rates of SAEs were comparable in the 
QMF149 treatment groups vs. corresponding MF treatment groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d 
group. The most commonly affected SOC in this age group category was infections and infestations (mainly 
driven by PT pneumonia). One adolescent patient on MF 400 µg (medium dose) in Study CQVM149B2301 
died on Day 314 due to status asthmaticus. 
For the subgroup of patients 12 to 15 years and 16 to < 18 years, the number of patients were small and the 
SAEs reported were single events with no obvious clustering in any SOC; thus, no meaningful differences 
were observed between the QMF149 treatment groups and corresponding MF groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. 
In the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 years, consistent with the safety analyses in the overall population, the 
occurrence rate of all SAEs in the QMF149 treatment groups were comparable with the corresponding MF 
groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most commonly affected SOCs were respiratory 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (specifically due to PT asthma (exacerbations), which was reported in ≤ 3 
patients in any treatment group) and infections and infestations (mainly due to PT pneumonia which was 
reported in ≤ 2 patients in any treatment group).  
Subgroup analyses of AESIs 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 155/182 
  
  
Subgroup analyses of AESIs were consistent with the AESI analyses in the overall population for the Asthma 
S-db. The occurrence rates of AESIs in the QMF149 treatment groups were lower compared with the 
corresponding MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group.  
Subgroup analyses of AESIs by age groups 
By age <18 and ≥ 18 years 
The subgroup of patients ≥ 18 years comprised the majority of this subgroup analysis, consistent with 
inclusion criteria for the 3 pivotal studies that make up the pooled analyses. For the subgroup of patients <18 
years, the number of patients across the 6 treatment groups were low and should be taken into consideration 
when interpreting results. Overall, for both subgroups of patients ≥18 and those <18 years, consistent with 
the main safety analyses, no meaningful imbalances were observed in the occurrence rate of total AESIs 
across treatment groups in the QMF149 treatment groups vs. their respective comparators.  
By age (12 to 15 years, 16 to < 18 years, 18 to 64 years, ≥ 65 years) 
The exposure-adjusted AESIs by age (12 to 15 years, 16 to <18 years, 18 to 64 years, ≥ 65 years), primary 
SOC and PT in the Asthma S-db are presented in SCS Appendix. The largest subgroup age category in this 
analysis were patients aged 18 to 64 years, reflective of the age inclusion criteria across the 3 pivotal studies. 
For the subgroup of patients between 18 to 64 years, consistent with the AESI analyses for the overall 
population, the occurrence rates were lower in the QMF149 treatment groups vs. the corresponding MF 
treatment groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most common AESI in this age group 
category was hypersensitivity (mainly driven by PT asthma included in this category) and immunosuppression 
(driven by the PT bronchitis). 
For the subgroup of patients 12 to 15 years and 16 to <18 years, the number of patients were low and the 
AESIs reported had no obvious clustering in any SOC, and no meaningful differences were observed between 
the QMF149 treatment groups and corresponding MF groups or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. 
For the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 years, consistent with the AESI analyses for the overall population, the 
occurrence rates were lower in the QMF149 treatment groups vs. the corresponding MF treatment groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. The most common AESI in this age group category was 
hypersensitivity (mostly due to PT asthma (exacerbations) included in this category), CCV events any 
category (mostly due to CCV events: Ischaemic heart disease) and immunosuppression (specifically due to 
PT bronchitis). 
Subgroup analyses of CCV AESIs for the Asthma S-db 
CCV AESIs by number of CCV risk factors at baseline 
For the subgroup of patients without CCV risk factors at baseline, the total number of CCV episodes (as well 
as occurrence rate) per 100 PY across the treatment groups was low with no meaningful differences between 
treatment groups. Similar findings were observed for each of the CCV categories by PT (e.g., atrial 
fibrillation, atrioventricular block). Of note, reflective of the exclusion criteria across the 3 key safety studies 
(CQVM149B2301, CQVM149B2302, and CQVM149B2303), the subgroups of patients with CCV risk factors at 
baseline were limited and not reflective of the wide spectrum of CCV events.  
For the subgroup of patients with 1 to 2 CCV risk factors at baseline, the occurrence rates for the total 
number of CCV events were comparable across all treatment groups with the exception of the QMF149 high 
and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d treatment groups, where a slightly higher occurrence rate was 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 156/182 
  
  
observed (7.1 vs 4.8 per 100 PY, respectively). In addition, for those with 1 to 2 CCV risk factors at baseline, 
the QMF149 high dose group had a slightly higher occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia terms: tachyarrhythmias 
(1.8 vs 0.6 per 100 PY respectively), driven by the PT tachycardia included in this category (0.9 vs 0.4 per 
100 PY, respectively). However, the actual number of episodes was 4 vs 2, respectively, and hence, careful 
consideration should be taken when interpreting results with the low number of events as these may be more 
due to chance findings. 
CCV AESIs by history of cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation/flutter 
For the subgroup of patients with no history of cardiac arrhythmias at baseline, the occurrence of all CCV 
AESIs were comparable across all treatment groups. Further, the number of episodes per 100 PY of exposure 
for each CCV AESI category was low with no meaningful differences in occurrence rates across all treatment 
comparisons. 
For the subgroup of patients with no history of atrial fibrillation/flutter at baseline, the occurrence of total 
CCV AESIs were comparable across all treatment groups.  
For the subgroup of patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation/flutter at baseline, the 
total number of PY was too low to make any meaningful conclusions across treatment groups. 
CCV AESIs by diabetes mellitus at baseline 
Of note, reflective of the exclusion criteria across the 3 key safety studies (CQVM149B2301, CQVM149B2302, 
and CQVM149B2303), the subgroups of patients with uncontrolled diabetes at baseline were limited and not 
reflective of the wide spectrum diabetes mellitus. 
For the subgroup of patients without diabetes at baseline, the occurrence of total CCV AESIs across all 
treatment groups was low with no meaningful difference between treatment groups. Similar findings were 
observed for each of the CCV categories by PT (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block). 
Non-CCV AESIs by presence of cataract or glaucoma at baseline 
Of note, reflective of the exclusion criteria across the 3 key safety studies (CQVM149B2301, CQVM149B2302, 
and CQVM149B2303), the subgroups of patients with presence of cataract or glaucoma at baseline were 
limited. 
For the subgroup of patients without cataract or glaucoma at baseline, the occurrence of total non-CCV AESIs 
were lower across all QMF149 treatment groups compared with corresponding MF groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group. Across all treatment groups, these differences were driven by 
hypersensitivity (inclusive of the PT asthma) and immunosuppression (inclusive of the PTs bronchitis). 
Immunological events 
The two most common risk category of AESIs across all treatment groups were hypersensitivity and 
immunosuppression, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 157/182 
  
  
Drug interactions  
The potential for systemic PK interaction between indacaterol acetate and MF is low based on in vitro data 
and clinical drug interaction studies conducted for the indacaterol maleate (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC), and 
MF (Asmanex Twisthaler SmPC) monotherapy development programs. 
No specific interaction studies were conducted with Bemrist Breezhaler. Information on the potential for 
interactions is based on the monotherapy components, which is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Specific drug interactions based on monotherapy components 
Interactions linked to QMF149: Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by QMF149 at clinical 
doses are considered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Concomitant administration of orally inhaled indacaterol and mometasone furoate under steady-state 
conditions did not affect the pharmacokinetics of any of the active substances. No formal drug interaction 
studies were conducted with QMF149. Information on the potential for interactions is based on the potential 
for each of its monotherapy components.  
Medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval: QMF149, like other medicinal products containing β2-
adrenergic agonists, should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the 
QT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia.  
Hypokalemia: Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or nonpotassium-sparing 
diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalemic effect of β2-adrenergic agonists. 
Beta-adrenergic blockers: Beta-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonize the effect of β2-adrenergic 
agonists. Therefore, QMF149 should not be given together with β-adrenergic blockers unless there are 
compelling reasons for their use. Where required, cardio-selective β-adrenergic blockers should be preferred, 
although they should be administered with caution. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: Inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp, has no 
impact on safety of therapeutic doses of QMF149. Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance 
(CYP3A4 and P-gp) or MF clearance (CYP3A4), raises the systemic exposure of indacaterol or MF up to two-
fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to drug interactions does not raise any safety concerns given 
the safety experience of treatment with indacaterol in clinical trials of up to one year at doses of 600 µg. Due 
to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant drug interactions are 
unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased systemic exposure to MF when strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co-administered. 
Other long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists: The co-administration of QMF149 with other long-acting 
β2-adrenergic agonists containing medicinal products has not been studied and is not recommended as it 
may potentiate adverse reactions. 
Relevant potential interactions are captured in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Adverse events leading to permanent study drug discontinuation 
Asthma S-db 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 158/182 
  
  
The AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug in the Asthma S-db are summarized in Table 2-
10. Overall, the occurrence rates of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were lower in the 
QMF149 treatment groups vs. the corresponding MF treatment groups or the salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 
µg b.i.d group. The most frequent AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was asthma 
(exacerbation). There were no patients in the QMF149 medium+high and QMF149 all treatment groups 
where patients had discontinued treatment due to asthma exacerbation as compared to the corresponding MF 
or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d groups. 
The occurrence rate of all other AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were ≤ 0.4 per 100 
PY with no meaningful differences between the QMF149 treatment groups vs. corresponding MF groups or 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group (Table 53). 
Table 55 
Adverse events leading to dose interruption or adjustment 
No dose adjustments were permitted during the studies. A total of 92 patients experienced AEs leading to 
dose interruption across the 3 studies (41 patients in CQVM149B2301, 7 patients CQVM149B2303, and 44 
patients in CQVM149B2302). The most common AE leading to dose interruption was asthma (exacerbation) 
[Study CQVM149B2301-Listing 16.2.7-1.1], [Study CQVM149B2303-Listing 16.2.7-1.1] and [Study 
CQVM149B2302-Listing 16.2.7-1.1]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 159/182 
  
  
 
Overall, there was no imbalance between treatment groups with regard to AE leading to dose interruption 
across the 3 key studies. 
Post marketing experience 
There has been no post-marketing experience as QMF149 is not yet approved. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety is primarily based on three pivotal studies which contribute to two pooled datasets; 
Asthma S-db (provides exposure adjusted occurrence rates considering all available data) and Asthma 6-
month S-db (provides event frequency, up to week 26 assessment only). 
In terms of the pooled comparisons it should be noted that the only comparison including the study 
population from study 2302, is that comparing QMF149 high dose with salmeterol/fluticasone. 
At the time of dossier submission, the two larger pivotal trials 2301 and 2302 were still ongoing, but both 
have now completed and the CSR II with completed 52-week data for studies B2301 and B2302 have been 
submitted.  
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant presented a summary of the cardiovascular safety data, for each of the 
individual earlier phase studies. These studies did not raise any additional concerns in terms of cardiovascular 
safety and overall support that treatment with QMF149 does not increase CV risk in the asthma population. 
Patient Exposure 
Overall, duration of treatment exposure was comparable amongst the treatment arms in the Asthma S-db. 
For both QMF149 medium and high doses, the ICH Guideline on the extent of population exposure to assess 
clinical safety for therapies intended for long-term treatment of non-life-threatening conditions (ICH E1 1994) 
can be considered fulfilled. However, for QMF149 low dose, which was evaluated in study 2303 alone, study 
duration was only 12 weeks. Thus; for the lower dose the guideline requirement is not considered to have 
been met. However, considering the higher doses have adequate exposure data, this was considered to be 
acceptable by CHMP. 
For the adolescent population which comprised <200 patients overall between studies 2301 and 2303. 
Overall 69 adolescent patients were exposed to QMF149 in the combined programme for at least 1 year as 
agreed with PDCO. The observed safety profile in adults is consistent with that seen in the overall population. 
In light of the agreed PIP, the submitted adolescent safety data could be considered sufficient to support an 
indication in this population.  
Patient Disposition 
Overall patient discontinuation rates were balanced between groups in the Asthma S-db. Compared to the MF 
alone groups, there were lower numbers of premature discontinuations overall in the QMF149 groups. The 
most common reason for premature discontinuation for all treatment groups was subject/guardian decision. 
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant clarified that if the patient withdraws informed consent, it was 
categorized as subject/guardian decision in eCRF. Further, the applicant clarified that <5% of these cases 
were reported as AEs and the applicant confirmed that these AEs were appropriately recorded in the safety 
database. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 160/182 
  
  
There were fewer premature discontinuations due to AEs for both QMF149 groups (medium+high and all) 
compared to both MF alone (medium+high and all) and S/F groups. 
There were no notable differences in the adolescent population compared to the adult population for 
premature discontinuations. In study 2301, discontinuations due to AEs were also lower in QMF149 treated 
adolescent patients (n=2) compared to MF treated adolescent patients (n=7). Available safety data for 
adolescent patients in QMF149 development programme can be considered comparable to the adult data.  
Demographics 
In terms of patient demographics, there was under-representation of some key groups in the three pivotal 
trials. Patients >/=65 years comprised less than 20% of the enrolled population in these trials. However, the 
applicant’s position that the safety profile has been adequately characterised in patients >65 years and is in 
line with ICH guidelines can be accepted. Black patients also comprised less than 1.5% of the participant 
population across these trials; taking into consideration that a different safety profile is not expected in this 
population, CHMP agreed that this issue will not be further pursued.   
At baseline there were more patients in the MF (medium+high and all) and S/F groups with 3 or more CCV 
risk factors compared to the QMF149 (medium+high, all and high) groups, in the Asthma S-db. This could 
suggest that the QMF149 treated patients may have had a lower baseline CV risk at enrolment. However, 
baseline history of cardiac arrhythmias was slightly higher in the QMF149 treated patient groups, thus the 
above concern for imbalance could be considered negated. 
Adverse Events 
Overall, the data for common adverse events for QMF149 compared to both MF and S/F could be considered 
favourable. There were lower occurrence rates of total AEs per SOC in the QMF149 treatment groups 
compared with the corresponding MF and salmeterol/fluticasone treatment groups. Exceptions were for 
slightly higher occurrence rates in the QMF149 groups compared to the corresponding MF alone groups for 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, vascular disorders, renal and 
urinary disorders, eye disorders and psychiatric disorders. 
The 5 most frequently reported AEs overall, consistent with this class of medicines, were asthma 
exacerbations, nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, and bronchitis. There were 
lower occurrence rates of asthma exacerbation, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections for 
patients in QMF149 groups compared to MF alone groups, and there was no meaningful difference in 
occurrence rates of headache or bronchitis between these groups. Similarly, there was a lower occurrence 
rate of asthma exacerbations, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and URTIs for the QMF149 high dose group 
compared to S/F group. However, there was a slight trend for increased occurrence rate of headache in 
QMF149 high dose group compared to S/F 50/500 group (6.9 vs 6.4 respectively). Consequently, an update 
of the summary of safety profile has been introduced in section 4.8 of the SmPC in line with the SmPC GL to 
reflect the most frequent and most serious ADRs i.e. Asthma exacerbations, nasopharyngitis, headache and 
upper respiratory tract infections. 
There was an increased occurrence rate of dysphonia for patients treated with QMF149 groups compared to 
the MF and S/F groups. Occurrence rates overall were still relatively low, not exceeding 2.5, and dysphonia 
has been appropriately identified as a common adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
There was also a higher occurrence rate for back pain in the QMF149 groups compared to the MF and S/F 
groups. Section 4.8 of the SmPC includes musculoskeletal pain, and the applicant has included back pain in 
the footnotes in grouping of PTs in this section.

When compared to the MF alone groups, there was a slightly higher occurrence rate of hypertension seen 
with the corresponding QMF149 groups. The applicant considered that the differences observed in high 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure seen with QMF149 compared to MF or S/F were small and overall 
comparable. Considering patients on all treatment groups including QMF149 had incidence of hypertension 
</=1.2% at most, the majority of patients did not have reported high or low blood pressure recorded, the 
applicant position is accepted. 
Consistent with the Asthma S-db, the Asthma 6-month S-db also showed a lower overall proportion of AEs in 
the QMF149 medium+high treatment group vs. MF medium+high group (51.1% vs. 58.2%) and QMF149 
high group vs. salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d group (55.5% vs. 59.7%). For the frequency measure 
used in the 6-month Asthma S-db, percentage of patients who reported an event, the differences in 
percentage of AEs between QMF149 and either MF alone or S/F, whilst still favouring QMF149, are more 
comparable and demonstrate less of reduction in AEs seen with QMF149 compared to MF or S/F. Thus, whilst 
still demonstrating overall lower % of AEs in the QMF149 arm, the differences are perhaps less favourable 
compared to differences in occurrence rates per 100 PY as reported in the Asthma S-db. The 6-month 
Asthma S-db may be a more informative presentation of AEs in that there are no assumptions made that AEs 
occur at the same frequency overtime.  
On review of Asthma 6-month S-db, there were higher incidence of eye disorders for QMF medium + high 
compared to MF medium + high (1.0 vs 0.6) and for QMF149 high compared to S/F (0.9 vs 0.6). The PTs of 
>/=0.2 consisted of cataract and vision blurred. Considering ‘vision blurred’ was a reason for permanent 
discontinuation of QMF149 medium+high (0.3), QMF149 all (0.2) and QMF149 high (0.1), with 0 
discontinuations in the respective comparator arms and as requested by CHMP, the applicant updated the 
SmPC section 4.8 to include eye disorders accounting for cataract and blurred vision. 
Drug-related adverse events 
Overall, adverse events considered to be study drug related were quite low across treatment groups. 
AESIs 
Hypersensitivity, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia and CCV events were defined as the 
most common AESIs. 
Although, not included in the most common AESIs, there was also a slightly higher occurrence of bone 
fracture in the QMF149 high dose group compared to the S/F group (1.7 vs 1.0 respectively). It appears that 
bone mineral density was only analysed in study 2302, the applicant has not described in protocol 2302 how 
bone mineral density was monitored in order to provide these results. However, considering the duration of 
these studies with a maximum of 52 weeks exposure, the limitation in interpreting such results is 
acknowledged. The applicant will monitor this in the post marketing setting and provide updated information 
in PSUR. 
Hypersensitivity and immunosuppression 
In both cases, lower occurrence rates were seen for QMF149 (medium+high, all and high) groups compared 
to MF (medium+high and all) or S/F groups. 
CCV AESIs 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 162/182 
  
  
 
For the Asthma S-db there was a trend towards higher total occurrence rate of CCV events for QMF149 
treatment groups; QMF149 medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (3.9 vs 3.7), QMF149 all vs MF all 
(3.7 vs 3.5) and between QMF149 high dose vs S/F (5.2 vs 4.2). A Major Objection was raised and the 
applicant provided a thorough discussion of the slight imbalance seen in CCV events and deaths and a 
discussion on individual cases of deaths, with only 1 of the 2 CV deaths potentially considered for causality. 
An autopsy was not performed and 1 death could also possibly be attributable to chance. The other 3 deaths 
were not considered as having any relationship to treatment. The 3 cases of PE did not raise concerns for 
relatedness to treatment considering confounding factors of underlying malignancy and recent trauma. 
Overall the applicant’s justification was accepted by CHMP.  
Within this group, higher occurrence rates specifically for Cardiac arrhythmia terms*: ‘Conduction 
abnormalities’ and ‘Tachyarrhythmias’ and ‘CCV events: Myocardial infarction’ were reported for QMF149 
groups compared to MF and S/F groups. 
There was a higher total occurrence rate of conduction abnormalities for QMF149 treatment groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.8 vs 0.1), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.8 vs 0.1) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (0.5 vs 0.3). However, for most cases in QMF149 treated patients the patient also 
had an abnormal ECG at baseline and/or screening or had a history of cardiovascular disease. Most of the 
cases were not considered related by the investigator and no changes were made to study treatment. 
Therefore, the imbalance could be considered to be due to underlying patient characteristics in the respective 
groups. However, and as requested by CHMP, the applicant committed to a close monitoring of the AE 
conduction abnormality in the post authorisation setting and to provide regular updates in the PSUR.  
Tachyarrhythmias were also reported with a higher occurrence rate for QMF149 groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.5 vs 0.3), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.5 vs 0.2) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (1.2 vs 0.5). Tachycardia has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Myocardial infarction was also reported with a higher occurrence rate for QMF149 groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.3 vs 0), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.2 vs 0) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (0.5 vs 0.2). However, CHMP acknowledges that the overall event frequency is 
considered very low to draw any meaningful conclusions at present. 
Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia 
The applicant concludes that there were no meaningful differences across treatment groups observed for 
hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus. However, there was a definite trend towards higher occurrence rate of this 
AE in all QMF149 groups, therefore its’ inclusion as an ADR in section 4.8 of SmPC is endorsed.  
Further, as the exclusion criteria did not allow enrolment of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or 
uncontrolled Type 2 DM. The applicant agreed to highlight this in the SmPC and added the following 
statement in the SmPC section 4.4: ‘Bemrist Breezhaler has not been investigated in patients with Type I 
diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus’. 
Serious AEs of special interest 
Similarly, there was a slightly higher occurrence rate for serious AESIs for the high dose QMF149 group 
compared to the S/F group, 10.2 vs 8.1 respectively. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
contributed the primary imbalance 2.1 vs 1.5. The applicant’s assessment that the imbalance was not 
clinically meaningful in relation to QMF149 treatment is accepted by CHMP. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 163/182 
  
  
On review of SAEs per SOC, occurrence rates overall were lower in the QMF149 medium + high and QMF149 
all dose arms compared to the respective MF arms. Occurrence rates of all SAEs, including asthma 
exacerbation, were however slightly higher in the QMF149 high dose treated patients (10.7) compared to S/F 
50/500 treated patients (8.9).  
Serious asthma outcomes are driven by asthma related hospitalisation, 1.7 in the QMF149 high dose group 
compared to 1.0 in the S/F group respectively. Upon request by CHMP, the applicant presented justification 
regarding the composite endpoint asthma related endpoints, firstly in that the rate difference between the 
composite endpoint asthma related hospitalisation of 0.8 CI (-0.2-1.8) as not being clinically meaningful. 
Whilst the total numbers are 17 vs 9 patients for QMF149 high and S/F respectively the applicant points out 
that one patient contributed 4 serious events (hospitalisation) and thus the difference in individual patients is 
actually 14 vs 9, which is more reassuring. The applicant also considered the secondary endpoint regarding 
the rate of severe exacerbations between QMF149 high and S/F as being supportive, in that there was no 
meaningful difference in serious asthma outcomes between QMF149 high and S/F. Overall this data is 
considered reassuring and the incidence of adjudicated moderate or severe and severe asthma exacerbations 
is not different between QMF149 high dose and S/F. 
Specific SAEs:  Adjudicated serious CCV AEs by MACE outcome 
The applicant concludes that the majority of patients with adjudicated serious MACE had underlying 
confounding factors which could have potentially contributed to the CV events. However, there was still a 
discernible imbalance in occurrence of MACE in the QMF149 treated patients compared to MF alone or S/F 
treated patients which was only assessed in study B2302. The MO concerning CV safety is now considered 
resolved following the applicant response at D121. In general, it is acknowledged the imbalance is considered 
relatively low. Furthermore, in considering MACE events, at 52 week follow up there was 1 event in QMF149 
high, 7 events in QMF149 medium and 1 event in S/F groups respectively for study B2302. 
The applicant outlines that there is no biological rationale as to why a lower dose of ICS (MF) in QMF149 
medium dose would have a higher MACE event occurrence compared to the QMF149 higher dose which is 
supported by the Rapporteur and agreed that the imbalance is more likely due to chance. 
Deaths 
In the Asthma S-db there was a slight, but discernible, imbalance in the number of deaths between 
treatment arms. 4 deaths in the QMF149 high dose group and 1 patient in the MF medium dose group. The 
investigator did not consider any of the deaths to be related to the study drug. 
All 4 deaths on QMF149 high dose group occurred in study 2302 and the applicant justifies that the study 
population in CQVM149B2302 were older, had more severe asthma, and more comorbidities compared with 
patients in study CQVM149B2301. In the QMF149 treated groups, 2 of the deaths due to a train accident 
and malignancy respectively could be considered not relevant to drug safety assessment. The other two 
deaths were both sudden cardiac death and both occurred only in the QMF149 high dose group. An autopsy 
was not performed in either of these sudden cardiac deaths. One of the cases had multiple risk factors that 
could have contributed to the cardiac event. Therefore, it is plausible that this may not have been study 
drug related. For the second sudden cardiac death there was no information to draw a conclusion on 
relatedness or not to QMF149 treatment. 
In the MF treated adolescent patient who died, the cause of death was status asthmaticus.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 164/182 
  
  
At the cut-off point 15 Jan 2019 there was only one additional death reported for ongoing study 2301 and 
this patient developed multiple complications post GI perforation that resulted in death and was not 
considered study drug related. The applicant confirmed that this patient was on MF treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
The incidence of clinical chemistry abnormalities within the 6-month Asthma S-db was generally quite low. 
There was a slight imbalance in the incidence of hyperglycemia for QMF149 high dose group (3.9%) 
compared to S/F treated group (3.3%). However, hyperglycemia is a known side effect of corticosteroid use 
and is adequately characterised in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC for QMF149.  
There was a higher incidence of hyperkalemia than expected, especially considering known association 
between beta-2 agonists and hypokalemia. The applicant has concluded that the most likely reason was an 
error of sample handling before analysis (pre-analytical error) either at the site level or during transport. The 
applicant provided more detail including report that the root cause analysis which determined that these were 
false positive high readings without associated clinical findings. The applicant confirmed this was related to 
results from one specific laboratory, ECL, who have confirmed this was not a QC or proficiency testing issue 
and that other laboratory results would not have been affected. Instead these high potassium values are 
considered attributable to pre-analytical error which was presumed to cause hemolysis of samples. In the 
case of patients with the falsely elevated potassium readings there were no associated ECG or clinical 
abnormalities. The applicant also states that from the other studies in the QMF/QVM clinical programme using 
different laboratories, the incidence of hyperkalemia was <1%.  
The applicant also presents an analysis of potassium readings from the three studies 2303, 2210 and 2306 in 
which the applicant reports a different central laboratory was used and in which there was no differences in 
mean serum potassium value changes from baseline or percentage of patients with high potassium levels 
during treatment period across all treatment groups. Regarding the concern for thus hypokalemia, the overall 
numbers were low. For the three studies in which a different laboratory was used there was 1 case of low 
potassium in study 2306 and 5 cases in study 2210 and no cases in study 2303. 
Plasma cortisol 
Treatment with QMF149 appeared to have more modest effects on plasma cortisol levels with time, 
compared to S/F 50/500 and did not show any signal for plasma cortisol level suppression. However, it is 
acknowledged that study duration was <1 year for many of the included patients and thus effects on HPA 
axis, a known steroid side effect, may not be fully characterised for QMF149. Appropriate warnings on the 
systemic side effects of inhaled steroids have been incorporated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Vital signs 
Overall there were no major differences in vital sign results during treatment with QMF149 compared to MF 
alone or S/F.  
The only notable finding was potentially higher systolic and diastolic BP values with QMF149 high dose 
compared to equivalent dose S/F treatment. However overall numbers were low. Considering, there also 
appeared to be higher AEs of hypertension in QMF149 groups compared to MF alone groups, the applicant 
was requested by CHMP to justify whether hypertension/blood pressure should be closely monitored in the 
postmarketing setting. Overall, the imbalance in hypertension cases seen between QMF149 high and S/F are 
small, systolic 0.8 vs 0.1 and diastolic 1.2 vs 0.7. When looking at the change from baseline in mmHg for 
systolic and diastolic pressures for the different treatment arms the changes are relatively similar with no 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 165/182 
  
  
striking differences. Thus, the applicant response to not follow up blood pressure specifically in the PSUR was 
accepted by CHMP. 
ECGs 
On review of QTc values and increases from baseline in the Asthma 6-month S-db, the results were 
comparable across treatment arms with no discernible signal for increased risk with QMF149 compared to MF 
alone or S/F. 
Subgroup analyses: Adverse events analysed by age group 
Overall occurrence rates of adverse events adjusted by age < 18 and >/= 18 years showed a similar pattern 
of lower occurrence rates in the QMF149 treated patients compared to the comparator groups of MF alone 
and S/F. 
The safety profile for adolescents who were included in the QMF149 development programme has not raised 
any specific concerns, however any conclusions are limited considering the low number of patients enrolled. 
This will be further monitored in the post marketing setting. 
Patients >/=65 years 
There were fewer patients enrolled who were >/=65 years however the applicant justifies that the submitted 
data fulfils ICH requirements. 
For overall AEs in patients >/=65, there were lower occurrence rates in the QMF149 groups compared to the 
MF alone and S/F groups. However, for cardiac disorders there were slightly more AEs in the QMF high dose 
group compared to the S/F 50/500 group in the subgroup >65 years with at least 1 CCV event, 10.7% vs 
4.4% respectively. The applicant attributes this to more cases of tachycardia (4 vs 0) in QMF149 high vs S/F 
and more cases of atrial fibrillation (5 vs 3) in QMF149 high vs S/F groups. This accounts for only 9 of the 17 
patients in the QMF179 high dose group. The difference in the additional CCV AEs are all </=2 and thus the 
significance of these is not clear. As highlighted by the applicant there is no clear biological rationale why 
there would be an intra class effect between ICS and LABA in QMF149 vs S/F and overall the difference in 
events is quite low.  
There were also more vascular disorders in QMF149 compared to MF or SF comparators. Most PTs consisted 
of hypertension, with more events occurring in QMF149 arms vs comparators. The applicant clarified that the 
imbalance is primarily seen in patients with hypertension at baseline. For those >65 years without 
hypertension at baseline the imbalance is not seen. There was no obvious clinical difference observed 
between QMF149 and MF or S/F in terms of pulse of blood pressure. This issue was therefore not be pursued 
further. 
Similarly, there were more musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in the QMF149 medium + high 
dose (21.3) compared to MF medium + high dose (8) and between QMF149 all (19.1) compared to MF all 
(7.2). There was an evident trend towards increased back pain, arthralgia and muscle spasms in all QMF149 
groups in those >/=65. The applicant acknowledges that there is a plausible mechanism of action for the 
effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on skeletal muscle. Musculoskeletal pain is included in section 4.8 of SmPC 
as an ADR and back pain is listed as one of the PTs. 
In older patients there were also higher occurrence of nervous system disorders in QMF149 compared to MF 
and S/F. The applicant attributes the higher neurological AEs in >65 years to PT headache which is already 
included as an ADR in section 4.8 of SmPC. This can be accepted. The additional events with slight increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 166/182 
  
  
frequency in patients >65years in QMF149 arms over MF or S/F were neuralgia and paraesthesia but risk 
difference was </=2. 
For patients >/=65 there were also higher frequency of eye disorders in all QMF149 groups compared to MF 
or S/F groups. The applicant agreed to include eye disorders including vision blurred and cataract in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
Drug-drug interactions 
The  applicant  has  not  performed  any  specific  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies.  Information  which  is 
included comes from the known interactions with other drugs in the class of ICS and LABAs. 
Dose discontinuation or interruption 
Overall, there was a relatively low occurrence of AEs that led to permanent drug discontinuation, with lower 
occurrence rates in all QMF149 groups.  
Safety in special populations 
No dedicated studies were conducted in special safety populations such as patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. The clinical pharmacology program for QMF149 was based on data from the authorized 
individual components. The results of the component interaction and the population pharmacokinetic 
analyses showed comparable systemic exposure between QMF149 components and corresponding 
monotherapy components. These data support extrapolation of dosing recommendations in special 
populations, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment from the monotherapy components to 
QMF149. Considering renal clearance is limited for both ICS and LABA, this is accepted from a renal 
perspective. In terms of hepatic impairment, the lack of data for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 
characterised in the SmPC, therefore this is also acceptable. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the clinical safety assessment of QMF149 is considered to be comprehensive despite a limited 
number of adolescent data. The uncertainty in the cardiovascular safety of QMF149 based on the submitted 
data is now considered resolved. The applicant has presented a thorough discussion of the individual events, 
the lack of biological plausibility for greater events with a variable steroid dosing and supportive evidence 
from the literature to support the generally recognised safety profile of ICS and LABA inhalers in asthma 
population. In general, it is considered that QMF149 was overall quite well tolerated with low discontinuation 
rates. The more common AEs expected for LABA-ICS combinations occurred at a lower or similar frequency 
compared to the MF alone and S/F comparator arms. 
The benefit risk is considered positive from a safety perspective. The applicant agreed to closely monitor 
‘bone fracture’ and ‘conduction abnormality’ in the future PSURs.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and hyper-
responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, 
particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but 
variable airflow obstruction. Patients with asthma can experience exacerbations that may be life threatening 
and carry a significant burden to patients and the community (GINA 2019). 
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide and despite existing 
therapies, there are still significant unmet medical needs. The Global Burden of Asthma Report estimates that 
23.7 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of the total global 
burden (Global Asthma Network 2018). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, there 
were 383,000 deaths due to asthma in 2015 (WHO 2017). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The long-term treatment goals are symptom control and risk reduction. Symptom control aims to have only 
occasional daytime symptoms without sleep disturbance or exercise limitation. Risk reduction involves 
preventing exacerbations, preserving lung function and avoiding asthma deaths.  
Patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance low dose ICS and ‘as needed’ short-acting beta2-
agonists or LABA (GINA step 2 and 3) have the following treatment options in addition to optimising 
treatment compliance and modifying risk factors; 
• 
Combination low dose LABA/ICS with as needed short acting beta2-agonists  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 169/182 
  
  
• 
Combination low dose formoterol/ICS maintenance and reliever. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two pivotal Phase III controlled studies [Study 2301] and [Study 2303] were conducted to demonstrate the 
efficacy of QMF149 in either low 150/80 μg o.d., medium QMF149 150/160 μg o.d., or high QMF149 150/320 
μg o.d. doses compared to their corresponding MF doses in adult and adolescent patients with asthma. The 
objective of these studies was to establish the contribution of indacaterol in a FDC (QMF149) compared with 
mometasone (MF) monotherapy. 
The aim of study 2303 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the lowest dose of the combination. In 
this study, during the 12-week treatment period patients received either QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. delivered 
via Concept1 device or MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler. This study utilised a double-dummy design. 
The aim of study 2301 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of medium (QMF149 150/160 μg o.d.) and 
high (QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.) doses over a 52-week study duration. In this study, patients were 
randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups and received either QMF149 150/160 μg o.d., QMF149 150/320 μg 
o.d., MF 400 μg o.d., MF 800 μg (400 μg b.i.d.) or an active comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone 
propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). The study had a triple-dummy design and each patient received 5 inhalations 
(3 in the evening and 2 in the morning).  
In both pivotal studies, the assessment of trough FEV1 was selected as a primary endpoint.  
In line with the asthma guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) measurement of lung function parameters 
alone is considered to be insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect. Therefore, the applicant 
selected the assessment of “asthma control” as a key secondary endpoint. Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ)-7 was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment in study 2303 and after 26 weeks of treatment in study 
2301. ACQ-7 was also measured at 52 weeks.  
The effect on exacerbations (including the assessment of time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation 
category and annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category) was analysed as a secondary 
endpoint.  
802 patients were randomized to study 2303 and 398 of these patients received treatment with QMF149 
150/80 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 and 404 patients received MF 200 μg o.d. delivered via Twisthaler. 
The majority of patients (96.9%) completed the treatment phase. The primary reasons for premature 
discontinuation of the treatment phase were AEs (1.1%) and protocol deviations (0.9%). 
The second pivotal study (2301) was larger and randomized 2216 patients to receive either high and medium 
doses of QMF149, MF, or salmeterol/fluticasone. Of the 2216 randomized patients, 234 (10.6%) patients 
permanently discontinued the study treatment prematurely (The highest discontinuation rate was in the MF 
400 group (9.2 %)  
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics of patients enrolled to both pivotal studies were very 
similar.  
The mean age of randomised patients was 45.6 years in study 2303 and 47.9 years in study 2301. In both 
studies only around of 13% of the randomized patients were aged 65 years or older. Both studies enrolled a 
small number of adolescents (64 in study 2303 and 107 in study 2301). The number of adolescents to be 
enrolled to planned studies in asthma was discussed and agreed with the PDCO.

Both studies enrolled patients with uncontrolled asthma with the baseline mean ACQ-7 score of 2.3. The 
majority of patients (>80%) had never smoked and the majority of patients (>70%) had no asthma 
exacerbations that required treatment. Study 2303 enrolled patients on low ICS dose (43%) or patients on 
low ICS/LABA combination (56%) at baseline whereas study 2301 enrolled patients on medium (19.8%), 
high ICS dose (6.9%) or low ICS/LABA combination (68.7%). 
Phase III study, CQVM149B2302, contains QMF149 as an active comparator and provides supportive efficacy 
data only. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both pivotal studies, the primary objectives were met.  
QMF149 150/80 μg o.d. demonstrated a statistically significant improvement from baseline in trough FEV1 at 
week 12 as compared to MF 200 and the observed difference (mean 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p < 
0.001) is considered to be clinically relevant.  
Both the high (150/320 μg o.d.) and medium (150/160 μg o.d.) QMF149 doses demonstrated superiority as 
compared with the corresponding MF monotherapy doses (400 and 800 μg). The observed difference for 
medium ICS doses (QMF149 150/160 versus MF 400) was 0.211 L (95% CI: 0.167 to 0.255) whereas the 
difference for higher ICS doses (QMF149 150/320 versus MF 800) was smaller i.e. 0.132 L (95% CI: 0.088 to 
0.176) both were statistically significant ( p< 0.001) and were considered to be clinically relevant.  
In study 2301 the efficacy of the QMF149 high dose i.e. 150/320 μg o.d.  was compared to an active 
comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). QMF149 150/320 was not inferior 
to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. in respect to trough FEV1 after 26 weeks.  The treatment 
difference was 0.036 L (95% CI: -0.007 to 0.080). Since the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than the 
pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -0.090 L, the non-inferiority objective was met. 
In both pivotal studies, the key secondary objective was the assessment of Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ)-7 and in both pivotal studies the primary objectives were met.  
QMF149 demonstrated superiority to MF in terms of ACQ-7 scores after 12 weeks of treatment in (adult and 
adolescent) patients with asthma. The LS mean treatment difference (for QMF149 – MF) in ACQ-7 score at 
Week 12 was statistically significant (−0.218, 95% CI: −0.293, −0.143, p<0.001).  
In study 2301 the primary analysis was based on the combined results for both doses (150/160 μg and 
150/320 μg o.d.) versus MF (400 and 800 μg) combined. After 26 weeks of treatment; the LS mean 
treatment difference in ACQ-7 score for pooled QMF149 vs MF doses improved (decreased) by -0.209 (95% 
CI: -0.270, -0.149, p<0.001).   A steady improvement in ACQ-7 scores was observed over the course of 
treatment (Day 364) for pooled high and medium QMF149 doses with a LS mean change from baseline of -
1.090 compared with -0.887 for pooled MF doses. 
A statistically significant difference in the mean score ACQ-7 scores for 150/160 versus MF400 comparison 
and 150/320 μg o.d. versus 800 μg comparison was seen at day 30. The proportion of ACQ-7 responders 
(patients who achieved an improvement of at least 0.5 units in the ACQ-7 score) was higher in the QMF149 
150/80 and 150/160 group as compared to the MF 200 and 400. 
The effect on exacerbations was assessed as a secondary endpoint in both studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 171/182 
  
  
Study 2303 had only 12 weeks’ duration and therefore could be considered as too short for the assessment 
on the effect on exacerbations. Fewer exacerbations were recorded in the QMF149 group as compared to the 
MF group.  The proportion of patients with all (mild, moderate or severe) asthma exacerbations was lower in 
the QMF149 group (5.1%) compared with the MF group (15.0%), including a lower proportion of each type of 
exacerbation in the QMF149 group compared with the MF group. The rate of moderate to severe 
exacerbations was 75% lower in the QMF149 group compared to the MF group (Rate ratio: 0.25, 95% CI: 
0.12, 0.52). All (mild, moderate, severe) asthma exacerbations were reduced by 70% (Rate ratio: 0.30, 95% 
CI: 0.18, 0.50) in the QMF149 group vs. the MF group.  
There were clinically meaningful reductions in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations for both high and 
medium doses of QMF149 compared with the corresponding MF doses. In study 2301 during 52 weeks of 
treatment, a reduction in exacerbation rate was seen in both the QMF149 groups investigated in this study as 
compared to the MF groups. For moderate or severe asthma exacerbations a rate ratio of 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.48, 0.89), i.e. 35% reduction, was reported for high dose comparisons, and a rate ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 
0.35, 0.64), i.e. 53% reduction, was reported medium dose comparisons. However, as these were nominally 
significant the p values were not added to the SPC. 
The rate ratio between high dose QMF149 and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. was 0.93 (i.e. 7% 
reduction, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.29) for moderate or severe exacerbations. 
Results of the other secondary endpoints which investigated lung function in general support the results of 
the primary endpoint. QMF149 demonstrated improvements as compared to the corresponding MF doses in 
trough FEV1(by visit) FEV1, pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow. In addition, a reduction in rescue 
medication use was noted for all QMF149 groups versus the corresponding MF groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The majority of patients enrolled to both pivotal studies were within the same disease severity category 
(GINA 2019 step 3) and received low dose ICS/LABA at baseline (56% in study 2303 and 68.7% in study 
2301). Patients receiving low ICS/LABA at baseline and subsequently randomised to high ICS/LABA 
combination could be considered as over treated. Further, for some patients, especially for those receiving 
high ICS dose at baseline this was considered to be a de-escalation even though the applicant confirmed that 
there was no evidence of asthma worsening (FEV1, ACQ-7 and PEF) during the run-in period. 
The most severe population (GINA 2019 step 4) considered as target population for QMF149 150/320 in line 
with the current guidelines was under-represented in the study B2301. Patients on medium dose ICS/LABA at 
baseline were not included and only 7% of patients received high dose ICS at baseline.  
It is acknowledged that at the time when this study was started, all patients enrolled to this where within the 
same GINA 2015 disease severity category (GINA step 3). However, GINA recommendations were amended 
significantly in 2019 and therefore the trial design and used treatment escalation strategy did not follow the 
current treatment recommendations. 
The applicant was asked to compare the efficacy results of the higher QMF 150/320 versus QMF 150/160 in 
order to justify the use of the higher dose. It needs to be highlighted that both doses were investigated in the 
same population of less severe patients. The provided comparisons in study B2301 indicates that there are 
only small additional benefits of the higher dose in the enrolled patient population. On balance, taking into 
consideration that high dose ICS/LABA combinations have an established role in the treatment of asthma, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 172/182 
  
  
approval of the high dose could be accepted. Severity of the enrolled population is clearly described in the 
SmPC. 
The proportion of ACQ-7 responders (patients who achieved an improvement of at least 0.5 units in the ACQ-
7 score) was higher in the QMF149 150/80 and 150/160 group as compared to the MF 200 and 400 groups. 
However, in this respect, the differences between the higher QMF149 150/320 group and the 800 MF group 
was not statistically significant. Further, the applicant was requested to discuss and present the data for 
Asthma Control Questionnaire without FEV1% score included. The applicant provided the results of ACQ-5.  It 
is clear that for the QMF versus MF comparisons the better results were obtained for ACQ-7 (which includes 
the lung function data) as compared to ACQ-5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pre-bronchodilator 
FEV1% score in the questionnaire is partially driving the positive results of this endpoints. Nevertheless, for 
both versions of the questionnaire (ACQ-5 and ACQ-7) statistically better results were reported in the 
QMF149 groups versus the MF groups therefore this issue is considered as resolved. 
There were no significant differences between the annualized rate of moderate and severe exacerbations 
reported in the QMF 150/320 group as compared to the QMF 150/160 group (025 and 0.27 respectively). The 
rate of severe exacerbations in these groups was the same (i.e. 0.13). It could be hypothesized that the 
enrolled study population (B2301) was not severe enough to show additional benefit of the higher dose. On 
the other hand, additional benefits of the higher dose (QMF 150/320) versus medium dose (QMF 150/160) 
were seen in study B2302 in which QMF was used as a comparator.  Further, the applicant was asked to 
justify the definition used for mild exacerbation as in line with the CHMP guideline the definition of “mild 
exacerbation” is difficult and should be avoided as its characteristics are similar to the normal variation seen 
in asthma control. Therefore, it is considered that the data on mild exacerbations are supportive only.  
Both studies enrolled adolescent patients. Study 2303 enrolled 64 (8.0%) adolescent patients whereas study 
2301 enrolled 107 (4.8%) adolescent patients. For adolescents enrolled to study 2303, the LS means 
treatment difference for trough FEV1 at Day 85 (Week 12) was 0.251 L (95% CI: 0.130, 0.371). For 
adolescents in study 2301, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at week 26 was 0.39 L for 
medium dose comparisons and 0.183 L for high dose comparisons. For the high dose comparison, the 
difference between groups was not statistically significant.  For the adolescent subgroups, improvements in 
lung function, symptoms and exacerbations were consistent with the overall population. 
In study 2301 the efficacy of the QMF149 high dose e.g. 150/320 was compared to an active comparator 
(salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.). However, these comparisons were made 
without multiplicity adjustment and therefore are considered as supportive only. Trough FEV1 after 26 weeks 
of treatment was tested for non-inferiority with 90 ml non-inferiority margin. QMF149 150/320 was not 
inferior to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. in respect to trough FEV1 after 26 weeks. The treatment 
difference was 0.036 L (95% CI: -0.007 to 0.080). For other endpoints no significant differences between 
QMF149 150/320 and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 were recorded; however, for these endpoints no formal 
non-inferiority testing was performed. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For adolescents in study 2301, the LS means treatment difference for trough FEV1 at week 26 was 0.39 L for 
medium dose comparisons and 0.183 L for high dose comparisons. For the high dose comparison, the 
difference between groups was not statistically significant.  
The differences between the higher QMF149 150/320 group and the 800 MF group was not statistically 
significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 173/182 
  
  
There was a higher total occurrence rate of conduction abnormalities for QMF149 treatment groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.8 vs 0.1), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.8 vs 0.1) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (0.5 vs 0.3). As this imbalance could be considered to be due to underlying patient 
characteristics in the respective groups; the AE conduction abnormality will be closely monitored in the post-
marketing setting as part of the PSUR.  
In the Asthma S-db there was a slight, but discernible, imbalance in the number of deaths between 
treatment arms. There were 4 deaths in the QMF149 high dose group and 1 patient in the MF medium dose 
group. The investigator did not consider any of the deaths to be related to the drug study. All 4 deaths on 
QMF149 high dose group occurred in study 2302 where the patient population was older, had more severe 
asthma, and more comorbidities compared with patients in study CQVM149B2301. With the 52-week data, 
an additional death was reported; a patient, who was on MF treatment, developed multiple complications 
post GI perforation that resulted in death and was not considered study drug related.  
Tachyarrhythmias were also reported with a higher occurrence rate for QMF149 groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.5 vs 0.3), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.5 vs 0.2) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (1.2 vs 0.5).  
Myocardial infarction was also reported with a higher occurrence rate for QMF149 groups; QMF149 
medium+high dose vs MF medium+high dose (0.3 vs 0), QMF149 all vs MF all (0.2 vs 0) and between 
QMF149 high dose vs S/F (0.5 vs 0.2). However, CHMP acknowledges that the overall event frequency is 
considered very low to draw any meaningful conclusions. 
There was higher occurrence of both overall SAEs and serious AESIs (some overlap) with high dose QMF149 
compared to SOC S/F. Excluding CV AEs, these were largely attributed to greater occurrences of adjudicated 
serious asthma outcomes.  
There was a higher occurrence for QMF149 vs comparators (MF or S/F) for the following AEs: dysphonia, 
musculoskeletal and back pain and eye disorders (including vision blurred and cataracts).  
There was also slightly higher occurrence of hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus for QMF149 treated groups 
which is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
In terms of patient demographics, there was under-representation of some key groups in the pivotal trials. 
Patients >/=65 years comprised less than 20% of the enrolled population in these trials. However, the safety 
profile has been adequately characterised in patients >65 years and is in line with ICH guidelines. Black 
patients also comprised less than 1.5% of the participant population across these trials; ; taking into 
consideration that a different safety profile is not expected in this population, CHMP agreed that this issue will 
not be further pursued. There were slightly higher occurrence rates in the QMF149 (medium+high and all) 
groups compared to the corresponding MF alone (medium+high and all) groups for musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, vascular disorders, renal and urinary disorders, eye 
disorders and psychiatric disorders. 
There was a slight trend for increased occurrence rate of headache in QMF149 high dose group compared to 
S/F 50/500 group (6.9 vs 6.4 respectively).  
There was an increased occurrence rate of dysphonia for patients treated with QMF149 (medium+high, all 
and high) groups compared to the MF (medium+high and all) and S/F groups. Occurrence rates overall were 
still relatively low, not exceeding 2.5.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206580/2020 
Page 174/182 
  
  
There was also a higher occurrence rate for back pain in the QMF149 (medium+high, all and high) groups 
compared to the MF (medium+high and all) and S/F groups.  
There was higher incidence of eye disorders for QMF medium + high compared to MF medium + high (1.0 vs 
0.6) and for QMF149 high compared to S/F (0.9 vs 0.6). There was also a slightly higher occurrence of bone 
fracture in the QMF149 high dose group compared to the S/F group (1.7 vs 1.0 respectively).  
There was potentially higher systolic and diastolic BP values with QMF149 high dose compared to equivalent 
dose S/F treatment. However overall numbers were low. Considering, there also appeared to be higher AEs of 
hypertension in QMF149 groups compared to MF alone groups, the applicant was requested by CHMP to 
justify whether hypertension/blood pressur should be closely monitored in the post-marketing seeting. 
Overall, the imbalance in hypertension cases seen between QMF149 high and S/F are small, systolic 0.8 vs 
0.1 and diastolic 1.2 vs 0.7. When looking at the change from baseline in mmHg for systolic and diastolic 
pressures for the different treatment arms the changes are relatively similar with no striking differences. 
Thus, the applicant response to not follow up blood pressure specifically in the PSUR was accepted by CHMP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The smaller representation of patients >65 years, adolescent patients and non-caucasian patients is a 
limitation of the data provided.  
Based on the short duration of treatment/follow up, up to 1 year, there is uncertainty about the long- term 
steroid side effects of using QMF149 on growth parameters and bone mineral density amongst others. 
Appropriate warnings regarding systemic side effects of ICS have been included in the SmPC section 4.4 and 
bone fracture will be closely monitored in post-marketing setting and data submitted in PSURs.  
Conduction abnormality will also be closely monitored in PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Fixed-dose combination (FDC) products containing a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist plus an inhaled 
corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) are considered as a standard therapy for patients with asthma. There are many 
LABA/ICS products with an established efficacy and safety profile available on the EU market. However, most 
of these products have a twice-daily regimen and therefore proposed new LABA/ICS products with once-daily 
regimen such as Bemrist Breezhaler may give an additional therapeutic option and theoretically improve 
medication adherence. 
Bemrist Breezhaler has shown to have a clinically relevant effect on pulmonary function (measured as the 
absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through 26 weeks of treatment) and asthma control 
(measured in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7), a patient-derived outcome) after 26 weeks of 
treatment) in adults and adolescents patients with asthma. Consistent effects have also been observed in a 
relevant clinical variable such as the effect on asthma exacerbations (assessed at week 52 of tretamnt) which 
is considered to be particularly important for LABA/ICS combination products. Furthermore, results of other 
secondary endpoints which investigated lung function were in general supporting the results seen with the 
primary endpoint i.e. Bemrist Breezhaler demonstrated improvements as compared to the corresponding MF

doses in trough FEV1(by visit) FEV1, pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow. In addition, a reduction 
in rescue medication use was noted for all QMF149 groups versus the corresponding MF groups.  
The applicant was asked to compare the efficacy results of the higher QMF 150/320 versus QMF 150/160 in 
order to justify the use of the higher dose. Both doses were investigated in the same population of less 
severe patients. The provided comparisons in study B2301 indicates that there are only small additional 
benefits of the higher dose in the enrolled patient population. On balance, taking into consideration that high 
dose ICS/LABA combinations have an established role in the treatment of asthma, the approval of the high 
dose could be accepted. Severity of the enrolled population is clearly described in the SmPC. 
There are no data which would indicate that Bemrist Breezhaler is superior to any other ICS/LABA 
combination. Although patients uncontrolled on long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids were enrolled to studies, there is no direct evidence of superiority in terms of efficacy over 
other ICS/LABA combinations. 
Indacaterol/mometasone appears to be well tolerated. The main uncertainties are related to the short 
duration of treatment/follow-up, up to one year, and the long-term steroid side effects using QMF149 on 
growth parameters and bone mineral density amongst others.  
Appropriate warnings regarding systemic side effects of ICS have been included in the product information. 
In addition, bone fracture, as well as other AEs such as conduction abnormality will be closely monitored in 
PSURs. For expected class effects of combination inhaler therapy such as asthma exacerbations, 
nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respiratory tract infections occurrence rates of more common AEs are 
relatively comparable between treatment arms. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
QMF149 (indacaterol/mometasone) has convincingly shown clinically relevant efficacy in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 
inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists for all doses. Overall, the benefits of Bemrist Breezhaler outweighs their 
risks. The studied populations were relevant to the enrolled populations in pivotal studies and the efficacy 
endpoints were clinically relevant.  
The safety profile is acceptable for all doses studied. Limited information is available on ‘bone fracture’ and 
‘conduction abnormality’. This will be further characterised in the post marketing setting and data provided in 
PSURs.  
The benefits of use of indacaterol/mometasone in the targeted population are established and do outweigh 
the identified risks.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bemrist Breezhaler as maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 
years of age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short acting beta-2 
agonists is positive.

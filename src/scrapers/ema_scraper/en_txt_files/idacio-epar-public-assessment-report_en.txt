2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Idacio (MSB11022) has been developed as a biosimilar to Humira and the Applicant claims all the 
indications of the reference product for Idacio 40 mg solution for injection  
For the paediatric formulation (40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection), only the paediatric indications are 
applied for.  
Disease or condition 
The reference product Humira is authorised for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (polyarticular JIA and enthesitis-related arthritis), Axial spondyloarthritis 
(ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), Psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA), Psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque Psoriasis, Crohn´s Disease (CD), paediatric Crohn´s 
Disease, Ulcerative colitis (UC), Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Non-infectious Uveitis (UV) and paediatric 
uveitis in the European Union.

Page 11/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
About the product 
The proposed product, Idacio, has been developed as a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab). Adalimumab 
belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group ‘immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
inhibitors’ (ATC code: L04AB04). The mechanism of action of adalimumab is binding specifically to TNF-α 
and neutralising its biological function by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF 
receptors. 
Three pharmaceutical forms are proposed, which are the same as three of the pharmaceutical forms of 
the reference product and contain a 40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection: a vial (for paediatric use), a 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) and a pre-filled pen (all of a volume of 0.8 mL). For the reference product, Humira, 
there is also a 20mg/0.2 mL strength available in a pre-filled syringe.   
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The various CHMP guidelines for similar biological medicinal products as well as indication-specific 
guidelines and guidelines relevant  for the PK trial design and efficacy trial design  were considered in the 
design of the clinical programme, in particular the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 
Rev1) and the Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products (CHMP/437/04 rev 1, 2014). 
CHMP scientific advice was given on 24 September 2015, 16 October 2016 and 1 April 2016. 
The main clinical aspects agreed by the CHMP concerning the pivotal efficacy trial were as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The proposed psoriasis population selected is appropriate and should be sensitive to detect 
differences between the test and Reference Medicinal Product (RMP) Adalimumab. 
As it is more sensitive, mean PASI change was preferred over PASI75 as primary outcome. 
Efficacy assessments over various time points to plateau effect would be needed to ensure 
similarity. 
The 18% equivalence margin would need to be further justified using a meta-analysis and clinical 
justification. 
Predefined equivalence margins for the key secondary endpoint (percentage PASI change) should 
be provided in addition to the chosen primary endpoint (PASI75). 
Follow-up efficacy and safety assessments of patients taken off treatment are needed until week 
16, unless patients withdraw their consent. 
The planned safety database could be adequate in terms of the number of subjects and duration 
of exposure. However 1 year of safety data and immunogenicity would need to be submitted early 
in the assessment. 
For indications where neutralising the soluble TNF -α appears to be mainly involved e.g. psoriasis, 
ankylosing spondylitis and RA, the extrapolation from Psoriasis could be acceptable. 
Extrapolation to Crohn’s disease would require convincing evidence from the preclinical studies 
related to these other potential mechanisms, e.g. the binding and effector functions in the setting 
of membrane bound TNF-α.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is a solution for injection in three different presentations: a PFS, a pre-filled pen and 
a vial (for paediatric use), all nominally containing 0.8 ml of the solution equivalent to 40 mg (50 mg/ml)

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody composed of two kappa light chains each 
with a molecular weight of approximately 24 kilo Daltons (kDa) and two IgG1 heavy chains each with a 
molecular weight of approximately 49 kDa based on the amino acid sequence. The total molecular weight 
of adalimumab with post-translational modifications is approximately 148 kDa. Each light chain consists 
of 214 amino acid residues and each heavy chain consists of 451 amino acid residues resulting in a total 
of 1330 amino acids for the entire IgG1 molecule; one glycosylation site (N301) is present. The primary 
amino-acid sequence of the heavy and light chains is reported.  
The internal company code of this preparation is MSB11022. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The active substance manufacturing and quality control (QC) release and stability testing take place at 
Merck Serono SA, Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. The active substance QC release and stability testing 
can also be performed at Merck Serono S.p.A, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Adalimumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The main steps are 
fermentation, recovery and purification as well as virus removal and inactivation steps.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. All media used in 
cell culture processes are chemically-defined media. These media are free from substances of animal 
origin and free of proteins, except for the presence of insulin. The insulin used is recombinant human 
insulin produced and has compendial grade (European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)). No other raw materials 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019

from animal origin are used in the cell culture process or purification process. Acceptable documents have 
been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell substrate. All raw 
materials used in this process are received, quarantined and released according to approved 
specifications and written procedures as required under current GMP.  
Adalimumab is produced by batch suspension culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that have 
been transfected with an expression vector containing coding sequences for the heavy and light chains of 
adalimumab.  
A two-tiered cell banking system is used, consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) from which WCBs are 
derived. The origin, source, history of cells and generation of the cell substrate as well as the cell banking 
system has been sufficiently documented. An extended cell bank (ExCB) was also produced, representing 
cells cultured till the maximum production limit during the cell expansion phase and an additional four 
population doubling levels after harvesting at the end of production. MCB-1, WCB-1.1 and ExCB 
underwent phenotypic and genotypic characterisation to confirm identity, purity and stability of the cell 
line, according current ICH guidance.  Overall, the results support the stability of the production cell line. 
All future Working Cell Banks will be established in a dedicated cGMP cell banking area according to a 
protocol based on that used for the preparation of the WCB-1.1. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the adalimumab active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has 
been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions 
taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
For each process step, critical process parameters were identified based on a risk assessment, using 
information coming from process development. Whenever necessary, experiments were conducted at 
small-scale to confirm the criticality of the process parameters and to define acceptable ranges. 
Appropriate controls have been included to detect possible deviations from the acceptable ranges for the 
critical process parameters. In-process controls (IPCs) have been defined to ensure appropriate 
performance of the manufacturing process. IPCs for the upstream process are mainly targeted on 
controlling cell viability and adventitious agents and for down-stream processing on bioburden, endotoxin 
and yield. During the procedure a number of concerns were identified, which has been adequately 
addressed by the applicant.  
Process validation 
The adalimumab active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in 
production has been shown on full scale commercial batches including process performance qualification 
batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for 
the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the manufacturing process consistently produces 
adalimumab active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification 
and in-process acceptance criteria. As part of the large scale process performance qualification a 
cumulated hold time study on process intermediates has been performed. The study aimed to confirm the 
absence of impact of the hold times on the quality of the active substance and to demonstrate that the 
microbiological level of process intermediates is appropriately controlled. 
The life time of the resins used in the chromatographic purification operations have been properly 
validated. The provided data are satisfactory and support the proposed lifetimes. Clear protocols for 
confirmation of the proposed lifetimes at production scale have been provided. Cleaning performance and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019  
Page 14/89 
 
 
 
 
 
monitoring of microbial charge has also been properly addressed. The approach of the company to 
validate the lifetime of the tangential flow filtration membrane is considered adequate as well. 
Adequate shipping validation data have been provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process for the nonclinical and Phase I material was developed at commercial scale.  A 
second clinical campaign resulted in GMP batches used for the Phase III clinical studies.  PPQ studies were 
conducted subsequent to the clinical campaign.  No substantial changes were introduced in the upstream 
and downstream processes during the course of development of the active substance. A limited number 
of minor changes were implemented between phase I and phase III studies.  The Applicant provided an 
integrated (active substance and finished product) comparability exercises as discussed under the 
pharmaceutical development of the finished product. 
Characterisation 
The adalimumab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a human 
IgG1-type antibody. Edman chemistry, peptide mapping and liquid chromatography (LC) with mass 
spectrometry (MS) (LC-MS) were used to for the characterisation of the primary structure and 
post-translational modifications; peptide mapping by LC-MS/MS (non-reducing), circular dichroism (CD) 
and nano-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used for the characterisation of higher order 
structure; charged isoforms were characterised by imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF), 
glycosylation by 2-aminobenzamide HILIC-UPLC (2-AB HILIC-UPLC). The biological characterisation was 
performed measuring the inhibition of TNF induced cytotoxicity as bioassay, further described under 
analytical methods; determination of biological activity (potency), binding to TNF by surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) and binding to the fragment crystallisable (Fc) receptors and C1q, antibody dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays. 
The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the 
active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge variants, glycosylation and 
other product-related substances and impurities. Biological characterization of adalimumab indicates that 
this antibody has the ability to bind TNF with high affinity and to specifically bind to Fc Receptor as 
expected of an IgG1. In summary, the characterization is considered appropriate for this type of 
molecule. 
Specification 
The adalimumab active substance specification include physicochemical tests (appearance, clarity and 
degree of opalescence, degree of coloration, pH, osmolality), biological activity and protein content, 
product related substances, impurities, process related impurities  and microbiological tests as per 
Ph.Eur. 
The specification has been prepared in line with the requirements of applicable ICH and EMA guidelines 
and Ph.Eur. monograph on monoclonal antibodies. The specification takes into account the critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of the active substance that can affect the safety and efficacy of the product, and 
defines the acceptable range for the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the active substance 
within the context of the wider control strategy. The justification of specifications is based on data from 
available active substance batches.

Analytical methods 
The non-compendial methods that are in common with the specification of the finished product are either 
identical or present small variations. Upon request, the description of the analytical methods was 
expanded. The analytical methods used are now adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
The adalimumab bioassay is based on the ability of adalimumab to inhibit cytotoxicity induced by 
recombinant-human TNF in a dose dependent manner. The method description has been updated during 
the review to a sufficient and unequivocal level of detail. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on full scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results are within the 
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
An interim reference standard has been employed in the analysis of the active substance and finished 
product for release and stability testing during development and was replaced by the current reference 
standard used for the active substance and finished product release and stability testing. Both reference 
standards are appropriately identified and characterised. An appropriate policy for replacement of the 
reference standard is provided. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life at the indicated conditions with the possibility of freeze-thaw cycles in the proposed container. 
Real time, real condition stability data of active substance for stored in a representative container closure 
system were provided. Data under accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Results on stress conditions were also provided. In addition, a freeze-thaw study has been performed.  
Stability indicating parameters were tested. 
Stability study results generated at the long-term stability testing meet the proposed commercial 
acceptance criteria and demonstrate stability throughout the proposed shelf-life. Most parameters do not 
change over time; which is to be expected during frozen storage. Where common trends can be discerned 
statistically, they are considered too small to be relevant, and may actually reflect chance findings. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in 
the EU), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile, clear, colourless solution for subcutaneous administration 
injection containing adalimumab (50 mg/mL) as active substance, citric acid monohydrate, disodium 
phosphate dihydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (as buffering agents); mannitol (tonicity 
and stabilising agent); polysorbate 80 (stabilising agent), sodium chloride (tonicity agent), sodium citrate 
(buffering agent); sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections (solvent). All excipients 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019  
Page 16/89 
 
 
 
 
 
are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The product is available in three presentations: a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a 29G Thin-Wall, ½ 
inch needle with a latex free needle cap, a plunger stopper (synthetic rubber), extended finger flanges 
and a passive needle shield; in a pre-filled single use, disposable, handheld, mechanical Physioject pen 
containing a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a 29G Thin-Wall, ½ inch needle with latex free needle 
cap and a plunger stopper (synthetic rubber); and in a glass (type I glass) vial with a rubber stopper 
(synthetic rubber) and aluminium crimp seal.  
The adult posology foresees the administration of the full content of the syringe/pen. The paediatric 
posology requires administering partial doses from the vial; appropriate materials for administering the 
dose are supplied with the vial (1 sterile injection syringe, 1 sterile needle, 1 vial adaptor). 
The material of the primary packaging of each presentation complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. Each presentation contains an overfill to compensate for dead volume and to 
assure a nominal amount of 40 mg adalimumab in 0.8 mL is delivered. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Pharmaceutical development was aimed at establishing a medicinal product which is biosimilar to the 
originator, matching its composition. The pH (5.2) is the same pH as the reference product and provides 
appropriate stability of the active substance against aggregation and degradation, as supported by the 
stability results. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the 
CQAs and critical process parameters (CPPs). The CQAs have also been investigated in the biosimilarity 
assessment and they are listed inTable 4 below. A risk analysis was performed in order to define critical 
process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality 
attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge, process development experience and 
information gathered from process pre-characterisation and characterisation studies. On request, the 
applicant provided additional details and satisfactorily justified why some process parameters were 
identified as non-critical. For selected process steps and their potential critical process parameters, the 
impact on CQAs was further studied by using design of experiments and/or one-factor-at-a-time 
experimental designs. The studies were performed at laboratory scale. The outcome of these studies was 
to confirm the criticality of potential CPPs and to define proposed operational limits for the confirmed CPPs 
that ensure process consistency and delivery of a product complying with quality specifications. For a 
selection of CPPs the operational limits were confirmed in CPP range confirmation studies. The approach 
of the company is state-of-the-art. The CPPs have been adequately identified. 
Comparability during development 
The Applicant provided comparability exercises with associated data to substantiate comparability of 
Phase I vs. Phase III; Phase III PFS vs. commercial PFS; and Phase III PFS vs. commercial Vial. The 
complete and integrated data, related to both the active substance and the finished product, are 
presented in Module 3.2.S.2.6. The comparability exercises comprise a detailed description of the 
changes to the finished product (mainly limited to differences between vial and PFS and different stoppers 
manufacturing process), QC/batch release data, comparative real time and accelerated stability data and 
an extensive characterisation data. These data indicate that no meaningful difference exists; all results 
are within expected batch to batch variability.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing and QC release and stability testing take place at Merck Serono S.p.A, 
Modugno, Bari, Italy. The finished product QC release and stability testing can also be performed at Merck 
Serono S.p.A., Guidonia Montecelio, Italy.  
The manufacturing method has been satisfactorily described.  
Upon request, a more elaborate description of the assembly of auto-injector or safety device, including 
appropriate CPPs and controls, has been included in the submission; in addition, appropriate validation 
data were provided. 
The general outline of the manufacturing process for vials is similar to the description for PFS; except that 
after sterile filtration the solution is filled into vials, with different target fill volume, and no forward 
manufacturing takes place.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of the intended quality in a 
reproducible manner.  
CPPs and Critical IPCs for PFS and Vials are equal, except for fill weight checks and hold times. CPPs and 
IPCs are sufficiently justified by manufacturing process development studies. The in-process controls are 
adequate. 
Product specification  
The adalimumab finished product specification include physicochemical tests (appearance, clarity and 
degree of opalescence, degree of coloration, pH, osmolality, particulate contamination and extractable 
volume), identity, biological activity and protein content, product related substances, impurities and 
microbiological tests as per Ph.Eur.  
The stated impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies, as relevant. 
The acceptance criteria are applicable from release to end of shelf-life.. 
The specifications for vial and PFS are identical.  
Analytical methods and reference materials 
Cross reference is made to the active substance section regarding analytical procedures and the reference 
standard; the non-compendial methods for active substance and finished product are identical and have 
been updated in parallel during the procedure. Compendial methods are sufficiently described and 
validated by reference to Ph. Eur.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data together with batch genealogy and batch disposition data of the finished product were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019

Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 year and storage conditions (store in a 
refrigerator, 2°C – 8°C, do not freeze) as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. The product should be stored 
in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
The finished product may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a period of up to 14 
days. The finished product must be kept in its outer carton in order to be protected from light, and 
discarded if not used within the 14-day period. 
For the PFS, real time, real condition stability data and under accelerated conditions finished product 
manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process according to the ICH guidelines, were 
provided. The batches of adalimumab finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Additional stability data on representative 
batches packed in the proposed container, at real time at real condition and accelerated were provided. 
Real time, real condition and accelerated stability data stability data according to the ICH guidelines have 
also been provided. Stability data on batches stored under stress conditions were also provided. Stability 
indicating parameters were tested. 
To support temporary storage of the finished product out of the refrigerator, stability data at room 
temperature has been provided for two batches. The results demonstrate that the product has suitable 
stability profile for several weeks at room temperature therefore the product can be stored for at least 2 
weeks at room temperature as an alternative storage condition for convenience of the patient, in line with 
the in use storage recommendations of the reference product. 
Furthermore, forced degradation testing has been performed side-by-side with the test product and the 
reference product sourced from EU and US to support the analytical similarity assessment. Samples were 
evaluated for thermal, mechanical, oxidative stress as well as low and high pH and light exposure. The 
results demonstrate that there are no substantial differences between all products tested, thus fully 
supporting the proposed storage conditions and the 3-way analytical similarity (see biosimilarity section 
below). 
For the vial, the stability data stored under long real time, real conditions, accelerated and stressed are 
aligned with the results obtained for the vial and support the applicability of the same shelf-life conditions 
for both the PFS and the vial. Additionally, compatibility of the finished product upon in-use 
administration with the ancillaries (i.e. vial adapter + needle, 1mL plastic syringe) has been 
demonstrated through an in-use stability study. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in 
the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Adventitious agents 
The approach for adventitious agents testing is described. The only material of animal origin used in the 
manufacture of Idacio is insulin as discussed under control of materials for the active substance. 
During the cell line development and establishment of the cell banks, animal derived component free 
media were used during all steps, with the only exception of the initial clone picking step. Its origin is from 
a country with negligible risk of TSE/BSE and is therefore acceptable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019  
Page 19/89 
 
 
 
 
 
All raw materials used in manufacture of the finished product are certified to be free of animal derived 
components based on supplier certificates. Therefore, the raw materials are not a concern from a viral 
safety or TSE risk-minimization perspective.  
The risk of adventitious viral contamination of active substance through the manufacturing process is low. 
Tests of the MCB, WCB and ExCB for adventitious viral contaminants in vivo and in vitro were negative for 
replication competent viruses. Adventitious viruses were not detected in vitro for the unprocessed bulk 
harvests using up to seven detector cell lines. The purification process includes various virus reduction 
and inactivation steps. Spiking experiments were performed on chromatography and filtration 
scaled-down models, to assess the viral reduction capacity of all the relevant steps for different model 
viruses. While the unprocessed bulk harvest is known to contain non-infectious retrovirus-like particles 
(rVLP) originating from the CHO cell line, the downstream process has been validated to remove or 
inactivate retroviruses in excess of known levels of rVLP contamination.  
In summary, the implemented measures ensure high safety with respect to adventitious agents.

2.2.4.  Biosimilarity 
The Applicant has performed an extensive comparability analysis to demonstrate biosimilarity to the 
reference product (Humira). The approach chosen is in line with current guidance and a scientific advice 
received by EMA-CHMP on 24 September 2015 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/593876/2015).  
Batches included 
The Applicant analysed batches from the EU; US; and rest of the world (RoW) markets ; with various 
expiry dates . Individual (raw) batch data from each batch are provided and traceability is ensured.  
Comparability criteria 
The presented analysis falls into two broad categories; a comparison of all the finished product batches to 
the QTPP of the originator (with separate QTPP analyses for EU batches and aggregated EU/US/RoW 
batches); and specific side-by-side analytical exercises, performed at separate points in time during 
different stages of development. Where a quantitative analysis was possible, Min-Max ranges for the 
finished product were established and compared to Mean+3SD intervals calculated for the originator 
(with Min-Max ranges presented for comparison; it is noted that the 3SD interval is sometimes more 
restrictive than the Min-Max interval due to the relatively high number of data points); age at the time of 
testing is appropriately taken into account; the data are presented both in tabular and graphical format. 
Method qualification 
Descriptions of analytical methods and summary qualification data have been provided and considered 
acceptable. The qualification data comprise specificity, intra – and inter-assay precision (repeatability and 
intermediate precision), accuracy, linearity and range.  
The biosimilarity results are summarised in the below.

Critical evaluation of analytical biosimilarity 
High similarity between the biosimilar and the originator can be considered demonstrated with regard to 
the following attributes: primary structure, higher order structure; including disulphide bonds, dimers, 
aggregates and fragments, oxidation and related microheterogeneity; glycosylation, with the exception 
of total afucosylation/mannosylation/galactosylation; it is noted that sialylation is different but the levels 
are so low that this is not considered relevant; TNF-alfa binding (both soluble and membrane bound; 
binding to Fc-receptors, except FcγRIIIa-binding (by a.o. SPR, where limited sensitivity should be noted); 
C1q-binding (ELISA) and CDC  
For the following interrelated attributes, the analytical comparability exercise results in the identification 
of differences: mannosylation/total afucosylation, FcγRIIIa 158F binding and ADCC. Data from several 
ADCC-type assays have been presented. Depending on the assay format, measurable ADCC is either 
absent in both the biosimilar and the reference product (ADCC with natural killer effector cells (NK) and 
activated monocyte target cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)), or that ADCC is similar 
(whole blood ADCC, FcγRIIIa ADCC reporter) or lower than (NK-PBMC ADCC) the originator. In the latter 
case, during the procedure it was questioned whether the differences were linked to assay variability and, 
as explained under the clinical section, it was concluded that they were not clinically meaningful. These 
results are consistent with the noted lower total afucosylation and results of Fc-receptor binding: the

KD-ranges (as determined by SPR) for FcγRIIIa F158 binding overlap but are not ‘within range’. In view of 
the comprehensive functional assay dataset provided, which supports biosimilarity for the mechanisms of 
action related to the extrapolation of indication for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, induction 
of apoptosis, inhibition of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines as well as inhibition of T cell 
proliferation; the relevance of the difference in mannosylation/total afucosylation, FcγRIIIa 158F binding 
and ADCC was raised as multidisciplinary MO (non-clinical/clinical) and subsequently resolved, as 
outlined in the non-clinical part of the report.  
A summary of the demonstration of similarity for those functionality tests linked to the extrapolation of 
indication for inflammatory bowel disease, is provided in Table 5 below.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Similarity between the biosimilar and the reference product, EU-Humira, has been addressed in an 
extensive comparability exercise and similarity can be confirmed.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance

of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends three points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
targeted against human TNFα. Both binding and functional assays were used to demonstrate that 
MSB11022 is comparable to Humira EU (RMP and Humira-US (RP) (3-way comparison) with respect to 
fragment antigen-binding (Fab) and fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain properties. Data on potency and 
binding properties included a TNFα inhibition bioassay (inhibition of TNFα induced cytotoxicity); binding to 
soluble TNFα (sTNFα) by SPR; binding to transmembrane TNFα (tmTNFα) by flow cytometry; FcRn, FcγRI, 
FcγRIIa (R131 & H131), FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa (V158 & F158) and FcγRIIIb binding by SPR; and C1q binding 
by ELISA. The data on binding and on potency, demonstrating adalimumabs ability to bind to either sTNFα 
or tmTNFα and to neutralise the activity of TNFα, confirmed similarity.  
The Applicant provided the results from ADCC assays using varying formats. When using LPS-activated 
human primary monocytes as target cells and NK effector cells of V/V158 genotype as effector cells, no 
ADCC activity could be measured. Using whole blood cells and CHO cells overexpressing non-cleavable 
tmTNF as target cells, the %EC50 values for MSB11022 overlap with the range observed for the EU RMP 
using healthy or patient blood cells. In a FcγRIIIa ADCC Reporter Assay, %EC50 values for MSB11022 and 
EU RMP were slightly lower but overlapping or similar, when using the V158-reporter or the F158-reporter 
assay, respectively. When using a more sensitive assay format the ADCC activity of MSB11022 compared 
to EU RMP is reduced. In the ADCC assay of NK-cell-enriched PBMC, applied at high ratio versus target 
cells overexpressing non-cleavable tmTNF, the ADCC EMax ranges using healthy donors were 84-92% vs 
95-104% (at F/F genotype) and 88-99% vs 94-104% (at V/F genotype) for MSB11022 and EU RMP, 
respectively. In this assay the %EC50 values were 41-56% vs 79-162% (at F/F genotype) and 26-37% vs 
70-174% (at V/F genotype) for MSB11022 and EU RMP, respectively. Comparable effects were found 
using patients blood but the difference was less pronounced in UC/CD patients (lower but overlapping) 
than with RA/PsO patient blood. The Applicant also provided data from the ADCC reporter assay showing 
that the ADCC activity induced by adalimumab was already greatly reduced in presence of 50% human 
serum and a difference was no longer observed between MSB11022 and RP, while ADCC reporter activity 
of both was not quantifiable in presence of 100% human serum. In addition, using the assay with the 
NK-enriched PBMC effector cells, the Applicant showed that addition of IgG diminishes the ADCC activity, 
and argues that in vivo it appears likely that endogenous IgG will compete with adalimumab for FcγRIIIa, 
making it less likely that ADCC would contribute to adalimumab’s efficacy. A reduction of ADCC activity in 
this assay was also shown by addition of serum from either healthy donors or CD patients. 
The Applicant provided comparative functional in vitro data related to Fab-related functionalities of 
adalimumab. The Fab-related functionality concerns the binding of sTNFα measured by subsequent 
effects on cellular processes mediated by binding of sTNFα to its receptor TNFR and the binding to tmTNFα 
measured by subsequent effects on cellular processes mediated by reverse signalling.

Functional sequelae of sTNFα-binding was shown by measuring sTNFα-induced NF-kB signalling in the 
reporter cell line; by sTNFα-induced apoptosis of (monocytic) cells by measuring caspase 3/7 activity; by 
sTNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells cells; and by sTNFα-induced IL-8 release 
in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These assays show the immunological consequence of 
lower sTNFα levels and thus reflect in a functional way the capacity of adalimumab to bind sTNFα. This 
mode of action is considered relevant for all indications. In addition, functional effects of sTNFα-binding 
was shown by measuring sTNFα-induced IL-6 release in synoviocytes; by sTNFα-induced IL-8 release in 
keratinocytes or in colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cells, or by measuring sTNFα-induced apoptosis 
(caspase 3/7 activity) in colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cells. The latter three cell types were 
considered by the Applicant as models for RA, psoriasis and IBD, respectively. The production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines - IL-6 or IL-8, in  synoviocytes or keratinocytes is considered plausibly to 
reflect sTNFα activity in tissues where RA and psoriasis are active. However, to consider IL-8 release in 
adenocarcinoma-derived cells as a model of IBD would seem a bit far-fetched. Nevertheless all of these 
assays show comparable results for both products, reflecting comparable efficacy in binding of sTNFα by 
both products. 
Functional sequelae of tmTNFα-binding was investigated by measuring apoptosis of Jurkat:tmTNF cells. 
Comparable caspase 3/7 activity (biomarker for apoptosis) was shown.  
In addition, inhibition of T-cell proliferation and induction of regulatory macrophages in a two-way 
allogenic Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) assay, supposed to involve both tmTNFα-binding (on 
activated T-cells) and binding to Fc-receptors (on macrophages), was shown to be similar, which lends 
support to a comparable activity of MSB11022 and Humira in IBD indications.  
The Tg197 mouse model is an established model to study the effects of immunomodulatory agents on 
arthritis. The Applicant compared MSB11022 and Humira in this model and measured the effect on body 
weight, arthritic score and histopathological score. The results show that both compounds have a 
dose-related effect on these parameters, demonstrating their efficacy in this model and using statistical 
analysis, similarity was found on body weight change, total arthritic score and total histopathological 
score at week 12.  
The Applicant provided data obtained in a mouse Tg197/TNBS colitis model. Body weight change and 
TNFα release in colon thick organ cultures were affected by both compounds, without a dose-response 
relationship.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant provided toxicokinetic data that were gathered in a repeated dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Generally, these data show similar pharmacokinetic behaviour of both products. 
Considering the low number of subjects in this study, these data do not significantly contribute to the 
establishment of biosimilarity of both products. Bioequivalence should be concluded from human data. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
In a repeated dose toxicity study, 3 male and 3 female cynomolgus monkeys per group received weekly 
subcutaneous (SC) injections of either vehicle control, MSB11022 (32 mg/kg) or Humira-US (32 mg/kg) 
for a total of 5 injections. The results indicate a comparable exposure and immunogenicity profile and a 
similar toxicity profile without adverse findings for both Idacio and Humira-US.

2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino 
acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should 
be provided. This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting specific ERA studies. 
According to Directive 2001/83/EC, applicants are required to submit an ERA also for applications under 
Art 10(4) similar biological applications. 
The active substance is a protein composed of natural amino acids, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, adalimumab is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Comparable potency was shown for both products (see quality section). With regard to data on binding, 
comparability is generally observed. Although, for the low affinity variant of FcγIIIa (F158), the range of 
observed K D values for MSB110022 (6.2 to 10.1 nM) was exceeding the range for the RMP (3.8 to 8.0 
nM). These results are consistent with the lower total afucosylation of MSB11022. 
Using the MLR assay, the effect on induction of regulatory macrophage and the associated inhibition of T 
cell proliferation was studied. MSB11022 and RMP/RP showed similar effects on both inhibition of T cell 
proliferation as well as on stimulation of regulatory macrophage induction in the MLR assay, which lends 
support to a comparable activity of Idacio and Humira in IBD indications. However, as this method is only 
semi-quantitative, its applicability to establish biosimilarity is limited. 
The ADCC assays measuring cytotoxic activity were run with freshly collected blood cells from healthy 
donors carrying the both alleles (V158 & F158) of the FcγRIIIA receptor, either from heterozygotes (V/F) 
or homozygotes (F/F, V/V). In addition, blood from RA, PsO, CD and UC patient with this F/F and/or V/F 
genetic constitution were used in the NK-cell enriched PBMC ADCC and in the whole blood ADCC assay. In 
the whole blood ADCC assay a similar effect was found for MSB11022 versus RMP/RP using both healthy 
and patient blood cells. In the NK-cell enriched PBMC ADCC assay using healthy donors, a lower 
non-overlapping %EC50 was found with MSB11022 as compared to RMP/RP. The difference was less 
pronounced in UC/CD patient blood (lower but overlapping) than with RA/PsO patient blood. 
In addition, based on data on ADCC activity obtained with different assay formats using both healthy and 
patient blood cells, the Applicant concludes that ADCC activity induced by adalimumab can only be 
detected under amplified artificial conditions and is even abrogated in the presence of physiological levels 
of human serum (healthy donors and CD patients) or IgG; and that no significant difference in ADCC is 
observed between MSB11022 and RMP/RP under more physiologically representative conditions such as 
when using whole blood effector cells or monocytes expressing physiological levels of tmTNF. In the most 
sensitive (NK-PBMC) ADCC assay the lower and not overlapping activities of MSB11022 were only found 
on the %EC50 parameter and not on Emax. In addition, given that the NK PBMC assay Emax occurs at or 
near Ctrough levels found at steady state in humans, the clinical relevance of the observed differences 
may be low.  
It may be considered that the lower ADCC activity in some assays may be associated with the observed 
lower high mannose content of MSB11022 as compared with the RMP. The Applicant showed that over the 
%afucosylation range present in the RMP, there was a high correlation with the NK-enriched PBMC ADCC 
assay activity but only moderate to low correlation for the ADCC reporter assay and the whole blood ADCC 
assay with a goodness of fit of 0.22 – 0.36 for the latter two assays.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019  
Page 26/89 
 
 
 
 
 
In the literature, it is argued that efficacy of anti-TNFα compounds in IBD varies, depending on the type 
of compound. The presence of an active Fc part is considered crucial for efficacy in IBD and different 
responses in patients depending the allotype of FcγIIIa receptor in a patient (low affinity 158F or high 
affinity 158V) suggest that FcγIIIa is involved in the mode of action. ADCC depends on this receptor and 
thus could be considered potentially relevant for efficacy in IBD. The Applicant argues that the literature 
provides conflicting evidence in this respect. In addition, the Applicant showed that the high affinity (2 – 
4 nM) allotype of FcγIIIa receptor 158V did not correlate with % afucosylation nor with any of the ADCC 
assays. To address uncertainties, upon request of the CHMP, the Applicant provided additional data which 
showed the correlation between total afucosylation and ADCC activity in the whole blood ADCC, the NK 
PBMC ADCC and the ADCC reporter assays and also a correlation with FcγRIIIa low affinity (158F) but not 
with the high affinity (158V) activating receptor. 
To further clarify the potential clinical relevance of the observed differences in ADCC activity, the 
Applicant provided data obtained with blood cells from healthy and patient donors, homozygous and/or 
heterozygous for the low affinity allele (F/F, V/F) and data with an ADCC reporter assay expressing the 
FcγRIIIA low affinity (158F) activating receptor. For the majority of assays, the data show similar or lower 
but overlapping data of MSB11022 and RMP with the exception of the NK-enriched PBMC ADCC assay 
%EC50, for which the relevance of translation to the clinic is considered low given the abrogation of the 
difference when more physiological assay conditions or assay formats are used and when also the much 
higher plasma Ctrough steady state levels are considered. Furthermore, other anti-TNF biosimilars, which 
displayed similar differences in glycosylation, FcRIIIa-binding and/or ADCC levels in vitro, did not show 
signs of differences on clinical efficacy. Finally, although the MLR assay has its limitations for establishing 
biosimilarity, similar effects of MSB11022 and RMP/RP were shown on both inhibition of T-cell 
proliferation and on stimulation of regulatory macrophage induction, which lends support to comparable 
activity of MSB11022 and Humira in IBD indications. 
The Applicant provided comparative functional in vitro data related to Fab-related functionalities of 
adalimumab. The Fab-related functionality concerns the binding of sTNFα as measured by subsequent 
effects on cellular processes mediated by binding of sTNFα to its receptor TNFR. This has been 
demonstrated in a wide range of assays. Effects on cellular processes mediated by reverse signalling 
subsequent to the binding to tmTNFα was measured as apoptosis induction in Jurkat:tmTNF cells. 
In Tg197 mouse model for RA, the Applicant used statistical tests to show similarity for the effect of both 
MSB11022 and RP on body weight change from baseline, total arthritic score and total histopathological 
score.  
The Applicant provided data obtained in a mouse Tg197/TNBS colitis model. TNBS induced colitis is a 
well-known method to investigate the effects of anti-inflammatory products on this disease. The design of 
these models vary, which affects the outcome of the study (te Velde et al, 2006). The Applicant used 
Tg197 mice, expressing higher levels of soluble and cleavable tmTNFα. This transgenic mouse is created 
in a C57B1/6 strain. According to te Velde and co-workers (2006), this strain is insensitive to TNBS 
induced colitis. Although the transgene may have affected the sensitivity, it remains uncertain whether 
this mouse is the appropriate model to study colitis. Lack of sensitivity is reflected by absence of lethality, 
also in the vehicle controls. Lack of a dose-response relationship for body weight change and TNFα release 
in colon thick organ cultures diminishes the suitability of this model to establish biosimilarity. The 
Applicant only evaluated TNFα release in colon thick organ cultures. No other cytokines were studied. No 
effects on colon draining lymph node were studied. Due to these omissions the Applicant may have 
missed the measurement of more sensitive endpoints. The endpoints measured by the Applicant (besides 
TNFα release in colon TOC), were body temperature and body weight. As evident from the presented 
results, an effect could be observed, but the sensitivity to detect a difference between both products 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019  
Page 27/89 
 
 
 
 
 
appears minimal. The Applicant did not make a statistical comparison of the results for the chosen 
endpoints between both products. Only statistical tests were used to show that an effect occurred (by 
comparison with the vehicle control). In conclusion, this study does not contribute to the establishment of 
biosimilarity of Idacio and Humira. 
Considering the low number of subjects in the cynomolgus monkey repeated dose toxicity study, the 
safety and toxicokinetic and immunogenicity data do not fully contribute to the establishment of 
biosimilarity of both products. The available quality and in vitro data did not indicate a need to perform a 
study in this species. Consequently, according to current guidelines, this study was not required. The 
study should not have been performed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Comparative data in vitro data were presented on: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support this biosimilar application, the PK-profile of MSB11022 was investigated and compared to 
EU-Humira in the following two studies   
(Pivotal) Phase I Study EMR200588-001 in healthy volunteers: double-blind, 3-arm parallel-group 
comparing the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MSB11022, US-Humira, and 
EU-Humira  
(Supportive) Phase 3 Study EMR200588-002 in psoriasis patients: double-blind, confirmatory study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11022 compared with EU-Humira  
Analytical methods 
The same analytical method was used for the determination of adalimumab in the serum from healthy 
volunteers and patients with psoriasis. 
The following analytical methods were used: a. ELISA for the determination of adalimumab 
concentrations in human serum 
b. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunogenicity assay for detection of antibodies against 
adalimumab (ADA) in human serum  
c. Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD)-ECL immunogenicity assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies 
(NAB) against adalimumab in human serum. 
The ELISA method. In general, the analytical methods were validated in line with the EMA bioanalytical 
guideline. 
The adalimumab concentrations in the serum were determined by a validated ELISA method. In this 
assay, adalimumab (or its biosimilar) is captured by a recombinant human TNFα  and an HRP-conjugated 
goat anti-human IgG antibody is used to detect the bound analyte.  The same analytical method was used 
for the determination of adalimumab in the serum from healthy volunteers and patients with psoriasis. 
A qualitative, single assay approach to detect anti-adalimumab in human serum from healthy individuals 
and patients with psoriasis was used. 
For the NAB assay, a non-cell based competitive ligand binding was used to determine the neutralizing 
capacity of the antibodies. The NAB assay used Sulfo-TAG-labeled TNFα (Ru-TNFα) to form a complex 
with biotinylated adalimumab. An affinity purified goat polyclonal anti-adalimumab was used as a positive 
control. 
Pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in healthy subjects 
PK similarity of adalimumab between MSB11022, EU-Humira and US-Humira was investigated in the 
pivotal study (EMR200588-001) in healthy subjects following administration of a 40 mg SC dose. For the 
primary parameters AUC0-∞ AUC0-t and Cmax, the 90% CI for the ratio of the test and reference products fell 
within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing MSB11022 to the reference product from 
EU as well as from US, and also when comparing the US versus the EU reference products. The 
concentration-time profiles, descriptive statistics of the PK-parameters, statistical comparison of the 
PK-parameters between MSB11022, EU-Humira and US-Humira are shown in Figure 3, Table 6 and 7 
below.

NABs on the pharmacokinetics parameters of the three adalimumab products by ADA grouping are 
summarised below.

The pharmacokinetics in ADA-negative subjects are of particular interest as this allows direct evaluation 
of elimination of the substances without interference of ADAs. Therefore, the agency requested additional 
analyses in ADA negative subjects. Inferential statistical analyses for ADA negative subjects is shown in 
Table 10; the 90% CIs for all comparisons between MSB11022 and EU-Humira fell between 80.00 and 
125.00%. There was no difference in elimination half-life between MSB11022 and EU-Humira. Most 
subjects became ADA positive after day 43; at day 43 on average 42% of the subjects was ADA positive 
while on day 71 on average 82% of the subjects was ADA positive. Analysis of comparison of PK by ADA 
onset showed that there were no differences in both the mean as well as the variability at different time 
points for the 3 products in ADA negative subjects. When subjects converted ADA positive, adalimumab 
exposure decreased but was also comparable for the 3 products.

Pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with psoriasis 
In the supportive phase 3 study in psoriasis patients (EMR200588-002), MSB11022 or EU-Humira  was 
administered with a pre-filled syringe as an initial subcutaneous dose of 80 mg on Day 1, followed by 40 
mg subcutaneously every other week starting 1 week after the initial dose. 
The Ctrough concentrations of MSB11022 and EU-Humira  appear to be comparable as illustrated Figure 
4. Similarity of Ctrough adalimumab concentrations was shown for the Core Treatment Period (0-16 
weeks)  (Table 11). More variability was observed for the Extended Treatment Period especially in the 
ADA negative group due to the low number of ADA negative subjects. In the cross-over comparison, that 
included subjects who were in the EU-Humira arm before Week 16 and were switched later to MSB11022, 
mean concentrations before and after the switch differed by less than 3%.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical comparative PD study was submitted by the applicant. No accepted specific pharmacodynamic 
(PD) markers exist, being predictive of efficacy of adalimumab in patients. PD similarity of MSB11022 and 
Humira in terms of TNF-α inhibition has been investigated in non-clinical studies.  
CRP (C-reactive protein) was among the biochemistry parameters investigated in study EMR200588-002.

Figure 5 shows a similar pattern of decline in CRP levels was observed between the MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira groups over the first 16 weeks (Core Treatment Period) of study EMR200588-002. A formal 
between-group comparison of CRP results was not performed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To support this biosimilar application, the PK-profile of MSB11022 was investigated and compared to 
EU-Humira in Phase I Study EMR200588-001 in healthy volunteers. The study design of the 
pharmacokinetic study EMR200588-001 is satisfactory; a parallel design is acceptable considering the 
long half-life of adalimumab (approximately 2 weeks) and the potential influence of immunogenicity. The 
use of healthy volunteers is agreed in line with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues. Supportive comparative PK data were 
collected in the Phase 3 Study EMR200588-002 in psoriasis patients, which is also in line with guideline 
recommendations. The 40 mg SC dose is the normally recommended dose. 
Humira is presented in three formulations: vial, pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen (auto-injector) 
formulations. The Applicant is applying for all these three formulations. However, only the pre-filled 
syringe has been used in the clinical studies and no PK study was done to show the equivalence of the 
pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen formulations. Considering that the pre-filled syringe is assembled 
directly with the pen, this was considered acceptable to the CHMP since the quality of the medical device 
ensures comparable release of the solution (see Quality AR). 
Analytical methods 
The same analytical method was used for the determination of adalimumab in the serum from healthy 
volunteers and patients with psoriasis. This is acceptable as functional interchangeability between each 
version of adalimumab in the assay was demonstrated. Hence, use of MSB11022 as a calibration standard 
and for quality control samples during study sample analysis is agreed. The performance of the analytical 
method used for assessment of MSB11022 and adalimumab in serum seems acceptable and  validation is 
in line with EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation. No relevant interference of ADA with the 
quantitation of adalimumab was observed when the concentration of anti-drug antibody was ≤ one third 
of adalimumab concentration in serum, at higher ADA concentrations interference occurs. The effect of 
ADAs on the quantitation of adalimumab was similar for the MSB11022 as for Humira. During validation 
it was discovered that anti-TNF-αbiologics might interfere with the adalimumab concentration 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 38/89  
 
 
 
  
  
measurement. Therefore, subjects with anti-TNF-α therapies without an adequate wash-out period were 
excluded from the PK and patients studies. Absence of interference was confirmed by predose 
adalimumab concentrations <LLOQ at day 1.The immune response after adalimumab administration was 
evaluated by a three-step procedure comprising a screening (Tier 1) and confirmatory (Tier 2) 
electrochemoluminescence (ECL) assay for detecting anti-adalimumab antibodies (ADAs) and a 
neutralization antibody (Nab) ECL assay (Tier 3). In addition, titer of the ADAs was determined. 
A one assay approach was used to detect anti-adalimumab in human serum from healthy individuals and 
patients with psoriasis. This was chosen to minimize the potentially confounding influence of higher 
inter-assay variability associated with labelling of both MSB11022 and EU-and US-Humira. This approach 
was agreed upon in one of the scientific advices sought by the Applicant.  
The tested drug tolerance of the ADA assay differs slightly among the 3 adalimumab products. For 
MSB11022, the high PCs 10000 and 250 ng/ml tolerated 500 μg/ml and the low PCsm 129.6 and 86.4 
ng/ml tolerated 250 μg/ml; for EU-Humira, all the 4  PCs tolerated 500 μg/ml concentration; and for 
US-Humira, PCs 10000, 250 and 129.6 ng/ml tolerated 500 μg/ml and PC 86.4 ng/ml tolerated 250 
μg/ml. The reported differences are likely to be the results of the variability of the assay observed. 
Despite this difference, this can be considered acceptable for the healthy human serum study samples 
considering that the highest Cmax concentration measured in these samples was about 7 μg/ml. This 
covers also the highest trough concentration of about 25 μg/ml in psoriasis patients.  
For the NAB assay, a non-cell based competitive ligand binding was used to determine the neutralizing 
capacity of the antibodies. Some of the actions of adalimumab appear to be mediated through the 
induction of several cellular responses, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis, in particular in patients with 
inflammatory bowel diseases. Cell-based assays are recommended for monoclonal antibody therapeutics 
with cellular effector functions for clinical efficacy as the mechanism of action may not be adequately 
reflected in a non-cell-based CLB assay (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). ADAs induced by 
adalimumab have been shown neutralizing potential by competition with TNF for binding to the CDRs 
(Harding, 2010, van Schouwenburg, 2013; van Schouwenburg, 2014; van Schie, 2014). Therefore, it is 
considered unlikely that a cell-based assay would be able to detect Fc-mediated effector response 
inhibition on top of neutralising competitive inhibition. For adalimumab, the competitive ligand binding 
assay is acceptable to detect neutralizing anti-bodies though the assay is expected to underestimate the 
% of NAB positive patients because of drug interference but this is inherent to competitive binding ADAs. 
As adalimumab exposure is higher in patients than in the healthy subjects due to the longer wash-out 
period, underestimation of NAB incidence is mainly expected to occur in patients.  
Overall, the analytical methods were validated in line with the relevant guidelines.  
Pharmacokinetic studies 
For the study in healthy subjects (EMR200588-001), the primary parameters AUC0-∞ AUC0-t and Cmax, the 
90% CI for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% 
when comparing MSB11022 to the reference product from EU as well as from US, and also when 
comparing the US versus the EU reference products (see Figure 3, Table 6 and  Table 7). Further support 
for similarity between MSB11022 and EU-Humira was obtained in the study in psoriasis patients (study 
EMR200588-002). The Ctrough concentrations of MSB11022 and EU-Humira was comparable (Table 11). 
In addition, in patients who were switched from Humira to MSB11022 at week 16, mean adalimumab 
concentrations remained the same. In the cross-over comparison, that included subjects who were in the 
EU-Humira arm before Week 16 and were switched later to MSB11022, mean concentrations before and 
after the switch differed by less than 3%.    
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 39/89  
 
 
  
  
Immunogenicity was high: in the healthy subjects, ADA and NAB incidence approximately 80% and 70%, 
respectively, was high but comparable in all the three groups. In psoriasis patients, ADA and NAB 
incidence approximately 90% and 45%, respectively, was also high but comparable between the 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira group. Moreover, the incidence and the distribution of ADA titers over time 
was similar between MSB11022 and Humira. These results indicate comparable immunogenicity between 
the products. The new generation of ADA detection methods have an improved sensitivity compared to 
older ADA detection methods, resulting in a higher incidence of ADA positivity. Therefore, incidence of 
ADA for Humira reported in the EPAR is considerably lower than recently reported ADA incidences for 
Humira in biosimilar applications including this application. 
Variability in the PK parameters was higher in subjects positive for ADA compared to ADA negative 
subjects. Elimination half-life and adalimumab exposure was lower in subjects positive for antidrug 
antibodies compared to subjects negative for antidrug antibodies as shown in Table 8 and Table 9. This 
is already known for Humira.  
Although the 90% CI for the ratio of MSB11022 and EU-Humira  fell within the acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00%, some issues were clarified. The upper limit of 90%CI for AUCinf  excludes 1 (i.e. 90% CI 
80.14 – 99.10) and this statistical difference in AUCinf might indicate a difference in clearance. Sensitivity 
analyses for protein content and ADA status were conducted. Difference in protein content between 
MSB11022 and Humira-EU was slightly more than 5%, a sensitivity analysis was conducted correcting for 
protein amount administered. When correction for protein content, similarity was demonstrated for 
AUCinf, AUCt, and Cmax with 90% CI within 80-125% similarity margin including unity for all parameters. 
Also the results for ADA negative subjects were similar between MSB11022 and Humira supporting the 
conclusion for biosimilarity between MSB11022 and Humira based on the overall study population. The 
pharmacokinetics in ADA-negative subjects are of particular interest as this allows direct evaluation of 
elimination of the substances without interference of ADAs. No difference in elimination half-life was 
observed between MSB11022 and Humira in ADA negative patients. The elimination of adalimumab 
seemed somewhat faster for MSB11022 than for Humira in the ADA positive subjects but sensitivity 
analysis of elimination half-life by consideration of the time at which subjects became ADA positive 
indicated that there was no consistent pattern that elimination half-life of adalimumab was shorter for 
MSB11022 than for Humira. In addition, in psoriasis patients, the adalimumab concentrations of 
MSB11022 were comparable or slightly higher at all time points compared to EU-Humira.  Overall, the PK 
results for ADA negative subjects and the Ctrough values in patients with psoriasis support the conclusion 
for biosimilarity between MSB11022 and Humira. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The relevance of the PD data on CRP in study EMR200588-002 in patients with psoriasis is considered to 
be limited. The results are supportive to compare the effects of MSB11022 and EU-Humira on disease 
activity data, but in psoriasis CRP levels are not sufficiently representative of disease activity. For that 
purpose, outcome measures of skin involvement (e.g. PASI, PGA) were used in the phase 3 studies.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK similarity has been demonstrated between MSB11022 and EU-Humira following administration of a 40 
mg SC dose to healthy subjects in study EMR200588-001 and has been supported by PK data in psoriasis 
patients in study EMR200588-002.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application includes one main clinical study (EMR200588-002).

2.5.1.  Main study 
Study EMR200588-002 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy of MSB11022, a proposed 
biosimilar to adalimumab, compared to EU-approved Humira, both administered subcutaneously, in 
subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Immunogenicity and safety (and PK 
parameters) were also assessed. Study EMR200588-002 was a 52-week randomized, double-blind, Phase 
III study, consisting of a 15-week Core Treatment Period followed by a 37-week Extended Treatment 
Period and a 4-month safety follow-up (Figure 1).  
Methods 
Design  
For the Core Treatment Period, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized to 
receive MSB11022 or EU-sourced Humira for 16 weeks in a double-blind fashion (Figure 1). Patients were 
given an initial dose of 80 mg subcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week 
starting one week after the initial dose. The primary outcome was 75% response (yes/no) in the Psoriasis 
Area severity Index (PASI75) at 16 weeks. Main secondary outcome was the percentage change in PASI. 
Safety and immunogenicity outcomes were also assessed. Study visits were scheduled at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 
12 and 16. 
For the Extended Treatment Period starting at week 16, patients with at least 50% PASI response 
were eligible. The Period lasted 37 weeks (Figure 1). Double-blinding was maintained in the Extended 
Treatment Period. Patients who had received EU-Humira in the Core Treatment Period were 
re-randomized to a switch to MSB11022 or to continue EU-Humira. Patients on MSB11022 continued to 
receive MSB11022. Study visits were scheduled at week 16, and every 8 weeks thereafter up to week 52 
(Figure 1). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 41/89  
 
 
 
 
  
  
The study was performed in 50 centres in Europe and 19 centres in Northern America.  
Study participants  
Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had received, or are candidate for, systemic 
therapy or phototherapy were eligible to enter the study. Patients having Psoriatic Arthritis could also be 
included, if they had a documented diagnosis by a rheumatologist, earlier than 6 months before baseline. 
Moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis was defined by: ≥ 10% body surface area affected, Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index score of ≥ 12, and Physicians Global Assessment score of ≥ 3, at screening and 
baseline. Previous use of not more than 1 prior biological therapy with either etanercept or infliximab was 
allowed. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive MSB11022 or EU-sourced Humira, stratified (block size 
of 4) according to three levels of pre-treatment: treatment-naïve, non-biological use, biological use. 
There were no other stratification factors. At week 16, all eligible patients took part in the 
re-randomization procedure. Patients who initially had been randomized to EU-Humira were 
re-randomization 1:1 to MSB11022 or EU-Humira. Patients who initially had been randomized to 
MSB11022 were re-randomized to MSB11022 again. Each study centre had received a blinded supply of 
study medication with individually numbered study kits, allocated to patients using a web based response 
system.  
Study treatments 
MSB1102 and EU-sourced Humira were delivered in blinded prefilled syringes for subcutaneous 
administration. In agreement with the Humira SmPC, the initial ‘baseline’ dose was 80 mg, followed by 40 
mg every other week starting 1 week after the initial dose. The study product of MSB11022 was 
representative for the to-be-marketed product. At Weeks 1, 2 and 4 the study medication was 
administered at the study site, and the patient or the care giver was trained for self-administration. 
Subsequent administrations of study medication were performed every other week, at home or on the 
study site at the scheduled study visits. Compliance with study medication was checked using a patient 
diary and by counting all used and unused study medication, which the patient had to bring at each study 
visit. 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint of Study EMR200588-002 was the percentage of subjects meeting the PASI 75 
(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score reduction of ≥75% from baseline) response criteria at Week 16. 
The main secondary endpoint was percent change from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI) at Week 16. Continuous absolute PASI scores over all time points were also presented. 
Percentage of subjects achieving PASI 50/90/100 at Week 16 and Week 24 
Further secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
• 
• 
• 
Percent change from baseline in PASI at Week 24 
Percentage of subjects achieving a static Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score of “clear” or 
“almost clear” at Week 16 and Week 24 compared to Baseline 
Change in PGA at Week 16 and Week 24 compared to Baseline

• 
Sample size 
It was calculated that approximately 382 subjects (191 evaluable subjects per arm) would be required for 
the analysis of the primary endpoint (PASI 75 at Week 16) to provide a power close to 90% for an 
equivalence margin of 18% and a Type I error of 2.5% (1-sided). The sample size was based on: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 42/89  
 
 
 
  
  
• 
An estimated response rate of 59% for the primary endpoint (based on an anticipated PASI 
75 response rate of 72% in anti-TNF-naïve- subjects (1-3) and 30% in anti-TNF-experienced 
subjects (4-8), in subjects with normal weight [below 90 kg]; and an anticipated PASI 75 
response rate of 61% in anti-TNF-naïve subjects (9-10) and 15% in anti-TNF-experienced 
subjects, in overweight subjects [weight between 90 kg and 120 kg]. The subject population 
is composed of 18% of anti-TNF-experienced patients and 82% of anti-TNF-naïve patients, as 
well as a maximum of 40% of overweight subjects and 60% of normal weight subjects). This 
was calculated as a weighted mean of the response rates observed in the above mentioned 
studies (1-10). 
• 
An expected difference between EU-Humira and MSB11022 of 0 following a single 80 mg dose 
of EU-Humira at Week 1 and a 40 mg dose every other week from Week 2 up to Week 16 (1-8, 
11). 
Approximately 426 subjects (213 per arm) were planned to be randomized, to account for an estimated 
10% of subjects excluded from the per protocol primary endpoint analysis population up to Week 16. This 
will also provide a power close to 90% for the key secondary endpoint. 
Statistical methods 
The Per Protocol (PP) data set was used for the analysis of primary and main secondary outcome (Table 
below). Additional analyses were performed using the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) data set. 
Table 9 Overview of statistical methods planned 
Therapeutic equivalence of MSB11022 and EU-approved Humira was assessed based on the primary 
endpoint of PASI 75 at Week 16. The 2 treatment groups were compared using the 2-sided 95% 
Newcombe confidence interval (CI) (using Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel weights) for the treatment difference 
(MSB11022 – EU-approved Humira) in PASI 75 response rate stratified by previous systemic therapy 
(treatment-naive, prior exposure to a biological agent, prior exposure to a non-biological agent). To 
CHMP assessment report

declare equivalence, the 95% CI for the treatment difference in PASI 75 response rates at Week 16 had 
to be entirely contained in the predefined equivalence margins [-18%,18%]. 
Sensitivity analyses were carried out using 1) imputation missing-at-random (MAR), 2) a more 
conservative imputation assuming MAR where imputed responders in the MSB11022 group only were 
categorized as non-responders with a probability corresponding to the equivalence margin, and 3) a 
tipping point analysis.  In the tipping point analysis, data were re-analysed for all possible combinations 
of the number of responders/non-responders imputed for drop-outs in each treatment arm. 
The key secondary endpoint was percent change from baseline in PASI at Week 16. The analysis of the 
key secondary endpoint was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, 
previous systemic therapy use, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as fixed factors and baseline PASI 
score as a covariate. The analysis was performed primarily on the PP Analysis Set and was repeated on 
the ITT analysis set, using baseline-observation-carried-forward (BOCF)-like multiple imputation 
approach. In a BOCF-like multiple imputation approach it is assumed that that after drop-out, a subject’s 
outcome reverts to a distribution similar to baseline values (i.e. of the PASI score) of the population. 
Results  
Participant flow  
In total 649 patients were screened and 443 (68%) were randomised (Figure 2). The most common 
reasons for discontinuation in the Core Treatment Period were adverse events (MSB11022 n=1 and 
EU-Humira (n=9) and withdrawal of informed consent (MSB11022 n=1 and EU-Humira n=4) and protocol 
non-compliance (MSB11022 n=3 and EU-Humira n=1). Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy occurred 
infrequently. In the Extended Treatment Period, in total 41 patients discontinued after 
re-randomization (Figure 2), most commonly due to adverse events (n=18) or lack of efficacy (n=8) or 
withdrawal of consent (n=7), equally divided over all three treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
In the Core Treatment Period, the proportion of patients remaining in the PP set was 91% in the 
MSB11022 group and 85% in the EU-Humira group (Table 6). Nearly all patients remained in the Safety 
Analysis (SAF) set.  
In the Extended Treatment Period, the proportion of patients remaining in the ETP-PP set was 95% in the 
MSB11022 group, 94% in the EU-Humira group and 95% in the EU-Humira to MSB1102 group (Table 7). 
Nearly all patients remained in the SAF set.

Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were overall similar for the MSB11022 and EU-Humira treated groups.  At 
baseline of the Core Treatment Period, the majority of patients was male (~67%) and white (~92%), 
with a mean (range) age of ~44 (20-74) years. The proportion of patients heavier than 90 kg was 10%. 
Baseline disease characteristics reflect a population with moderate to severe psoriasis (Table 9). The 
average PASI score was about 20, the minimum PASI score was 12. The majority of patients had 
previously used therapies for psoriasis.

After re-randomisation for the Extended Treatment Period, the baseline (i.e. at week 16) 
characteristics of the between the MSB11022, EU-Humira and EU-Humira/MSB11022 group were similar 
between the three treatment groups (Table 4) and comparable to the results described above.

Compliance 
Treatment compliance was defined as the total injections received / the number of planned injections. In 
the Core Treatment Period, mean compliance in the MSB11022 group and the EU-Humira group was 
about 99%. In the Extended Treatment Period, compliance was 98%-99% in all three treatment groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
The PASI75 response at week 16 in the PP set was of similar size in both treatment groups: 90% in the 
MSB1102 group and 92% in the EU-Humira group. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment 
difference was within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 18% (Figure 3), in PP and in ITT sets. In 
both the PP and the ITT set the 95% confidence interval included 0 (no difference). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 48/89  
 
 
 
 
  
  
Two sensitivity analyses with different imputation methods were used in the ITT set. Both sensitivity 
analyses provided 95% confidence intervals for the difference in treatment effects that were within the 
+/- 18% equivalence limits, while including 0. The additional ‘tipping point’ analysis showed that for all 
~1000 scenario’s the results were within the equivalence margins. 
Main secondary outcome 
The mean percent change in PASI from baseline to week 16 in the PP set was similar in size for both 
treatment groups: -91% in the MSB11022 group and -92% in the EU-Humira group. This was based on a 
change in baseline PASI score from approximately 21 to less than 2 in both treatment groups. The 2-sided 
95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 
15% (Figure 4), in PP and in ITT sets. In both the PP and the ITT set the 95% confidence interval included 
0 (no difference). 
Two sensitivity analyses with different imputation methods (including one with a BOCF-like multiple 
imputation approach) were used in the ITT set. Both sensitivity analyses provided 95% confidence 
intervals for the difference in treatment effects that were within the +/- 15% equivalence limits, while 
including 0.

Further secondary outcomes 
The mean PASI scores of the MSB1102 and EU-Humira groups showed a similar decline from around 21 
at baseline to just below 2 at week 16 in the PP set (Figure 5) and in the ITT set. The medians showed a 
similar pattern. 
In the Extended Treatment Period the baseline PASI was low, and remained similarly low in all three 
treatment groups (Figure 7). 
Consequently, the mean percentage PASI change in the Core Treatment Period and in the Extended 
Treatment Period was similar for all treatment groups over all time points, in the PP and ITT sets. 
The proportions of PASI50, PASI90 and PASI100 responders at week 16 were similar in the MSB11022 
and EU-Humira group, in PP and ITT sets. At week 52, the proportions of PASI50, PASI75, PASI90 and 
PASI100 responders were similar in the two groups continuing treatment and the group who switched 
from EU-Humira to MSB11022. The between-group differences were 9% at the largest (for PASI90).

The proportions of PGA responders at week 16 were similar in the BMS11022 and EU-Humira group, in 
PP (Figure 13) and ITT sets. At week 52, the proportions of PGA responders were similar in the two groups 
continuing treatment and the group who switched from EU-Humira to MSB11022 (Figure 13). 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for demographic variables and for previous use of systemic therapy 
(the randomisation stratification factor), for PASI75 (Figure 15) and for PGA response as outcomes. In the 
subgroup analyses of PASI75, the 95% confidence intervals of all subgroups included 0 and nearly all 
estimates of the treatment difference were close to 0. The largest deviation was seen in the subgroup of 
previous users of ‘non-biological’ systemic therapy in favour of MSB11022 (Figure 15). The upper limit of 
the 95% confidence interval of the difference aligned with the upper limit of the +18% equivalence 
margin. The same kind of results were seen in the subgroup analyses with PGA response as outcome. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in the majority of (~90%) of patients in both groups over the 
course of 16 weeks. The PASI75 response responder rates (primary outcome) was were slightly  lower 
(about 5-7%)  in ADA positive patients than in ADA negative patients, to a similar extent in patients 
treated with MSB11022 and patients treated with EU-Humira (Figure 17). Similar results were obtained 
for the mean percentage change in PASI (main secondary outcome) from week 2 up to and including week 
16. 
Over 54 weeks, all ADA negative patients in all three treatment groups were PASI75 responders. Of the 
vast majority who were ADA positive, ~91% of patients were PASI75 responders in the three treatment 
groups. Also in mean percentage change in PASI, differences in response between ADA positive patients 
of the three treatment groups were small.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design and conduct of the clinical equivalence study is generally considered as adequate. EU-sourced 
Humira is a relevant comparator. The overall design has been agreed by the CHMP in the Scientific Advice. 
The study appears to be reasonably well conducted, as the number of drop-outs and missing values was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 55/89  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
low and adherence to the medication was good. The MSB11022 study product used in the clinical studies 
is  representative  for  the  to-be-marketed  product.  The  dose of  EU-Humira  and  MSB11022  used in  the 
equivalence trial is in accordance with the posology in the Humira SmPC. Remarkably, the randomisation 
was not stratified on centre, in contrast to what is customary in multi centre trials. However, absence of 
probably relevant centre effects was sufficiently documented, using numbers of enrolment and drop-outs 
per centre and country/region, and by analysing treatment effects by country/region.  
As  concluded  in  the  SAWP/CHMP  advice,  the  patient  population  chosen  for  the  trial  is  considered  as 
appropriate and sensitive to detect differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira. The main reasons 
are: within 12 weeks relatively large treatment effects with adalimumab can be attained in psoriasis; 
concomitant immunosuppressive therapies that may interfere with treatment effects and immunogenicity 
are  generally  not  used  in  psoriasis;  established  and  sensitive  outcome  measures  (notably  PASI)  are 
available for psoriasis trials.  
However, as expressed in the CHMP advice, the PASI75 responder rate at week 16 as primary outcome is 
considered less suitable than a continuous endpoint, such as mean change in PASI score, for purpose of 
testing equivalence of MSB11022 and EU-Humira. Week 16 is already at the plateau of efficacy, and a 
dichotomy like PASI75 is less sensitive than the continuous ‘parent’ PASI outcome. Therefore, in addition 
to the primary and main secondary outcomes, evaluation of PASI scores of the treatment groups over all 
time points of the first 16 weeks of the study is considered important, descriptive results of the course of 
continuous PASI were provided. 
The assumptions of the sample size calculation based on the primary outcome and for the main secondary 
outcome (percent change from Baseline in PASI score at week 16) are considered reasonable and the 
calculated sample size is acceptable.  
The 18% equivalence margin for PASI75 was justified by the Applicant statistically (preservation of 70% 
of the treatment effect) and based on clinical arguments (25% is the difference between PASI75 that 
nowadays substitutes PASI50). Margins of either 15% (percent PASI change) or of 18% (PASI75 
response) have been accepted previously by the CHMP. 
While the margins are perceived as rather wide, in absence of a minimal clinically important difference for 
PASI and for PASI75, it is difficult to find clear scientific justification for smaller margins (e.g. 10%). 
However, the 15% and 18% equivalence margins are quite wide relative to the treatment effects and the 
upper margin actually exceeds 100%. Additionally, the Applicant did not explain how far the responses 
close to the ‘ceiling’ are artificially favouring the conclusion of equivalence. However, as the continuous 
PASI score shows equivalence, the issue is not pursued further. 
In general the statistical methods used are considered acceptable. However, an analysis stratifying on 
centre (or country) was initially missing for both the primary and main secondary endpoint and no 
subgroup analyses were performed based on centre or country. The analysis of the main secondary 
endpoint, mean PASI change, was not performed with the most simple model including only stratification 
factors, but it also included gender and BMI that were regarded important prognostic factors. However, 
analysis without gender and BMI lead to similar results. The analysis including (pooled) country and 
country by treatment interaction as fixed effect supported the primary analysis. 
In the study there overall was not much discontinuation. Most discontinuations were due to TEAEs, and 
occurred in the first period after baseline which can be expected. However, there were considerable more 
discontinuations in EU-Humira group as compared to the MSB11022 group. There was no clear pattern in 
causes of discontinuations, and since most of these were not treatment related, it is considered that these 
are likely chance findings.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results of the equivalence study show that MSB11022 and EU-Humira are similarly effective regarding 
the main secondary outcome (mean percent change in PASI) as well as the primary outcome (PASI75).  
The mean percent change in PASI from baseline to week 16 in the PP set was similar in size for both 
treatment groups: -91% in the MSB11022 group and -92% in the EU-Humira group. The 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval of the treatment difference was within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 15% 
and included 0 (no difference).   
The PASI75 response at week 16 in the PP set was of similar size in both treatment groups: 90% in the 
MSB1102 group and 92% in the EU-Humira group. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment 
difference was within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 18% (Figure 3) and included 0 (no 
difference). 
For both outcomes, the results of the ITT analyses were similar to the PP-analyses, and also the sensitivity 
analyses supported the results of the main analyses.  
The results of the secondary outcomes, including the mean PASI scores over time, supported the results 
of the main analyses.  Importantly, the mean PASI scores of the MSB1102 and EU-Humira groups showed 
a similar decline from baseline, week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. Baseline scores were around 21 and decreased 
to just below 2 at week 16 in the PP and ITT sets.  
From week 16 (re-randomization) to week 24 and week 52, the PASI score remained similarly low in the 
groups continuing EU-Humira, continuing MSB11022 or switching to MSB11022. Consequently, the mean 
percentage change in PASI, PASI 50, 75 and 90 were similar for all three treatment groups, which also 
occurred for the proportions of PGA responders. 
The results of the subgroup analyses are regarded to be supportive for equivalence of MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira. Subgroup analyses were performed for demographic variables and for previous use of 
systemic therapy (the randomisation stratification factor) for PASI75 and for PGA response, the results 
provided no indication that MSB11022 and EU-Humira performed dissimilar. Further subgroup analysis 
was performed for ADA positivity. In both treatment groups most (~90%) patients had developed 
Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) in the course of the first 16 weeks. Patients who were ADA positive showed on 
average a slightly decreased PASI75 response, similarly for MSB11022 and EU-Humira. 
Notably, the effects of MSB11022 and of EU-Humira on PASI and on PASI75 at week 16 were large in 
comparison to the previous expectations. It is most likely that several factors played a role in causing the 
high responses, notably PP analysis as opposed to ITT analysis and the study design with 2 active 
treatments, which may influence expectations about the treatment effect and thus influences scoring by 
investigators. An average PASI75 response of 60% was expected from a meta-analysis of historic data, 
while the PASI75 response in the equivalence study amounted to 90%, in both treatment groups. While 
this approaches the ‘ceiling’ of what can be measured with PASI75, it makes these outcomes less 
sensitive for detecting differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira. Illustratively, the upper 
equivalence margin of 18% exceeds 100% now the PASI75 response was 90%. The ‘parent’ continue 
PASI scores are regarded to be more sensitive to detect between-group differences. Therefore, it can be 
considered supportive for equivalence in efficacy that also in the early course of the study, the decrease 
in PASI scores was similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira. While most other secondary outcomes are mere 
transformations of the PASI score (PASI50/75/90/100), it is also supportive for equivalence that the 
results on PGA and BSA were similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira.  
It is remarkable that within the first 16 weeks of the equivalence study, the vast majority patients 
developed ADA positivity (about 90%). The proportion of ADA positive (yes/no) patients was similar in 
both groups. However, as this also approaches the upper limit of the measurement scale, it may not be 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 57/89  
 
 
 
  
  
sensitive to detect small differenced in immunogenicity, if present. Therefore, for assessing equivalence 
it is useful to also evaluate ADA titres and nAB over the course of the study. While the proportion of ADA 
positivity is much higher than in previous studies, this may be due to the specific assay used (refer to PK 
section). Although the group of ADA negative patients is much smaller than the group of ADA positive 
patients and therefore difficult to analyse, it appeared that there was only a small reduction in efficacy, in 
PASI75 as well as in the more sensitive percent PASI change, in ADA positive patients.  
Extrapolation in other indications 
MSB11022 is proposed for the same indications as for Humira, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, Axial spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Psoriasis, Paediatric plaque psoriasis, 
Hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, Paediatric Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis. The main 
equivalence study was performed in patients with psoriasis. It is considered that extrapolation of clinical 
equivalence from psoriasis to those disorders where the effect of adalimumab is primarily attained 
through inhibition of soluble TNF (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis) 
can be agreed. This is in line with the CHMP Scientific Advice.  
However, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, including Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s disease) an 
important part of the effect of adalimumab is thought to be mediated via the membrane-bound TNF 
receptor. In line with the CHMP advice, extrapolation to inflammatory bowel disease would require 
convincing evidence from the preclinical studies related to these other potential mechanisms, e.g. the 
binding and effector functions in the setting of membrane bound TNF. There were uncertainties for the 
non-clinical and Quality data whether MSB11002 is equally potent to Humira in effector functions which 
are relevant subsequent to binding of adalimumab to the membrane-bound TNF (i.e. differences in high 
mannose content related to differences in ADCC activity and absence of data on regulatory 
macrophages). These uncertainties have now been solved (see quality and non-clinical sections). Further, 
the Applicant argued that extrapolation to IBD indications from the psoriasis study is justified, considering 
that the doses of adalimumab are similar, irrespective of the indication and their assumed main targets 
(membrane-bound TNF for IBD or soluble TNF for psoriasis and arthritis indications). Another argument 
from the Applicant was that the PK is equivalent between MSB11002 and Humira, whereas the PK profile 
is also determined by binding to the target. The psoriasis study and the PK study are in general supportive 
of equivalence however these studies do not univocally support an extrapolation to IBD.  
Consequently, it is considered that therapeutic equivalence can be extrapolated from psoriasis to 
inflammatory bowel disease, because therapeutic equivalence is considered supported by the pre-clinical 
evidence related to membrane-bound TNF-associated modes of action. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
It is considered that all efficacy results of the equivalence study in patients with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis are supporting comparable efficacy of MSB11022 and EU-Humira. Psoriasis is regarded 
as a sensitive model and the study was sufficiently powered. The period from baseline up to plateau of the 
effect is regarded to be most sensitive to detect differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira, if they 
exist. According to the results of the study, MSB11022 and EU-Humira were similarly effective at week 16 
in change in PASI score and in PASI75 response. 
The 95%CI of the differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira was small, clearly within the 
equivalence margins, and included zero. Importantly, these findings are supported by the mean PASI 
scores over all visits of the 16 week Core Treatment Period,that were similar for MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira, without a tendency for MSB11022 to be worse. Together with the consistent results of the 
subgroup analyses, other secondary outcomes, 52 week data and switching data, this supports that 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira have equivalent efficacy in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 58/89  
 
 
  
  
The PASI75 responder rates are much higher than anticipated based on historical data. Therefore, the 
chosen NI margin and the effect of the high response rate on the interpretation of the primary endpoint 
is unclear; it is conceivable that PASI75 is less sensitive.  As the continuous PASI scores support 
equivalence, the issue was not pursued further. 
Extrapolation from the psoriasis model to inflammatory bowel disease is supported by the pre-clinical 
evidence related to membrane-bound TNF-associated modes of action.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The Clinical Study Report was submitted including the 54-week data and an addendum to the Clinical 
Study Report including the 66-week safety data (final database lock). 
Patient exposure 
Given the two-phase design of study EMR200588-002, the safety data were organised to describe the 
Core Treatment Period, the Extended Treatment Period, and the Overall Treatment Period  (Table 5). In 
both study phases, nearly all randomised patients remained in the Safety Analysis Set.  
Adverse events 
In the Core Treatment Period of study EMR200588-002 (baseline – week 16), about half of the patients 
had at least 1 TEAE, similar in each of the two treatment groups (Table 11). The majority of TEAEs were 
of mild or moderate severity. Serious AEs occurred in eight patients in the MSB11022 group and in six 
patients in the EU-Humira group. By the investigators, two and four of the Serious AEs were considered 
to be related to the study drug, deaths did not occur (see section ‘Serious adverse events and Deaths’). 
The occurrence of adverse events of special interest (AESI’s) was low. In the EU-Humira group, more 
patients than in the MSB11022 group discontinued the treatment and the study due to TEAEs (Table 11).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 59/89  
 
 
 
  
  
In the Core Treatment Period, the most common AEs (≥2%) by organ class for MSB11022 and EU-Humira 
were: infections and infestations (19% and 21%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(15% and 16%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (8% and 6%). Neoplasms (benign, malignant and 
unspecified) occurred in 1 (0.5%) and 7 (3%) of patients in the MSB11022 and the EU-Humira group. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders occurred in 6 (2.7%) and 1 (0.5%) of patients in the MSB11022 
and the EU-Humira group. The commonest AEs (≥2%) by preferred term were: nasopharyngitis, injection 
site erythema and injection site pain, headache (Table 14). 
In the Core Treatment Period, 2 patients in the MSB11022 group (n=222) and 1 patient in the EU-Humira 
group (n=221) were reported to have adverse events of special interest (AESIs). Of the serious 
infections, these were chronic cholecystitis and respiratory tract viral infection in the MSB11022 group 
and bacterial arthritis in the EU-Humira group. Latent or active TB did not occur in this period. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 60/89  
 
 
 
 
  
  
Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 5 patients in the MSB11022 group (n=222) compared with 6 
patients in the EU-Humira group (n=221). Injection site reactions occurred in a similar frequency and 
pattern in the MSB11022 (11%) and EU-Humira (14%) groups. 
In the Overall Treatment Period of study EMR200588-002 (baseline – week 54), the frequency of 
occurrence of AEs (Table 12) was raised compared to the Core Treatment Period of the first 16 weeks 
(Table 11). The occurrence of SAEs was highest in the continuous MSB11022 group, but a minority of the 
occurrences were considered to be drug-related. Occurrence of AESIs was also highest in the continuous 
MSB11022 group (Table 12).  
The most frequent AEs according to SOC term in the continuous MSB11022 and the continuous 
EU-Humira groups (Table 15) were: infections and infestations (51% and 38%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (20% and 21%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (15% 
and 10%), investigations (14% and 18%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (13% and 4%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (13% and 17%). The largest differences between continuous MSB11022 
and continuous EU-Humira occurred in the SOCs: infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, blood and lymphatic disorders (5% and 
1.7%). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 61/89  
 
 
 
  
  
The occurrence of AEs according to Preferred Term  (Table 16) appeared to be dissimilar (in %) between 
the two groups continuing on MSB11022 or EU-Humira for: hypertriglyceridaemia/’blood triglycerides 
increased’, hypertension, bronchitis but not upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis but not 
nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, headache. For some of these AEs, smaller dissimilarities can be noted already 
at the end of the Core Treatment Period (Table 14). 
Regarding infections and infestations, it can be seen in Table 16 that for every tabulated infection, except 
herpes simplex, occurrence in continuous MSB11022 was slightly higher than in continuous EU-Humira: 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, bronchitis, tonsillitis, viral infection, latent 
tuberculosis. There also were relatively more patients on continuous MSB11022 having an infection that 
occurred in few or single patients (not shown). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 62/89  
 
 
 
  
  
In the Extended Treatment Period (week 16 – week 54), the occurrence of TEAEs was generally similar 
in the groups of patients who switched to MSB11022 or who continued EU-Humira and (Table 23). Most 
occurring TEAEs (SOC) in the respective two treatment groups were: infections and infestations (39% 
and 29%), general disorders and administration site conditions (14% and 13%), musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (7% and 8%), investigations (9% and 9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (6% and 16%). There were no PT terms for infections clearly dominating the difference between 
‘switchers’ and the patients continuing EU-Humira. A part of the higher occurrence of AEs in the SOC ‘skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ for continuous EU-Humira is explained by a higher frequency of AEs 
concerning psoriasis and pruritis in that patient group.

Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest were pre-defined as: serious infections and latent or active tuberculosis 
infections. In addition, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, and injection site reactions were 
analysed. 
In the Overall Treatment Period, 12 AESIs were reported in the continuous MSB11022 group (n=221) 
and 6 AESIs in the continuous EU-Humira group (n=119). In the continuous MSB11022 group these 
were: chronic cholecystitis, respiratory tract infection (both had occurred in the Core Treatment Period), 
chronic cholecystitis, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, 5 cases of latent tuberculosis, positive tuberculosis test, 
viral respiratory tract infection. In the continuous EU-Humira group these were: bacterial arthritis, 2 
cases of positive tuberculosis test, (all had occurred in the Core Treatment Period), a case of false-positive 
tuberculosis test. In the continuous MSB11022 group there were 10 (4.5%) patients and in the 
continuous EU-Humira 4 (3.4%) patients with a hypersensitivity reaction. There was one case with 
anaphylactic shock, that was attributed to bee sting, which occurred in the EU-Humira group. The 
occurrence of injection site reactions was similar in the groups continuing MSB11022 and continuing 
EU-Humira (Table 20, below). 
In the Extended Treatment Period, 5 patients in the group who had switched to MSB11022 had an 
AESI: 2 cases of latent tuberculosis, lip infection, pneumonia, allergic dermatitis. One patient in the 
‘switch’ group to MSB11022 and 2 patients in the continuous EU-Humira group had a hypersensitivity 
reaction; anaphylactic shock did not occur. The occurrence and pattern of injection site reactions was 
similar in the groups switching to MSB11022 (13%) and continuing EU-Humira (11%).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the 54-week period of study EMR200588-002 one death was reported. After the week 24 visit, one 
patient in the continued EU-Humira group had died after a traumatic event with cerebral hematoma, brain 
edema, and subsequent cardiac failure. These events were considered not to be related to the study 
medication. 
In the Core Treatment Period, 8 SAEs occurred in the MSB11022 group and 6 SAEs occurred in the 
EU-Humira group (Table 18), all SAEs occurred in single patients. In the MSB11022 group, 2 SAEs were 
rated as related to study medication: respiratory tract infection viral and erythema multiforme. In the 
EU-Humira group, 4 SAEs were rated as treatment-related: intraductal proliferative breast lesion, 
bacterial arthritis, increased hepatic enzyme, and increased liver function test. 
In the Overall Treatment Period, 9% in the continuous MSB11022 group and 7% of patients in the 
continuous EU-Humira group had SAEs. Most SAEs occurred in single patients (Table 53). In the MSB1102 
group, 1 subject had 3 cardiac SAEs.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 65/89  
 
  
 
 
  
  
In the Extended Treatment Period (week 16 – week 54), 4 (4%) patients in the group who ‘switched’ 
to MSB11022 had 4 SAEs (myocardial infarction, conjunctival cyst, appendicitis, staphylococcal abcess).  
(The case with anaphylactic shock, attributed to bee sting, in Table 53 had occurred in the core treatment 
period while on EU-Humira.) Over the same period, 12 (5.6%) patients from the group who continued 
MSB11022 had SAEs. 
Immunogenicity 
In the Core Treatment Period, the proportions of patients positive for anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
increased similarly in both groups and overall amounted to 88% in both treatment groups (Figure 18). 
The proportion of patients positive for neutralising antibody (nAb) as proportion of patients positive for 
ADA) increased in both groups to around 46%. The ADA titers over the course of the Core Treatment 
Period were similar for the MSB11022 and EU-Humira groups (Figure 11).  
In the Extended Treatment Period the proportions of ADA and nAb positive patients up to week 54 
were similarly high for the continued MSB11022 and the continued EU-Humira group, as well as the group 
that had switched from EU-Humira to MSB11022  (Figure 18). There were no apparent differences in ADA 
titres between the groups who continued MSB11022, continued EU-Hunira, or ‘switched’ from Eu-Humira 
to MSB11022 (not shown). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 66/89  
 
 
 
  
  
The influence of ADA positivity on the clinical response (PASI75) was similar for MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira. 
In the Core Treatment Period and the Overall Treatment Period, injection site reactions in patients who 
were ADA positive occurred similarly in continuous MSB11022 (16%) and the continuous EU-Humira 
groups (19%). The proportions of ADA- were too low for meaningful comparisons.  
Laboratory findings 
There were overall no clinical meaningful differences between treatment groups in mean or median 
hematology values (except a small difference in eosinophilea), biochemistry values (including liver 
function tests), or urine analysis, across treatment groups in the Core Treatment Period, Overall 
Treatment Period or Extended Treatment Period.

Discontinuation due to AEs 
In the 16 weeks of the Core Treatment Period, one patient in the MSB11022 group discontinued the 
treatment due to a TEAE, while 12 patients in the EU-Humira discontinued treatment (Table 11). These 
TEAEs were erythema multiforme in the MSB11022 group, and in the EU-Humira group these were: 
neutropenia, atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, hepatic steiatosis, bacterial arthritis, arthropod bite, hepatic 
ezyme increased, liver function test increased, positive tuberculosis test, intraductal proliferatuive breast 
lesion, uterine leiomyoma, pregnancy (2 patients), allergic dermatitis.  
In the Extended Treatment Period, 9 patients on continuous MSB11022 (hepatic steatosis, latent 
tuberculosis (3 subjects), tuberculosis, pregnancy, acute kidney injury, hypersensitivity vasculitis, 
psoriasis), 6 patients on EU-Humira (cardiac failure, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, mitral valve 
incompetence, liver function test increased, brain edema, cerebral hematoma, pregnancy, psoriasis, 
pustular psoriasis) and 3 patients who had switched to MSB11022 (latent tuberculosis, anti-double 
stranded DNA positive, pregnancy) had discontinued the treatment due to one or more TEAEs.  
Four-month safety follow-up data 
The 4-month safety follow-up data that were provided as amendment did not change the picture and 
pattern as was derived by the evaluation of the week 54 data. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development program consisted of two studies: a single dose PK study of 70 days in healthy 
volunteers (EMR200588-001) comparing MSB110022 with EU-Humira and US-Humira and a 52-week 
equivalence trial with safety follow-up to week 66, in adult patients with moderate-severe plaque 
psoriasis (EMR200588-002) comparing MSB11022 with EU-Humira. The main clinical study in plaque 
psoriasis is meanwhile completed and safety and immunogenicity data up to week 54 and an addendum 
concerning the week 66 safety follow-up data were submitted. In case of chronic administration, one-year 
follow up data is normally required pre-authorisation for evaluation of immunogenicity as mentioned in 
the relevant guideline [EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1].  
In the 16-week Core Treatment Period, n=222 patients were treated with MSB11022 and n=221 were 
treated with EU-Humira, nearly all patients remained in the Safety Analysis Set of the Core Treatment 
Period and of the Extended Treatment Period from week 16 up to and including week 54. 
Overall, the occurrence of TEAEs appears to be similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira.  
In the Core Treatment Period of study EMR200588-002 (baseline – week 16), about half of the patients 
had at least 1 TEAE, similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira. The majority of TEAEs were of mild or 
moderate severity. The most common AEs (≥2%) by organ class for MSB11022 and EU-Humira were: 
infections and infestations (19% and 21%), general disorders and administration site conditions (15% 
and 16%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (8% and 6%). The most common AEs (≥2%) by preferred 
term were: nasopharyngitis, injection site erythema and injection site pain, headache. This was similar 
for both treatment groups and the pattern is in line with the Humira SmPC. Some of the less common AEs 
(hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia) occurred in more cases with MSB11022 than with EU-Humira. 
‘Lipids increased’ and ‘hypertension’ are listed as a very common AE in the Humira SmPC, and therefore 
this does not lead to further concern by the CHMP. 
In the Core Treatment Period there also were notable differences in the occurrence of neoplasms (more 
in EU-Humira) and blood/lymphatic system disorders (more in MSB11022). While the frequency of 
occurrence is low and the number of organ classes/preferred terms is relatively high, these may well be 
chance findings. Moreover, as the time from baseline to occurrence is relatively short for development of 
malignancies, a causal relation of malignancies with study treatment is not very likely. Serious AEs 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 68/89  
 
 
  
  
occurred in eight patients in the MSB11022 group and in six patients in the EU-Humira group. More 
patients on EU-Humira group than on MSB11022 discontinued the treatment and/or the study due to 
TEAEs, most had done so at or before week 16. There was no clear pattern and it is likely that the 
numerical difference is a chance finding, therefore no concern was raised by the CHMP. 
The results of the Overall Treatment Period (baseline – week 54) of patients continuing MSB11022 or 
EU-Humira were largely similar to the Core Treatment Period. As may be expected, the incidence of AEs 
increased with longer exposition. Due to the re-randomization at week 16, the treatment group 
continuing MSB1102 was about twice as large (n=221) as the continuous EU-Humira group (n=119). The 
overall occurrence of TEAEs was similar for continuous MSB11022 (78%) and continuous EU-Humira 
(77%). Serious AEs occurred in 20 (9%) patients in the continuous MSB11022 group and in 8 (7%) 
patients in the continuous EU-Humira group. There was no clear pattern, usually SAEs occurred in single 
patients, and few of them can be considered drug related.  
The largest differences between continuous MSB11022 and continuous EU-Humira occurred in the SOCs: 
infections and infestations (51% and 38%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (15% and 
10%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (13% and 4%), blood and lymphatic disorders (5% and 1.7%). 
Regarding infections, it seems that the difference is explained by a ‘generally’ raised occurrence in the 
MSB11022 group, rather than raised occurrence of some specific kinds of infection. The dissimilarity in 
occurrence of infections is valued as most likely attributable by chance: there are no apparent 
dissimilarities in non-clinical functional tests, PK or PD that would explain this difference in occurrence of 
infections. Commonness of infections in the source population and the large number of AEs evaluated 
may increase the likelihood of chance findings.  
Neoplasms occurred dissimilar in the Core Treatment period: neoplasms (benign, malignant and 
unspecified) occurred in 1 (0.5%) and 7 (3%) of patients in the MSB11022 and the EU-Humira group. Due 
to low numbers and short exposure to EU-Humira or MSB11022, this likely was a chance finding. In the 
Overall Treatment Period, two additional events occurred: one in the switch group and one in the 
MSB11022 group. This does not lead to further concerns about dissimilarity on safety. 
There also are dissimilarities between the two groups continuing on MSB11022 or EU-Humira for: 
hypertriglyceridaemia/’blood triglycerides increased’ and hypertension.  However, the dissimilarities 
regarding hypertriglyceridaemia/blood triglycerides increased/hypertension are valued as chance 
findings, given commonness in the source population and the large number of AEs evaluated. The planned 
measurements of serum triglycerides and of blood pressure did not give rise for concerns.  
The results on immunogenicity do not show differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira. The 
proportions of patients with ADA increased similarly in both groups and amounted to ~90% in the 
MSB11022 group and the EU-Humira group already within 16 weeks. Towards 54 weeks, the occurrence 
of ADA positivity increased slightly to ~95% in all three treatment groups, while 56%-66% were nAB 
positive. ADA positivity lead to a slightly reduced efficacy (PASI75 response) and did not appear to 
influence safety events, similarly in patients treated with MSB11022 or with EU-Humira. 
Already after 16 weeks, nearly all patients had developed ADA and this is much more than in previous 
studies. Reassuringly, the ADA titers over the course of the Core Treatment Period and Overall Treatment 
Period/extended Treatment Period were comparable for the MSB11022 and EU-Humira groups, and the 
group of patients switching to MSB11022.  
In the patients who switched from EU-Humira to MSB11022, the occurrence of AEs by Organ Class and by 
Preferred Term was generally similar as compared to the other two treatment groups (EU-Humira and 
MSB11022). Similar as in patients on continuous MSB11022, in patients who switched to MSB11022, the 
occurrence of infections and infestations was raised by 10% as compared to patients continuing 
EU-Humira. Again, there were no PT terms for infections clearly dominating the difference between 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 69/89  
 
 
 
  
  
‘switchers’ and the patients continuing EU-Humira. Consequently, switching from EU-Humira to 
MSB11022 does not lead to a safety signal in the commonest TEAEs. Switching from EU-Humira to 
MSB11022 did not lead to a further increase in ADA positivity. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile and immunogenicity of MSB11022 and EU-Humira appear to be similar.  
Overall, the occurrence of AEs was similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira, and both MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira appeared to be safe over 54 weeks of the study. Numerical differences in the occurrence of 
infections and in metabolism disorders, that were higher in MSB11022, are valued as chance findings. 
There were no other major differences in occurrence and pattern of TEAEs, AESIs, SAEs, immunogenicity 
and other laboratory findings. It did not appear that switching from EU-Humira to MSB11022 lead to a 
safety signal. 
The percentage of subjects with ADA-positive samples was very high (near 90%) after a relatively short 
treatment period, thus providing little ‘assay sensitivity’ in this study population to detect difference in 
immunogenicity, if present. However, given the similarity of ADA titers over time similarity of 
immunogenicity is not doubted. 
The responses to questions related to safety do currently not impact the safety specification in the Risk 
Management Plan.

2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
MSB11022 was developed as a biosimilar product of adalimumab, with Humira for subcutaneous use as 
the reference product. Dosage, route of administration and indications are proposed to be identical to 
Humira.  
The proposed indications are: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Axial spondyloarthritis, 
Psoriatic arthritis, Psoriasis, Paediatric plaque psoriasis, Hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, 
Paediatric Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis, Paediatric uveitis. 
Three pharmaceutical forms are proposed, which are similar to three of the pharmaceutical forms of 
Humira containing a 40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection: a vial (for paediatric use), a pre-filled syringe 
and a pre-filled pen (all of a volume of 0.8 mL). 
For the paediatric formulation (40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection), only the paediatric indications are 
proposed.  
Summary of analytical comparability (quality data)  
The Applicant has performed an extensive comparability analysis to demonstrate biosimilarity to the 
reference product (Humira). The approach chosen is in line with current guidance and a scientific advice 
received by EMA-CHMP on 24 September 2015 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/593876/2015).  
Batches from the EU; US and rest of the world (RoW) markets; with various expiry dates were used in the 
analysis. Individual (raw) batch data from each batch are provided and traceability is ensured. Several 
batches of the biosimilar, manufactured using different active substance batches were included in the 
analysis, representing independent data points. The presented analysis falls into two broad categories; a 
comparison of all the finished product batches to the QTPP of the originator (with separate QTPP analyses 
for EU batches and aggregated EU/US/RoW batches); and three specific side-by-side analytical exercises, 
performed at separate points in time during different stages of development. Where a quantitative 
analysis was possible, Min-Max ranges for the finished product were established and compared to 
Mean+3SD intervals calculated for the originator; age at the time of testing is appropriately taken into 
account; the data are presented both in tabular and graphical format. 
Descriptions of analytical methods and summary qualification data have been provided and considered 
acceptable.

Summary of clinical equivalence data  
•  PK study (EMR200588-001): a single-dose (40 mg sc) randomised double-blind three-arm parallel PK 
trial in healthy volunteers comparing MSB11022, EU-sourced Humira and US-approved Humira (79 
subjects per arm); supportive PK data in patients with psoriasis in the clinical efficacy and safety 
study. 
•  Efficacy and safety study (EMR200588-002): a 54-week randomised double-blind equivalence study 
comparing MSB11022 and EU-Humira (80 mg loading dose followed by 40 mg sc every 2 weeks) in 
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy (~220 patients 
per arm). The primary outcome was PASI75 at Week 16 (core period), with a non-inferiority margin of 
+/- 18%. Main secondary outcome was percentage change in PASI score from baseline to week 16 
(non-inferiority margin of 15%). Patients on EU-Humira in the core period were re-randomised at 
week 16 to continuation or switching to MSB11022. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality and in vitro pharmacology data 
High similarity between MSB11022 and originator can be considered demonstrated with regard to the 
following attributes: 
- 
Primary structure  
-  Higher order structure 
-  Dimers, aggregates and fragments  
-  Oxidation and related microheterogeneity 
-  Glycosylation, with the exception of total afucosylation/mannosylation/galactosylation; it is noted 
that sialylation is different but the levels are so low that this is not considered relevant 
- 
- 
TNF-alfa binding (both soluble and membrane bound)

ADCC activity (whole blood assay using healthy and patient blood, ADCC FcγRIIIa reporter) 
except NK-enriched PBMC ADCC assay using healthy and patient blood. 
Non-clinical data 
Comparable efficacy in binding of sTNFα by both products was also shown in functional assays including 
a reporter gene assay coupled to the TNF receptor (used as potency assay), measurement of apoptosis 
(caspase 3/7 activity) and release of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) and of ICAM. 
Following tmTNFα-binding on Jurkat:tmTNF cells comparable levels of apoptosis was observed. 
In a mixed lymphocyte reaction, proliferation of T-cells was inhibited and induction of regulatory 
macrophages stimulated at a comparable level. 
Both compounds have a dose-related effect on body weight, arthritic score and histopathological score in 
the Tg197 mouse model. 
No differences in toxicokinetics, safety and immunogenicity (ADA) were apparent in the cynomolgus 
monkey study. 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
Similar pharmacokinetics has been shown between MSB11022 and the EU reference products in the 
pivotal PK study using healthy volunteers. 
Adalimumab Ctrough values in psoriasis patients the core period (0-16 weeks) were similar between 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira. 
Efficacy 
Both the primary and main secondary outcomes support equivalence of MSB11022 with EU-Humira in 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The mean percent change in PASI from baseline to 
week 16 in the PP set was similar in size for both treatment groups: -91% in the MSB11022 group and 
-92% in the EU-Humira group. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was 
within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 15% and included 0 (no difference), in PP and in ITT 
sets. The primary outcome PASI75 response at week 16 in the PP set was of similar size in both treatment 
groups: 90% in the MSB1102 group and 92% in the EU-Humira group. The 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval of the treatment difference was within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 18% and 
included 0, in PP and in ITT sets.  
Importantly, these findings are supported by the (more sensitive) mean PASI scores over all intermediate 
visits of the 16 week Core Treatment Period, that were similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira, without a 
tendency for MSB11022 to be worse. Together with the consistent results of the subgroup analyses, other 
secondary outcomes, 52 week data and switching data, this supports that MSB11022 and EU-Humira 
have equivalent efficacy in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
Safety 
Overall, the occurrence of AEs appears to be similar for MSB11022 and EU-Humira. Both MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira appeared to be reasonably well tolerated, without major differences in occurrence and pattern 
of TEAEs, AESIs, SAEs, and laboratory findings. The exception is that infections, triglyceridaemia and 
hypertension appeared to occur more frequently in patients on ongoing MSB11022 and switching to

MSB11022, as compared to patients continuing EU-Humira, which however is likely attributable to 
chance. Switching from EU-Humira to MSB11022 did not lead to a safety signal. 
Immunogenicity 
The results on immunogenicity did not show differences between MSB11022 and EU-Humira. The 
proportions of patients with anti-drug antibody (ADA) increased similarly in both groups to ~90% in the 
MSB11022 group and the EU-Humira group. Overall, ~50% of ADA positive patients were positive for 
nAb, in both groups. The ADA titers over the course of the Core Treatment Period were similar for the 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira groups. Switching from EU-Humira to MSB11022 did not appear to lead to a 
further increase in ADA positivity. As may be expected, ADA positivity leads to a slightly reduced efficacy 
(PASI75 response). Most patients with injection site reactions were ADA positive, similarly in patients 
treated with MSB11022 or with EU-Humira and the overall study population. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality and in vitro pharmacology data 
Uncertainties and limitations were identified for the following quality attributes and in vitro properties and 
subsequently addressed during the review with supporting clinical and non-clinical data:  
-  Galactosylation (ranges for biosimilar and originator overlap, but not all values of the biosimilar 
are within range of the originator): no impact on the related parameters C1q-binding and CDC 
was observed 
A lower total afucosylation was noted for MSB11022 . This was mainly due to lower levels of high 
mannose variants (MSB11022: 1.9-2.5%; Humira-EU: 5.3-12.0%). 
The KD-ranges (as determined by SPR) for FcγRIIIa F158 binding overlap but are not ‘within 
range’: For MSB11022 a range of 6.2-10.1 nM was found; Humira-EU: min-max 3.8-8.0 nM. 
The Applicant presented data from several ADCC-type assays. For the most sensitive format, 
ADCC of MSB11022 is lower than for Humira: NK-PBMC ADCC assay using %EC50 as read-out.  
- 
- 
o  Similar to results as found with the healthy donors, data with blood cells from UC, CD, 
PsO or RA patients show similar responses, meaning similarity with Humira in the whole 
blood ADCC assay and lower (RA, PsO, healthy) or lower but overlapping (CD, UC) in the 
NK-PBMC ADCC assay.  
-  High CVs (low sensitivity) are seen with the SPR method investigating Fc-receptor binding. 
- 
Taken together, the differences seen in the FcγRIIIa F158 by SPR and NK-PBMC ADCC assay, 
although internally consistent, are likely either due to analytical variability (low sensitivity of 
SPR), or clinically irrelevant (see results of other ADCC assays), or both.  
- 
The MLR assay, potentially reflecting an important mechanism for adalimumabs efficacy in IBD, is 
only a semi-quantitative method, limiting its applicability for establishing biosimilarity. 
Non-clinical data 
The mouse Tg197/TNBS colitis model showed a lack of sensitivity. Body weight change and TNFα release 
in colon thick organ cultures were affected by both compounds, but without a dose-response relationship. 
This study does not contribute to the establishment of biosimilarity 
Due to the low number of animals and inter-animal variability in response, the cynomolgus monkey study 
lacks sensitivity to detect relevant differences. The available quality and in vitro data did not indicate a 
CHMP assessment report

need to perform a study in this species. Consequently, this study does not provide decisive information 
and should not have been performed.

Immunogenicity 
Already after 16 weeks, nearly more than 80% of the patients had developed ADA and this is higher than 
in previous studies. This may be caused by the sensitive bio-analytical assay but also disease related. 
Incidence of ADA is lower in patients with RA compared to patients with psoriasis. Given the high rates of 
subjects with ADA-positive serum samples, the incidence of ADA positivity may not be sensitive enough 
to detect possible differences in immunogenicity, but given the similarity of ADA titers over time similarity 
of immunogenicity is not doubted.   
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
The data on quality attributes demonstrate a high level of similarity.  
For the following quality parameters, the Applicant sufficiently argued that uncertainties and limitations 
could be considered as minor and/or not clinically relevant. 
With regard to galactosylation: ranges for biosimilar and originator overlap, but not all values of the 
biosimilar are within range of the originator; however, no impact on the related parameters C1q-binding 
and CDC was observed. 
A more complex issue is the lower level of high mannosylated afucosylated glycans. This seems to be 
correlated to the potentially slightly higher KD for FcγRIIIa receptor (F158 low affinity variant) and lower 
activity in ADCC assays when more sensitive assay formats, like the NK-PBMC assay (%EC50), are used. 
The Applicant argues that these assays with higher sensitivity are artificial constructs not representing 
the physiological conditions in a patient. The Applicant showed that addition of serum or IgG to these 
assays diminishes the observed differences in the ADCC assays or even abolishes ADCC activity all 
together. The Applicant also claims that one assay, utilising NK effector cells and LPS activated primary 
monocytes, expressing physiological levels of tmTNF, could not detect any ADCC activity in the presence 
of adalimumab (both products). According to the Applicant this assay is a more physiological 
representative assay. In the literature, it is argued that a functional Fc part of an anti-TNF pharmaceutical 
is essential for efficacy in IBD. One mode of action proposed for anti-TNF mAbs (adalimumab and 
infliximab) in IBD is ADCC, involving binding to both tmTNFα and FcγRIIIa receptor. Binding to tmTNF was 
shown to be similar, as was binding to FcγRIIIa V158 (high affinity) receptor and, in addition, similar 
ADCC activity was shown in the whole blood ADCC assay using blood from healthy and patient (RA, PsO, 
CD, UC) donors and in the FcγRIIIa reporter ADCC assay.  Finally, the clinical relevance of the differences 
seen in the NK-PBMC ADCC assay per se is questioned as the addition of serum or IgG up to clinical levels, 
dose-dependently diminishes or even completely abolishes the ADCC response by MSB11022 as well as 
by RMP/RP.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 85/89  
 
 
  
  
Another mode of action proposed for adalimumab efficacy in IBD is inhibition of proliferation of activated 
T-cells, involving regulatory macrophages (Vos et al, 2011). In this mode of action, also both tmTNFα (on 
the activated T-cell) and Fc receptors (on the regulatory macrophage) are involved. To evaluate the 
activity of both products with respect to this mode of action, the Applicant performed a Mixed Lymphocyte 
Assay (MLR) and generated semi-quantifiable, but comparable results on inhibition of T-cell proliferation 
and also on induction of regulatory macrophages, which lends support to comparable activity of 
MSB11022 and Humira in IBD indications.  
Binding to tmTNFα (using flow cytometry) and a functional effect of this binding (apoptosis in 
Jurkat:tmTNF cells) was shown to be comparable. This leaves differences in binding to FcγRIIIa F158 
receptor as the most plausible explanation for differences observed in the more sensitive ADCC assays. 
Differences in binding to FcγRIIIa receptor may be explained by the differences observed in afucosylated 
glycans.  
The clinical significance of observed differences in ADCC were further addressed with additional data and 
scientific discussion. In addition, no meaningful differences in another tm-TNF dependent mechanism, i.e. 
induction of regulatory macrophages in addition to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation were found 
suggesting a similar activity. This is especially important for the extrapolation to inflammatory bowel 
disease (see section 5.5 on extrapolation). 
Similarity in the pharmacokinetic study using healthy volunteers has been demonstrated between 
MSB11022 and the two Humira reference products as the primary parameters AUC0-∞ AUC0-t and Cmax, 
the 90% CI for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00% when comparing MSB11022 to the reference product from EU as well as from US, and 
also when comparing the US versus the EU reference products. Further support for similarity between 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira was obtained in the study in psoriasis patients (study EMR200588-002). The 
Ctrough concentrations of MSB11022 and EU-Humira appear  comparable, with exposure of EU-Humira 
slightly higher than MSB11022.  
Although the 90% CI for the ratio of MSB11022 and EU-Humira fell within the acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00%, the upper limit of 90%CI for AUCinf  excludes 1;  80.14 – 99.10. This statistical difference 
in AUCinf might indicate a difference in clearance. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for protein content 
and ADA status. When corrected for protein content, similarity was demonstrated for AUCinf, AUCt, and 
Cmax with 90% CI within 80-125% similarity margin including unity for all parameters. The 
pharmacokinetics in ADA-negative subjects are of particular interest as this allows direct evaluation of 
elimination of the substances without interference of ADAs. The results for ADA negative subjects were 
similar between MSB11022 and Humira supporting the conclusion for biosimilarity between MSB11022 
and Humira based on the overall study population. The elimination of adalimumab seemed somewhat 
faster for MSB11022 than for Humira in the ADA positive subjects but sensitivity analysis of elimination 
half-life by consideration of the time at which subjects became ADA positive indicated that there was no 
consistent pattern that elimination half-life of adalimumab was shorter for MSB11022 than for Humira. In 
addition, in psoriasis patients, the adalimumab concentrations of MSB11022 were comparable or slightly 
higher at all time points compared to EU-Humira.  Overall, the PK results for ADA negative subjects and 
the Ctrough values in patients with psoriasis support the conclusion for biosimilarity between MSB11022 
and Humira. 
The results of the main clinical study show that MSB11022 and EU-Humira have equivalent efficacy, in a 
sensitive (psoriasis) model in an adequately powered study. After 16 and after 54 weeks, MSB11022 and 
EU-Humira are considered equivalent in immunogenicity and safety.  The higher occurrence of infections, 
triglyceridaemia and hypertension in the groups of patients continuing or switching to MSB11022 as 
compared to EU-Humira are likely due to chance.  There is an uncertainty considering the height of 
PASI75 response in relation to the size of the equivalence margins, which however is mitigated by 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/124342/2019 
Page 86/89  
 
 
 
  
  
similarity of the ‘parent’ continuous PASI scores. The continuous PASI scores were highly similar between 
MSB11022 and EU-Humira over all time points, making relevant dissimilarity unlikely. Further, similarity 
was also supported by other outcomes, notably PGA and BSA. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
MSB11022 is proposed for the same indications as for Humira, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, Axial spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Psoriasis, Paediatric plaque psoriasis, 
Hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, Paediatric Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis and 
Paediatric uveitis.  
PK similarity of MSB11022 with EU-Humira was established. It is agreed with the Applicant that it is 
justified to extrapolate PK profiles of adalimumab across all target populations and conditions of use, 
including dose escalation and use with or without background immunomodulatory therapy. 
The clinical efficacy of MSB11022 was shown to be similar to EU-Humira in the Psoriasis model, which is 
a sensitive model to study equivalence. Similarity of MSB11022 and EU-Humira is demonstrated in both 
main outcomes, all sensitivity analyses, all secondary outcomes, and between-group differences are 
consistently small over study time. Also, the occurrence and pattern of adverse events and of 
immunogenicity was generally similar between MSB11022 and EU-Humira and no new safety signals 
appeared.  
It is considered that extrapolation of clinical equivalence from psoriasis to those disorders where the 
effect of adalimumab is primarily attained through binding of soluble TNF (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, axial 
spondyloarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis) can be agreed, because therapeutic equivalence is supported by 
the pre-clinical evidence related to membrane-bound TNF-associated modes of action.  
It is also considered that therapeutic equivalence can be extrapolated from psoriasis to inflammatory 
bowel disease, because therapeutic equivalence is considered supported by the pre-clinical evidence 
related to membrane-bound TNF-associated modes of action. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
None. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance

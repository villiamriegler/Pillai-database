Summary of risk management plan for MOZOBIL (Plerixafor) 
This is a summary of the RMP for MOZOBIL. The RMP details important risks of MOZOBIL 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about MOZOBIL’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
MOZOBIL's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how MOZOBIL should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for MOZOBIL should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
MOZOBIL’s RMP. 
1.1. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
MOZOBIL is authorized in combination with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to 
enhance mobilisation of hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and 
subsequent autologous transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
whose cells mobilise poorly. The proposed indication for MOZOBIL is as follows:  
Adult patients 
MOZOBIL is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of hematopoietic 
stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in adult 
patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly.  
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years)  
MOZOBIL is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of hematopoietic 
stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in 
children with lymphoma or solid malignant tumours and either:  
•  pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after 
adequate  mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be 
insufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield or  
•  who previously failed to collect sufficient hematopoietic stem cells. (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  
It contains plerixafor as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection

1.2.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of MOZOBIL, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about MOZOBIL's risks, are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of MOZOBIL is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
1.2.1.  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of MOZOBIL are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of MOZOBIL. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

In the general population, risk of anxiety is higher in younger people, women, and 
people from lower socioeconomic groups. Among cancer patients, demographic 
differences are less relevant, although association with sex remains in multivariate 
analyses.a In addition, patients with newly diagnosed cancer are at higher risk for 
anxiety, as are those with functional deficits.a Sleep disturbances in patients 
undergoing HSCT have been associated with physical functioning, fatigue, and 
treatment-specific distress.b 
Cancer patients receiving certain treatments (eg, opioids for pain management) 
may be at higher risk for hallucinations and nightmares.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Plaque psoriasis 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Bimzelx, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have 
responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Bimzelx is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Bimzelx is indicated. 
Posology 
Plaque psoriasis 
The recommended dose for adult patients with plaque psoriasis is 320 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous 
injections of 160 mg each) at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter.  
Psoriatic arthritis 
The recommended dose for adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis is 160 mg (given as 1 
subcutaneous injection of 160 mg) every 4 weeks.  
For psoriatic arthritis patients with coexistent moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended 
dose is the same as for plaque psoriasis [320 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 160 mg each) 
at Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter]. After 16 weeks, regular assessment of efficacy 
is recommended and if a sufficient clinical response in joints cannot be maintained, a switch to 160 mg 
every 4 weeks can be considered. 
Axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS) 
The recommended dose for adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis is 160 mg (given as 1 
subcutaneous injection) every 4 weeks. 
For above indications, consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have 
shown no improvement by 16 weeks of treatment. 
Special populations 
Overweight patients with plaque psoriasis 
For some patients with plaque psoriasis (including psoriatic arthritis with coexistent moderate to 
severe psoriasis) and a body weight ≥ 120 kg who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, 
320 mg every 4 weeks after week 16 may further improve treatment response (see section 5.1). 
Elderly (≥65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal or hepatic impairment  
Bimekizumab has not been studied in these patient populations. Dose adjustments are not considered 
necessary based on pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have 
not been established. No data are available.

Method of administration 
This medicinal product is administered by subcutaneous injection.  
Suitable areas for injection include thigh, abdomen and upper arm. Injection sites should be rotated 
and injections should not be given into psoriasis plaques or areas where the skin is tender, bruised, 
erythematous, or indurated.  
The pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen must not be shaken. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Bimzelx with the 
pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical 
follow-up as necessary. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of Bimzelx according to 
the instructions for use provided in the package leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections such as upper respiratory tract infections and oral 
candidiasis (see section 4.8). 
Caution should be exercised when considering the use of bimekizumab in patients with a chronic 
infection or a history of recurrent infection. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in 
patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately 
treated (see section 4.3). 
Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms 
suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection, the patient should be carefully 
monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy, treatment should 
be discontinued until the infection resolves. 
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) 
Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab, patients should be evaluated for TB infection. 
Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB (see section 4.3). Patients receiving 
bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be 
considered prior to initiating bimekizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in 
whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. 
Inflammatory bowel disease 
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab 
(see section 4.8). Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a 
patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of 
pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate 
medical management should be initiated.

Hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 
inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of bimekizumab should be 
discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Vaccinations 
Prior to initiating therapy with bimekizumab, completion of all age appropriate immunizations 
according to current immunization guidelines should be considered. 
Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab. 
Patients treated with bimekizumab may receive inactivated or non-live vaccinations. Healthy 
individuals who received a single 320 mg dose of bimekizumab two weeks prior to vaccination with 
an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine had similar antibody responses compared to individuals who 
did not receive bimekizumab prior to vaccination.  
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
There is no direct evidence for the role of IL-17A or IL-17F in the expression of CYP450 enzymes. 
The formation of some CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during 
chronic inflammation. Thus, anti-inflammatory treatments, such as with the IL-17A and IL-17F 
inhibitor bimekizumab, may result in normalisation of CYP450 levels with accompanying lower 
exposure of CYP450-metabolised medicinal products. Therefore, a clinically relevant effect on 
CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, in which the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. 
warfarin) cannot be excluded. On initiation of bimekizumab therapy in patients being treated with 
these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring should be considered. 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) data analyses indicated that the clearance of bimekizumab was not 
impacted by concomitant administration of conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(cDMARDs) including methotrexate, or by prior exposure to biologics. 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with bimekizumab (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 17 weeks after treatment.  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data on the use of bimekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Bimzelx during pregnancy. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether bimekizumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot 
be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from Bimzelx therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
The effect of bimekizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Bimzelx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of 4821 patients have been treated with bimekizumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies 
in plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS) representing 
8733.0 patient-years of exposure. Of these, over 3900 patients were exposed to bimekizumab for at 
least one year. Overall, the safety profile of bimekizumab is consistent across all indications. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%, 14.6%, 
16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axSpA respectively) and oral candidiasis 
(7.3%, 2.3%, 3.7% in PSO, PsA and axSpA respectively).

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled period of Phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis, infections were 
reported in 36.0% of patients treated with bimekizumab for up to 16 weeks compared with 22.5% of 
patients treated with placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with 
bimekizumab and 0% treated with placebo.  
The majority of infections consisted of non-serious mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections 
such as nasopharyngitis. There were higher rates of oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients 
treated with bimekizumab consistent with the mechanism of action (7.3% and 1.2% respectively 
compared to 0% for placebo-treated patients). More than 98% of cases were non-serious, mild or 
moderate in severity, and did not require treatment discontinuation. A slightly higher incidence of oral 
candidiasis was reported in patients <70 kg (8.5% versus 7.0% in patients ≥70 kg). 
Over the entire treatment period of Phase III studies in plaque psoriasis, infections were reported in 
63.2% of patients treated with bimekizumab (120.4 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were 
reported in 1.5% of patients treated with bimekizumab (1.6 per 100 patient-years) (see section 4.4). 
Infection rates observed in PsA and axSpA (nr-axSpA and AS) Phase III clinical studies were similar 
to those observed in plaque psoriasis apart from oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis rates in patients 
treated with bimekizumab, which were lower at 2.3% and 0% respectively in PsA and 3.7% and 0.3% 
respectively in axSpA compared to 0% with placebo.

Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was observed with bimekizumab in phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis. Over the 
entire treatment period of Phase III studies, neutropenia grade 3/4 were observed in 1% of patients 
treated with bimekizumab.  
The frequency of neutropenia in PsA and axSpA (nr-axSpA and AS) clinical studies was similar to 
that observed in plaque psoriasis studies. 
Most cases were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. No serious infections were 
associated with neutropenia. 
Hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 
inhibitors. 
Immunogenicity 
Plaque psoriasis 
Approximately 45% of plaque psoriasis patients treated with bimekizumab up to 56 weeks at the 
recommended dosing regimen (320 mg every 4 weeks up to week 16 and 320 mg every 8 weeks 
thereafter) developed anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients who developed anti-drug antibodies, 
approximately 34% (16% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had antibodies that were classified 
as neutralising.  
Psoriatic arthritis 
Approximately 31% of patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with bimekizumab at the recommended 
dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) up to 16 weeks had anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients with 
anti-drug antibodies, about 33% (10% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had antibodies that 
were classified as neutralizing. By week 52, approximately 47% of biologic disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatment naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis in the BE OPTIMAL 
study treated with bimekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) had 
anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients with anti-drug antibodies, about 38% (18% of all patients in the 
BE OPTIMAL study treated with bimekizumab) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing.  
Axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS) 
Approximately 57% of patients with nr-axSpA treated with bimekizumab up to 52 weeks at the 
recommended dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) had anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients with 
anti-drug antibodies, approximately 44% (25% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had 
antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. 
Approximately 44% of patients with AS treated with bimekizumab up to 52 weeks at the 
recommended dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) had anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients with 
anti-drug antibodies, approximately 44% (20% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had 
antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. 
Across indications, no clinically meaningful impact on clinical response was associated with anti-
bimekizumab antibodies development and an association between immunogenicity and treatment 
emergent adverse events has not been clearly established. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
Exposure is limited in elderly subjects.

Elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis, 
dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.  
In the placebo-controlled period of Phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis, oral candidiasis was 
observed in 18.2% of patients ≥65 years versus 6.3% in <65 years, dermatitis and eczema in 7.3% of 
patients ≥65 years versus 2.8% in <65 years. 
In the placebo-controlled period of Phase III clinical studies in psoriatic arthritis, oral candidiasis was 
observed in 7.0% of patients ≥65 years versus 1.6% in <65 years, dermatitis and eczema in 1.2% of 
patients ≥65 years versus 2.0% in <65 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of 640 mg intravenously or 640 mg subcutaneously, followed by 320 mg subcutaneously 
every two weeks for five doses have been administered in clinical studies without dose-limiting 
toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs and 
symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC21 
Mechanism of action 
Bimekizumab is a humanised IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to 
IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC 
receptor complex. Elevated concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17F have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases including plaque psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. IL-17A and IL-17F cooperate and/or synergize with other 
inflammatory cytokines to induce inflammation. IL17-F is produced in significant amount by innate 
immune cells. This production can be independent of IL-23. Bimekizumab inhibits the 
proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in the normalization of skin inflammation and substantial 
decrease of local and systemic inflammation, and as a consequence improvement in clinical signs and 
symptoms associated with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. From in vitro 
models, bimekizumab was shown to inhibit psoriasis-related gene expression, cytokine production, the 
migration of inflammatory cells and pathological osteogenesis to a greater extent than inhibition of IL-
17A alone. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab was evaluated in 1,480 patients with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis in three Phase 3 multicenter, randomised, placebo and/or active comparator-
controlled studies. Patients were at least 18 years of age, had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI) score ≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by psoriasis (PSO) ≥10%, an Investigators 
Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 on a 5-point scale and were candidates for systemic psoriasis 
therapy and/or phototherapy. The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab were evaluated versus placebo 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and ustekinumab (BE VIVID – PS0009), versus placebo (BE READY – PS0013) and versus 
adalimumab (BE SURE - PS0008). 
The BE VIVID study evaluated 567 patients for 52 weeks where patients were randomised to receive 
either bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks, ustekinumab (45 mg or 90 mg, depending on patient 
weight, at baseline and week 4 and then every 12 weeks), or placebo for an initial 16 weeks, followed 
by bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks. 
The BE READY study evaluated 435 patients for 56 weeks. Patients were randomised to receive 
bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. At week 16, patients who achieved a PASI 90 
response entered the 40-week randomised withdrawal period. Patients initially randomised to 
bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks were re-randomised to either bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 
weeks or bimekizumab 320 mg every 8 weeks or placebo (i.e. withdrawal of bimekizumab). Patients 
initially randomised to placebo continued to receive placebo provided they were PASI 90 responders. 
Patients who did not achieve a PASI 90 response at week 16 entered an open-label escape arm and 
received bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients who relapsed (did not achieve 
PASI 75 response) during the randomised withdrawal period also entered the 12-week escape arm. 
The BE SURE study evaluated 478 patients for 56 weeks. Patients were randomised to receive either 
bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks through week 56, bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks through 
week 16 followed by bimekizumab 320 mg every 8 weeks through week 56 or adalimumab as per 
labeling recommendation through Week 24 followed by bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks through 
week 56. 
Baseline characteristics were consistent across all 3 studies: patients were predominantly male 
(70.7%) and white (84.1%), with a mean age of 45.2 years (18 to 83 years), and 8.9% were ≥65 years 
of age. The median baseline BSA was 20%, the median baseline PASI score was 18 and the baseline 
IGA score was severe in 33% of patients. The median baseline scores for Patient Symptoms Diary 
(PSD) pain, itch and scaling items ranged between 6 and 7 on a 0-10 points scale and the median 
baseline Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score was 9. 
Across all 3 studies, 38% of patients had received a prior biologic therapy; 23% had received at least 
one anti-IL17 agent (primary anti-IL17 failures were excluded) and 13% had received at least one 
TNF-antagonist. Twenty-two percent were naïve to any systemic therapy (including non-biologic and 
biologic) and 39% of patients had received prior phototherapy or photochemotherapy. 
The efficacy of bimekizumab was evaluated with respect to impact on skin disease overall, specific 
body locations (scalp, nails, palms and soles), patient reported symptoms and impact on quality of life. 
The two co-primary endpoints in all 3 studies were the proportion of patients who achieved 1) a PASI 
90 response and 2) an IGA “clear or almost clear” (IGA 0/1with at least two points improvement from 
baseline) response at week 16. PASI 100, IGA 0 response at week 16 and PASI 75 response at week 4 
were secondary endpoints in all 3 studies. 
Skin disease overall 
Treatment with bimekizumab resulted in significant improvement across efficacy endpoints compared 
to placebo, ustekinumab or adalimumab at week 16. The main efficacy results are shown in Table 2.

IGA 0/1 response was defined as Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-category improvement from Baseline at 
week 16. IGA 0 response was defined as Clear (0) with at least a 2-category improvement from Baseline at week 16. 
PSD is a Patient Symptoms Diary, also referred to as Psoriasis Symptoms and Impacts Measure (P-SIM), measuring psoriasis 
symptom severity on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (very severe symptoms). Response is defined as a decrease ≥4 from 
baseline to week 16 for pain, itch and scaling on a scale from 0 to 10.  
a) p<0.001 versus placebo (BE VIVID and BE READY), versus adalimumab (BE SURE), adjusted for multiplicity. 
b) p<0.001 versus ustekinumab (BE VIVID), adjusted for multiplicity. 
Bimekizumab was associated with a rapid onset of efficacy. In BE VIVID, at week 2 and week 4, 
PASI 90 response rates were significantly higher for bimekizumab-treated patients (12.1% and 43.6% 
respectively) compared to placebo (1.2% and 2.4% respectively) and ustekinumab (1.2% and 3.1% 
respectively).  
In the BE VIVID study, at week 52, bimekizumab-treated patients (every 4 weeks) achieved 
significantly higher response rates than the ustekinumab-treated patients on the endpoints of PASI 90 
(81.9% bimekizumab vs 55.8% ustekinumab, p<0.001), IGA 0/1 (78.2% bimekizumab vs 60.7% 
ustekinumab, p<0.001) and PASI 100 (64.5% bimekizumab vs 38.0% ustekinumab).

BKZ 320 mg Q4W=bimekizumab every 4 weeks; Uste=ustekinumab. NRI is used. 
In the BE SURE study at week 24, a significantly higher percentage of patients treated with 
bimekizumab (Q4W/Q4W and Q4W/Q8W combined dosing arms) achieved PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 
responses as compared with adalimumab (85.6% and 86.5% respectively vs 51.6% and 57.9% 
respectively, p<0.001). At week 56, 70.2% of patients treated with bimekizumab Q8W achieved a 
PASI 100 response. Among the 65 adalimumab non-responders at week 24 (< PASI 90), 78.5% 
achieved a PASI 90 response after 16 weeks of treatment with bimekizumab. The safety profile 
observed in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab without a wash-out period was 
similar to patients who initiated bimekizumab after wash out of prior systemic therapies.

The efficacy of bimekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, body 
weight, PASI baseline severity and previous treatment with a biologic. Bimekizumab was efficacious 
in prior biologic exposed patients, including anti-TNF / anti IL-17 and in systemic treatment-naïve 
patients. Efficacy in patients with primary failure to anti-IL17 has not been investigated. 
Based on population PK/ PD analysis and supported by clinical data, patients with higher body weight 
(≥120 kg) who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16 benefited from continued 
bimekizumab 320 mg every four weeks (Q4W) after the initial 16 weeks of treatment. In the BE 
SURE study, patients received bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W through week 16, followed by either Q4W 
or every eight weeks (Q8W) dosing through week 56, regardless of responder status at week 16. 
Patients in the ≥120 kg group (N=37) on the Q4W maintenance regimen showed greater improvement 
in PASI100 between week 16 (23.5%) and week 56 (70.6%) compared to those on the Q8W 
maintenance regimen (week 16: 45.0% vs week 56: 60.0%). 
Improvements were observed in psoriasis involving the scalp, nails, palms and soles in patients treated 
with bimekizumab at week 16 (see Table 3).

of patients treated with bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks achieved complete nail clearance 
(mNAPSI 100). In BE READY, at week 56, 67.7% and 69.8% of week 16 PASI 90 responders 
achieved complete nail clearance with bimekizumab 320 mg every 8 weeks and bimekizumab 320 mg

Durability of response (after bimekizumab discontinuation) 
Figure 3: PASI 90 responder rates over time for PASI 90 responders at week 16 – Randomized 
withdrawal period in BE READY 
NRI is used. 
At week 16, 105 study participants started the Randomized-Withdrawal Period in the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/placebo 
group, 100 in the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q8W group, and 106 in the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q4W group.  
In BE READY, for PASI 90 responders at week 16 who were re-randomised to placebo and 
withdrawn from bimekizumab, the median time to relapse, defined as loss of PASI 75, was 
approximately 28 weeks (32 weeks after the last bimekizumab dose). Among these patients, 88.1% 
regained a PASI 90 response within 12 weeks of restarting treatment with bimekizumab 320 mg every 
4 weeks. 
Health-related Quality of Life / Patient reported outcomes 
Across all 3 studies, a greater proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab experienced no impact 
of psoriasis on their quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
compared to placebo and active comparator-treated patients at week 16 (Table 5).

DLQI 0/1 responses continued to increase beyond week 16 and then were maintained through week 
52 / 56. In BE VIVID, DLQI 0/1 response rate at week 52 was 74.8% in patients treated with 
bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks. In BE SURE at week 56, 78.9% and 74.1% of patients had a 
DLQI 0/1 with bimekizumab 320 mg every 8 weeks and bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks, 
respectively. 
Phase 3b direct comparative study versus secukinumab 
The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab were also evaluated in a double-blind study compared with 
secukinumab, an IL-17A inhibitor, (BE RADIANT - PS0015). Patients were randomized to receive 
bimekizumab (N=373, 320mg at Week 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (Q4W) followed by 320mg every 4 weeks 
(Q4W/Q4W) or 320 mg every 8 weeks (Q4W/Q8W)) or secukinumab (N=370, 300 mg at Weeks 0,1, 
2, 3, 4 followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks). Baseline characteristics were consistent with a population 
of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients with a median BSA of 19% and a median PASI score 
of 18. 
Bimekizumab-treated patients achieved significantly higher response rates compared to secukinumab 
for the primary endpoint of PASI100 (complete skin clearance) at Week 16. Significantly higher 
response rates were also achieved with bimekizumab for the secondary endpoint of PASI 100 at Week 
48 (for both Q4W/Q4W and Q4W/Q8W regimens). Comparative PASI response rates are presented in 
Table 6. 
Differences in response rates between bimekizumab and secukinumab-treated patients were noted as 
early as week 1 for PASI 75 (7.2% and 1.4% respectively) and as early as Week 2 for PASI 90 (7.5% 
and 2.4% respectively).

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab were evaluated in 1112 adult patients (at least 18 years of 
age) with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies (PA0010 - BE OPTIMAL and PA0011- BE COMPLETE). The BE OPTIMAL 
study included an active reference treatment arm (adalimumab) (N=140). 
For both studies, patients had a diagnosis of active psoriatic arthritis for at least 6 months based on the 
Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) and had active disease with tender joint count 
(TJC) ≥3 and swollen joint count (SJC) ≥3. Patients had a diagnosis of PsA for a median of 3.6 years 
in BE OPTIMAL and 6.8 years in BE COMPLETE. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled 
in these studies, including polyarticular symmetric arthritis, oligoarticular asymmetric arthritis, distal 
interphalangeal joint predominant, spondylitis predominant and arthritis mutilans. At baseline, 55.9% 
of patients had ≥ 3% Body Surface Area (BSA) with active plaque psoriasis. 10.4% of patients had 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and 31.9% and 12.3% had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, 
respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response at Week 16. 
The BE OPTIMAL study evaluated 852 patients not previously exposed to any biologic disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. Patients 
were randomized (3:2:1) to receive bimekizumab 160 mg every 4 weeks through Week 52 or placebo 
up to Week 16 followed by bimekizumab 160 mg every 4 weeks through Week 52 or an active 
reference treatment arm (adalimumab 40mg every 2 weeks) up to Week 52. In this study, 78.3% of 
patients had received prior treatment with ≥ 1 cDMARDs and 21.7 % of patients had no prior 
treatment with cDMARDs. At baseline, 58.2% of patients were receiving concomitant methotrexate 
(MTX), 11.3% were receiving concomitant cDMARDs other than MTX, and 30.5% were receiving no 
cDMARDs. 
The BE COMPLETE study evaluated 400 patients with an inadequate response (lack of efficacy) or 
intolerance to treatment with 1 or 2 tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFα – IR) for either 
psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive bimekizumab 160 mg every 4 
weeks or placebo up to Week 16. At baseline, 42.5% of patients were receiving concomitant MTX, 
8.0% were receiving concomitant cDMARDs other than MTX, and 49.5% were receiving no 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cDMARDs. In this study, 76.5% of participants had an inadequate response to 1 TNFα inhibitor, 
11.3% had an inadequate response to 2 TNFα inhibitors and 12.3% were intolerant to TNFα inhibitors. 
Signs and symptoms 
In bDMARDs-naïve patients (BE OPTIMAL) and anti-TNFα IR patients (BE COMPLETE) treatment 
with bimekizumab resulted in significant improvement in signs and symptoms and measures of 
disease activity compared to placebo at Week 16, with similar response rates seen in both patient 
populations (see Table 7). Clinical responses were sustained up to Week 52 in BE OPTIMAL as 
assessed by ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70, MDA, PASI 90, PASI 100 and ACR 50 / PASI 100.

Figure 6: ACR 50 response over time up to Week 16 in BE COMPLETE (NRI) 
For the bimekizumab-treated patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 16 in BE 
OPTIMAL, 87.2% maintained this response at Week 52. 
The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab were demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, baseline 
body weight, baseline psoriasis involvement, baseline CRP, disease duration and prior cDMARDs use. 
In both studies, similar responses were observed with bimekizumab regardless of whether patients 
were on concomitant cDMARDs, including MTX, or not.  
The modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) is a specific composite responder index 
comprising of tender joint count, swollen joints count, patient and physician global assessment. The 
proportion of patients achieving modified PsARC at Week 16 was higher in the bimekizumab-treated 
patients compared to placebo (80.3% versus 40.2% respectively in BE OPTIMAL and 85.4% versus 
30.8% respectively in BE COMPLETE). PsARC response was sustained up to Week 52 in BE 
OPTIMAL. 
Radiographic response 
In BE OPTIMAL, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and 
expressed as the change from baseline in the Van der Heijde modified total Sharp Score (vdHmTSS) 
and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and the Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at Week 16 
(see Table 8).

Bimekizumab significantly inhibited the progression of joint damage at Week 16 in both the 
population with elevated hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone erosion at baseline and the overall population 
compared to placebo. While reference-based imputation was specified as the missing data handling 
method in the statistical testing procedure comparing bimekizumab versus placebo, changes from 
baseline were also calculated using standard multiple imputation in both the population with elevated 
hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone erosion at baseline and the overall population at Week 16 in the 
bimekizumab arm (mean change from baseline 0.01 and 0.01 respectively) and the adalimumab arm 
(mean change from baseline -0.05 and -0.03 respectively). Inhibition of the progression of joint 
damage was sustained in both the population with elevated hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone erosion at 
baseline and the overall population to Week 52 in both the bimekizumab arm (mean change from 
baseline 0.10 and 0.10 respectively) and the adalimumab arm (mean change from baseline -0.17 and -
0.12 respectively). 
The observed percentage of patients with no radiographic joint damage progression (defined as a 
change from baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomization to Week 52 was 87.9% (N=276/314) for 
bimekizumab and 84.8% (N=168/198) for placebo study participants switching to bimekizumab and 
94.1% (N=96/102) for adalimumab in the population with elevated hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone 
erosion. Similar rates were observed in the overall population (89.3% (N=326/365) for bimekizumab 
and 87.3% (N=207/237) for placebo study participants switching to bimekizumab and 94.1% 
(N=111/118) for adalimumab). 
Physical function and other health-related outcomes 
Both bDMARD-naïve (BE OPTIMAL) and anti-TNFα-IR (BE COMPLETE) patients receiving 
bimekizumab showed significant improvement from baseline in physical function compared to 
placebo patients at Week 16 (p<0.001) as assessed by the HAQ-DI (LS Mean change from baseline: 
- 0.3 versus - 0.1 in BE OPTIMAL and - 0.3 versus 0 in BE COMPLETE, respectively). In both 
studies, a greater proportion of patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction of at least 0.35 in 
HAQ-DI score from baseline in the bimekizumab group compared with placebo at Week 16. 
Bimekizumab-treated patients reported significant improvement from baseline in the Short Form-36 
item Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS) score at Week 16 compared to 
placebo (LS Mean change from baseline: 6.3 versus 1.9, p<0.001 in BE OPTIMAL and 6.2 versus 0.1, 
p<0.001 in BE COMPLETE).  
In both studies, bimekizumab-treated patients reported meaningful reduction from baseline in fatigue 
as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score at Week 
16 compared to placebo. Meaningful improvement from baseline was also observed in the Psoriatic 
Arthritis Impact of Disease-12 (PsAID-12) score in the bimekizumab-treated group compared to the 
placebo group at Week 16.  
Patients with axial involvement at baseline, approximately 74% of patients, (defined as a Bath 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score ≥4) showed greater improvement 
from baseline in BASDAI compared with placebo at Week 16. 
Improvements achieved at Week 16 in all measures of physical function and other health-related 
outcomes mentioned above (HAQ-DI, SF-36 PCS, FACIT-Fatigue, PsAID-12 scores and BASDAI) 
were sustained up to Week 52 in BE OPTIMAL. 
In BE OPTIMAL, at Week 52, 65.5% of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved complete nail 
clearance (mNAPSI resolution in patients with mNAPSI higher than 0 at Baseline).

Axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS) 
The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab was evaluated in 586 adult patients (at least 18 years of age) 
with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies, one in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and one in ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS), also known as radiographic axSpA. The primary endpoint in both studies was the 
percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 
response at Week 16. Consistent results were seen across both patient populations. 
The BE MOBILE 1 study (AS0010) evaluated 254 patients with active nr-axSpA. Patients had axSpA 
(age of symptoms onset < 45 years) meeting the ASAS classification criteria and had active disease as 
defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and spinal pain ≥4 on 
a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) (from BASDAI Item 2) and no evidence of radiographic changes 
in the sacroiliac joints that would meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients also had 
objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level and/or 
evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as a history of inadequate 
response to 2 different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or intolerance or 
contraindication to NSAIDs. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive bimekizumab 160 mg every 4 
weeks up to Week 52 or placebo up to Week 16 followed by bimekizumab 160 mg every 4 weeks up 
to Week 52. At baseline, patients had symptoms of nr-axSpA for a mean of 9 years (median of 5.5 
years). 10.6% of patients were previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent.  
The BE MOBILE 2 study (AS0011) evaluated 332 patients with active AS determined by documented 
radiologic evidence (x-ray) fulfilling the Modified New York criteria for AS. Patients had active 
disease as defined by a BASDAI ≥4 and spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) (from 
BASDAI Item 2). Patients had to have a history of inadequate response to 2 different NSAIDs or 
intolerance or contraindication to NSAIDs. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive bimekizumab 
160 mg every 4 weeks up to Week 52 or placebo up to Week 16 followed by bimekizumab 160 mg 
every 4 weeks up to Week 52. At baseline, patients had symptoms of AS for a mean of 13.5 years 
(median of 11 years). 16.3% of patients were previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent. 
Clinical response 
Treatment with bimekizumab resulted in significant improvement in signs and symptoms and 
measures of disease activity compared to placebo at Week 16 in both nr-axSpA and AS patient 
populations (see Table 9). Clinical responses were sustained up to Week 52 in both patient populations 
as assessed by all the endpoints presented in Table 9.

The proportion of patients in BE MOBILE 1 reaching ASDAS <2.1 (combining ASDAS-inactive 
disease (ID) and ASDAS-low disease (LD)) at Week 16 was 46.1% in the bimekizumab group versus 
21.1% in the placebo group (multiple imputation). At Week 52, 61.6% of patients in the bimekizumab 
group achieved an ASDAS <2.1, including 25.2% in inactive disease state (ASDAS <1.3). 
The proportion of patients in BE MOBILE 2 reaching ASDAS <2.1 (combining ASDAS-ID and 
ASDAS-LD) at Week 16 was 44.8% in the bimekizumab group versus 17.4% in placebo group 
(multiple imputation). At Week 52, 57.1% of patients in the bimekizumab group achieved an ASDAS 
<2.1, including 23.4 % in inactive disease state (ASDAS <1.3). 
All four ASAS 40 components (total spinal pain, morning stiffness, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Functional Index [BASFI] and Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity [PGADA]) were 
improved with bimekizumab treatment and contributed to the overall ASAS 40 response at week 16, 
and these improvements were sustained up to Week 52 in both patient populations. 
Improvements in other measures of efficacy are shown in Table 10.

Bimekizumab was associated with a rapid onset of efficacy in both nr-axSpA and AS patient 
population.  
Treatment responses on bimekizumab-treated patients for ASAS 40 were greater than those on 
placebo as early as Week 1 in BE MOBILE 1 (16.4% vs. 1.6%, nominal p<0.001) and Week 2 in BE 
MOBILE 2 (16.7% vs. 7.2%, nominal p=0.019). 
Bimekizumab was also associated with a rapid decrease in systemic inflammation as measured by hs-
CRP levels as early as Week 2 in both nr-axSpA and AS patient populations, with nominal p-values 
<0.001 in both studies.

In an integrated analysis of BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2, of bimekizumab-treated patients who 
achieved an ASAS 40 response at Week 16, 82.1% maintained this response at Week 52. 
The efficacy of bimekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, 
baseline inflammation status, baseline ASDAS and concomitant cDMARDs. 
Similar response in ASAS 40 was seen in patients regardless of prior anti-TNFα exposure. 
At Week 16, among patients with enthesitis at baseline, the proportion of patients (NRI) with 
enthesitis resolution as assessed by the Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis (MASES) index 
was greater with bimekizumab compared to placebo (BE MOBILE 1: 51.1% versus 23.9% and BE 
MOBILE 2: 51.5% versus 32.8%). The resolution of enthesitis with bimekizumab was sustained up to 
Week 52 in both studies (BE MOBILE 1: 54.3% and BE MOBILE 2: 50.8%). 
Reduction of inflammation  
Bimekizumab reduced inflammation as measured by hs-CRP (see Table 10) and as assessed by MRI 
in an imaging sub-study. Signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at baseline and Week 16 and 
expressed as change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) 
score for sacroiliac joints and Ankylosing Spondylitis spine Magnetic Resonance Imagine-activity 
(ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modification) for the spine. Reduction of inflammatory signs in both 
sacroiliac joints and the spine was observed in patients treated with bimekizumab as compared with 
placebo (see Table 11). Reduction of inflammation as measured by hs-CRP and as assessed by MRI 
was sustained to Week 52.

Physical function and other health-related outcomes 
Patients treated with bimekizumab showed significant improvement from baseline in physical function 
as assessed by the BASFI compared to placebo (LS Mean change from baseline at Week 16 in BE 
MOBILE 1: -2.4 versus -0.9, p<0.001 and in BE MOBILE 2: -2.0 versus -1.0, p<0.001). Patients 
treated with bimekizumab reported significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo-
treated patients in SF-36 PCS score (LS Mean change from baseline at Week 16 in BE MOBILE 1: 
9.3 versus 5.4, p<0.001 and in BE MOBILE 2: 8.5 versus 5.2, p<0.001).  
Patients treated with bimekizumab reported significant improvement from baseline in health-related 
quality of life as measured by the AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) compared to placebo 
(LS Mean change from baseline at Week 16 in BE MOBILE 1: -4.9 versus -2.3, p<0.001 and in BE 
MOBILE 2: -4.6 versus -3.0, p<0.001) as well as meaningful reduction in fatigue as assessed by the 
FACIT-Fatigue score (Mean change from baseline at Week 16 in BE MOBILE 1: 8.5 for 
bimekizumab versus 3.9 for placebo and in BE MOBILE 2: 8.4 for bimekizumab versus 5.0 for 
placebo).  
Improvements achieved at Week 16 in all measures of physical function and other health-related 
outcomes mentioned above (BASFI, SF-36 PCS, ASQoL and FACIT-Fatigue scores) were sustained 
up to Week 52 in both studies.      
Extra-articular manifestation  
In pooled data from BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS), at Week 16, the proportion 
of patients developing a uveitis event was lower with bimekizumab (0.6%) compared to placebo 
(4.6%). The incidence of uveitis remained low with long-term treatment with bimekizumab (1.2/100 
patient-years in the pooled phase 2/3 studies).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Bimzelx in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in psoriasis and chronic idiopathic 
arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of bimekizumab were similar in patients with plaque psoriasis, 
psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS).

Absorption 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of 320 mg in 
plaque psoriasis patients, bimekizumab reached a median (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) peak plasma 
concentration of 25 (12 -50) μg/mL, between 3 and 4 days post dose. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that bimekizumab was absorbed with an average 
absolute bioavailability of 70.1% in healthy volunteers. 
Based on simulated data, the median (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) peak and trough concentration at 
steady-state following subcutaneous administration of 320 mg every 4 weeks are 43 (20-91) µg/mL 
and 20 (7-50) µg/mL respectively and steady-state is reached after approximately 16 weeks with every 
4 weeks dosing regimen. Compared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis showed that patients exhibited a 1.74-fold increase in peak plasma concentrations and area 
under the curve (AUC) following repeated four weekly dosing. 
After switching from the 320 mg every 4 weeks dosing regimen to 320 mg every 8 weeks dosing 
regimen at week 16, steady-state is achieved approximately 16 weeks after the switch. Median (2.5th 
and 97.5th percentile) peak and trough plasma concentrations are 30 (14 -60) μg/mL and 5 (1-
16) μg/mL respectively. 
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the median (coefficient of variation %) volume of 
distribution (V/F) at steady state was 11.2 (30.5%) L in plaque psoriasis patients. 
Biotransformation 
Bimekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins. 
Elimination 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the median (coefficient of variation %) apparent 
clearance (CL/F) of bimekizumab was 0.337 L/day (32.7%) and the mean terminal elimination half-
life of bimekizumab was 23 days in clinical studies in patients with plaque psoriasis. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Bimekizumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in patients with plaque psoriasis over a 
dose range from 64 mg to 480 mg following multiple subcutaneous administrations, with apparent 
clearance (CL/F) being independent of dose. 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic relationship 
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed using all available data in 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients. The analysis showed that higher bimekizumab 
concentrations are related to better Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigators Global 
Assessment (IGA) response. A dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks was shown to be an appropriate dose for 
the initial treatment period and 320 mg every 8 weeks thereafter is appropriate for the maintenance 
period for the majority of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients (see Special Populations, Body 
weight).

Special populations 
Body weight 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that exposure decreased as body weight increased. 
The average plasma concentration in adult patients weighing ≥120 kg following a 320 mg 
subcutaneous injection was predicted to be at least 30% lower than in adult patients weighing 90 kg. 
Dose adjustment may be appropriate in some patients (see section 4.2). 
Elderly 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n=337 for 
age ≥ 65 years and n= 45 for age ≥ 75 years), apparent clearance (CL/F) in elderly patients and 
patients less than 65 years of age was similar. No dose adjustment is required (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment or hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of bimekizumab. The renal elimination of intact bimekizumab, an IgG monoclonal 
antibody, is expected to be low and of minor importance. Similarly, IgGs are mainly eliminated via 
intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of 
bimekizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, hepatic function markers 
(ALT/bilirubin) did not have any impact on bimekizumab clearance in patients with plaque psoriasis. 
Race 
No clinically meaningful differences in bimekizumab exposure were observed in Japanese or Chinese 
subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in a clinical pharmacokinetic study. No dose adjustment is 
required. 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling indicated females may have 10% faster apparent clearance 
(CL/F) compared to males and it is not clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment is required. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on tissue cross-reactivity testing, 
repeat-dose toxicity studies (including safety pharmacology endpoints and assessment of fertility-
related endpoints) and evaluation of pre- and postnatal development in the cynomolgus monkey. 
In cynomolgus monkeys, bimekizumab-related effects were limited to mucocutaneous changes 
consistent with pharmacologic modulation of commensal microflora. 
No mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with bimekizumab. However monoclonal 
antibodies are not expected to damage DNA or chromosomes. In a 26-week chronic toxicology study 
in cynomolgus monkeys there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed at a dose resulting 
in 109 times the human exposure at 320 mg every 4 weeks. 
In a peri- and postnatal development study in the cynomolgus monkey, bimekizumab showed no 
effects on gestation, parturition, infant survival, foetal and postnatal development when administered 
throughout organogenesis until parturition at a dose resulting in 27 times the human exposure at 
320 mg every 4 weeks based on AUC. At birth, serum bimekizumab concentrations in infant monkeys 
were comparable to those of mothers.

Instructions for use 
1.  What Bimzelx is and what it is used for 
What Bimzelx is 
Bimzelx contains the active substance bimekizumab. 
What Bimzelx is used for 
Bimzelx is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:  
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis  
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing 
spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Plaque psoriasis  
Bimzelx is used in adults to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis. Bimzelx reduces the 
symptoms, including pain, itching, and scaling of the skin. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes 
inflamed joints, often accompanied by plaque psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may 
first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough or in case of intolerance, 
you will be given Bimzelx either alone or in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. 
Bimzelx reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, swelling in and around 
your joints, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage and slow down the damage to the cartilage and 
bone of the joints involved in the disease. These effects can help you to control signs and symptoms of 
the disease, ease your normal daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.  
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 
(radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which 
causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is not visible 
using X-rays, it is referred to as “non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis”; if it occurs in patients with 
visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as “ankylosing spondylitis” or “radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”.  
If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given Bimzelx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function. Bimzelx can help to reduce back 
pain, stiffness and tiredness, which can ease your normal daily activities and improve your quality of 
life. 
How Bimzelx works 
Bimekizumab, the active substance in Bimzelx, belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) 
inhibitors. Bimekizumab works by reducing the activity of two proteins called IL-17A and IL-17F, 
which are involved in causing inflammation. There are higher levels of these proteins in inflammatory 
diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Bimzelx

Bimzelx the right way. 
You and/or your caregiver should read these Instructions for Use before each use of Bimzelx.  
Call your healthcare professional if you or your caregiver have any questions about how to 
inject Bimzelx the right way.  
Depending on your prescribed dose you will need to use 1 or 2 Bimzelx pre-filled

• 
• 
• 
• 
the expiry date (EXP) has passed.

spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis)  
Plaque psoriasis  
Bimzelx is used in adults to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis. Bimzelx reduces the 
symptoms, including pain, itching, and scaling of the skin. 
Psoriatic arthritis  
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes 
inflamed joints, often accompanied by plaque psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may 
first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough or in case of intolerance, 
you will be given Bimzelx either alone or in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. 
Bimzelx reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, swelling in and around 
your joints, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage and slow down the damage to the cartilage and 
bone of the joints involved in the disease. These effects can help you to control signs and symptoms of 
the disease, ease your normal daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.

Axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 
(radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which 
causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is not visible 
using X-rays, it is referred to as “non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis”; if it occurs in patients with 
visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as “ankylosing spondylitis” or “radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”.  
If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given Bimzelx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function. Bimzelx can help to reduce back 
pain, stiffness and tiredness, which can ease your normal daily activities and improve your quality of 
life. 
How Bimzelx works 
Bimekizumab, the active substance in Bimzelx, belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) 
inhibitors. Bimekizumab works by reducing the activity of two proteins called IL-17A and IL-17F, 
which are involved in causing inflammation. There are higher levels of these proteins in inflammatory 
diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis.

One pre-filled pen is needed for a 160 mg dose and 2 pre-filled pens (one after the other) are 
needed for a 320 mg dose.  
Do not use this medicine and return it to the pharmacy if:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the expiry date (EXP) has passed. 
the carton seal is broken. 
the pre-filled pen has been dropped or looks damaged. 
the liquid has ever been frozen (even if thawed).

Do not shake the pre-filled pen(s). 
Do not uncap the pre-filled pen(s) until you are ready to inject. 
Follow the steps below each time you use Bimzelx. 
Step 1: Setting up for your injection(s) 
Depending on your prescribed dose, place the following items on a clean flat, well-lit work 
surface, like a table: 
• 
1 or 2 Bimzelx pre-filled pen(s) 
You will also need (not included in the carton): 
• 
•

• 
• 
Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly, hard or areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
Do not inject within 5 cm of the belly-button (navel). 
If a second injection is needed for your prescribed dose (320 mg), you should use a different 
place for your second injection. Do not use the same place to inject twice in a row. 
2b: Wash your hands well with soap and water and dry with a clean towel 
2c: Prepare your skin 
• 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let the area dry completely. Do not touch the

Step 3: Inject Bimzelx 
3a: Remove the pre-filled pen cap 
•

filled pen with the other hand (see Figure E). Although you cannot see the needle tip, it is now 
uncovered. 
Do not touch the needle guard or put the cap back on. This is because it could activate the pre-
filled pen and you could prick yourself.

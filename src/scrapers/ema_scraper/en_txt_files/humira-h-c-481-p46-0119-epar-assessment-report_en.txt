Study P15-759: Assessing Long-term Effectiveness of Adalimumab for treating children and 
adolescents with Crohn's disease in real life conditions - LEA
Crohn's disease (CD) is a relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease involving potentially any part 
of the digestive tract and potentially associated with extra-intestinal manifestations involving joints, 
skin, eyes, or liver. During relapses, symptoms associate abdominal pain, diarrhoea often with mucus 
and blood, ano-perineal involvement, and sometimes systemic manifestations. Fatigue, weight loss, 
anorexia, and fever are frequently reported. CD may be complicated by intestinal obstructions, fistulae, 
abscesses, anal fissures, malnutrition, malabsorption, peritonitis, digestive haemorrhages. Patients 
with extensive colitis are at high risk of dysplasia and cancer, especially in case of cholangitis.
In paediatric patients, the reported incidence rates of CD ranges from 0.1 to 13.9 per 100,000 persons 
internationally (Benchimol 2011). There are phenotypic characteristics unique to pediatric CD, 
including a greater propensity for disease extension (Levine 2011). Beside intestinal and extra-
intestinal manifestations, growth failure and pubertal delay are specific to children and adolescents 
with CD, involving up to 30% of children and challenging their quality of life (Hensley 1987, Molinari 
2002).
CD therapies aim to reach sustained, steroid-free remission, with mucosal healing and enhancement of 
growth and pubertal development of paediatric patients. Apart from enteral nutritional therapy, oral 
corticosteroid, and amino salicylates, anti-TNF treatments are indicated for inducing and maintaining 
remission in paediatric patients with chronically active luminal CD despite prior optimized 
immunomodulator therapy and in children with active steroid-refractory CD. Anti-TNF therapy should 
be considered early in the treatment plan for severe extra-intestinal manifestations (Ruemmele 2014). 
In particular, adalimumab, a fully human recombinant anti-TNF monoclonal antibody containing only 
3
human peptide sequences, demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in a previous interventional study 
conducted in 192 children and adolescents with active CD (IMAGINE 1, Hyams 2012).
IMAGINE1 was the pivotal clinical study leading to the approval of the paediatric Crohn’s indication. 
After receiving open-label induction therapy with adalimumab, at week 4 subjects were randomised to 
either low-dose adalimumab (10 mg eow [<40 kg] or 20 mg [≥40 kg]) or high-dose adalimumab (20 
mg [<40 kg] or 40 mg [≥40 kg] eow). Study endpoints were assessed at week 26,
In a retrospective non-interventional study conducted in 36 CD children receiving adalimumab, an 
improvement in linear growth was shown after 6 months in 42% of patients, especially in those 
entering remission regardless of the steroid sparing effect (Malik 2012). However, long-term outcomes 
were only available in CD adults treated with adalimumab (up to Week240 in the IMAGINE2 extension 
study, Faubion 2017) and no data were available in treated pediatric patients.
2.3.2.  Clinical study
Clinical study number and title
P15-759: Assessing Long-term Effectiveness of Adalimumab for treating children and adolescents with 
Crohn's disease in real life conditions - LEA
Description
This was a French prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study conducted in pediatric patients 
who started adalimumab treatment with for CD in real-life conditions.
Methods
Objectives
At the time of the protocol writing, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate long-term 
effectiveness of adalimumab in paediatric patients starting a treatment for CD in real-life conditions, 
namely to describe the time to loss of clinical benefit in a time to event approach. Main secondary 
objectives were to describe growth and pubertal development and to describe long-term safety.  The 
patients were to be followed for up to 10 years. 
Considering the limited number of inclusions during the planned 2-year period (n= 62 versus 200 
expected) and in agreement with French Health Authorities, the study discontinued prematurely on 
14/10/2019, with very few follow-up medical visits after 12 months. Consequently, analysis focused on 
the baseline characteristics of paediatric patients who started treatment with adalimumab for Crohn's 
disease, the use of adalimumab and safety data collected until Month 12 (M12).  Exploratory objectives 
aimed to describe available effectiveness data and evolution of treated patient productivity.
Study design
This was a French prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study conducted in paediatric patients 
who started adalimumab treatment for CD in real-life conditions. Follow-up visits, treatments, 
procedures and diagnostic methods were at the sole discretion of the participant physicians. Data to be 
documented in a dedicated eCRF were those closest to the following time-windows: baseline, 3, 6 and 
12 months after, and then every year until the end of the study. At each study visit, physicians asked 
patients to fulfil a "paper" questionnaire on their productivity (at school or work whichever was 
applicable).
4
The initially planned study duration was 12 years (inclusions:2 years; follow-up: 10 years). 
Considering the limited number of enrolled patients at the end of the inclusion period, the study was 
prematurely discontinued at that time.

Study size
Around 200 included children and adolescents starting adalimumab for CD were initially expected over 
a 2-year period; 62 were enrolled during this time with none of them being excluding from analysis.
Analysis population
Safety population:  all included patients with at least one injection of adalimumab were included in the 
Safety population.
Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population:  all the patients included in the Safety population and meeting all 
the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria were included in this population.
Treatments
The use of adalimumab was considered as in accordance with the product label in the following 
conditions:
Outcomes/endpoints
Considering the changes in study conduct as described above, the planned analyses related to the 
long-term outcomes of adalimumab were not performed.
5
The following analysis were carried out:
•
•
Baseline characteristics of eligible patients, medical history, CD characteristics, and prior 
CD treatments
Modalities of the use of adalimumab (number and percentage of patients with each drug 
regimen during the initial and the maintenance treatment periods, treatment duration, 
number and percentage of patients with temporary discontinuation(s), number and 
percentage of patients with permanent discontinuation with reasons, concomitant 
treatments for CD and other diseases)
•
Number and percentage of patients with at least one serious adverse event(SAE), with at 
least one adverse event of special interest(AESI), with at least one serious AESI, with at 
least one SAE (AESI, serious AESI) leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment, 
with at least one SAE (AESI, serious AESI) leading to death(and detailed adverse events); 
causal relationship with adalimumab and outcomes.
Exploratory effectiveness variables were as follows: growth and puberty data, CD activity, imaging and 
laboratory data (at each follow-up visit until M12).
Data from the work productivity questionnaire completed by patients at each follow-up visit until M12 
were other exploratory variables.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS® software (version 9.2 or higher), by the CRO in 
charge of statistics.  The SAP was finalized before the data base lock performed on January 14, 2020.
All parameters were summarized in tables including the following descriptive statistics:
•
•
Quantitative variables: number of available data, missing data, mean, standard deviation, 
median, quartiles (Q) 1 and 3, and range, with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) if 
relevant,
Qualitative variables: number of available data, missing data, frequency, and percentage 
for each modality, with associated 95% CI if relevant.
Main Statistical Methods
Baseline Characteristics
Patients were described for all baseline data in the FAS Population [patient characteristics including 
growth and puberty data, smoking and alcohol status, medical history, CD characteristics and activity 
(wPCDAI; Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI; Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, SES-CD), 
medical imaging and laboratory findings, and prior CD treatments], using descriptive statistics.
Use of Adalimumab
The reasons for adalimumab initiation and the modalities of the use of adalimumab during the study 
were described in the FAS Population[drug regimens during the initial and the maintenance treatment 
periods, treatment duration, temporary discontinuations (number per patient, duration, reasons) 
permanent discontinuations (reasons), concomitant CD treatments], using descriptive statistics.
The proportions of patients with adalimumab used in conformity with its label at treatment start and 
during the maintenance period were described.
Patients' follow-up duration was also described in the FAS Population.
6
Adverse Events 
SAEs, AESIs and serious AESIs were described in the Safety Analysis (with causal relationship with 
adalimumab and outcomes), using descriptive statistics.  Additional nonserious and non-AESIs 
spontaneously reported by investigators were also described. Patients' follow-up duration was also 
described in the Safety Population.
Exploratory Efficacy Analysis
Growth and puberty data, CD activity (wPCDAI, HBI, and SES-CD indexes), medical imaging, and 
laboratory data were described at each follow-up visit, with absolute and relative changes from 
baseline (apart from medical imaging data).
The number and percentage of patients with improvement in the wPCDAI score was described from 
baseline to each follow-up visit, as well as the number and percentage of patients with fistula 
remission.  The proportion of patients with mucosal healing was also described at each visit, using the 
SES-CD index.
Other Exploratory Analysis 
Data from the productivity questionnaire completed by patients were described at each visit.
Missing Values
Partial dates were managed as usual.  Other missing data were not replaced.
Sensitivity Analyses
No sensitivity analysis was performed.
Amendments to the Statistical Analysis Plan
Not applicable.
Quality Control
Participant centers were instructed on the protocol, the functionality and handling of the eCRF, and the 
requirement to maintain source documents for each patient in the study.
A comprehensive data validation program using front-end checks in the eCRF validated the data.  
Automated checks for data consistency were implemented, discrepancies had to be solved by the 
researcher in the eCRF before the module could be completed.  
Follow-up on eCRF data for medical plausibility was done by a company mandated by AbbVie (ICTA).  
The principal investigator of each site finally reviewed the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy of 
available data and provided his/ her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Continuous monitoring of the study and frequent site telephone contacts were performed by a 
company mandated by AbbVie (ICTA).
Results
Recruitment/ Number analysed
During the 2-year inclusion period, 62 patients were enrolled. First patient entered the study on 
September 24, 2017 and last inclusion was performed on August 07, 2019; last patient last visit was 
on October 14, 2019.
7
Considering that all these 62 patients had at least one injection of adalimumab from inclusion and met 
all the selection criteria, all the 62 enrolled patients entered the Safety and the FAS population (no 
exclusion from analyses).
Table 1. Patient disposition (n=62)
Mainly due to the early study termination, the number of patients at each follow-up visit decreases 
over time (
Figure 1). Considering the low number of patients with a medical visit at M18 (n = 5, 8%) and M24 
(n= 2, 3%), only data available until the M12 follow-up visit were taken into account for analysis. 
Four patients (4/62, 6%) did not fulfil the study due to other reasons than the early study termination.
Figure 1. Patient visits
Baseline data
The mean age of paediatric patients was 13±3 years at inclusion (Table 2), ranging from 6 to 17 years 
according to the product label for paediatric CD.  The majority of them were females (60%) and lived 
in urban area (74%). All patients had never smoked at inclusion and one of them was consuming 
alcohol. A growth delay was diagnosed in 18/54 patients (33%).

Table 2. Baseline Sociodemographic Characteristics (n = 62)
Apart from CD, 47% of patients had past or concomitant diseases and 23% at least one concomitant 
disease at the time of inclusion [mainly as respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (7%, asthma 
for all) and congenital, familial and genetic disorders (5%)]. Family history of IBD was reported in 19% 
of cases.
The mean age of patients was 12±3 years at CD diagnosis. At this time, according to the Paris 
classification, the main CD locations were ileocolonic (44%) and colonic (32%), and the most reported 
phenotype was the non-stricturing and non-penetrating one (90%).
At inclusion, the median disease duration from first CD symptoms was 1.5 year (range:  0.1; 9.1). At 
least one past or ongoing CD complication was reported in 52% of patients, mainly as anal fissures 
(31%), stenosing lesions (13%) or perineal fistulae (10%). At inclusion, 27% of patients had at least 
one CD complication, including 13% of patients with anal fissures and/or 10% with stenosing lesion.  
At least one past or ongoing extra-intestinal manifestation was observed in 26% of patients, mainly as 
acute peripheral rheumatisms (16%) and erythema nodosum (7%).  At inclusion, 11% of patients had 
at least one extra-intestinal manifestation, including acute peripheral rheumatism (5%) and erythema 
nodosum (5%).
Distal ileum and left colon (transverse – left – sigmoid – rectum) were the most locations affected by 
CD (in 71% and 41% of the cases, respectively).  Stenosis and intraperitoneal abscess were reported 
in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. 
At inclusion, the mean wPCDAI score was 32.1± 24.0; it was 3.7± 4.1 for the HBI, and 12.6± 8.0 for 
the SES-CD. According to the wPCDAI, the proportions of the patients with moderate (score: [40; 
57.5]), severe (score ≥ 57.5), and then moderate-to-severe (score ≥ 40) disease activity were 17%, 
17%, and 35%, respectively. According to the HBI, the proportions of the patients with moderate 
(score: [8; 16]), severe (score > 16), and then moderate-to-severe (score > 16) disease activity were 
14%, 0%, and 14%, respectively. In the other hand, using SES-CD,59%, 24%, and 83% of patients 
had moderate (score: [7; 15]), severe (score > 15), and then moderate-to-severe (score > 7) 
endoscopic activity respectively at inclusion. The majority of patients had CRP value > 10 mg/L (59%), 
and high fecal calprotectin value (≥ 100 μg/L: 81%, ≥ 250 μg/L: 71%).
Using the work productivity questionnaire completed at inclusion, 4 patients (7%) did not attend 
school due to CD.  Two patients (4%) went to school as part-time due to CD, and 30 patients (56%) 
missed school for a total of 5 days or more over the 6 last months. 
9
Prior and concomitant therapies
The majority of patients (73%) received at least one previous CD treatment, mainly as azathioprine 
(39%), corticosteroids (31%), and/or infliximab (27%), as well as enteral nutrition (37%).  In 66% of 
patients, at least one CD treatment was prescribed in combination with adalimumab during the study 
period, mainly as azathioprine (44%) and/or corticosteroids (31%).  Two patients (3%) underwent at 
least one surgery for CD before inclusion and the same number had surgery during the study period.
Use of adalimumab 
Adalimumab was mainly prescribed as second-line treatment, after failure of conventional treatment or 
first anti-TNF (24% and 16% of patients, respectively), and in the case of poor tolerability of current 
treatment (11%) or contra-indication of conventional therapy (5%). It was used as anti-TNF of first 
intention in 27% of patients.
As planned by the investigators, compliance to the adalimumab label was observed for the majority of 
patients:  74% at treatment initiation, 68% at maintenance therapy, and 56% at both times. Similar 
compliance was observed during follow-up (in 80% of patients at M3, 83% at M6, 80% at M12, and 
79% at all times).
During patient follow-up (median duration: 6.7 months; range: 0.0; 21.8), 7 patients (11%) stopped 
adalimumab permanently, mainly due to the lack (n = 2) or loss of efficacy (n = 2), and to related AE 
(n = 2).  The few temporary treatment discontinuations (3 patients, 5%) were due to infections (n = 
2) and/or patient poor observance (n = 2).
Efficacy results
Between treatment start and M6, CD activity decreased by wPCDAI (decrease of at least 37.5) in 27% 
of patients (7/26). wPCDAI remission (score <12.5) was reached at M3 and M6 in 70% (23/33) and 
73% (22/30) of patients, respectively (Table 3. ).
Table 3. wPCDAI Evolution Over the Study Period
10
HBI remission (score <5) was reached at M3 and M6 in 96% (48/50) and 98% (39/40) of patients, 
respectively. 
Improvement in CRP value was also observed during follow-up [≤ 10 mg/L:  41% at inclusion (20/49), 
85% at M3 (40/47), and 77% at M6 (26/34)].
Regarding the evolution of patient work productivity between inclusion and M6, the proportion of 
patients with missed school for a total of 5 days over this period decreased from 57% (30/53) to 22% 
(7/32).
Safety results
Only AESIs and SAEs were required to be reported by investigators after the first adalimumab 
injection.
From inclusion and during patient follow-up (median duration: 6.7 months; range:0.0; 21.8), at least 
one AE was reported in 13 patients (21%, 18 events reported) and 7 patients (11%) experienced at 
least one AE assessed as related to adalimumab (9 related AEs including 4 CD flares or digestive 
ulcers). At least one SAE was reported in 10 patients (16%, 12 SAEs reported) and 5 patients (8%) 
experienced at least one SAE related to adalimumab (6 related SAEs with the preferred terms: CD, 
colitis ulcerative, ileal ulcer, drug-induced liver injury, malnutrition, and arthralgia).
Five AEs reported in 5 patients (8%) led to treatment discontinuation. Among these 5 AEs, 4 events 
were assessed as related to adalimumab (CD, drug-induced liver injury, malnutrition, and arthralgia).
One patient (2%) experienced one serious AESI related to adalimumab (probable drug-induced 
hepatitis) that led to treatment discontinuation. 
No malignancy or fatal AE was reported.
Discussion as provided by the MAH
Currently there is limited French real-world data on paediatric patients starting adalimumab for CD.  
The LEA study was set up to close this data gap.  Due to the limited number of included patients (n = 
62), the study discontinued prematurely, and only exploratory effectiveness analysis was performed 
until M12.  Finally, the LEA study mainly aimed to describe the characteristics of treated CD paediatric 
patients, as well as the use and the safety profile of adalimumab.
The characteristics of paediatric patients included in the LEA study were broadly similar to previous 
non-French interventional and observational studies.  At adalimumab start, only 35% of patients had 
moderate-to-severe disease activity at inclusion by wPCDAI (moderate:  17%; severe: 17%), whereas 
39% were mild and 27% were inactive.  However, moderate-to-severe endoscopic activity was 
observed in most patients (83%; moderate:  59%; severe; 24%) using SES-CD, with high CRP (60% 
> 10mg/L) and high faecal calprotectin (80% ≥ 100 μg/L; 70% ≥ 250 μg/L) which indicate an active 
disease.
Adalimumab was mainly prescribed as second-line treatment, after failure of conventional treatment 
(24%) or first anti-TNF (16%), and in the case of poor tolerability of current treatment (11%) or 
contra-indication of conventional therapy (5%). Treated patients were aged between 6 and 17 years 
according to the product label for paediatric CD. In the majority of the cases, adalimumab regimens 
were in accordance with the product label at initiation and maintenance therapy. 
Adalimumab was well tolerated with a low number of SAEs and 8% of patients discontinuing treatment 
prematurely for safety reasons. No new safety signals were detected. 
11
In addition, our findings tend to confirm in a real-life setting the efficacy of adalimumab in CD children 
and adolescents as CD activity decreased by wPCDAI (at least 37.5) in 27% of patients. wPCDAI 
remission (score< 12.5) and HBI remission (score <5) were reached at M3 in 70%and 96% of cases, 
respectively, and at M6 in 73% and 98% of patients. CRF decrease was also observed after 
adalimumab initiation (≤ 10 mg/L: from 41% at inclusion to 85% at M3 and 77% at M6).
Overall, considering the lack of French data in paediatric CD patients treated with adalimumab, the 
present study provides new information in this context, both reassuring on the use and on the safety 
profile of adalimumab.
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Humira was approved in 2012 for the treatment of paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) with 
moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Study P15-759 was a postmarketing commitment from 
AbbVie to the French Health Authority (HAS:  Haute Autorité de Santé).
Study P15-759 was a French prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study conducted in paediatric 
patients who started adalimumab treatment with for CD in real-life conditions.
Methods
The original primary objective was to evaluate long-term effectiveness of adalimumab in paediatric 
patients starting a treatment for CD. Considering the limited number of patients included (n= 62 
versus 200 expected) and in agreement with French Health Authorities, the study discontinued 
prematurely on 14/10/2019, with very few follow-up medical visits after 12 months.  Consequently, 
analysis focused on the baseline characteristics and safety data collected until Month 12 (M12).  
Exploratory objectives aimed to describe available effectiveness data and evolution of treated patient 
productivity.
Included patients were adalimumab-naïve Crohn’s patients aged 6-17 years. Adalimumab was 
administered in accordance with the SmPC. 
Baseline characteristics and other variables were summarised using descriptive statistics.
Results
During the 2-year inclusion period (2017-2019), 62 patients were enrolled and achieved at least one 
injection of adalimumab. The mean age was 13±3 years at inclusion, ranging from 6 to 17 years. 
Detailed baseline disease characteristics were presented.
From an efficacy point of view, CD activity decreased by wPCDAI (decrease of at least 37.5) in 27% of 
patients (7/26) between treatment start and month 6. wPCDAI remission (score <12.5) was reached 
at month 3 and month 6 in 70% (23/33) and 73% (22/30) of patients, respectively. HBI remission 
(score <5) was reached at month 3 and month 6 in 96% (48/50) and 98% (39/40) of patients, 
respectively. 
Regarding safety, from inclusion and during patient follow-up (median duration: 6.7 months; range: 
0.0; 21.8), at least one AE was reported in 13 patients (21%, 18 events reported) and 7 patients 
(11%) experienced at least one AE assessed as related to adalimumab (9 related AEs including 4 CD 
flares or digestive ulcers). At least one SAE was reported in 10 patients (16%, 12 SAEs reported) and 
5 patients (8%) experienced at least one SAE related to adalimumab (6 related SAEs with the 
preferred terms: CD, colitis ulcerative, ileal ulcer, drug-induced liver injury, malnutrition, and 
arthralgia).
12
Five AEs reported in 5 patients (8%) led to treatment discontinuation. Among these 5 AEs, 4 events 
were assessed as related to adalimumab (CD, drug-induced liver injury, malnutrition, and arthralgia).
One patient (2%) experienced one serious AESI related to adalimumab (probable drug-induced 
hepatitis) that led to treatment discontinuation. Narrative was provided and based on the information 
provided, causality with Humira is considered likely. Liver failure is described in the SmPC and this 
does not constitute any new safety signal. The risk for liver injury is captured in the ongoing registry 
study on paediatric CD, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (P11-292). This observational 10-year 
study aims to enrol approximately 800 paediatric patients with moderately to severely active CD 
treated with Humira and approximately 500 patients treated with non-biologic immunomodulating 
therapy. Interim reports are provided every second year, with final report due in 2028. One of the 
AESIs to be studied is “hepatic events: liver enzyme abnormalities, liver failure and other liver events, 
reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis”. In the latest MEA (080.6) in October 2018, only 
1 case in the control group reported an event of hepatitis. To conclude, although this case is of concern 
it does not constitute a new safety signal for Humira, and the risk is continuously followed through 
additional PhV activities.
No malignancy or fatal AE was reported.
To conclude, the study provided some interesting efficacy and safety data, but the initial purpose could 
not be fulfilled due to recruiting difficulties.
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation
Although the initial aim of the study could not be fulfilled due to recruiting difficulties, the study 
includes some interesting data on the disease characteristics in paediatric patients treated with 
Humira, as well as some efficacy outcomes confirming the efficacy of Humira in the current population. 
More importantly, there are also some, although limited, safety data. Among these are one case of 
drug-induced hepatitis where causality with Humira is considered likely. This is a known safety issue 
with Humira treatment and it does not constitute any new safety signal. The risk for hepatic events in 
paediatric CD patients is continuously followed through a registry study listed in the RMP. No further 
actions are currently needed.
  Fulfilled:
No regulatory action required.

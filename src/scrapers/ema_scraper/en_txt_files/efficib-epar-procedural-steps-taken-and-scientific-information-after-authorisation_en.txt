For patients with moderate renal impairment and a GFR of

Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order 
to modify the information on dosing, and 
administration instructions respectively for use of 
sitagliptin/metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and moderate renal impairment.  
Consequently, the RMP version 8 has also been 
updated accordingly. Section 4.5 of the SmPC is also 
updated to extend the existing warning on the 
concomitant use of metformin with cimetidine to 
other medicines potentially interfering the renal 
excretion of metformin, such as ranolazine, 
vandetanib and dolutegravir. In addition, the 
Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet for Efficib and to bring the Product

45-49 mL/min, the maximum sitagliptin daily dose of 100

mg can be used.  For detailed posology recommendations 
please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
A single dose, open label study was conducted to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of sitagliptin (50 
mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal 
impairment compared to normal healthy control subjects. 
The study included patients with mild, moderate, and 
severe renal impairment, as well as patients with ESRD on 
haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal impairment 
on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 
diabetes and mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment 
(including ESRD) were assessed using population 
pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC 
of sitagliptin was increased by approximately 1.2-fold and 
1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR ≥ 60 
to < 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal 
impairment (GFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively.

Because increases of this magnitude are not clinically 
relevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is not 
necessary. AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 
2 foldin patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 
30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4 fold in patients 
with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), 
including patients with ESRD on haemodialysis.  
Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal 
tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination 
of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / 
multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as 
ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could 
increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase 
the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks 
of concomitant use. Close monitoring of glycaemic control, 
dose adjustment within the recommended posology and 
changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when 
such products are co administered.

was ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7,339) 
added to usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c 
and CV risk factors. The study population included 2,004 
patients ≥ 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal 
impairment (eGFR= 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Over the course of the study, the overall estimated mean 
(SD) difference in HbA1c between the sitagliptin and 
placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); 
p < 0.001. After a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, 
when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of 
hospitalization for heart failure compared to usual care 
without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The 
overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients 
receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in patients receiving 
placebo.

patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without 
metformin) and 36.8 % in patients treated with placebo 
and insulin (with or without metformin).The difference was 
mainly due to a higher percentage of patients in the

glycaemic control on dual combination therapy with 
metformin and pioglitazone, the addition of sitagliptin 100 
mg provided a statistically significant lowering in HbA1c, 
compared to placebo at Week 26: difference in mean 
change -0.75 (95% CI -0.95, -0.54) (FAS/LOCF). Analyses 
of change from baseline in HbA1c for Completers only were 
in line with the analysis of the FAS/LOCF (-0.60 [-0.80; -
0.39]). 
With regards to fasting plasma glucose, the addition of 
sitagliptin was statistically significantly greater to the 
addition of placebo in lowering FPG at Week 26 (sitagliptin -
21.6 mg/dL vs. placebo -1.5. mg/dL; difference -20.3 [CI-
27.0, -13.6]). The profile over time for this group showed a 
reduction in FPG levels within the first 6 weeks of treatment 
with sitagliptin; and generally stable FPG was observed 
over the remaining double blind treatment period with only 
a minor trend towards baseline between Weeks 12-26.  
Body weight was increased in both treatment groups: 1.3 
kg in the sitagliptin group vs. 1.1 kg in the placebo group. 
The difference was not statistically significant. 
In this 26-week, there was a numerically higher incidence 
of adverse events in patients treated with sitagliptin in 
combination with pioglitazone and metformin; however, the 
95% CI for the between-group difference included 0. The 
incidences of drug-related adverse events and serious 
adverse events were numerically lower in the sitagliptin 
group relative to the placebo. In addition, the proportion of 
patients who discontinued from study drug due to adverse 
events was numerically lower in the sitagliptin group 
relative to the placebo group. Some specific adverse events 
occurred at a slightly higher incidence in the sitagliptin 
group relative to the placebo group. The adverse events 
Page 26/40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were generally mild to moderate in intensity and did not 
lead to discontinuation of study drug.  
There was a low incidence of hypoglycaemia with no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences 
between groups; this is reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. The few events reported in the sitagliptin group 
were mild, none required assistance for treatment, and 
none caused interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Numerically lower incidences of peripheral oedema were 
reported in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. 
The table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been 
updated to reflect the results of study P128. The adverse 
drug reactions associated with the combination of 
sitagliptin and rosiglitazone which were previously included 
in the SmPC have been deleted. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has also been updated to reflect 
the results of study P128, and results of the study of 
sitagliptin in combination with rosiglitazone have been 
deleted.

these adverse events of back pain were non-serious. Based 
on the accumulation of reports of back pain, including 18 
serious reports, 42 positive dechalleges and 7 positive 
rechallenges, an association between back pain and use of 
sitagliptin and sitagliptin/metformin FDC cannot be 
excluded. In 42 cases the time to onset was reported, and 
in 28 (67%) of these cases time to onset (TTO) was <30 
days. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that this event should be 
added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for both sitagliptin and 
sitagliptin/metformin fixed-dose combination (FDC) as a 
postmarketing adverse event. 
The MAH has received 156 postmarketing reports of “pain 
in extremity”, in patients treated with sitagliptin (125 
reports) or sitagliptin/metformin FDC (31 reports). The 
majority of these adverse events of pain in extremity were 
non-serious in nature. Based on the accumulated reports of 
pain in extremity, including 33 serious reports, and 11 
positive rechallenges, an association between pain in 
extremity and use of sitagliptin and sitagliptin/metformin 
FDC cannot be excluded. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that 
this event should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for 
both sitagliptin and sitagliptin/metformin fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) as a postmarketing adverse event.

section 5.2 of the SmPC. This deletion is proposed for 
consistency with the current SmPC for sitagliptin. The 
corresponding text was deleted from the SmPC for 
sitagliptin during variation WS-0179, which resulted in 
approval for use of lower doses of sitagliptin in patients 
with moderate or severe renal impairment or End Stage 
Renal Disease (ESRD). 
Other revisions made to sections 4.2, 4,4 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC for sitagliptin during WS-0179 do not apply to 
sitagliptin/metformin FDC, because the FDC remains 
contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment as the use of metformin is contraindicated in 
patients with these disorders. Therefore only section 5.2 
has been revised in the SmPC for FDC. This was accepted 
by the CHMP.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
This type II variation was submitted following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a CHMP request based on the assessment 
of PSUR 4 for Janumet and PSUR 7-8 of Januvia, the 
Product Information (Summary of Product 
Characteristics section 4.8 and Package Leaflet 
section 4) is updated by adding arthralgia and 
myalgia as adverse drug reactions. Furthermore 
section 4.8 is re-structured in order to improve 
readability. In addition, MAH took opportunity to 
update Annex IIB "Other conditions" with the latest 
wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcement 
regarding the Pharmacovigilance system and to 
update section 6 of the Package Leaflet with local 
representatives for Sweden and The Netherlands. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
II and PL 
of Januvia the MAH reported number of cases of positive 
de- and rechallenges that were indicative of a causal 
relation for arthralgia and myalgia. Following the review of 
the PSUR 7-8 the CHMP requested to include arthralgia and 
myalgia as adverse drug reactions reported during post-
marketing period. Subsequently MAH applied to update 
Product Information (Summary of Product Characteristics 
section 4.8 and Package Leaflet section 4) by adding 
arthralgia and myalgia as adverse drug reactions. 
Furthermore, following the CHMP request, MAH applied to 
re-structure section 4.8 and present the adverse reactions 
identified from clinical studies and from post-marketing 
experience in one table with reduced footnotes in order to 
present clearer safety information. In addition, MAH took 
opportunity to update Annex IIB "Other conditions" with 
the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP 
announcement regarding the Pharmacovigilance system 
and to update section 6 of the Package Leaflet with local 
representatives for Sweden and The Netherlands.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
In clinical trials the number of pancreatitis cases is very 
low. However, since market introduction, 108 cases of 
(acute) pancreatitis were reported. For 38 of the cases, the 
lack of information did not allow full assessment. Two 
fatalities were reported, but the cases are confounded by 
several serious co-morbidities and concomitantly used 
medication. Based on the provided data, a causal relation 
between the use of sitagliptin and the occurrence of 
pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the inclusion of 
pancreatitis to section 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) is acceptable.  
A total of 15 cases of cutaneous vasculitis were reported 
spontaneously and in clinical trials.  
In the majority of these cases, patients were suffering from 
multiple co-morbidities and using many drugs 
concomitantly. Taking into account the fact that 
hypersensitivity reactions are known for sitagliptin-
containing products (labeled in the current SPC) and the 
positive de- and rechallenge in an extensively documented 
case report, a causal relation between the use of sitagliptin 
and the occurrence of vasculitis is considered to be likely. 
The addition of cutaneous vasculitis to section 4.8 is 
therefore acceptable.

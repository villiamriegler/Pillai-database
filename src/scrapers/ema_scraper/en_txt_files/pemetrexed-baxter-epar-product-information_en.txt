4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Pemetrexed Baxter must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use 
of anti-cancer chemotherapy. 
Posology 
Pemetrexed Baxter in combination with cisplatin 
The recommended dose of Pemetrexed Baxter is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered 
as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. The recommended 
dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion 
of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients must receive adequate anti-
emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin 
Summary of Product Characteristics for specific dosing advice). 
Pemetrexed Baxter as single agent 
In patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of 
Pemetrexed Baxter is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the 
first day of each 21-day cycle. 
Pre-medication regimen 
To reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior 
to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent 
to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). 
To reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see 
section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 
1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven 
days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of 
therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular 
injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and 
once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as 
pemetrexed. 
Monitoring 
Patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, 
including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy 
administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before 
the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) should be ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. 
Creatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min. 
The total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times 
upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal is 
acceptable if liver has tumour involvement. 
Dose adjustments 
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or 
maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed 
to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines 
in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for Pemetrexed Baxter used as a single agent or in 
combination with cisplatin.

Special populations 
Elderly 
In clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased 
risk of adverse reaction compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions other than 
those recommended for all patients are necessary.

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Pemetrexed Baxter in the paediatric population in malignant pleural 
mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. 
Patients with renal impairment (standard cockcroft and gault formula or glomerular filtration rate 
measured Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method) 
Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with 
creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for 
all patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance 
below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed 
pharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin > 1.5 
times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic 
metastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been 
specifically studied. 
Method of administration 
Pemetrexed Baxter is for intravenous use. Pemetrexed Baxter should be administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. 
For precautions to be taken before handling or administering Pemetrexed Baxter and for instructions 
on reconstitution and dilution of Pemetrexed Baxter before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Concomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
anaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. 
Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be 
given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count 
returns to ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, 
platelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). 
Less toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when 
pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated with 
pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce 
treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). 
Skin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with 
dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see section 
4.2). 
An insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. 
Therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min is not 
recommended (see section 4.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should 
avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic 
acid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration 
(see section 4.5). 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with 
long elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 
2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). 
Serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in 
association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had 
underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing 
hypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis were also reported 
in post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Most of these 
events resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients should be regularly monitored for acute tubular 
necrosis, decreased renal function and signs and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. 
hypernatraemia). 
The effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. 
A phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid demonstrated 
no difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients 
without third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed 
treatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. 
Due to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe 
dehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and 
appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. 
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been 
uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination 
with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had pre-
existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). 
Immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated 
vaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). 
Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a 
child during the treatment and up to 3 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are 
recommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men 
are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed 
and for 6 months following completion of treatment (see section 4.6). 
Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, 
during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients 
and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. 
Cases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years 
previously.

recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by 
glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic substances (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of 
pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine clearance should 
be closely monitored. 
Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) 
could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these 
substances are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely 
monitored. 
In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid at 
higher dose (> 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the 
occurrence of pemetrexed adverse reactions. Therefore, caution should be made when administering 
higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal 
function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the 
concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid at 
higher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed 
administration (see section 4.4). 
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such as 
piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild to 
moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at 
least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant administration of 
NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression 
and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver 
microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition 
of the metabolic clearance of substances metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. 
Interactions common to all cytotoxics 
Due to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is 
frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the 
possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased 
frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with 
oral anticoagulants. 
Concomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see 
section 4.3). 
Concomitant use not recommended: Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which 
concomitant use is contraindicated): risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in 
subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine 
where it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Women of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed and for 6 months following completion of 
treatment.  
Sexually mature males are advised to use effective contraceptive measures and not to father a child 
during the treatment and up to 3 months thereafter. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other anti-
metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Animal 
studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed should not be used during 
pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the 
risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the breast-
feeding child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed therapy 
(see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to 
seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, it 
has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore patients should be cautioned against 
driving or operating machines if this event occurs. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy 
or in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
constipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other undesirable effects include renal toxicities, 
increased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. 
Rarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table 4 lists the adverse events regardless of causality associated with pemetrexed used either as a 
monotherapy treatment or in combination with cisplatin from the pivotal registration studies (JMCH, 
JMEI, JMBD, JMEN and PARAMOUNT) and from the post marketing period. 
ADRs are listed by MedDRA body system organ class. The following convention has been used for 
classification of frequency: very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 
to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, sensory 
polyneuropathy and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as 
manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without 
fever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be 
monitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium 
folinate / folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed overdose should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial 
folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of 
thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate 
carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly 
and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The 
polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 
Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a 
lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life 
resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population in the granted indications (see Section 4.2).

Clinical efficacy 
Mesothelioma 
EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
versus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients 
treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival 
advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone. 
During the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patients’ 
therapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all

A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) 
associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm (212 patients) versus 
the cisplatin arm alone (218 patients) was demonstrated using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale. 
Statistically significant differences in pulmonary function tests were also observed. The separation 
between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the pemetrexed/cisplatin 
arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. 
There are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed alone. 
Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive patients with 
malignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. 
NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), second-line treatment 
A multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of 
8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (Intent To Treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy did not include pemetrexed. An 
analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favour of 
pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n = 399, 9.3 versus 
8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for 
squamous cell carcinoma histology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 
1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of 
pemetrexed within the histology subgroups. 
Limited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data 
(overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously 
pretreated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment 
(n = 540).

NSCLC, first-line treatment 
A multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine 
plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC 
showed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin (Intent-To-Treat [ITT] population n = 862) met its primary 
endpoint and showed similar clinical efficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin (ITT n = 863) in overall 
survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients included in this study had an 
ECOG performance status 0 or 1. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy 
endpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using 
PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority 
of AC versus GC. 
Progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: 
median PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% (95% 
CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) for gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review (400/1725 patients were 
randomly selected for review). 
The analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant 
differences in survival according to histology, see table below.

a Statistically significant for noninferiority, with the entire confidence interval for HR well below 
the 1.17645 noninferiority margin (p <0.001). 
There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin within the histology subgroups. 
Patients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus 28.9%, 
p<0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p<0.001) and platelet transfusions (1.8% 
versus 4.5%, p=0.002). Patients also required lower administration of erythropoietin/darbopoietin 
(10.4% versus 18.1%, p<0.001), G-CSF/GM-CSF (3.1% versus 6.1%, p=0.004), and iron 
preparations (4.3% versus 7.0%, p=0.021). 
NSCLC, maintenance treatment 
JMEN 
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (JMEN), compared the 
efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 
441) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 222) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or 
metastatic (Stage IV) (NSCLC) who did not progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy 
containing Cisplatin or Carboplatin in combination with Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, or Docetaxel. First 
line doublet therapy containing pemetrexed was not included. All patients included in this study had 
an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease 
progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with 
pemetrexed and 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total 
of 103 patients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. 
The study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of 4.0 
months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The 
independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. The 
median OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.6 
months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01192). 
Consistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was 
observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 
430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and 1.8 
months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The median OS 
for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 
months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% CI = 
0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other 
than predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the pemetrexed arm and 13.6 months 
for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). 
The PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for 
pemetrexed over placebo. 
There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed within the 
histology subgroups.

PARAMOUNT 
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (PARAMOUNT), 
compared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus BSC (n 
= 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or 
metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress 
after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 
patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to 
maintenance treatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a 
complete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
induction. Patients randomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance 
status 0 or 1. The median time from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start 
of maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. 
Randomised patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. 
Patients received a median of 4 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 4 cycles of 
placebo. A total of 169 patients (47.1%) completed ≥ 6 cycles maintenance treatment with 
pemetrexed, representing at least 10 total cycles of pemetrexed. 
The study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median of 3.9 
months and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = 0.0002). The 
independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For 
randomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction 
treatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the pemetrexed arm and 5.6 
months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = 0.47-0.74). 
Following pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was statistically 
superior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 
95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of patients were alive 
or lost to follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm. The relative treatment 
effect of pemetrexed was internally consistent across subgroups (including disease stage, induction 
response, ECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the 
unadjusted OS and PFS analyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 
58% and 32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo. From the start of 
pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for 
the pemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96). 
The percentage of patients that received post study treatment was 64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% 
for placebo. 
PARAMOUNT: Kaplan Meier plot of PFS and OS for continuation pemetrexed maintenance 
versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology 
(measured from randomisation) 
The pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were 
similar. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been 
evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to 
838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 
9 l/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. 
Binding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes 
limited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the 
administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 (organic anion 
transporter). Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from 
plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). 
Between patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics 
of pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered 
cisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal 
weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. 
Administration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced 
fertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous bolus injection 
for 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been 
observed. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not 
investigated. 
Pemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo 
micronucleus test in the mouse. 
Studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted.

administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. 
5.  Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyolefin lined 
administration sets and infusion bags. 
6.  Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration 
prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. 
7.  Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material 
must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Preparation and administration precautions 
As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and 
preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed 
solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If 
pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few 
reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. 
Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pemetrexed Baxter is and what it is used for 
Pemetrexed Baxter is a medicine used in the treatment of cancer. 
Pemetrexed Baxter is given in combination with cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine, as treatment 
for malignant pleural mesothelioma, a form of cancer that affects the lining of the lung, to patients 
who have not received prior chemotherapy. 
Pemetrexed Baxter is also given in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with 
advanced stage of lung cancer. 
Pemetrexed Baxter can be prescribed to you if you have lung cancer at an advanced stage if your 
disease has responded to treatment or it remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy. 
Pemetrexed Baxter is also a treatment for patients with advanced stage of lung cancer whose disease 
has progressed after other initial chemotherapy has been used. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Pemetrexed Baxter

Talk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist before receiving Pemetrexed Baxter. 
If you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive Pemetrexed Baxter. 
Before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive Pemetrexed Baxter. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition 
and if your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make 
sure that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving 
cisplatin to prevent vomiting. 
If you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early 
or late radiation reaction with Pemetrexed Baxter. 
If you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects 
with Pemetrexed Baxter. 
If you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. 
If you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid 
before giving you Pemetrexed Baxter. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this 
medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Pemetrexed Baxter 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as 
medicines called “non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased 
without a doctor’s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different 
durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of Pemetrexed Baxter and/or on the 
status of your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and 
when you can take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are 
NSAIDs. 
Please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The 
use of Pemetrexed Baxter should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the 
potential risk of taking Pemetrexed Baxter during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception 
during treatment with Pemetrexed Baxter and for 6 months after receiving the last dose. 
Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. 
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with Pemetrexed Baxter. 
Fertility 
Men are advised not to father a child during and up to 3 months following treatment with Pemetrexed 
Baxter and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with Pemetrexed Baxter and 
for up to 3 months afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 3 
months following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. Pemetrexed 
Baxter can affect your ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about sperm storage 
before starting your therapy.

Pemetrexed Baxter 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

3. 
How to use Pemetrexed Baxter 
The dose of Pemetrexed Baxter is 500 milligrams for every square metre of your body’s surface area. 
Your height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will use 
this body surface area to work out the right dose for you. This dose may be adjusted, or treatment may 
be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital pharmacist, 
nurse or doctor will have mixed the Pemetrexed Baxter powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride 
solution for injection before it is given to you. 
You will always receive Pemetrexed Baxter by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last 
approximately 10 minutes. 
When using Pemetrexed Baxter in combination with cisplatin: 
The doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. 
Cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after 
the infusion of Pemetrexed Baxter has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 
hours. 
You should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. 
Additional medicines: 
Corticosteroids: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of 
dexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day 
after Pemetrexed Baxter treatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity 
of skin reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. 
Vitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin 
containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking 
Pemetrexed Baxter. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of 
Pemetrexed Baxter. You must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of 
Pemetrexed Baxter. You will also receive an injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week 
before administration of Pemetrexed Baxter and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 
3 courses of Pemetrexed Baxter treatment). Vitamin B12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the 
possible toxic effects of the anticancer treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Use aseptic techniques during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for 
intravenous infusion administration. 
Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Baxter vials needed. Each vial contains an 
excess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of the label amount. 
Pemetrexed Baxter 100 mg: 
Reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for 
injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. 
Pemetrexed Baxter 500 mg: 
Reconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for 
injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. 
Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear 
and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting 
product quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is 
required. 
The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml 
with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection, without preservative, and 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. 
Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyolefin lined 
administration sets and infusion bags. Pemetrexed is incompatible with diluents containing 
calcium, including lactated Ringer’s Injection and Ringer’s Injection. 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. 
Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused product or waste material should be 
disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Preparation and administration precautions: As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, 
care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use 
of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately 
and thoroughly with soap and water. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush 
thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not a vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for 
extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been a few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, 
which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. Extravasation should be managed by local 
standard practice as with other non-vesicants.

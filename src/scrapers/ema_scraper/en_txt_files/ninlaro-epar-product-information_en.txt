Product Characteristics (SmPC) for these medicinal products. 
Prior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: 
•  
• 
• 
Absolute neutrophil count should be ≥ 1 000/mm3 
Platelet count should be ≥ 75 000/mm3 
Non-haematologic toxicities should, at the physician’s discretion, generally be recovered to 
patient’s baseline condition or ≤ Grade 1 
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with 
ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 24 cycles should be 
based on an individual benefit risk assessment, as the data on the tolerability and toxicity beyond 
24 cycles are limited (see section 5.1). 
Delayed or missed doses  
In the event that a ixazomib dose is delayed or missed, the dose should be taken only if the next 
scheduled dose is ≥ 72 hours away. A missed dose should not be taken within 72 hours of the next 
scheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  
If a patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing 
at the time of the next scheduled dose. 
Dose modifications 
The ixazomib dose reduction steps are presented in Table 1 and the dose modification guidelines are 
provided in Table 2.

An alternating dose modification approach is recommended for ixazomib and lenalidomide for 
overlapping toxicities of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and rash. For these toxicities, the first dose 
modification step is to withhold/reduce lenalidomide. Refer to the lenalidomide SmPC, section 4.2 for 
the dose reduction steps for these toxicities.

†Grading based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) Version 4.03 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with ixazomib to decrease the risk 
of herpes zoster reactivation. Patients included in studies with ixazomib who received antiviral 
prophylaxis had a lower incidence of herpes zoster infection compared to patients who did not receive 
prophylaxis. 
Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with ixazomib in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and should be based on an assessment of the patient’s underlying 
risks and clinical status.  
For other concomitant medicinal products that may be required, refer to the current lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone SmPC. 
Special patient populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients over 65 years of age.  
Discontinuations in patients > 75 years of age were reported in 13 patients (28%) in the ixazomib 
regimen and 10 patients (16%) in the placebo regimen. Cardiac arrhythmias in patients > 75 years of 
age were observed in 10 patients (21%) in the ixazomib regimen and 9 patients (15%) in the placebo 
regimen.  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or total bilirubin 
> 1-1.5 x ULN and any AST). The reduced dose of 3 mg is recommended in patients with moderate 
(total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN) hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min). The reduced dose of 3 mg is recommended in patients with severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring 
dialysis. Ixazomib is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of 
dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Refer to the lenalidomide SmPC for dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ixazomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
Ixazomib is for oral use. 
Ixazomib should be taken at approximately the same time on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each treatment cycle 
at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food (see section 5.2). The capsule should be swallowed 
whole with water. It should not be crushed, chewed, or opened (see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
As ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC 
for these medicinal products for additional contraindications. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
As ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC 
for these medicinal products for additional special warnings and precautions for use. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8) with platelet nadirs typically 
occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next 
cycle (see section 4.8). 
Platelet counts should be monitored at least monthly during ixazomib treatment. More frequent 
monitoring should be considered during the first three cycles as per the lenalidomide SmPC. 
Thrombocytopenia can be managed with dose modifications (see section 4.2) and platelet transfusions 
as per standard medical guidelines. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
Diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting have been reported with ixazomib, occasionally 
requiring use of antiemetic and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products and supportive care (see 
section 4.8). The dose should be adjusted for severe (Grade 3-4) symptoms (see section 4.2). In case of 
severe gastrointestinal events, monitoring of serum potassium level is recommended. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). The patient should be 
monitored for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral 
neuropathy may require dose modification (see section 4.2). 
Peripheral oedema 
Peripheral oedema has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). The patient should be evaluated 
for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. The dose of dexamethasone should be 
adjusted per its prescribing information or ixazomib for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (see section 4.2).

Cutaneous reactions 
Rash has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). Rash should be managed with supportive care 
or with dose modification if Grade 2 or higher (see section 4.2). Stevens-Johnson syndrome has also 
been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). If Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurs, discontinue 
ixazomib. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), 
have been reported in patients who received ixazomib. Some of these events have been fatal. Signs 
and symptoms of TMA should be monitored for. If the diagnosis is suspected, stop ixazomib and 
evaluate patients for possible TMA. If the diagnosis of TMA is excluded, ixazomib can be restarted. 
The safety of reinitiating ixazomib therapy in patients previously experiencing TMA is not known. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis cholestatic and 
hepatotoxicity have been uncommonly reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). Hepatic enzymes 
should be monitored regularly and the dose should be adjusted for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (see 
section 4.2). 
Pregnancy 
Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with ixazomib. If ixazomib is used 
during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking ixazomib, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking ixazomib and 
for 90 days after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). Women using hormonal contraceptives 
should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has occurred in patients receiving ixazomib. 
PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with seizure, hypertension, 
headache, altered consciousness, and visual disturbances. Brain imaging, preferably Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging, is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing PRES, discontinue 
ixazomib. 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
Strong inducers may reduce the efficacy of ixazomib, therefore the concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), 
should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). Closely monitor patients for disease control if 
co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
CYP inhibitors 
Co-administration of ixazomib with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not result in a 
clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib. Ixazomib Cmax was decreased by 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4% and AUC was increased by 11%. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with 
co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors. 
Co-administration of ixazomib with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not result in a clinically meaningful 
change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib based on the results of a population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with co-administration of 
strong CYP1A2 inhibitors. 
CYP inducers 
Co-administration of ixazomib with rifampicin decreased ixazomib Cmax by 54% and AUC by 74%. 
Therefore, co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib is not recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Effect of ixazomib on other medicinal products 
Ixazomib is not a reversible or a time-dependent inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
or 3A4/5. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity or corresponding 
immunoreactive protein levels. Ixazomib is not expected to produce drug-drug interactions via 
CYP inhibition or induction. 
Transporter-based interactions 
Ixazomib is a low affinity substrate of P-gp. Ixazomib is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 or hepatic 
OATPs. Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, 
OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2-K. Ixazomib is not expected to cause transporter-mediated drug-drug 
interactions. 
Oral contraceptives 
When ixazomib is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy 
of oral contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal contraceptives should 
additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
As ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC 
for these medicinal products for additional information on fertility, pregnancy and lactation. 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Male and female patients who are able to have children must use effective contraceptive measures 
during and for 90 days following treatment. Ixazomib is not recommended in women of childbearing 
potential not using contraception. 
When ixazomib is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy 
of oral contraceptives needs to be considered. Therefore, women using oral hormonal contraceptives 
should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
Ixazomib is not recommended during pregnancy as it can cause foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Therefore, women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with 
ixazomib. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data for the use of ixazomib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Ixazomib is given in combination with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is structurally related to 
thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe 
life-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect in humans 
is expected. The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme for lenalidomide must be fulfilled 
for all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. 
Please refer to the current lenalidomide SmPC. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ixazomib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No animal data are 
available. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and therefore breast-feeding should be 
discontinued. 
Ixazomib will be given in combination with lenalidomide and breast-feeding should be stopped 
because of the use of lenalidomide. 
Fertility 
Fertility studies have not been conducted with ixazomib (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ixazomib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Fatigue and dizziness have been 
observed in clinical trials. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines if they 
experience any of these symptoms. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
As ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC 
for these medicinal products for additional undesirable effects. 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of NINLARO is based on available clinical trial data and post-marketing experience 
to date. Frequencies of adverse reactions described below and in Table 3 have been determined based 
on data generated from clinical studies. 
Unless otherwise noted, the data presented below is the pooled safety data from the pivotal, Phase 3, 
global C16010 study (n = 720) and the double-blind, placebo-controlled C16010 China Continuation 
Study (n = 115). The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) across 418 patients treated 
within the ixazomib regimen and 417 patients within the placebo regimen were diarrhoea (47% vs. 
38%), thrombocytopenia (41% vs. 24%), neutropenia (37% vs. 36%), constipation (31% vs. 24%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (28% vs. 24%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 22%), nausea (28% 
vs. 20%), back pain (25% vs. 21%), rash (25% vs. 15%), peripheral oedema (24% vs. 19%), vomiting 
(23% vs. 12%) and bronchitis (20% vs. 15%). Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients 
included diarrhoea (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%) and bronchitis (2%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following convention is used for the classification of the frequency of an adverse drug reaction 
(ADR): very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent

Thrombocytopenia 
Two percent of patients in both the ixazomib regimen and the placebo regimen had a platelet count 
≤ 10 000/mm3 during treatment. Less than 1% of patients in both regimens had a platelet count 
≤ 5 000/mm3 during treatment. Thrombocytopenia resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the 
three medicinal products in 2% of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 3% of patients in the placebo 
regimen. Thrombocytopenia did not result in an increase in haemorrhagic events or platelet 
transfusions. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
Diarrhoea resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal products in 2% of patients 
in the ixazomib regimen and 1% of patients in the placebo regimen. 
Rash 
Rash occurred in 25% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 15% of patients in the placebo 
regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular 
rash. Grade 3 rash was reported in 3% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 2% of patients 
in the placebo regimen. Rash resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal 
products in < 1% of patients in both regimens. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 28% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 22% of 
patients in the placebo regimen. Grade 3 adverse reactions of peripheral neuropathy were reported in 
2% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 1% in the placebo regimen. The most commonly 
reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (21% and 15% in the ixazomib and placebo 
regimen, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen 
(< 1%). Peripheral neuropathy resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal 
products in 3% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to < 1% of patients in the placebo 
regimen. 
Eye disorders  
Eye disorders were reported with many different preferred terms but in aggregate, the frequency was 
34% in patients in the ixazomib regimen and 28% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most 
common adverse reactions were blurred vision (6% in the ixazomib regimen and 5% in the placebo 
regimen), dry eye (6% in the ixazomib regimen and 1% in the placebo regimen), conjunctivitis (8% in 
the ixazomib regimen and 2% in the placebo regimen) and cataract (13% in the ixazomib regimen and 
17% in the placebo regimen). Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported in 6% of patients in the 
ixazomib regimen and 8% of patients in the placebo regimen. 
Other adverse reactions 
In the pooled dataset from the pivotal, Phase 3, global C16010 study (n = 720) and the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, C16010 China Continuation Study (n = 115), the following adverse reactions 
occurred with a similar rate between the ixazomib and placebo regimens: fatigue (28% vs. 26%), 
decreased appetite (13% vs. 11%), hypotension (5% vs. 4%), heart failure† (5% each), arrhythmia† 
(17% vs. 16%), and liver impairment including enzyme changes† (11% vs. 9%). 
The frequency of severe (Grade 3-4) events of hypokalaemia was higher in the ixazomib regimen 
(7%) than the placebo regimen (2%).  
Fungal and viral pneumonia resulting in fatal outcome were rarely reported in patients given the 
ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination.

Overdose has been reported in patients taking NINLARO. Symptoms of overdose are generally 
consistent with the known risks of NINLARO (see section 4.8). Overdose of 12 mg (taken at one time) 
has resulted in serious adverse events, such as severe nausea, aspiration pneumonia, multiple organ 
failure and death. 
There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, monitor the 
patient closely for adverse reactions (see section 4.8) and provide appropriate supportive care. 
Ixazomib is not dialyzable (see section 5.2). 
Overdoses were most common in patients starting treatment with NINLARO. The importance of 
carefully following all dosage instructions should be discussed with patients starting treatment. 
Instruct patients to take the recommended dosage as directed because overdose has led to deaths.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XG03. 
Mechanism of action 
Ixazomib citrate, a prodrug, is a substance that rapidly hydrolyses under physiological conditions to its 
biologically active form, ixazomib.  
Ixazomib is an oral, highly selective and reversible proteasome inhibitor. Ixazomib preferentially 
binds and inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome.  
Ixazomib induced apoptosis of several tumour cell types in vitro. Ixazomib demonstrated in vitro 
cytotoxicity against myeloma cells from patients who had relapsed after multiple prior therapies, 
including bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. The combination of ixazomib and 
lenalidomide demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma cell lines. In vivo, 
ixazomib demonstrated antitumour activity in various tumour xenograft models, including models of 
multiple myeloma. In vitro, ixazomib affected cell types found in the bone marrow microenvironment 
including vascular endothelial cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Ixazomib did not prolong the QTc interval at clinically relevant exposures based on the results of a 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of data from 245 patients. At the 4 mg dose, mean 
change from baseline in QTcF was estimated to be 0.07 msec (90% CI; -0.22, 0.36) from the model 
based analysis. There was no discernible relationship between ixazomib concentration and the RR 
interval suggesting no clinically meaningful effect of ixazomib on heart rate.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was 
evaluated in an international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 
superiority study (C16010) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had 
received at least one prior therapy. A total of 722 patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone (N = 360; ixazomib regimen) or placebo, lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
(N = 362; placebo regimen) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients enrolled in the 
trial had multiple myeloma that was refractory, including primary refractory, had relapsed after prior 
therapy, or had relapsed and was refractory to any prior therapy. Patients that changed therapies prior 
to disease progression were eligible for enrolment, as well as those with controlled cardiovascular 
conditions. The Phase 3 study excluded patients who were refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome 
inhibitors and patients who received more than three prior therapies. For the purposes of this study, 
refractory disease was defined as disease progression on treatment or progression within 60 days after 
the last dose of lenalidomide or a proteasome inhibitor. As data are limited in these patients, a careful 
risk-benefit assessment is recommended before initiating the ixazomib regimen. 
Thromboprophylaxis was recommended for all patients in both treatment groups according to the 
lenalidomide SmPC. Concomitant medicinal products, such as antiemetic, antiviral, and antihistamine 
medicinal products were given to patients at the physician's discretion as prophylaxis and/or 
management of symptoms.  
Patients received ixazomib 4 mg or placebo on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 
through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients with renal 
impairment received a starting dose of lenalidomide according to its SmPC. Treatment continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the 
study regimens. The median age was 66 years, range 38-91 years; 58% of patients were older than 
65 years. Fifty seven percent of patients were male. Eighty five percent of the population was White, 
9% Asian and 2% Black. Ninety three percent of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 and 
12% had baseline ISS stage III disease (N = 90). Twenty five percent of patients had a creatinine 
clearance of < 60 mL/min. Twenty three percent of patients had light chain disease and 12% of 
patients had measurable disease by free light chain assay only. Nineteen percent had high-risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities (del[17], t[4;14], t[14;16]) (N = 137), 10% had del(17) (N = 69) and 34% 
had 1q amplification (1q21) (N = 247). Patients received one to three prior therapies (median of 1) 
including prior treatment with bortezomib (69%), carfilzomib (< 1%), thalidomide (45%), 
lenalidomide (12%), melphalan (81%). Fifty seven percent of patients had undergone prior stem cell 
transplantation. Seventy seven percent of patients relapsed after prior therapies and 11% were 
refractory to prior therapies. Primary refractory, defined as best response of stable disease or disease 
progression on all prior therapies, was documented in 6% of patients. 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to the 2011 International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Consensus Uniform Response Criteria as assessed by a blinded 
independent review committee (IRC) based on central laboratory results. Response was assessed every 
4 weeks until disease progression. At the primary analysis (median follow up of 14.7 months and a 
median of 13 cycles), PFS was statistically significantly different between the treatment arms. PFS 
results are summarised in Table 4 and Figure 1. The improvement in PFS in the ixazomib regimen was 
supported by improvements in overall response rate.

(primary analysis) 
A second, non-inferential, PFS analysis was conducted with a median follow up of 23 months. At this 
analysis, estimated median PFS was 20 months in the ixazomib regimen and 15.9 months in the 
placebo regimen (HR = 0.82 [95% CI (0.67, 1.0)]) in the ITT population. For patients with one prior 
therapy, the median PFS was 18.7 months in the ixazomib regimen and 17.6 months in the placebo 
regimen (HR = 0.99). For patients with 2 or 3 prior therapies, PFS was 22.0 months in the ixazomib 
regimen and 13.0 months in the placebo regimen (HR = 0.62). 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
At the final analysis for OS at a median duration of follow up of approximately 85 months, median OS 
in the ITT population was 53.6 months for patients in the ixazomib regimen and 51.6 months for 
patients in the placebo regimen (HR = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.13; p = 0.495]). For patients with one 
prior therapy, the median OS was 54.3 months in the ixazomib regimen and 58.3 months in the 
placebo regimen (HR = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.80, 1.29]). For patients with 2 or 3 prior therapies, the median 
OS was 53.0 months in the ixazomib regimen and 43.0 months in the placebo regimen (HR = 0.85 
[95% CI: 0.64, 1.11]). 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study was conducted in China (N = 115) with 
a similar study design and eligibility criteria. Many of the patients enrolled in the study had advanced 
disease with Durie-Salmon Stage III (69%) at initial diagnosis and a treatment history of receiving at 
least 2 prior therapies (60%) and being thalidomide refractory (63%). At the primary analysis (median 
follow up of 8 months and a median of 6 cycles), the median PFS was 6.7 months in the ixazomib 
regimen compared to 4 months in the placebo regimen (p-value = 0.035, HR = 0.60). At the final 
analysis for OS at a median follow up of 19.8 months, OS was improved for patients treated in the 
ixazomib regimen compared with placebo [p-value = 0.0014, HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.242, 0.726 ]). 
As multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease, benefit may vary across subgroups in the Phase 3 
study (C16010) (see Figure 2).  
Figure 2: Forest plot of progression-free survival in subgroups 
In the Phase 3 study (C16010), 10 patients (5 in each treatment regimen) had severe renal impairment 
at baseline. Of the 5 patients in the ixazomib regimen, one patient had a confirmed partial response 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 3 confirmed stable disease (however 2 were unconfirmed partial response and 1 was an 
unconfirmed very good partial response). Of the 5 patients in the placebo regimen, 2 had a confirmed 
very good partial response. 
Quality of life as assessed by global health scores (EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY-20) was maintained 
during treatment and was similar in both treatment regimens in the Phase 3 study (C16010). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ixazomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of ixazomib were achieved at approximately 
one hour after dosing. The mean absolute oral bioavailability is 58%. Ixazomib AUC increases in a 
dose proportional manner over a dose range of 0.2-10.6 mg.  
Administration with a high-fat meal decreased ixazomib AUC by 28% compared with administration 
after an overnight fast (see section 4.2).  
Distribution 
Ixazomib is 99% bound to plasma proteins and distributes into red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma 
AUC ratio of 10. The steady-state volume of distribution is 543 L.  
Biotransformation 
After oral administration of a radiolabeled dose, 70% of total drug-related material in plasma was 
accounted for by ixazomib. Metabolism by multiple CYP enzymes and non-CYP proteins is expected 
to be the major clearance mechanism for ixazomib. At clinically relevant ixazomib concentrations, 
in vitro studies using human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes indicate that no specific 
CYP isozyme predominantly contributes to ixazomib metabolism and non-CYP proteins contribute to 
overall metabolism. At concentrations exceeding those observed clinically, ixazomib was metabolized 
by multiple CYP isoforms with estimated relative contributions of 3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 
2B6 (16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%) and 2C9 (< 1%). 
Elimination 
Ixazomib exhibits a multi-exponential disposition profile. Based on a population PK analysis, systemic 
clearance (CL) was approximately 1.86 L/hr with inter-individual variability of 44%. The terminal 
half-life (t1/2) of ixazomib was 9.5 days. Approximately 2-fold accumulation in AUC was observed 
with weekly oral dosing on Day 15. 
Excretion 
After administration of a single oral dose of 14C-ixazomib to 5 patients with advanced cancer, 62% of 
the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 22% in the faeces. Unchanged ixazomib 
accounted for < 3.5% of the administered dose recovered in urine. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1-1.5 x ULN and any 
AST) based on the results of a population PK analysis.  
The PK of ixazomib was characterized in patients with normal hepatic function at 4 mg (N = 12), 
moderate hepatic impairment at 2.3 mg (total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN, N = 13) or severe hepatic 
impairment at 1.5 mg (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, N = 18). Unbound dose-normalized AUC was 
27% higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min) based on the results of a population PK 
analysis.  
The PK of ixazomib was characterized at a dose of 3 mg in patients with normal renal function 
(creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min, N = 18), severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 30 mL/min, N = 14), or ESRD requiring dialysis (N = 6). Unbound AUC was 38% higher in patients 
with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal 
function. Pre- and post-dialyzer concentrations of ixazomib measured during the haemodialysis 
session were similar, suggesting that ixazomib is not dialyzable (see section 4.2).  
Age, gender, race 
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age (23-91 years), sex, body surface area (1.2-2.7 m2), or 
race on the clearance of ixazomib based on the results of a population PK analysis. The mean AUC 
was 35% higher in Asian patients; however, there was overlap in the AUC of ixazomib across White 
and Asian patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Mutagenicity 
Ixazomib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or clastogenic in a 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice. Ixazomib was positive in an in vitro clastogenicity test in 
human peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, ixazomib was negative in an in vivo comet assay in 
mice, in which percent tail DNA was assessed in the stomach and liver. Therefore, the weight of 
evidence indicates that ixazomib is not considered to present a genotoxic risk.  
Reproductive and embryo-foetal development 
Ixazomib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits only at maternally toxic doses and 
at exposures that were slightly higher than those observed in patients receiving the recommended 
dose. Studies of fertility and early embryonic development and pre- and post-natal toxicology were not 
conducted with ixazomib, but evaluation of reproductive tissues was conducted in the general toxicity 
studies. There were no effects due to ixazomib treatment on male or female reproductive organs in 
studies up to 6-months duration in rats and up to 9-months duration in dogs.  
Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology 
In multi-cycle repeated-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, the principal target organs 
included the gastrointestinal tract, lymphoid tissues, and the nervous system. In the 9-month study 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(10 cycles) in dogs orally administered with a dosing schedule mimicking the clinical regimen 
(28-day cycle), microscopic neuronal effects were generally minimal in nature and only observed at 
0.2 mg/kg (4 mg/m2). The majority of target organ findings demonstrated partial to full recovery 
following discontinuation of treatment, with the exception of neuronal findings in the lumbar dorsal 
root ganglion and dorsal column.  
Following oral administration, a tissue distribution study in rats revealed that the brain and spinal cord 
were amongst the tissues with the lowest levels, suggesting that the penetration of ixazomib through 
the blood-brain barrier appears to be limited. However, the relevance to humans is unknown. 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies both in vitro (on hERG channels) and in vivo (in telemetered 
dogs following single oral administration) demonstrated no effects of ixazomib on cardiovascular or 
respiratory functions at AUC more than 8-fold higher than the clinical value.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NINLARO is and what it is used for 
What NINLARO is 
NINLARO is a cancer medicine that contains ixazomib, a ‘proteasome inhibitor’. 
NINLARO is used to treat a cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma. Its active substance 
ixazomib works by blocking the action of proteasomes. These are structures inside the cell that digest 
proteins and are important for cell survival. Because myeloma cells produce a lot of proteins, blocking 
the action of proteasomes can kill the cancerous cells. 
What NINLARO is used for 
NINLARO is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma. NINLARO will be given to you together 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which are other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. 
What multiple myeloma is  
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood which affects a type of cell, called the plasma cell. A 
plasma cell is a blood cell that normally produces proteins to fight infections. People with multiple 
myeloma have cancerous plasma cells, also called myeloma cells, which can damage the bones. 
Protein produced by myeloma cells can damage the kidneys. Treatment for multiple myeloma involves 
killing myeloma cells and reducing the symptoms of the disease.  
2.  What you need to know before you take NINLARO 
Do not take NINLARO 
- 
if you are allergic to ixazomib or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are uncertain whether the condition above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before taking NINLARO. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking or during treatment with NINLARO if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have a history of bleeding 
you have persistent nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea 
you have a history of nerve problems, to include tingling and numbness 
you have a history of swelling 
you have a persistent rash or a severe skin rash with skin peeling and mouth sores (Stevens 
Johnson syndrome) 
you have or have had liver or kidney problems as your dose may have to be adjusted 
you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Tell your doctor if you develop 
fatigue, fever, bruising, bleeding, decreased urination, swelling, confusion, vision loss, and 
seizures. 
• 
• 
Your doctor will examine you and you will be monitored closely during treatment. Before starting 
NINLARO and during treatment, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough blood cells. 
Children and adolescents 
NINLARO is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. 
Other medicines and NINLARO 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal 
remedies. This is because other medicines can affect the way NINLARO works. In particular, tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). These medicines should be 
avoided as they may reduce the effectiveness of NINLARO. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
NINLARO is not recommended during pregnancy as it may harm your unborn baby. Breast-feeding 
should be stopped when taking NINLARO. 
Avoid becoming pregnant or breast-feeding while being treated with NINLARO. If you are pregnant 
or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
If you are a woman of childbearing potential or a man who can father a child, you must use effective 
contraception during and for 90 days after treatment. Women using hormonal contraceptives should 
additionally use a barrier method of contraception. Tell doctor right away if you or your partner 
becomes pregnant while receiving NINLARO. 
As NINLARO is given in combination with lenalidomide, you should adhere to the pregnancy 
prevention programme of lenalidomide because lenalidomide can be harmful to the unborn child. 
See the package leaflets for lenalidomide and dexamethasone for additional information on pregnancy 
and breast-feeding 
Driving and using machines 
NINLARO may affect your ability to drive or use machines. You may feel tired and dizzy while 
taking NINLARO. Do not drive or operate machines if you have these side effects. 
3.

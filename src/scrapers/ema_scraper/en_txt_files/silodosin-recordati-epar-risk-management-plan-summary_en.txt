PART VI:  SUMMARY  OF  THE  RISK  MANAGEMENT  PLAN  FOR 
UROREC (SILODOSIN) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Urorec (silodosin). The RMP details 
important risks of Urorec, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be 
obtained about Urorec's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Urorec's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Urorec should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Urorec  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment  report of the  evaluation  and its plain-language summary,  all  which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones are included in updates of Urorec 's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Urorec is authorised for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains silodosin as the active substance and it is 
given orally as a 4mg or an 8 mg hard capsule. 
Further information about the evaluation of Urorec’s benefits can be found in Urorec’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of  Urorec,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Urorec's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information  that  may  affect the safe use of  Urorec is not  yet available,  it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Urorec. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Due to the fact that the symptoms of prostate cancer and BPH can be very similar, there is 
the potential risk of a delay in the appropriate treatment of prostate cancer. 
Patients with increased PSA levels (>4.0 ng/ml) 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical measures to address 
the risk: 
•  SmPC section 4.4 
•  PL section 2. 
II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligations 
of silodosin. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
There are no studies required for silodosin. 
 
 
PART VI:  SUMMARY  OF  THE  RISK  MANAGEMENT  PLAN  FOR

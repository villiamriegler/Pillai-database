Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Stribild 
elvitegravir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil 
On 14 September 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Stribild. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences International 
Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
“Stribild is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults aged 18 years and over who are antiretroviral treatment-naïve or are infected with HIV-1 
without known mutations associated with resistance to any of the three antiretroviral agents in 
Stribild (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Stribild is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adolescents aged 
12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 35 kg who are infected with HIV-1 without known 
mutations associated with resistance to any of the three antiretroviral agents in Stribild 
and who have experienced toxicities which preclude the use of other regimens that do 
not contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

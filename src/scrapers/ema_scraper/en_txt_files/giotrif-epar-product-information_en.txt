CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
GIOTRIF as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s);
Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing 
on or after platinum-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1).

4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GIOTRIF should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer therapies.
EGFR mutation status should be established prior to initiation of GIOTRIF therapy (see section 4.4).
Posology
The recommended dose is 40 mg once daily.
This medicinal product should be taken without food. Food should not be consumed for at least 
3 hours before and at least 1 hour after taking this medicinal product (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
GIOTRIF treatment should be continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the 
patient (see Table 1 below).
Dose escalation
A dose escalation to a maximum of 50 mg/day may be considered in patients who tolerate a 40 mg/day 
starting dose (i.e. absence of diarrhoea, skin rash, stomatitis, and other adverse reactions with CTCAE 
Grade > 1) in the first cycle of treatment (21 days for EGFR mutation positive NSCLC and 28 days for 
squamous NSCLC). The dose should not be escalated in any patients with a prior dose reduction. The 
maximum daily dose is 50 mg.
Dose adjustment for adverse reactions
Symptomatic adverse reactions (e.g. severe/persistent diarrhoea or skin related adverse reactions) may 
be successfully managed by treatment interruption and dose reductions or treatment discontinuation of 
GIOTRIF as outlined in Table 1 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

d If patient cannot tolerate 20 mg/day, permanent discontinuation of GIOTRIF should be considered
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) should be considered if a patient develops acute or worsening of 
respiratory symptoms in which case treatment should be interrupted pending evaluation. If ILD is 
diagnosed, GIOTRIF should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary 
(see section 4.4).
3
Missed dose
If a dose is missed, it should be taken within the same day as soon as the patient remembers. 
However, if the next scheduled dose is due within 8 hours then the missed dose must be skipped.
Use of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors
If P-gp inhibitors need to be taken, they should be administered using staggered dosing, i.e. the P-gp 
inhibitor dose should be taken as far apart in time as possible from the GIOTRIF dose. This means 
preferably 6 hours (for P-gp inhibitors dosed twice daily) or 12 hours (for P-gp inhibitors dosed once 
daily) apart from GIOTRIF (see section 4.5).
Special populations
Patients with renal impairment
Exposure to afatinib was found to be increased in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment 
(see section 5.2). Adjustments to the starting dose are not necessary in patients with mild 
(eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m²) or severe 
(eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m²) renal impairment. Monitor patients with severe renal impairment 
(eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m²) and adjust GIOTRIF dose if not tolerated.
GIOTRIF treatment in patients with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis is not recommended.
Patients with hepatic impairment
Exposure to afatinib is not significantly changed in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate 
(Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Adjustments to the starting dose are not 
necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. This medicinal product has not been 
studied in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Treatment in this population is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of GIOTRIF in the paediatric population in the indication of NSCLC.
Treatment of children or adolescents with GIOTRIF was not supported by a clinical trial conducted in 
paediatric patients with other conditions (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Safety and efficacy have not been 
established.
Therefore, treatment of children or adolescents with this medicinal product is not recommended.
Method of administration
This medicinal product is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. If 
swallowing of whole tablets is not possible, these can be dispersed in approximately 100 mL of 
non-carbonated drinking water. No other liquids should be used. The tablet should be dropped into the 
water without crushing it, and stirred occasionally for up to 15 min until it is broken up into very small 
particles. The dispersion should be consumed immediately. The glass should be rinsed with 
approximately 100 mL of water which should also be consumed. The dispersion can also be 
administered through a gastric tube.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to afatinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Assessment of EGFR mutation status
When assessing the EGFR mutation status of a patient, it is important that a well-validated and robust 
methodology is chosen to avoid false negative or false positive determinations.
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been reported during treatment with GIOTRIF
(see section 4.8). Diarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, which in rare 
4
cases has resulted in fatal outcomes. Diarrhoea usually occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Grade 3 diarrhoea most frequently occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment.
Proactive management of diarrhoea including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products especially within the first 6 weeks of the treatment is important and should start at 
first signs of diarrhoea. Antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) should be used and if 
necessary their dose should be escalated to the highest recommended approved dose. Anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products should be readily available to the patients so that treatment can be initiated at first 
signs of diarrhoea and continued until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours. Patients with severe 
diarrhoea may require interruption and dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with GIOTRIF 
(see section 4.2). Patients who become dehydrated may require administration of intravenous 
electrolytes and fluids.
Skin related adverse events
Rash/acne has been reported in patients treated with this medicinal product (see section 4.8). In 
general, rash manifests as a mild or moderate erythematous and acneiform rash, which may occur or 
worsen in areas exposed to sun. For patients who are exposed to sun, protective clothing, and use of 
sun screen is advisable. Early intervention (such as emollients, antibiotics) of dermatologic reactions 
can facilitate continuous GIOTRIF treatment. Patients with severe skin reactions may also require 
temporary interruption of therapy, dose reduction (see section 4.2), additional therapeutic intervention, 
and referral to a specialist with expertise in managing these dermatologic effects.
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported including rare cases suggestive 
of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Treatment with this medicinal product 
should be interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating 
conditions (see section 4.8).
Female gender, lower body weight, and underlying renal impairment
Higher exposure to afatinib has been observed in female patients, patients with lower body weight and 
those with underlying renal impairment (see section 5.2). This could result in a higher risk of 
developing adverse reactions in particular diarrhoea, rash/acne and stomatitis. Closer monitoring is 
recommended in patients with these risk factors.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
There have been reports of ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (such as lung infiltration, pneumonitis, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, allergic alveolitis), including fatalities, in patients receiving 
GIOTRIF for treatment of NSCLC. ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of patients 
treated with GIOTRIF across all clinical trials (including 0.5% of patients with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 
ILD-like adverse reactions). Patients with a history of ILD have not been studied.
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary 
symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Treatment with this 
medicinal product should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD is diagnosed, 
GIOTRIF should be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary 
(see section 4.2).
Severe hepatic impairment
Hepatic failure, including fatalities, has been reported during treatment with this medicinal product in 
less than 1% of patients. In these patients, confounding factors have included pre-existing liver disease 
and/or comorbidities associated with progression of underlying malignancy. Periodic liver function 
testing is recommended in patients with pre-existing liver disease. In the pivotal trials Grade 3 alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations were observed in 2.4% 
(LUX-Lung-3) and 1.6% (LUX-Lung 8) of patients with normal baseline liver tests treated with 
40 mg/day. In LUX-Lung-3 Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations were about 3.5 fold higher in patients with 
abnormal baseline liver tests. There were no Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations in patients with abnormal 
baseline liver tests in LUX-Lung 8 (see section 4.8). Dose interruption may become necessary in 
5
patients who experience worsening of liver function (see section 4.2). In patients who develop severe 
hepatic impairment while taking GIOTRIF, treatment should be discontinued.
Gastrointestinal perforations
Gastrointestinal perforation, including fatalities, has been reported during treatment with GIOTRIF in 
0.2% of patients across all randomized controlled clinical trials. In the majority of cases, 
gastrointestinal perforation was associated with other known risk factors, including concomitant 
medications such as corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or anti-angiogenic agents, an underlying history of 
gastrointestinal ulceration, underlying diverticular disease, age, or bowel metastases at sites of 
perforation. In patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation while taking GIOTRIF, treatment 
should be permanently discontinued.
Keratitis
Symptoms such as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, 
eye pain and/or red eye should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. If a diagnosis of 
ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is 
diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully considered. This 
medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative 
keratitis or severe dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration
(see section 4.8).
Left ventricular function
Left ventricular dysfunction has been associated with HER2 inhibition. Based on the available clinical 
trial data, there is no suggestion that this medicinal product causes an adverse reaction on cardiac 
contractility. However, this medicinal product has not been studied in patients with abnormal left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or those with significant cardiac history. In patients with cardiac 
risk factors and those with conditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including an 
assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, should be considered. In patients who develop 
relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring including LVEF assessment 
should be considered.
In patients with an ejection fraction below the institution’s lower limit of normal, cardiac consultation 
as well as treatment interruption or discontinuation should be considered.
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) interactions
Concomitant treatment with strong inducers of P-gp may decrease exposure to afatinib
(see section 4.5).
Lactose
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary conditions of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interactions with drug transport systems
Effects of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors on afatinib
In vitro studies have demonstrated that afatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. When the strong P-gp 
and BCRP inhibitor ritonavir (200 mg twice a day for 3 days) was administered 1 hour before a single 
dose of 20 mg GIOTRIF, exposure to afatinib increased by 48% (area under the curve (AUC0-∞)) and 
39% (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)). In contrast, when ritonavir was administered 
simultaneously or 6 hours after 40 mg GIOTRIF, the relative bioavailability of afatinib was 
119% (AUC0-∞) and 104% (Cmax) and 111% (AUC0-∞) and 105% (Cmax), respectively. Therefore, it is 
recommended to administer strong P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to ritonavir, 
cyclosporine A, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, quinidine, tacrolimus, 
6
nelfinavir, saquinavir, and amiodarone) using staggered dosing, preferably 6 hours or 12 hours apart 
from GIOTRIF (see section 4.2).
Effects of P-gp inducers on afatinib
Pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days), a potent inducer of P-gp, decreased the 
plasma exposure to afatinib by 34% (AUC0-∞) and 22% (Cmax) after administration of a single dose of 
40 mg GIOTRIF. Strong P-gp inducers (including but not limited to rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, phenobarbital or St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may decrease exposure to 
afatinib (see section 4.4).
Effects of afatinib on P-gp substrates
Based on in vitro data, afatinib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp. However, based on clinical data it is 
considered unlikely that GIOTRIF treatment will result in changes of the plasma concentrations of 
other P-gp substrates.
Interactions with BCRP
In vitro studies indicated that afatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP. Afatinib
may increase the bioavailability of orally administered BCRP substrates (including but not limited to
rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine).
Food effect on afatinib
Co-administration of a high-fat meal with GIOTRIF resulted in a significant decrease of exposure to 
afatinib by about 50% in regard to Cmax and 39% in regard to AUC0-∞. This medicinal product should 
be administered without food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
As a precautionary measure, women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant while receiving treatment with GIOTRIF. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used 
during therapy and for at least 1 month after the last dose.
Pregnancy
Mechanistically, all EGFR targeting medicinal products have the potential to cause foetal harm.
Animal studies with afatinib did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Studies in animals have shown no signs of teratogenicity up to 
and including maternally lethal dose levels. Adverse changes were restricted to toxic dose levels.
However, systemic exposures achieved in animals were either in a similar range or below the levels 
observed in patients (see section 5.3).
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. The 
risk for humans is thus unknown. If used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while or 
after receiving GIOTRIF, she should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of afatinib in milk (see section 5.3). 
Based on this, it is likely that afatinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-feeding child 
cannot be excluded. Mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving this medicinal 
product.
Fertility
Fertility studies in humans have not been performed with afatinib. Available non-clinical toxicology 
data have shown effects on reproductive organs at higher doses. Therefore, an adverse effect of this 
medicinal product on human fertility cannot be excluded.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
GIOTRIF has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment, ocular 
adverse reactions (conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis) have been reported in some patients 
(see section 4.8) which may affect patients ability to drive or use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The types of adverse reactions (ADRs) were generally associated with the EGFR inhibitory mode of 
action of afatinib. The summary of all ADRs is shown in Table 2. The most frequent ADRs were 
diarrhoea and skin related adverse events (see section 4.4) as well as stomatitis and paronychia 
(see also Table 3, 4 and 5). Overall, dose reduction (see section 4.2) led to a lower frequency of 
common adverse reactions.
In patients treated with once daily GIOTRIF 40 mg, dose reductions due to ADRs occurred in 57% of 
the patients in the LUX-Lung 3 trial and in 25% of the patients in the LUX-Lung 8 trial. 
Discontinuation due to ADRs diarrhoea and rash/acne was 1.3% and 0% in LUX-Lung 3 and 3.8% 
and 2.0% in LUX-Lung 8, respectively.
ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of afatinib treated patients. Bullous, blistering and 
exfoliative skin conditions have been reported including rare cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis although in these cases there were potential alternative 
aetiologies (see section 4.4).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 2 summarises the frequencies of ADRs from all NSCLC trials and from post-marketing 
experience with daily GIOTRIF doses of 40 mg or 50 mg as monotherapy. The following terms are 
used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Liver function test abnormalities
Liver function test abnormalities (including elevated ALT and AST) were observed in patients 
receiving GIOTRIF 40 mg. These elevations were mainly transient and did not lead to discontinuation. 
Grade 2 (> 2.5 to 5.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN)) ALT elevations occurred in < 8% of patients 
treated with this medicinal product. Grade 3 (> 5.0 to 20.0 times ULN) elevations occurred in < 4% of 
patients treated with GIOTRIF (see section 4.4).

Liver function test abnormalities
Liver function test abnormalities (including elevated ALT and AST) were observed in patients 
receiving GIOTRIF 40 mg. These elevations were mainly transient and did not lead to discontinuation. 
Grade 2 ALT elevations occurred in 1% and Grade 3 elevations occurred in 0.8% of patients treated 
with GIOTRIF (see section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
The highest dose of afatinib studied in a limited number of patients in Phase I clinical trials was 
160 mg once daily for 3 days and 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks. The adverse reactions observed at 
these doses were primarily dermatological (rash/acne) and gastrointestinal events (especially 
diarrhoea). Overdose in 2 healthy adolescents involving the ingestion of 360 mg each of afatinib
(as part of a mixed drug ingestion) was associated with adverse events of nausea, vomiting, asthenia, 
dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and elevated amylase (< 1.5 times ULN). Both individuals
recovered from these adverse events.
Treatment
There is no specific antidote for overdose with this medicinal product. In cases of suspected overdose, 
GIOTRIF should be withheld and supportive care initiated.
If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed afatinib may be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EB03
Mechanism of action
Afatinib is a potent and selective, irreversible ErbB Family Blocker. Afatinib covalently binds to and 
irreversibly blocks signalling from all homo- and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members 
EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Aberrant ErbB signalling triggered by receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand 
overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype. Mutation in EGFR defines a distinct molecular 
subtype of lung cancer.
In non-clinical disease models with ErbB pathway deregulation, afatinib as a single agent effectively 
blocks ErbB receptor signalling resulting in tumour growth inhibition or tumour regression. NSCLC 
tumours with common activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R) and several less common EGFR 
mutations in exon 18 (G719X) and exon 21 (L861Q) are particularly sensitive to afatinib treatment in 
non-clinical and clinical settings. Limited non-clinical and/or clinical activity was observed in NSCLC 
tumours with insertion mutations in exon 20.
The acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to 
afatinib and gene dosage of the T790M-containing allele correlates with the degree of resistance 
in vitro. The T790M mutation is found in approximately 50% of patients’ tumours upon disease 
progression on afatinib, for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may be considered as a next line 
treatment option. Other potential mechanisms of resistance to afatinib have been suggested 
preclinically and MET gene amplification has been observed clinically.
Clinical efficacy and safety
GIOTRIF in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations
LUX-Lung 3
In the first-line setting, the efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF in patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV) were assessed in a global, randomised, 
multicentre, open-label trial. Patients were screened for the presence of 29 different EGFR mutations 
using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method (TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit, 
Qiagen Manchester Ltd). Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive GIOTRIF 40 mg once daily or up 
to 6 cycles of pemetrexed/cisplatin. Among the patients randomised, 65% were female, the median 
age was 61 years, the baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (39%) or 1 (61%), 26% were 
Caucasian and 72% were Asian. 89% of patients had common EGFR mutations (Del 19 or L858R).
The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) by independent review; the secondary 
endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate. At the time of the analysis, 
14 Nov 2013, 176 patients (76.5%) in the afatinib arm and 70 patients (60.9%) in the chemotherapy 
arm experienced an event contributing to the PFS analysis, i.e. disease progression as determined by 
central independent review or death. The efficacy results are provided in Figure 1, Tables 6 and 7.
LUX-Lung 6
The efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF in Asian patients with Stage IIIB/IV EGFR mutation-positive 
locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung was evaluated in a randomised, 
multicentre, open-label trial. Similar to LUX-Lung 3, patients with previously untreated NSCLC were 
screened for EGFR mutations using TheraScreen®: EGFR29 Mutation Kit (Qiagen Manchester Ltd). 
13
Among randomized patients, 65% were female, the median age was 58 years and all patients were of 
Asian ethnicity. Patients with common EGFR mutations accounted for 89% of the study population.
The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by central independent review; secondary endpoints 
included OS and ORR.
Both trials demonstrated significant improvement in PFS of EGFR mutation positive patients treated 
with GIOTRIF compared to chemotherapy. The efficacy results are summarized in Figure 1 
(LUX-Lung 3) and Tables 6 and 7 (LUX-Lung 3 and 6). Table 7 shows outcomes in the subgroups of 
patients with two common EGFR mutations – Del 19 and L858R.

In the pre-defined subgroup of common mutations (combined Del 19 and L858R) for GIOTRIF and 
chemotherapy, the median PFS was 13.6 months vs. 6.9 months (HR 0.48; 95%
CI 0.35-0.66; p < 0.0001; N = 307) in LUX-Lung 3, and 11.0 months vs. 5.6 months (HR 0.24; 95%
CI 0.17-0.35; p < 0.0001; N = 324) in LUX-Lung 6, respectively.
PFS benefit was accompanied by improvement in disease-related symptoms and delayed time to 
deterioration (see Table 8). Mean scores over time for overall quality of life, global health status and 
physical, role, cognitive, social and emotional functioning were significantly better for GIOTRIF.

LUX-Lung 2
LUX-Lung 2 was a single arm Phase II trial in 129 EGFR TKI-naïve patients with stage IIIB or IV
lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. Patients were enrolled in the first-line (N = 61) or 
second-line setting (N = 68) (i.e. after failure of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen). In 61 patients treated 
in the first-line setting, confirmed ORR was 65.6% and DCR was 86.9% according to independent 
review. The median PFS was 12.0 months by independent review. Efficacy was similarly high in the 
group of patients who had received prior chemotherapy (N = 68; ORR 57.4%; median PFS by 
independent review 8 months). The updated median OS for first- and second-line was 31.7 months and 
23.6 months, respectively.
LUX-Lung 7
LUX-Lung 7 is a randomised, global, open label Phase IIb trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 
GIOTRIF in patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB or IV) with 
EGFR mutations in the first-line setting. Patients were screened for the presence of activating EGFR 
mutations (Del 19 and/or L858R) using the TheraScreen® EGFR RGQ PCR Kit, Qiagen Manchester 
Ltd. Patients (N = 319) were randomised (1:1) to receive GIOTRIF® 40 mg orally once daily 
(N = 160) or gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily (N = 159). Randomisation was stratified according to 
EGFR mutation status (Del 19; L858R) and presence of brain metastases (yes; no).
Among the patients randomised, 62% were female, the median age was 63 years, 16% of patients had 
brain metastases, the baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or 1 (69%), 57% were Asian 
and 43% were non-Asian. Patients had a tumour sample with an EGFR mutation categorised as either 
exon 19 deletion (58%) or exon 21 L858R substitutions (42%).
The co-primary endpoints include PFS by independent review and OS. Secondary endpoints include 
ORR and DCR. GIOTRIF significantly improved PFS and ORR in EGFR mutation positive patients 
compared to gefitinib. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 9.

Analysis of GIOTRIF’s efficacy in EGFR TKI naïve patients with tumours harbouring uncommon 
EGFR Mutations (LUX-Lung 2, -3, and -6)
In three clinical trials of GIOTRIF with prospective tumour genotyping (Phase 3 trials LUX-Lung 3 
and -6, and single arm Phase 2 trial LUX-Lung 2), an analysis was conducted of data from a total of 
75 TKI-naïve patients with advanced (stage IIIb–IV) lung adenocarcinomas harbouring uncommon 
EGFR mutations, which were defined as all mutations other than Del 19 and L858R mutations. 
Patients were treated with GIOTRIF 40 mg (all three trials) or 50 mg (LUX-Lung 2) orally once daily.
In patients with tumours harbouring either G719X (N = 18), L861Q (N = 16), or S768I substitution 
mutation (N = 8), the confirmed ORR was 72.2%, 56.3%, 75.0%, respectively, and the median 
duration of response was 13.2 months, 12.9 months and 26.3 months, respectively.
In patients with tumours harbouring exon 20 insertions (N = 23) the confirmed ORR was 8.7% and the 
median duration of response was 7.1 months. In patients with tumours harbouring de-novo T790M 
mutations (N = 14) the confirmed ORR was 14.3% and the median duration of response was 
8.3 months.
GIOTRIF in patients with NSCLC of squamous histology
The efficacy and safety of GIOTRIF as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC of 
squamous histology was investigated in a randomized open-label global Phase III trial LUX-Lung 8. 
Patients who received at least 4 cycles of platinum-based therapy in the first line setting were 
subsequently randomized 1:1 to daily GIOTRIF 40 mg or erlotinib 150 mg until progression. 
Randomization was stratified by race (Eastern Asian vs non Eastern Asian). The primary endpoint was 
PFS; OS was the key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, change in 
tumour size and HRQOL.
18
Among 795 patients randomized, the majority were males (84%), white (73%), current or former 
smokers (95%) with baseline performance status ECOG 1 (67%) and ECOG 0 (33%).
Second-line GIOTRIF significantly improved PFS and OS of patients with squamous NSCLC 
compared to erlotinib. The efficacy results at the time of the primary analysis of OS including all 
randomized patients are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 10.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of trials with this 
medicinal product in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC indications (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). However, paediatric development was conducted in paediatric patients 
with other conditions.
A Phase I/II open-label, dose escalation, multicentre trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
GIOTRIF in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years with recurrent/refractory neuroectodermal 
tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma and/or other solid tumours with known ErbB pathway deregulation 
regardless of tumour histology. A total of 17 patients were treated in the dose finding part of the trial. 
In the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion part of the trial, 39 patients selected by biomarkers 
for ErbB pathway deregulation received GIOTRIF at a dose of 18 mg/m²/day. In this expansion part, 
no objective responses were observed in 38 patients, including 6 patients with refractory high grade
glioma (HGG), 4 patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), 8 patients with ependymoma 
and 20 patients with other histologies. One patient with a neural-glial tumour of the brain with a 
CLIP2-EGFR gene fusion had a confirmed partial response (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). The adverse reaction profile of GIOTRIF in paediatric patients was consistent with the 
safety profile seen in adults.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following oral administration of GIOTRIF, Cmax of afatinib were observed approximately 2 to 5 hours 
post dose. Cmax and AUC0-∞ values increased slightly more than proportionally in the dose range from 
20 mg to 50 mg GIOTRIF. Systemic exposure to afatinib is decreased by 50% (Cmax) and 39%
(AUC0-∞), when administered with a high-fat meal compared to administration in the fasted state. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types, an 
average decrease of 26% in AUCτ,ss was observed when food was consumed within 3 hours before 
or 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF. Therefore, food should not be consumed for at least 3 hours before 
and at least 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Distribution
In vitro binding of afatinib to human plasma proteins is approximately 95%. Afatinib binds to proteins 
both non-covalently (traditional protein binding) and covalently.
Biotransformation
Enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for afatinib in vivo. Covalent adducts to 
proteins were the major circulating metabolites of afatinib.
20
Elimination
In humans, excretion of afatinib is primarily via the faeces. Following administration of an oral 
solution of 15 mg afatinib, 85.4% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 4.3% in urine. The 
parent compound afatinib accounted for 88% of the recovered dose. Afatinib is eliminated with an 
effective half-life of approximately 37 hours. Thus, steady state plasma concentrations of afatinib were 
achieved within 8 days of multiple dosing of afatinib resulting in an accumulation of 2.77-fold
(AUC0-∞) and 2.11-fold (Cmax). In patients treated with afatinib for more than 6 months a terminal 
half-life of 344 h was estimated.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Less than 5% of a single dose of afatinib is excreted via the kidneys. Exposure to afatinib in subjects 
with renal impairment was compared to healthy volunteers following a single dose of 40 mg 
GIOTRIF. Subjects with moderate renal impairment (n = 8; eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m², according 
to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula) had an exposure of 101% (Cmax) and 
122% (AUC0-tz) in comparison to their healthy controls. Subjects with severe renal impairment 
(n = 8; eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m², according to the MDRD formula) had an exposure of 122%
(Cmax) and 150% (AUC0-tz) in comparison to their healthy controls. Based on this trial and population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types, it is concluded, 
that adjustments to the starting dose in patients with mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate 
(eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m²), or severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m²) renal impairment are not 
necessary, but patients with severe impairment should be monitored (see “Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis in special populations” below and section 4.2). GIOTRIF has not been studied in patients with 
eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis.
Hepatic impairment
Afatinib is eliminated mainly by biliary/faecal excretion. Subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) or 
moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had similar exposure in comparison to healthy 
volunteers following a single dose of 50 mg GIOTRIF. This is consistent with population 
pharmacokinetic data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types (see “Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis in special populations” below). No starting dose adjustments appear 
necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). The 
pharmacokinetics of afatinib have not been studied in subjects with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic 
dysfunction (see section 4.4).
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in special populations
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 927 cancer patients (764 with NSCLC) 
receiving GIOTRIF monotherapy. No starting dose adjustment was considered necessary for any of 
the following covariates tested.
Age
No significant impact of age (range: 28 years - 87 years) on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib could be 
observed.
Body weight
Plasma exposure (AUCτ,ss) was increased by 26% for a 42 kg patient (2.5th percentile) and decreased 
by 22% for a 95 kg patient (97.5th percentile) relative to a patient weighing 62 kg (median body weight 
of patients in the overall patient population).
Gender
Female patients had a 15% higher plasma exposure (AUCτ,ss, body weight corrected) than male 
patients.
21
Race
Race had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, including patients of Asian, White, and Black racial groups. Data on Black racial groups was 
limited.
Renal impairment
Exposure to afatinib moderately increased with lowering of the creatinine clearance (CrCL, calculated 
according to Cockcroft Gault), i.e. for a patient with a CrCL of 60 mL/min or 30 mL/min exposure 
(AUCτ,ss) to afatinib increased by 13% and 42%, respectively, and decreased by 6% and 20% for a
patient with CrCL of 90 mL/min or 120 mL/min, respectively, compared to a patient with the CrCL of 
79 mL/min (median CrCL of patients in the overall patient population analysed).
Hepatic impairment
Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as identified by abnormal liver tests did not 
correlate with any significant change in afatinib exposure. There was limited data available for 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
Other patient characteristics/intrinsic factors
Other patient characteristics/intrinsic factors found with a significant impact on afatinib exposure
were: ECOG performance score, lactate dehydrogenase levels, alkaline phosphatase levels and total 
protein. The individual effect sizes of these covariates were considered not clinically relevant.
Smoking history, alcohol consumption (limited data), or presence of liver metastases had no
significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib.
Paediatric population
After administration of 18 mg/m2 afatinib, the steady-state exposure (AUC and Cmax) in paediatric 
patients aged 2 to less than 18 years was comparable to that observed in adults given 40-50 mg 
afatinib (see also section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
Other information on drug-drug interactions
Interactions with drug uptake transport systems
In vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 transporters are considered unlikely.
Interactions with Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes
In humans it was found that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the 
metabolism of afatinib. Approximately 2% of the afatinib dose was metabolized by FMO3 and the 
CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was too low to be quantitatively detected. Afatinib is not an 
inhibitor or an inducer of CYP enzymes. Therefore, this medicinal product is unlikely to interact with
other medicines that modulate or are metabolised by CYP enzymes.
Effect of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibition on afatinib
In vitro data indicated that drug-drug interactions with afatinib due to inhibition of UGT1A1 are 
considered unlikely.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Oral administration of single doses to mice and rats indicated a low acute toxic potential of afatinib. In 
oral repeated-dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats or 52 weeks in minipigs the main effects were 
identified in the skin (dermal changes, epithelial atrophy and folliculitis in rats), the gastrointestinal 
tract (diarrhoea, erosions in the stomach, epithelial atrophy in rats and minipigs) and the kidneys 
(papillary necrosis in rats). Depending on the finding, these changes occurred at exposures below, in 
the range of or above clinically relevant levels. Additionally, in various organs pharmacodynamically 
mediated atrophy of epithelia was observed in both species.
22
Reproduction toxicity
Based on the mechanism of action, all EGFR targeting medicinal products including GIOTRIF have
the potential to cause foetal harm. The embryo-foetal development studies performed on afatinib 
revealed no indication of teratogenicity. The respective total systemic exposure (AUC) was either 
slightly above (2.2 times in rats) or below (0.3 times in rabbits) compared with levels in patients.
Radiolabelled afatinib administered orally to rats on Day 11 of lactation was excreted in the breast 
milk of the dams.
A fertility study in male and female rats up to the maximum tolerated dose revealed no significant 
impact on fertility. The total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in male and female rats was in the range or 
less than that observed in patients (1.3 times and 0.51 times, respectively).
A study in rats up to the maximum tolerated doses revealed no significant impact on pre-/postnatal 
development. The highest total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) in female rats was less than that observed 
in patients (0.23 times).
Phototoxicity
An in vitro 3T3 test showed that afatinib may have phototoxicity potential.
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with GIOTRIF.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What GIOTRIF is and what it is used for
GIOTRIF is a medicine which contains the active substance afatinib. It works by blocking the activity 
of a group of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or 
ErbB1], HER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of 
cancer cells, and can be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking 
the activity of these proteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.
This medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung 
(non-small cell lung cancer):

that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR. GIOTRIF can be prescribed to 
you as your first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.
of squamous type if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.

2. What you need to know before you take GIOTRIF
Do not take GIOTRIF
-
if you are allergic to afatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:

if you are female, have a low body weight of less than 50 kg or have kidney problems. If any of 
these apply to you, your doctor may monitor you more closely as the side effects may be more 
pronounced.
if you have a history of lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease).
if you have liver problems. Your doctor may do some liver tests. Treatment with this medicine 
is not recommended if you have a severe liver disease.
if you have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eyes, inflammation of the transparent 
layer at the front of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the outer part of the eye, or if you use 
contact lenses.
if you have a history of heart problems. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.




47
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine:



if you develop diarrhoea. Treatment at the first signs of diarrhoea is important.
if you develop skin rash. Early treatment of skin rash is important.
if you develop new or sudden worsening of shortness of breath, possibly with a cough or fever. 
These could be symptoms of an inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) and can be 
life-threatening.
if you have severe pain in your stomach or intestines, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or 
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a tear in the wall of your stomach 
or intestines (‘gastrointestinal perforation’). Also, tell your doctor if you had gastrointestinal 
ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and 
allergies), as this may increase this risk.
if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred 
vision and/or sensitivity to light. You may need urgent treatment.


See also section 4 “Possible side effects”.
Children and adolescents
GIOTRIF is not recommended for use in children or adolescents. Do not give this medicine to children 
or adolescents under the age of 18 years.
Other medicines and GIOTRIF
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.
In particular, if taken before GIOTRIF, the following medicines may increase the blood levels of 
GIOTRIF and therefore the risk of side effects. They should therefore be taken as far apart in time as 
possible from GIOTRIF. This means preferably 6 hours (for medicines taken twice daily) or 12 hours
(for medicines taken once daily) apart from GIOTRIF:

Ritonavir, ketoconazole (except in shampoo), itraconazole, erythromycin, nelfinavir, saquinavir
– used to treat different kinds of infections.
Verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone – used to treat heart conditions.
Cyclosporine A, tacrolimus – medicines that affect your immune system.


The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of GIOTRIF:



Ask your doctor if you are unsure of when to take these medicines.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital – used to treat seizures.
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine to treat depression.
Rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.
GIOTRIF may increase the blood levels of other medicines including but not limited to:


Sulfasalazine, used to treat inflammation/infection.
Rosuvastatin, used for lowering cholesterol.
Tell your doctor before taking these medicines together with GIOTRIF.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this medicine. If you could become pregnant, you 
should use adequate birth control methods during treatment and for at least 1 month after taking the 
last dose of this medicine. This is because there may be a risk that an unborn baby is harmed.
48
If you become pregnant while receiving this medicine, you should immediately inform your doctor. 
Your doctor will decide with you whether treatment should be continued or not.
If you plan to become pregnant after taking the last dose of this medicine, you should ask your doctor 
for advice as your body may not have fully eliminated this medicine.
Breast-feeding
Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine as a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded.
Driving and using machines
If you experience treatment-related symptoms affecting your eye sight (e.g. redness and/or irritation of 
the eye, dry eye, tearing, light-sensitivity) or your ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended 
that you do not drive or use machines until the side effect disappears (see section 4 Possible side 
effects).
GIOTRIF contains lactose
This medicine contains a sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

given to you via the tube.
If you take more GIOTRIF than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. You may experience increased side effects and your 
doctor may interrupt your treatment and provide supportive care.
If you forget to take GIOTRIF

If your next scheduled dose is more than 8 hours away, take the missed dose as soon as you 
remember.
49

If your next scheduled dose is due within 8 hours, skip the missed dose and take your next dose 
at the usual time. Then carry on taking your tablets at regular times as usual.

How to store GIOTRIF
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What GIOTRIF is and what it is used for
GIOTRIF is a medicine which contains the active substance afatinib. It works by blocking the activity 
of a group of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or 
ErbB1], HER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of 
cancer cells, and can be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking 
the activity of these proteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.
This medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung 
(non-small cell lung cancer):

that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR. GIOTRIF can be prescribed to 
you as your first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.
of squamous type if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.

2. What you need to know before you take GIOTRIF
Do not take GIOTRIF
-
if you are allergic to afatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:

if you are female, have a low body weight of less than 50 kg or have kidney problems. If any of 
these apply to you, your doctor may monitor you more closely as the side effects may be more 
pronounced.
if you have a history of lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease).
if you have liver problems. Your doctor may do some liver tests. Treatment with this medicine 
is not recommended if you have a severe liver disease.
if you have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eyes, inflammation of the transparent 
layer at the front of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the outer part of the eye, or if you use 
contact lenses.
if you have a history of heart problems. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.




55
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine:



if you develop diarrhoea. Treatment at the first signs of diarrhoea is important.
if you develop skin rash. Early treatment of skin rash is important.
if you develop new or sudden worsening of shortness of breath, possibly with a cough or fever. 
These could be symptoms of an inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) and can be 
life-threatening.
if you have severe pain in your stomach or intestines, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or 
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a tear in the wall of your stomach 
or intestines (‘gastrointestinal perforation’). Also, tell your doctor if you had gastrointestinal 
ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and 
allergies), as this may increase this risk.
if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred 
vision and/or sensitivity to light. You may need urgent treatment.


See also section 4 “Possible side effects”.
Children and adolescents

Other medicines and GIOTRIF
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.
In particular, if taken before GIOTRIF, the following medicines may increase the blood levels of 
GIOTRIF and therefore the risk of side effects. They should therefore be taken as far apart in time as 
possible from GIOTRIF. This means preferably 6 hours (for medicines taken twice daily) or 12 hours 
(for medicines taken once daily) apart from GIOTRIF:

Ritonavir, ketoconazole (except in shampoo), itraconazole, erythromycin, nelfinavir, saquinavir 
– used to treat different kinds of infections.
Verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone – used to treat heart conditions.
Cyclosporine A, tacrolimus – medicines that affect your immune system.


The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of GIOTRIF:



Ask your doctor if you are unsure of when to take these medicines.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital – used to treat seizures.
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine to treat depression.
Rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.
GIOTRIF may increase the blood levels of other medicines including but not limited to:


Sulfasalazine, used to treat inflammation/infection.
Rosuvastatin, used for lowering cholesterol.
Tell your doctor before taking these medicines together with GIOTRIF.

that you do not drive or use machines until the side effect disappears (see section 4 Possible side 
effects).

1. What GIOTRIF is and what it is used for
GIOTRIF is a medicine which contains the active substance afatinib. It works by blocking the activity 
of a group of proteins called the ErbB family (including EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor or 
ErbB1], HER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of 
cancer cells, and can be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking 
the activity of these proteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.
This medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung 
(non-small cell lung cancer):

that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR. GIOTRIF can be prescribed to 
you as your first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.
of squamous type if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.

2. What you need to know before you take GIOTRIF
Do not take GIOTRIF
-
if you are allergic to afatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:

if you are female, have a low body weight of less than 50 kg or have kidney problems. If any of 
these apply to you, your doctor may monitor you more closely as the side effects may be more 
pronounced.
if you have a history of lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease).
if you have liver problems. Your doctor may do some liver tests. Treatment with this medicine 
is not recommended if you have a severe liver disease.
if you have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eyes, inflammation of the transparent 
layer at the front of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the outer part of the eye, or if you use 
contact lenses.
if you have a history of heart problems. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.


if you develop diarrhoea. Treatment at the first signs of diarrhoea is important.
if you develop skin rash. Early treatment of skin rash is important.
if you develop new or sudden worsening of shortness of breath, possibly with a cough or fever. 
These could be symptoms of an inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) and can be 
life-threatening.
if you have severe pain in your stomach or intestines, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or 
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a tear in the wall of your stomach 
or intestines (‘gastrointestinal perforation’). Also, tell your doctor if you had gastrointestinal 
ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and 
allergies), as this may increase this risk.
if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred 
vision and/or sensitivity to light. You may need urgent treatment.

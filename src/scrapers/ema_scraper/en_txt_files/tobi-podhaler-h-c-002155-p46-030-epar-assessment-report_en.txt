Main objectives 
To conduct the psychometric validation of the Italian Treatment Adherence Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire 
(ITA-CFq) by testing convergent validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. 
Other objectives: 
•  To evaluate ITA-CFq comprehensibility. 
•  To estimate the weights of score compliance to each therapy used in the overall score. 
CHMP comment 
As the objectives are based on a self-administered questionnaire, developed in Italian language by the 
sponsor (in collaboration with a multidisciplinary advisory board), the relevance of the outcome of this 
small study for the overall CF population worldwide is questionable.   
Study design 
FREE was an observational longitudinal multicenter cohort study involving 17 Italian centers. 
According to routine medical practice, the observational period consisted of 2 follow-up visits. The first 
follow-up was performed at 3 months (+/- 15) days from baseline, and the second at the end of third 
Tobi Podhaler cycle or after 6 months from the enrollment, whichever occurred first. 
The FREE – ITA-CFq psychometric validation, a substudy of the main FREE study, was an observational, 
longitudinal, multicenter study aimed to assess comprehensibility and psychometric properties of ITA-
CFq  (internal  consistency,  test-retest  reliability,  and  convergent  validity).  The  entire  psychometric 
validation  process lasted  15 months (12 months for enrollment + 3 months follow-up  + 2-7 days for 
retest). 
A qualitative comprehensibility test had been conducted before starting the core FREE study, and the 
psychometric validation substudy and had been performed on a group of patients different from the one 
involved in the main study.

Study population 
The  FREE  core  study  and  the  substudy  population  consisted  of  patients  diagnosed  with  cystic  fibrosis 
chronically infected with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa who started Tobi Podhaler treatment as per clinical 
practice within 15 days before the enrollment visit. 
All patients referred to the participating sites that met eligibility criteria were consecutively enrolled. 
Patients who met the following criteria were considered eligible for the study: 
1.  Male and female patients ≥12 and ≤35 years of age at enrollment. 
2.  Written  informed  consent  and  privacy  disclosure  given  by  patients  or  by  the  parent/legal 
guardian on behalf of the subject if <18 years old. 
3.  Patients with a proven cystic fibrosis diagnosis. 
4.  Patients  chronically  infected  with  P.  aeruginosa  confirmed  by  microbiological/  molecular  test 
within 6 months prior to enrollment. 
5.  Patients who started TOBI Podhaler treatment as per clinical practice within 15 days before the 
enrollment visit. 
6.  Patients  receiving  at  least  one  cycle  of  inhaled  antibiotic  treatment  2  months  before  starting 
TOBI Podhaler treatment. 
Patients who meet the following criteria were not considered eligible for the study: 
1.  Patients unable to complete the patient questionnaires. 
2.  Patients participating to any clinical trial. 
3.  Patients with any contraindications to aminoglycosides 
Sample size 
The primary objective of the core study was to evaluate the compliance to treatment with Tobi Podhaler 
at the end of the third cycle of therapy or after 6 months from enrollment in reallife setting, by means 
of a newly developed questionnaire. Given no literature data were available to this regard at the time of 
the sample size evaluation, a sample size of 120 evaluable subjects was deemed as appropriate, on the 
basis  of  simulations  aimed  at  determining  precision  of  the  estimate  and  feasibility.  Hypothesizing  a 
maximum  of  10%  of  drop-out  rate,  including  not-evaluable  patients,  108  evaluable  patients  were 
foreseen for the primary end-point. 
During the study, mainly for feasibility reasons as the unexpectedly slow recruitment rate made study 
timelines unrealistic, and in alignment with the descriptive intent of the study, the final sample size was 
reduced to 82 patients, provided adequate communication to each participating site. The final sample 
size was considered to be acceptable for statistical analysis since CF is a rare disease and no a priori 
statistical hypothesis was drawn. 
For the primary objective of the substudy, i.e. the evaluation of the psychometric properties of ITA-CFq, 
a sample size of 40 patients was calculated on the basis of simulations of achievable  precision of the 
estimates.

CHMP comment 
The planned sample size was reduced from 120 to 82 patients during the study for feasibility reasons, 
further limiting the value of the results.  
Treatments 
This  was  a  non-interventional  study  and  did  not  impose  a  therapy  protocol,  diagnostic/therapeutic 
procedure, or a visit schedule. Patients were treated according to the local prescribing information, and 
routine medical practice in terms of visit frequency and types of assessments performed and only these 
data were collected as part of the study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Compliance to treatment were recorded at each time point by means of the Italian Treatment Adherence 
Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (ITA-CFq). 
This  questionnaire,  developed  in  Italian  language  by  Novartis  in  collaboration  with  a  multidisciplinary 
Italian Advisory Board, was self-administered to the patient. It referred to the last 4 weeks of antibiotic 
treatment prescription period and its main aim was to measure an overall degree of compliance to the 
whole therapeutic scheme (i.e. physiotherapy, exercise, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins and antibiotics) 
as perceived by the patient. 
ITA-CFq consists in 5 sections, one for each therapeutic scheme, to evaluate the following issue: 
1.  Compliance to treatment: evaluated by means of a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, 
where 0 is no compliance and 10 is fully compliance; 
2.  Reasons for non-compliance: evaluated by means of a multiple choice; 
3.  Patient’s perception of prescribed therapy: measured as poor, adequate, excessive, unknown. 
The patient answered the questionnaire in a quiet room and could ask parents/physician support in case 
of any doubts related to therapy under review. 
Safety related measurements included physical examination, vital signs and lab evaluation, weight and 
FEV1% predicted, and other safety assessments (Pulmonary exacerbations. The Revised Cystic Fibrosis 
Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  (CFQ-R)  was  used  to  assess  the  Quality  of  Life.  Patient’s  self-reported 
satisfaction or dissatisfaction with study drug were measured using the validated Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire  for  Medication  (TSQM).  A  diary  captured  the  following  information:  number  of  missing 
doses per week, number of inhaled capsules per dose, reasons of missing doses, timing of inhalations 
and  method  of  use  (i.e.  critical  errors  of  use,  duration  of  the  inhalation)  of  Tobi  Podhaler®  inhaler, 
including the interest of the dose visual control. 
Statistical Methods 
For the main objective, appropriate descriptive statistics and 95% CI of the mean value of the compliance 
to inhaled capsules at second follow-up visit were provided. 
Quantitative  variables  were  described  by  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  first  and  third  quartile, 
minimum and maximum, while qualitative variables by absolute and relative frequency. Bilateral 95% 
confidence intervals were given where relevant.

At enrollment, 72 patients (87.8% of enrolled patients) were considered evaluable and therefore included 
in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for the core study, and 28 patients were considerable evaluable for the 
validation substudy.  
Baseline data 
The overall evaluable patients were well balanced regarding the distribution by sex (little prevalence of 
female subjects, 51.4%), while the majority of them were Caucasian/white (98.6%), and mean age at 
enrollment was 24.8 ± 7.9 years. Cystic fibrosis duration was 21.7 ± 8.2 years on average, and patient’s 
age at diagnosis was 3.3 ± 6.1 years on average. 
Efficacy results 
ITA-CFq was not fully answered in most of the cases (N=38, N=42 and N=41 patients included in the 
FAS  provided  compliance  scores  for  all  treatments  at  enrollment,  first  and  second  follow-up  visit, 
respectively). In order to maximise available information, compliance at single timepoints has also been 
evaluated. 
The primary objective, compliance to antibiotic treatment, is depicted below (Table 10.4.1-1), paediatric 
data is depicted in Table 4-6.

CHMP comment 
The number of evaluable subjects to answer the study’s main question(s), was limited. This, together 
with the nature of the questionnaire (sponsor developed, single country, non-validated) makes that the 
data can only be regarded descriptive. No conclusions should be drawn based on these results.  
•  Compliance  to  other  treatments  and  overall  compliance  score  (ITACFq)  (secondary  objectives 
#1 and #3) 
Table 10.4.2.1-11 shows values of overall compliance score at each time point and relative changes for 
the overall population, Table 4-5 shows data for paediatric patients.

The most commonly reported factor of poor or non-compliance to treatment with aerosol antibiotic at 
enrollment was forgetfulness (15.7%), followed by lack of time (9.8%) and treatment assumption only 
when  the  patient  does  not  feel  good  (7.8%).  The  most  frequently  reported  factor  of  poor  or  non  - 
compliance at first and second follow-up visits was forgetfulness (19.2% and 16.7%, respectively), while 
others were negligible.

Patient’s average weight was 56.8 ± 10.5 kg at enrolment (n=69), 57.4 ± 9.9 kg at first follow-up visit 
(n=54), and 57.2 ± 10.1 kg at second follow-up visit (n=52). 
Patient’s  average  FEV1%  predicted  was  73.8  ±  23.9  %  at  enrolment  (n=43),  78.1  ±  20.7  %  at  first 
follow-up visit (n=26), and 77.2 ± 17.9 % at second follow-up visit (n=24). 
Patient’s average Tobramycin MIC value was 2.8 ± 1.2 μg/ml at enrollment (n=18) and 6.3 ± 11.5 μg/ml 
at second follow-up visit (n=16). 
•  Compliance during Tobi Podhaler treatment (patient diary) (secondary objective #5) 
According  to  patient  diary,  the  average  number  of  missed  antibiotic  dose  per  patient  during  the  past 
week was 0.5 ± 0.7 at first cycle (n=46), 0.4 ± 0.5 at second cycle (n=36), and 0.4 ± 0.8 at third cycle 
(n=28). 
• 
Patient’s treatment satisfaction (TSQM) (secondary objective #6) 
With respect to efficacy domain, a mean value of 63.6 ± 19.8 was observed at enrollment that increased 
to 67.5 ± 15.1 at second follow-up with a change of 1.8 ± 22.4 (with a 95% CI of [- 4.6 ; 8.2]). 
Regarding the convenience domain, the mean score was74.2 ± 17.1 at enrollment and 77.8 ± 15.9 at 
second follow-up with a mean increase of 2.8 ± 17.9 (with a 95% CI of [-2.4 ; 8.0]). 
Regarding the global satisfaction domain, the mean score was:62.4 ± 19.3 at enrollment and 63.9 ± 
16.9 at second follow-up with a change of -0.2 ± 22.1 (with a 95% CI of [-6.6 ; 6.3]). 
Regarding the adverse events domain, the mean score was:94.0 ± 12.1 at enrollment and 95.3 ± 12.4 
at second follow-up with a negative change of -1.2 ± 14.6 (with a 95% CI of [-5.5 ; 3.1]). 
•  Changes in quality of life (CFQ-R) (secondary objective #7) 
No  substantial  impact  of  Tobi  Podhaler  was  observed  in  terms  of  QoL,  as  assessed  by  the  CFQ-R.  All 
domains remained roughly unchanged from baseline to study end. 
Safety results 
There were 12 patients (16.7%) that discontinued the treatment with Tobi Podhaler, one of which was 
a paediatric patient. Among those subjects, 3 patients (25.0%) discontinued the treatment due to lack 
of breath, and 2 (16.7%) because of bronchospasm and cough. 
The safety profile is in line with previously reported findings. 26 patients (31.7%) experienced at least 
one AE, and at least one serious AE (SAE) was reported in 7 (8.5%).  
Among  AEs,  the  most  represented  clusters  were  N=9  infections,  with  main  incidence  of  infective 
pulmonary exacerbations CF related (8.5%), and N=14 respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 
with  main  incidence  of  cough  (N=3),  dyspnea  (N=3)  and  respiratory  failure  (N=2).  Tobi  Podhaler®-
related  AEs  occurred  in  10  (12.2%)  patients,  and  SAEs  related  to  Tobi  Podhaler®  use  occurred  in  2 
patients (2.4%). All safety findings described in the study are aligned with the known safety profile of 
the drug and in line with current SmPC reported findings, with the single exception of one lip oedema 
case described as not related to study medication and completely recovered. 
Among paediatric patients, 4 (18.2%) had experienced at least one adverse event and 2 (9.1%) at least 
one serious adverse event. The SAEs experienced by paediatric patients were: 
• 
a serious haemoptysis event of severe intensity in a female patient aged 15 years. It occurred 
15 days after the first dose of TOBI Podhaler, the relationship was considered to be suspected 
and the study drug was permanently discontinued.  The event was completely recovered. This

event  was  also  the  only  suspected  drug  related  adverse  event  occurring  in  the  paediatric 
population.  
• 
a  serious  moderate  pulmonary  exacerbation  with  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  as  primary 
precipitating factor (reported in in a female patient aged 15 years). The event occurred 78 days 
after the start of treatment with TOBI Podhaler, and resulted in a prolonged hospitalization which 
resolved after 13 days. The relation with TOBI Podhaler was not suspected, but the dosage was 
adjusted/temporarily interrupted. 
CHMP comment  
Based upon the reported safety results, no new safety signals are identified.   
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The main objective of the FREE study was to evaluate the compliance to Tobi Podhaler treatment in the 
real-life setting at the end of the third cycle of therapy, or after 6 months from enrollment. Compliance 
was  assessed  by  ITA-CFq,  a  specific  questionnaire  that  was  developed  by  the  sponsor  to  evaluate 
patient’s compliance to therapy. 
The small sample size and patients’ low responsiveness to the questionnaire, together with the nature 
of the questionnaire (sponsor developed, single country, non-validated) makes that the data can only 
be regarded descriptive. No conclusions should be drawn based on these results. 
The reported safety findings did not give rise to new concerns. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
It is agreed  with the MAH that the product information of TOBI Podhaler does not warrant an update 
based on the results from study CTBM100C2409. 
Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

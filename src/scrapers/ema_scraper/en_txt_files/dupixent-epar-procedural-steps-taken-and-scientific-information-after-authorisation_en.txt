dermatitis. The study met all pre-specified efficacy 
endpoints that assessed skin lesions and other domains of 
atopic hand and foot dermatitis. No specific safety concern 
arises from the safety data collected in adolescents. The 
safety data resulting from the study suggests that 
dupilumab is well tolerated in patients with hand and foot 
dermatitis and is overall consistent with the known safety 
profile in the AD study populations and AD patients. This 
information has been reflected in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
of the SmPC.

data 
profile as defined in the initial Marketing authorisation and 
further variation applications for the indications currently 
approved. This included 12 completed randomized, placebo 
controlled clinical trials. These studies involved 4,206 
patients receiving dupilumab and 2,326 patients receiving 
placebo during the placebo-controlled treatment period.  
The pooling of studies resulted in amendment and/or 
clarification of frequencies of several adverse drug 
reactions as follows:  Injection site reactions (common), 
arthralgia (common) angioedema (uncommon); Blepharitis 
(uncommon); keratitis (uncommon); ulcerative keratitis 
(rare) ; anaphylactic reaction (are). Injection site reactions 
were grouped to include erythema, oedema, pruritus, 
swelling and pain. Headache was removed from the list of 
adverse drug reactions with appropriate justification.

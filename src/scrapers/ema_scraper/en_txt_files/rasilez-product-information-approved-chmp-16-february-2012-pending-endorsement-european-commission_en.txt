4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The recommended dose of Rasilez is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. 
The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy 
with 150 mg once daily. 
Rasilez may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception of 
use in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Rasilez should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit 
juice should not be taken together with Rasilez. 
Renal impairment 
No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 
< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Concomitant use of Rasilez with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients 
with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). 
Hepatic impairment 
No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly patients (over 65 years) 
The recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful 
additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of 
elderly patients. 
Paediatric patients (below 18 years) 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rasilez is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on 
safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
History of angioedema with aliskiren. 
Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. 
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp inhibitors, 
and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Aliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). 
In the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilez therapy should be stopped. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Hypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal 
failure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that 
affect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by 
combining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. 
The use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). 
Angioedema 
As with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of 
angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated 
with aliskiren. 
A number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, 
which in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS 
blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). 
Patients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during 
treatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when 
prescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely 
monitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. 
If angioedema occurs, Rasilez should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and 
monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. 
Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In 
addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. 
Sodium and/or volume depleted patients 
In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilez. This condition should 
be corrected prior to administration of Rasilez, or the treatment should start under close medical 
supervision. 
Renal impairment 
In clinical studies Rasilez has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal 
impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥ 177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in 
men and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or 
renovascular hypertension. Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 
< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
As for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren 
is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. 
due to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease, 
diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is 
contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Acute renal failure, 
reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in 
post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be 
promptly discontinued. 
Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and 
these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination 
of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. 
Renal artery stenosis 
No controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilez in patients with unilateral or bilateral 
renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the 
renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, 
when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should be 
exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. 
Moderate P-gp inhibitors 
Co-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a 
76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when 
aliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section 
4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus 
or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, 
atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No 
interactions have been identified. 
Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine 
(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Rasilez. When administered with 
atorvastatin, steady-state Rasilez AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of Rasilez had 
no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a result no dose 
adjustment for Rasilez or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. 
Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Rasilez. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Rasilez bioavailability. 
Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Rasilez. 
CYP450 interactions 
Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). 
Aliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure 
of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is metabolised 
minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or induction of 
CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp. Increased 
aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore 
be expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). 
P-glycoprotein interactions 
MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and 
biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced 
aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s 
wort) might decrease the bioavailability of Rasilez. Although this has not been investigated for 
aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors 
can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue 
levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend 
on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. 
P-gp potent inhibitors 
A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) 
increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase 
may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC 
and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of 
aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Moderate P-gp inhibitors 
Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in 
a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the 
presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the 
dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended 
therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Preclinical studies 
indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal 
absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is 
administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors (clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). 
P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors 
No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When 
administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 
50%. 
Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors 
Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting 
polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren 
when administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). 
Furosemide 
When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced 
by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when 
initiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of 
volume overload. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-
hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated 
patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further 
deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. 
Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels 
Concomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum 
potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent 
affecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination 
of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal 
impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 
4.4 and 5.1). 
Grapefruit juice 
Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. 
Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-
administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is 
likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by 
grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, 
grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasilez. 
Warfarin 
The effects of Rasilez on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. 
Food intake 
Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Rasilez substantially. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Rasilez was not teratogenic in rats or 
rabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with 
serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, 
Rasilez should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become 
pregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare 
professionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing 
potential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during 
therapy, Rasilez should be discontinued accordingly. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Rasilez was secreted in the milk of 
lactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
when driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness 
may occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Rasilez has negligible influence on 
the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Rasilez has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for over 
6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no 
association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Rasilez resulted in an 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have 
generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of 
therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. 
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, 
using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1,000, <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness.

Hyperkalaemia 
Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased 
Blood creatinine increased 
Angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In 
controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment 
with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. 
Cases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or 
tongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a 
history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated 
with the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers 
(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). 
Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. 
In the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties 
in breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or 
tongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). 
Arthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Laboratory findings 
In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
uncommonly associated with the administration of Rasilez. In clinical studies in hypertensive patients, 
Rasilez had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. 
Haemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of 
approximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients 
discontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-
angiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. 
Serum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be 
exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with 
standard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is 
advised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or 
ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR 
< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
In post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in 
patients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood 
creatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. 
4.9  Overdose 
Limited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of 
overdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic 
hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 
Aliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. 
By inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the 
conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin 
II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) 
cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in 
hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was 
combined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on 
PRA are not known at the present time. 
Hypertension 
In hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasilez at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided 
dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the 
entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to trough 
ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-
pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was 
sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and 
ethnicity. Rasilez has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged 
75 years or older. 
Rasilez monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes 
of antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HCTZ), Rasilez 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 
14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Combination therapy studies are available for Rasilez added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the 
calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well 
tolerated. Rasilez induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to 
hydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel 
blocker amlodipine, the addition of Rasilez 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to 
that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 
150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). 
The efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-
month non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. 
Aliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for 
36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and 
amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered 
systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, 
consistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both 
treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren 
regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the 
ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). 
In a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) 
aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in 
blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure 
lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses 
were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. 
In obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with 
Rasilez 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on treatment 
with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. 
There has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in 
controlled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with 
uncomplicated hypertension treated with Rasilez alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) 
during combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood 
pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence 
of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. 
In a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in 
ventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with 
aliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. 
The combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, 
stroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. 
However, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, 
hypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. 
Aliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled 
randomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by 
proteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients 
arterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of 
cardiovascular and renal complications. 
In this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The 
study was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. 
Preliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo 
(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious 
adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% 
versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke 
(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal 
insufficiency. 
Beneficial effects of Rasilez on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are 
currently unknown. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
No effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled 
study using standard and Holter electrocardiography. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax 
by 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following 
once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial 
dose. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 
135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren 
plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. 
Metabolism and elimination 
The mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged 
compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme 
responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine 
following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is 
approximately 9 l/h. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Exposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose 
administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-
fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more 
pronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible 
mechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. 
Characteristics in patients 
Aliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, 
age, body mass index and ethnicity. 
The AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity 
have no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. 
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal 
insufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between 
0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. 
These observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No 
adjustment of the initial dosage of Rasilez is required in patients with mild to moderate renal 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Concomitant use of Rasilez with 
ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see 
section 4.3). 
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver 
disease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to 
severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No 
carcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in 
rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known 
irritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy 
volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold 
based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. 
Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The 
assays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. 
Reproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or 
teratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal 
development and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The 
doses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than 
the maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). 
Safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or 
cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with 
the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The recommended dose of Rasilez is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. 
The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy 
with 150 mg once daily. 
Rasilez may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception of 
use in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Rasilez should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit 
juice should not be taken together with Rasilez. 
Renal impairment 
No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2) Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 
< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Concomitant use of Rasilez with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients 
with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). 
Hepatic impairment 
No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly patients (over 65 years) 
The recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful 
additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of 
elderly patients. 
Paediatric patients (below 18 years) 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rasilez is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on 
safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
History of angioedema with aliskiren. 
Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. 
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp inhibitors, 
and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Aliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). 
In the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilez therapy should be stopped. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Hypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal 
failure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that 
affect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by 
combining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. 
The use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). 
Angioedema 
As with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of 
angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated 
with aliskiren. 
A number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, 
which in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS 
blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). 
Patients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during 
treatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when 
prescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely 
monitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. 
If angioedema occurs, Rasilez should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and 
monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. 
Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In 
addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. 
Sodium and/or volume depleted patients 
In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilez. This condition should 
be corrected prior to administration of Rasilez, or the treatment should start under close medical 
supervision. 
Renal impairment 
In clinical studies Rasilez has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal 
impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥ 177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in 
men and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or 
renovascular hypertension. Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 
< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
As for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren 
is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. 
due to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease, 
diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is 
contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Acute renal failure, 
reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in 
post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be 
promptly discontinued. 
Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and 
these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination 
of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. 
Renal artery stenosis 
No controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilez in patients with unilateral or bilateral 
renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the 
renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, 
when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should be 
exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. 
Moderate P-gp inhibitors 
Co-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a 
76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when 
aliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section 
4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus 
or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, 
atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No 
interactions have been identified. 
Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine 
(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Rasilez. When administered with 
atorvastatin, steady-state Rasilez AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of Rasilez had 
no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a result no dose 
adjustment for Rasilez or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. 
Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Rasilez. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Rasilez bioavailability. 
Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Rasilez. 
CYP450 interactions 
Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). 
Aliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure 
of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is metabolised 
minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or induction of 
CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp. Increased 
aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore 
be expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). 
P-glycoprotein interactions 
MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and 
biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced 
aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s 
wort) might decrease the bioavailability of Rasilez. Although this has not been investigated for 
aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors 
can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue 
levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend 
on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. 
P-gp potent inhibitors 
A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) 
increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase 
may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC 
and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of 
aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Moderate P-gp inhibitors 
Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in 
a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the 
presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the 
dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended 
therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Preclinical studies 
indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal 
absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is 
administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors (clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). 
P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors 
No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When 
administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 
50%. 
Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors 
Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting 
polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren 
when administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). 
Furosemide 
When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced 
by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when 
initiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of 
volume overload. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-
hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated 
patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further 
deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. 
Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels 
Concomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum 
potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent 
affecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination 
of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal 
impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 
4.4 and 5.1). 
Grapefruit juice 
Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. 
Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-
administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is 
likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by 
grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, 
grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasilez. 
Warfarin 
The effects of Rasilez on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. 
Food intake 
Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Rasilez substantially. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Rasilez was not teratogenic in rats or 
rabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with 
serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, 
Rasilez should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become 
pregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare 
professionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing 
potential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during 
therapy, Rasilez should be discontinued accordingly. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Rasilez was secreted in the milk of 
lactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
when driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness 
may occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Rasilez has negligible influence on 
the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Rasilez has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for over 
6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no 
association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Rasilez resulted in an 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have 
generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of 
therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. 
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, 
using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1,000, <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness.

Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased 
Blood creatinine increased 
Angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In 
controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment 
with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. 
Cases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or 
tongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a 
history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated 
with the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers 
(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). 
Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. 
In the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties 
in breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or 
tongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). 
Arthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Laboratory findings 
In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
uncommonly associated with the administration of Rasilez. In clinical studies in hypertensive patients, 
Rasilez had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. 
Haemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of 
approximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients 
discontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-
angiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. 
Serum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be 
exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with 
standard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is 
advised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or 
ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR 
< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
In post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in 
patients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood 
creatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. 
4.9  Overdose 
Limited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of 
overdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic 
hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 
Aliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. 
By inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the 
conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin 
II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) 
cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in 
hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was 
combined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on 
PRA are not known at the present time. 
Hypertension 
In hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasilez at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided 
dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the 
entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to trough 
ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-
pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was 
sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and 
ethnicity. Rasilez has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged 
75 years or older. 
Rasilez monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes 
of antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HCTZ), Rasilez 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 
14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Combination therapy studies are available for Rasilez added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the 
calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well 
tolerated. Rasilez induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to 
hydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel 
blocker amlodipine, the addition of Rasilez 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to 
that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 
150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). 
The efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-
month non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. 
Aliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for 
36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and 
amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered 
systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, 
consistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both 
treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren 
regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the 
ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). 
In a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) 
aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in 
blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure 
lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses 
were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. 
In obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with 
Rasilez 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on treatment 
with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. 
There has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in 
controlled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with 
uncomplicated hypertension treated with Rasilez alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) 
during combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood 
pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence 
of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. 
In a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in 
ventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with 
aliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. 
The combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, 
stroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. 
However, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, 
hypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. 
Aliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled 
randomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by 
proteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients 
arterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of 
cardiovascular and renal complications. 
In this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The 
study was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. 
Preliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo 
(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious 
adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% 
versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke 
(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal 
insufficiency. 
Beneficial effects of Rasilez on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are 
currently unknown. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
No effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled 
study using standard and Holter electrocardiography. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax 
by 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following 
once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial 
dose. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 
135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren 
plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. 
Metabolism and elimination 
The mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged 
compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme 
responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine 
following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is 
approximately 9 l/h. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Exposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose 
administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-
fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more 
pronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible 
mechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. 
Characteristics in patients 
Aliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, 
age, body mass index and ethnicity. 
The AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity 
have no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. 
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal 
insufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between 
0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. 
These observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjustment of the initial dosage of Rasilez is required in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Rasilez is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Concomitant use of Rasilez with 
ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see 
section 4.3). 
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver 
disease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to 
severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No 
carcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in 
rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known 
irritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy 
volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold 
based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. 
Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The 
assays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. 
Reproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or 
teratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal 
development and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The 
doses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than 
the maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). 
Safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or 
cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with 
the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren.

Further information 
1.  WHAT RASILEZ IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Rasilez belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors. Rasilez helps to lower high blood 
pressure. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. Angiotensin II 
causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the amount of 
angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. 
High blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, 
it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart 
failure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk 
of developing these disorders.

3. 
HOW TO TAKE RASILEZ 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always take Rasilez exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
People who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel 
quite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the 
best results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you are 
feeling well. 
The usual starting dose is one 150 mg tablet once daily. 
Depending on how you respond to the treatment your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of one 
300 mg tablet once daily. Your doctor may prescribe Rasilez together with other medicines used to 
treat high blood pressure. 
Method of administration 
It is recommended that you take the tablets with some water. You should take Rasilez with a light 
meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. You should not take Rasilez together with 
grapefruit juice. 
If you take more Rasilez than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many Rasilez tablets, consult a doctor immediately. You may 
require medical attention. 
If you forget to take Rasilez 
If you forget to take a dose of Rasilez, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next dose at 
its usual time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet 
at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
4.

Further information 
1.  WHAT RASILEZ IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Rasilez belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors. Rasilez helps to lower high blood 
pressure. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. Angiotensin II 
causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the amount of 
angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. 
High blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, 
it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart 
failure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk 
of developing these disorders.

61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always take Rasilez exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
People who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel 
quite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the 
best results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you are 
feeling well. 
The usual starting dose is one 150 mg tablet once daily. 
Depending on how you respond to the treatment your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of one 
300 mg tablet once daily. Your doctor may prescribe Rasilez together with other medicines used to 
treat high blood pressure. 
Method of administration 
It is recommended that you take the tablets with some water. You should take Rasilez with a light 
meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. You should not take Rasilez together with 
grapefruit juice. 
If you take more Rasilez than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many Rasilez tablets, consult a doctor immediately. You may 
require medical attention. 
If you forget to take Rasilez 
If you forget to take a dose of Rasilez, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next dose at 
its usual time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet 
at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for delamanid, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
In view of available data on paradoxical reactions from the literature and spontaneous reports, and in 
view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between 
delamanid and ‘Paradoxical drug reaction’ is at least a reasonable possibility. In addition, in view of 
available data on nightmares from clinical trial PHOENIx (study 242-201-00004) including in some cases 
a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship 
between delamanid and ‘Nightmare’ is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the 
product information of products containing delamanid should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for delamanid the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing delamanid is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

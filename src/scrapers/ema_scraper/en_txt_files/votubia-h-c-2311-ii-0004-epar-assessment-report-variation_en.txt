1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a congenital disorder that results from mutations in one of two 
genes, TSC1 gene (encoding hamartin/TSC1) or TSC2 gene (encoding tuberin/TSC2). Estimates for 
prevalence are in the range of 1 in 6000 live births1 and of 1.04 cases per 10,000 persons for the EU. 
Approximately 51,972 persons are affected in the EU. 
TSC1 and TSC2 are proteins that act upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signalling pathway. Hamartin/TSC1 (a 140-kD protein) interacts with tuberin/TSC2 (200-kD protein) 
with high affinity to form heterodimers, which then block the mTOR signalling pathway leading to cell 
growth (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1: 
Interactions of the TSC1–TSC2 Complex with Multiple Cellular Pathways 
Mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and the loss of TSC1 or TSC2 activity results in the expression of 
deficient proteins which constitutively up-regulate mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and gives rise to the 
condition of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). The tuberin-hamartin complex regulates mTOR

activation through inhibition of Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a member of the small 
GTPase superfamily, which is highly expressed in the brain.  
TSC is characterised by often disabling neurologic disorders in TSC patients, including subendymal 
giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), epilepsy, mental retardation, and autism. Additional major features of 
the disease comprise facial angiofibromas, renal angiomyolipomas (AML), and pulmonary 
lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM). Angiomyolipomas among patients diagnosed with sporadic LAM are 
usually unilateral, small, and solitary, while those among patients diagnosed with TSC are typically 
bilateral, larger, and multiple, and more prone to hemorrhage2. 
The clinical diagnosis of TSC is made when a patient has at least 2 major, or 1 major and 2 minor 
features (Gomez criteria) from the following table:

Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are the most common renal manifestation of TSC, occurring in approximately 
60% to 80% of patients with TSC, and typically develop in later childhood and adolescence3, 4, 5 . In 
general, renal involvement in TSC is common and potentially serious, only second to CNS 
complications as a cause of mortality in these patients6. AMLs are hamartomas comprised of abnormal 
blood vessels, immature smooth muscle cells, and adipose tissue. Two major complications are 
associated with renal AML. The first and more dramatic is Wunderlich syndrome, a retro-peritoneal 
hemorrhage originating in the angiomyolipoma that may be life-threatening and often requires urgent 
surgical intervention. The second major morbidity is the insidious encroachment of the 
angiomyolipoma on normal renal tissue, which may lead to renal failure and the need for dialysis. 
Patients with LAM (associated with TSC or occurring sporadically) also experience multiple pulmonary 
function abnormalities, the most common of which are reductions in airflow (FEV1), forced vital 
capacity (FVC), and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO). Cystic destruction of lung tissue, 
impaired gaseous exchange, respiratory failure, and ultimately death occur in most of these patients. 
While the rate of progression is variable, most patients survive between 10 and 20 years following

diagnosis. Two natural history studies found that loss of FEV1 averages 80 to 100 mL per year. Lung 
transplantation remains the only viable option for end-stage disease7,8 .  
The primary reason for intervention in patients with renal angiomyolipoma is to alleviate symptoms 
such as pain or hemorrhage. Angiomyolipomas appear to grow over time, and there is evidence of an 
association between lesion size and hemorrhage9, 10,11,12. When patients experience sudden and 
potentially life-threatening hemorrhages, they are likely to result in total nephrectomy13. Partial or 
nephron-sparing nephrectomies run the risk of significant haemorrhage.  
An alternative to the invasive treatment of surgery is embolization of angiomyolipomas. Embolization is 
currently regarded the best treatment for large (> 4 cm) angiomyolipomas. This procedure obliterates 
the blood supply to the angiomyolipoma and reduces the risk of hemorrhage. However, embolization is 
also associated with significant side effects; an estimated 85% of patients develop post-embolization 
syndrome, including fever and pain. Repeat embolization procedures are required in 0% to 40% of 
patients due to recurrence of lesions14, 15. Embolization and surgical therapies can successfully treat 
solitary lesions. However, there is no current treatment for the clinical problem of coalescent renal 
angiomyolipomas that replace renal parenchyma. When bleeding occurs under these circumstances, it 
can be impossible to identify which lesion is the source and therefore embolization cannot be 
performed. There is a need for a renal-sparing approach and preservation of renal function for 
treatment of patients with angiomyolipomas16. 
Everolimus (Afinitor/Certican/Votubia/Zortress) is a selective inhibitor of mTOR. Everolimus was 
initially developed to prevent allograft rejection following solid organ transplantation. The development 
program was expanded in 2002 to treat patients with advanced renal cell cancer (RCC), advanced 
neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and metastatic breast cancer (Afinitor) and for patients with SEGA 
associated TSC.  
The MAH has applied for the following indication:  
“Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with renal angiomyolipoma 
Votubia is indicated for the treatment of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who have 
renal angiomyolipoma not requiring immediate surgery.”

1.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a summary of literature data on the role of the mTOR pathway in the development 
of angiomyolipoma (AML), SEGA and other TSC-related manifestations. An updated pharmacokinetic 
written summary and tabulated summary were submitted with new data on the potential of everolimus 
to inhibit hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) mediated uptake. 
1.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Angiomyolipoma and other perivascular epithelioid cell tumors linked with Tsc 1 / 2 mutations, such as 
SEGA, exhibit sustained activation of the mTOR pathway17,18. 
There is in vivo evidence that inhibiting mTORC1 in preclinical rodent models of TSC or mouse 
angiomyolipoma-derived human tumor xenograft models reduces tumor formation and growth 19, 20, 21, 
22, 21. In a mouse model for renal tumour development23 where ENU (Nethyl-N-nitrosourea, an 
alkylating agent) was used to enhance Tsc2+- kidney tumor development, everolimus was able to 
suppress tumor development during a 4 week treatment period, with a 99% reduction in tumor cell 
mass (see Figure 2).

Dot blot analysis of gross kidney tumor score (A) and microscopic kidney tumor score (B) in ENU treated Tsc2+- 
treated mice at age 24 weeks that received either placebo or everolimus (10 mg/kg p.o 5 d/week).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential inhibitory effect of everolimus (up to 25 µM) on the transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
was examined using HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Transport 
activity was evaluated by comparing the extent of probe substrates accumulation in cells that express 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 compared to control cells. Everolimus reduced [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide 
accumulation into OATP1B1-expressing cells in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, everolimus 
reduced [3H]estradiol-17βglucuronide and [3H]cholecystokinin-8 accumulation into OATP1B3-
expressing cells in a dose dependent manner. The inhibition of OATP1B1and OATP1B3 transport 
activity in the presence of the highest concentration of everolimus tested (25 µM) was essentially 
complete. The estimated IC50 value for inhibition of OATP1B1-mediated [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide 
uptake was 96 ng/mL (0.10 µM). The estimated IC50 values for inhibition of OATP1B3mediated 
[3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake and [3H]cholecystokinin-8 uptake by everolimus were 604 
ng/mL (0.63 µM) and 546 ng/mL (0.57 µM), respectively.

The ERA included a Phase I and Phase II assessment according to the Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. The updated environmental risk assessment indicated that everolimus 
does not constitute a significant risk to surface waters, sewage treatment plants and groundwater. As 
a precautionary measure, patients should be advised not to dispose of unused everolimus via domestic 
sewage but in according to local requirements, as stated in the SmPC section 6.6. The study on Algae 
Growth Inhibition (OECD 201, NOTOX Study No. 246757) did not fulfill the criteria of validity according 
to the given guideline. Thus, to further characterise the environmental risk assessment, the data from 
the following studies need to be provided: Bioconcentration factor in fish (OECD 305), the study on 
Algae Growth Inhibition (OECD 201,) and the sediment-dwelling larvae of the midge species 
Chironomus riparius (OECD 218). 
1.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new information on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology of everolimus was 
submitted. The MAH has submitted a summary of literature data on the role of the mTOR pathway in 
the development of angiomyolipoma (AML), SEGA and other TSC-related manifestations to support the 
new indication. The summary of literature data in this application is acceptable given that the  
mechanism of action of everolimus has been widely studied and the body of non-clinical data 
submitted previously. 
For the evaluation of the environmental risk assessment, since the value log Kow 4.0 of the n-
octanol/water partition coefficient exceeded the trigger for an assessment of the bioaccumulation 
potential, the MAH was asked to provide a study on the determination of the Bioconcentration factor in 
fish (OECD 305). The study on Algae Growth Inhibition (OECD 201, NOTOX Study No. 246757) did not 
fulfill the criteria of validity according to the given guideline and as a consequence a new study on 
Algae Growth Inhibition (OECD 201) should be performed. In summary, in order to further consider the 
effect of everolimus on the environment, the MAH was asked to provide the study with the sediment-
dwelling larvae of the midge species Chironomus riparius (OECD 218), the additional algae study 
(OECD 201) and the planned fish bioconcentration study (OECD 305) by 31-May-2013.

1.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical literature submitted was considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of 
non-clinical aspects for the product everolimus in the new clinical indication. The submitted data 
suggest that everolimus may have activity in TSC-associated angiomyolipoma non-clinical models. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
 
The MAH is recommended to provide a fully updated environmental risk assessment addressing 
all outstanding concerns and including all three remaining studies, i.e. the study with the 
sediment-dwelling larvae of the midge species Chironomus riparius (OECD 218), the additional 
algae study (OECD 201) and the planned fish bioconcentration study (OECD 305) by 31-May-
2013.

No data were submitted for distribution studies. 
Elimination 
No data was submitted for elimination studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A secondary efficacy objective from the pivotal study M2302 was to characterize the PK of everolimus 
in terms of pre-dose (Cmin) and two hours post-dose (C 2h) exposure in the double-blind treatment 
period. The C 2h samples were collected to allow for determination of concentrations near the true peak 
concentration (C max) for everolimus. 
During the blinded treatment phase of the trial, pre-dose trough blood samples for the determination 
of everolimus Cmin were collected immediately prior to dosing at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48. Pre-dose 
blood samples were to be collected prior to dosing on the same day of the trial and approximately 24 ± 
4 hours after the patient’s last dose of study drug, following 5 days of consistent dosing of the same 
dose and dose schedule (steady-state conditions). 
A PK blood sample (2 ml) was taken 2 hours (± 30 minutes, C2h) after dose administration at Weeks 2, 
4, 12, 24 and 48.  
Everolimus blood concentrations in whole blood were determined by a liquid chromatography-mass 
spectroscopy method. The method has a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.3 ng/ml. 
PK profile of everolimus over time 
C min and C 2h summary statistics by the planned dose and time window in patients treated with 
everolimus during the double-blind period are presented in Table 3. Median Cmin and C 2h appeared to 
be stable over time. Inter-subject variability in C min ranged from 56.4% to 104.5% and inter-subject 
variability in C2h ranged from 43.8% to 56.7%. 
Table 3: 
Everolimus concentrations (ng/ml) by planned dose and time window

Dose reduction to 5 mg/day was required for a low number of patients (Table 4). In general, the mean 
C min and C 2h observed with the 5 mg daily dose was within the range observed in previous everolimus

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Everolimus C min and C 2h in patients using and not using EIAED at randomization 
Everolimus Cmin and C2h was analysed in patients using and not using enzyme inducing anti-epileptic 
drugs (EIAED). The mean Cmin values at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were: 
  Using EIAED at randomization: 4.36 ± 1.70 ng/ml (n=8), 4.77 ± 2.78 ng/ml (n=8), 4.30 ± 
1.96 ng/ml (n=10), 5.10 ± 3.02 ng/ml (n=9), and 8.26 ± 3.94 ng/ml (n=3), respectively 
  Not using EIAED at randomization: 8.38 ± 4.41 ng/ml (n=35), 8.38 ± 4.39 ng/ml (n=36), 
9.94 ± 7.07ng/ml (n=39), 10.41 ± 9.47 ng/ml (n=37), and 12.30 ± 13.31 ng/ml (n=12), 
respectively 
Mean C 2h values at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were: 
  Using EIAED at randomization: 21.38 ± 11.03 ng/ml (n=10), 18.98 ± 8.82 ng/ml (n=9), 26.92 
± 11.97 ng/ml (n=10), 25.94 ± 14.37 ng/ml (n=10), and 18.78 ± 12.47 ng/ml (n=2), 
respectively 
  Not using EIAED at randomization: 36.04 ± 15.37 ng/ml (n=45), 33.57 ± 14.82 ng/ml (n=40), 
36.13 ± 15.32 ng/ml (n=46), 42.60 ± 22.75 ng/ml (n=40), and 35.61 ± 18.55 ng/ml (n=12), 
respectively 
Mean Cmin and C2h values were lower in patients using EIAED at randomization compared to the 
respective PK parameters in patients who were not using EIAED at randomization.

Target angiomyolipoma lesions 
The relationship between the absolute change from baseline in angiomyolipoma lesion volume and 
time-normalized Cmin is illustrated in Figure 3. While there was no apparent relationship between the 
absolute change from baseline in angiomyolipoma volume and Cmin in any subgroup of patients with 
different categories of angiomyolipoma volume at baseline (< 100 cm3, 100-200 cm3, and > 200 
cm3), it appeared that subgroups of patients with a larger angiomyolipoma volume at baseline had a 
larger extent of reduction in angiomyolipoma volume from baseline. The analysis using a linear mixed 
model for the absolute change from baseline in angiomyolipoma lesion volume resulted in a slope of 
8.124 (cm3) (95% CI: -18.8, 2.55) per 1-unit log-Cmin increase, which was not statistically 
significant.

versus time-normalized everolimus Cmin between last and current tumor 
assessment (by sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline) 
(double-blind period) (Confirmed PK Sample Set) – Study M2302 
No apparent difference in response-exposure relationship was observed among subgroups of patients 
of differing categories of angiomyolipoma volume at baseline (< 100 cm3, 100-200 cm3, and > 200 
cm3). Results of a linear mixed model indicated a 10.37% (95% CI=-15.96%, -4.40%) tumor size 
reduction from baseline for a 2-fold Cmin increase; this was statistically significant at the 5% level. 
An analysis was performed to compare the angiomyolipoma response rate between the groups of 
patients with time-averaged Cmin ≤ 5 ng/mL and >5 ng/mL.

The C min at Week 2 was considered unlikely to reflect an accurate representation of the exposure 
related to best overall response.  As a result, time-averaged Cmin was estimated from Study Day 1 to 
the day of: 
  Response for responders 
 
 
Progression for patients with PD 
Last tumor assessment for patients with SD or NE (not evaluable) 
Response rates were higher for patients with a time-averaged Cmin >5 ng/mL than for those with Cmin 
≤ 5 ng/mL (Table 5). Of note, when running an alternate analysis excluding patients with a best 
overall response of NE from the denominator, the difference in response rate between patients with a 
time averaged Cmin ≤ 5 ng/mL vs. those >5 ng/mL was more pronounced. This may in part be 
explained by uncertainty related to patients with NE disease who may have responded.

Target SEGA lesions 
There was no apparent relationship between the absolute or percent change from baseline in SEGA 
volume and C min for patients with a SEGA volume at baseline < 1 cm3 and between 1-3 cm3. The 
relationship for patients with a SEGA volume at baseline between 3-5 cm3 and > 5 cm3 was not 
interpretable due to small sample sizes (n ≤ 3).  
Skin lesions 
The median time-normalized C min was higher in patients with partial response (PR) than in patients 
with stable disease (SD) response at Week 12, while the Cmin was comparable in patients with PR and 
SD by Week 24. 
1.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the pivotal trial for this application, M2302, exposure-efficacy relationship was investigated for 
overall 3 endpoints of efficacy i.e. target angiomyolipoma lesions, target SEGA lesions and skin lesions. 
No exposure-response relationship in AML (and SEGA) lesions has been established in spite of the high 
objective response rate (ORR). This is in some contrast to the granted SEGA indication where at least a 
weak relationship could be found. For SEGA there seems to be weak correlation in-between exposure 
(cmin) and SEGA volume reduction resulting in therapeutic target Cmin ranges to be monitored after a 
recommended starting dose. Analysis of the interaction between angiomyolipoma lesion volume at 
baseline and absolute volume reduction suggests that the exposure-response relationship may have 
varied in patients with differing angiomyolipoma lesion volumes at baseline.  
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
Page 12/75
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The data on the relationship between angiomyolipoma response rates and time averaged Cmin 
category shows that there is a reduction in the response rate when Cmin is below 5 ng/mL. The 
difference was considered clinically meaningful. Taken into account the limitations of the post-hoc 
analysis, the CHMP considered that there may be a risk of underdosing below a threshold of 5 ng/mL 
with the risk of a lower effect on reduction of tumour volume. As a precaution, the option of 
therapeutic monitoring should be considered in patients treated for AML in order to avoid 
underexposure after treatment changes or with hepatic impairment. Statements informing the 
prescriber of the risk of lower treatment effect with lower Cmin have been introduced in section 4.2 
and 5.1 of the SmPC. Whereas for SEGA therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is required, for AML, in 
section 4.2, the recommendation for TDM is as follows “Therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus 
blood concentrations, using a validated assay, is an option to be considered for patients treated for 
renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC (see section 5.1) after initiation of or change in co-
administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) or after any change in 
hepatic status (Child-Pugh) (see Hepatic impairment below and section 5.2).” and in Section 5.1, the 
statement includes “Post-hoc sub-group analysis of EXIST-2 (study CRAD001M2302) demonstrated 
that angiomyolipoma response rate is reduced below the threshold of 5 ng/ml (Table 6).”. Further 
recommendation on the dosing in hepatic impaired patients is also stated in section 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC. 
EIAEDs are strong CYP3A4 inducers and are known to decrease the exposure to everolimus. Patients 
with baseline use of EIAED had a lower exposure (Cmin) to everolimus than EIAED non-use but the 
difference of the effect compared to placebo in both strata was nearly the same. However, considering 
the risk of underexposure to everolimus, it was necessary to update the recommendations concerning 
co-administration of everolimus with potents CYP3A4 inducers and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC for patients with renal AML associated with TSC. 
1.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The analysis of exposure-response relationship in terms both of AML and SEGA response, are 
supporting the dosing concept as proposed for the SmPC of a fixed dose of 10 mg with the possibility 
of dose-modifications triggered by tolerability of AEs (and co-administration of EIAEDs) without 
therapeutic drug monitoring for a Cmin target range. However, the option of therapeutic dose 
monitoring should be considered after treatment changes or with hepatic impairment. 
1.5.  Clinical efficacy  
1.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-finding trial was performed for the new indication. The investigated (and 
recommended) dose of 10 mg everolimus daily was based partially on preclinical investigations on the 
basis of the relationship between systemic drug exposure and pharmacodynamic markers within the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR pathway24 and clinical experience in 
the broader everolimus phase-I/II program. Daily administration of everolimus 5 mg or 10 mg 
completely inhibited the phosphorylation of S6 kinase in tumor and skin samples of patients, whereas

inhibition of 4E-BP1 and eIF-4G was partial with the 5- mg dose and 10-mg daily dosing was required 
to achieve complete inhibition25. 
The goal for a target posology for renal AML associated with TSC was to achieve an everolimus Cmin 
similar to that observed in earlier oncology trials and in SEGA studies that had an acceptable safety 
and tolerability of everolimus observed in phase II trials26, 27, 28. The dose 10 mg everolimus per day is 
the dose recommended in RCC and is approximately the same as investigated in study M2301. 
However the current recommended dose in the Votubia SmPC for SEGA is lower than the 
recommended dose for the new indication. The recommended posology for renal AML associated with 
TSC in the SmPC is 10 mg once daily. 
1.5.2.  Main study 
Study CRAD001M2302 (Study M2302):  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study of RAD001 in the treatment of angiomyolipoma in patients with either Tuberous 
Sclerosis Complex (TSC) or Sporadic Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). 
Methods 
Study M2302 is a double-blind, 2:1 randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, international, 
multi-center Phase-III trial of a once daily oral dose of everolimus 10 mg vs. matching placebo in adult 
(≥18 years) patients with angiomyolipoma associated with clinically definitive diagnosis of either TSC 
or sporadic LAM. The null-hyphotesis (Ho RREVEROLIMUS ≤ RRPLACEBO) characterize the trial as a trial 
testing one-sided for superiority of everolimus. 
Study M2302 was a stratified trial. The original protocol comprised  
 
 
 
TSC and use of EIAED vs. 
TSC and non-use of EIAED vs. 
sporadic LAM 
based on the assumption that use of EIADS may affect (by interactions, primarily on the CYP3A4 level) 
the effect of everolimus, and patients with sporadic LAM requiring only exceptionally EIADS. 
The study had overall 4 treatment phases as per the flow chart below (Figure 4).

the primary population in all analysis of efficacy. Further pre-specified analysis population were 
  Safety Set (SS): The Safety Set consists of all patients who received at least one dose of the 
double-blind study drug with a valid post-baseline assessment. The Safety Set was the 
population used in the assessments of safety for the double-blind period. 
 
Per Protocol Set (PPS):The Per Protocol Set (PPS) consists of all patients from the FAS without 
any major protocol deviations, who were evaluable for efficacy and who had completed a 
minimum exposure requirement. However, if a patient had angiomyolipoma progression, 
discontinued for an AE, or died before the minimum exposure requirement could be met or 
before he/she could become evaluable for efficacy, that patient was still to be included in the 
PPS. If a patient had a non-evaluable best overall response but discontinued due to an AE in 
the first 84 days, then the patient should be included in the PPS; otherwise if the 
discontinuation due to an AE occurs after 84 days then the patient should be excluded from the 
PPS. The PPS was used for a supportive analysis of the primary endpoint.

the final primary analysis were known), all patients who had not progressed and 
were still receiving study treatment were be given the option of starting open-label 
everolimus. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the angiomyolipoma response rate on everolimus versus 
placebo in patients with angiomyolipomata associated with either TSC or sporadic LAM. 
Secondary objectives were: 
 
To compare everolimus versus placebo with respect to: 
1. Time to angiomyolipoma progression 
2. Skin lesion response rate 
3. Change from baseline in plasma angiogenic molecules, e.g., VEGF, basic FGF, PLGF, soluble VEGF 
receptor1, and soluble VEGF receptor2 
4. Renal function assessed using calculated creatinine clearance 
5. Safety as assessed by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 3.0 
  Secondary objectives only in the everolimus treatment arm: 
1. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 in this patient population, specifically in terms of 
exposure 
2. Describe the duration of angiomyolipoma response, the time to angiomyolipoma response and the 
duration of skin lesion response 
Further exploratory objectives were: 
1. Changes in additional TSC-associated lesions that are documented at baseline, namely 
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), tubers and subependymal nodules (SENs) will be

(SSQ) 
6. Mutational analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 genes correlated with angiomyolipoma response rate and 
time to progression 
7. To assess the relationship between everolimus concentration and safety/efficacy endpoints 
8. To assess the incidence and reasons for angiomyolipoma-related surgery in each treatment arm 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of study M2302, angiomyolipoma response rate, in terms of a prospectively 
planned variable, was defined as (wording as of the original protocol): 
 
the proportion of patients with an angiomyolipoma response, and using data from the 
Independent Central Radiological Review of MRIs and the AE CRF page (to identify 
angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of grade 2 or worse as defined by NCI CTCAE version 3.0) 
Angiomyolipoma response was defined as: 
 
a reduction in angiomyolipoma volume of at least 50% relative to baseline, where 
angiomyolipoma volume is the sum of the volumes of all target angiomyolipomata identified at 
baseline, and confirmed with a second scan performed at least 4 weeks later 
In addition, angiomyolipoma response required satisfying all of the following criteria: 
  no new angiomyolipomata ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter identified 
  neither kidney increases in volume by more than 20% from nadir (where nadir is the lowest 
kidney volume obtained for the patient, separately for each kidney, previously in the trial 
including baseline) 
 
the patient did not have any angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of grade 2 or worse (as defined 
by NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) 
Key secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare everolimus against placebo with respect to time to 
angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate.  
Time to angiomyolipoma progression 
Time to angiomyolipoma progression (TTAP) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of first documented angiomyolipoma progression. 
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
Page 18/75
 
 
 
 
 
 
Angiomyolipoma progression was defined as one or more of the following: 
  An increase from nadir of ≥ 25% in angiomyolipoma volume to a value greater than baseline 
(where angiomyolipoma volume was the sum of the volumes of all target lesions identified at 
baseline and where nadir was the lowest angiomyolipoma volume achieved by the patient 
previously in the trial, including baseline) 
 
The appearance of a new angiomyolipoma ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter  
  An increase from nadir of ≥ 20% in the volume of either kidney to a value greater than 
baseline, where nadir was the lowest kidney volume obtained for the patient, separately for 
each kidney, previously measured in the trial (including baseline) 
  Angiomyolipoma-related bleeding ≥ grade 2 (CTCAE Version 3.0) 
Skin lesion response 
Skin lesions were assessed by the investigators; response was evaluated using the Physician’s Global 
Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA). Digital photographs of all skin lesions were taken at baseline, 
every 12 weeks thereafter, and at End of Treatment and were archived at the central review facility. 
Skin lesions resulting from TSC include hypomelanotic macules, the shagreen patch, periungual or 
subungual fibromas, facial angiofibromas and/or forehead plaques. 
Sample size 
Sample size was determined using simulation to guarantee a study power of at least 90%. As a 
starting value, NQuery (Version 4.0) indicated that for an analysis using Fisher’s exact test, a total of 
99 patients would provide 93% power at a 2:1 randomization. 
For the one-sided null-hypothesis p was set to 0.025. The angiomyolipoma response rate in the 
placebo arm was expected to be close to 0%. The angiomyolipoma response rate on everolimus was 
expected to be at least 20%. The relative prevalence of the categories of the stratification factors was 
expected to be 3:3:2 (assumption 25% with sporadic LAM, the remainder 75% of patients with TSC 
distributed nearly 1:1 for use/non-use of EIAED). 
Table 7: 
Sensitivity of study power to treatment by stratum interaction assuming 3:3:2 
ratio of patients across strata 1-3 – Study M2302 
Randomisation 
The patients were randomized using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). The patients were 
randomized 2:1 for 3 strata.

Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double blinded study. Central laboratory and central radiology were to remain blinded 
to treatment allocation from the time of randomization until final database lock. Treating physician 
could be unblinded in case of progression.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was a comparison of the angiomyolipoma response rates in the everolimus and 
placebo arms using an exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test at the onesided 2.5% level, 
analyzed in the FAS. The test was stratified by the modified stratification factor (use of EIAED versus 
non-use of EIAED). 
The statistical hypotheses were: 
H0: RREVEROLIMUS ≤ RRPLACEBO versus H1: RREVEROLIMUS > RRPLACEBO where RR is the 
probability of angiomyolipoma response on everolimus or on placebo. 
Angiomyolipoma response rates were summarized by treatment group in terms of percentage rates 
and exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The difference in response rates between treatment groups 
and the exact 95% CI were presented.  
The data cut-off date for the final analysis was 6 months after the last patient had been randomized. 
All data up to the data cut-off date (30-Jun-2011) were included in the analysis, whether they arose 
from patients on double-blind treatment or on open-label everolimus. However, the focus of the 
statistical analyses was on data from the double-blind phase of the trial, with data collected during the 
open-label phase being reported in separate data presentations. 
Key secondary endpoints 
In order to be able to make a claim with respect to time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin 
lesion response rate, a multiplicity adjustment was implemented. Multiplicity was controlled via a 
hierarchical closed testing procedure to ensure that the overall Type I error rate of the trial was 
maintained at 2.5% (one-sided). Interpretation of the p-values was dependent on the hierarchy used 
in the closed testing strategy. 
Based on clinical judgment, the key secondary efficacy endpoints were ranked and the closed testing 
procedure was as follows: 
 
 
 
test primary endpoint of angiomyolipoma response rate 
test time to angiomyolipoma progression 
test skin lesion response rate 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), the primary population for the assessment of efficacy was defined 
according to the Intention-to-Treat principle and consisted of all randomized patients. Patients were to 
be analyzed according to the treatment that they were assigned to at randomization.

Recruitment 
A total of 118 patients were enrolled and randomized into this trial from 24 sites in 11 countries. The 
highest enrolling countries were the United States (32 patients), Germany (27), The Netherlands (13), 
and Japan (10).

Of note, although none of the patients in the everolimus arm had disease progression as the reason for 
discontinuation, there were 3 patients (3.8%) from the everolimus arm that actually met the criteria 
for angiomyolipoma progression according to central radiology review but had not discontinued from 
the trial because discontinuation for disease progression was at investigator discretion and not 
mandatory. 
Following blinded data review during data validation prior to database lock, it was observed that only 8 
patients were stratified as having sporadic LAM at randomization. Upon further review of the baseline 
data collected on the CRF, only 5 of these 8 patients were correctly stratified as having sporadic LAM. 
As patients with sporadic LAM were not expected to be using EIAED, as confirmed by the CRF data, it 
was considered appropriate to combine patients in the stratum “TSC and EIAED non-use” with patients 
in the stratum “sporadic LAM”. Therefore, the newly modified stratification factor to be used in all 
stratified statistical analyses would contain only two categories: EIAED use versus EIAED non-use at 
randomization. This change to the statistical analysis plan was made prior to the database lock and 
unblinding of the data. 
The protocol was amended twice. The protocol was amended two times. The key features of each 
amendment are given below: 
Amendment 1 (dated 29-Mar-2010) was issued after the inclusion of 21% of patients and, among 
other changes, introduced the following changes: 
• Allowed assessment of angiomyolipomata to be carried out by CT scan as well as by MRI with the 
condition that the same imaging modality for assessment of the kidneys must be used throughout the 
trial for each individual patient 
• Patients who met pre-specified criteria at baseline would now be screened for hepatitis B 
(HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) at baseline, using the following tests: HBV DNA, HBV surface antigen 
(HBsAg), HBV surface antibody (HBsAb), HBV core antibody (HBcAb), HCV RNA-PCR. Hepatitis B and C 
management guidelines were added for patients who are active prior to the implementation of 
Amendment 1 
• Harmonized the visit window for all visits 
• Added revised table of PgP substrates, inhibitors, and inducers 
• Added provision for an End of Treatment scan if the patient discontinued for reasons other than 
progression and enough time had passed since their most recent scan 
• Added instructions for the permitted local laboratory collections for the 6 week visit for patients in 
the United States for whom travel to the clinic was difficult 
• Changed the requirement of a confirmatory scan from “at least 4 weeks” after the first assessment of 
response to “approximately 12” (and no sooner than 8 weeks) after the first assessment of response 
• Changed the confirmation of skin lesion response from “at least 4 weeks” after the first response 
assessment to “approximately 12 weeks” (and no sooner than 8 weeks) after the first response 
assessment 
Amendment 2 (dated 13-May-2010) contained administrative changes to the Visit Evaluation 
Schedules as well as editorial changes and clarifications. 
Major protocol deviations (those leading to exclusion from the PPS) were observed in 2 patients, one 
randomized to the everolimus arm and one to the placebo arm (both failed to meet the predefined 
entry criteria for angiomyolipoma). In the everolimus arm, one patient did not have a clinically definite

diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma and had no angiomyolipoma ≥ 2 cm in longest diameter at baseline 
per local or central radiology review. In the placebo arm, one patient had no angiomyolipoma ≥ 2 cm in 
longest diameter at baseline per central radiology review. Minor deviations that were not considered 
clinically meaningful were reported in 67.1% of patients in the everolimus arm and 64.1% of patients 
in the placebo arm. 
Baseline data 
The two treatment groups had a median age of 32 years and 29 years in the everolimus and placebo 
arms, respectively (Table 9): 
Table 9: 
 Demographic characteristics (Full Analysis Set) – Study M2302 
Patients in trial M2302 can be considered as representative of the target patient population. All 
patients had a clinical diagnosis of TSC or of sporadic LAM (Table 10). In the everolimus arm, a single 
patient did not have a confirmed angiomyolipoma. In Table 11, this patient is counted (but as having 
zero target lesions and a “not applicable” longest diameter of angiomyolipoma).

The distribution of patients in the different analysis populations is presented in Table 13. 
Sixteen patients (20.3%) in the everolimus arm were excluded from the PPS one patient (1.3%) had a 
major protocol deviation (did not meet protocol inclusion criteria for a clinically definite diagnosis of 
renal angiomyolipoma and angiomyolipoma ≥ 2 cm in longest diameter at baseline), 12 patients 
(15.2%) were not evaluable for efficacy, and 5 patients (6.3%) had insufficient exposure to 
everolimus. Five patients (12.8%) in the placebo arm were excluded from the PPS: one (2.6%) had a 
major protocol deviation (did not meet protocol inclusion criterion for angiomyolipoma ≥ 2 cm in 
longest diameter at baseline), and 5 (12.8%) were non-evaluable for efficacy.

Time to angiomyolypoma progression 
A summary of the time to angiomyolipoma progression is shown in Table 15 and Figure 5. There were 
3 (3.8%) patients in the everolimus arm and 8 (20.5%) patients in the placebo arm that had 
angiomyolipoma progression. There was prolongation of time to angiomyolipoma progression in the 
everolimus arm compared to the placebo arm (HR 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.37; p<0.0001). Median time 
to angiomyolipoma progression was 11.37 months in the placebo arm and was not reached in the 
everolimus arm. The 3 cases of angiomyolipoma progression in the everolimus arm were assessed on 
trial days 114, 337, and 671.

Skin lesion response rate 
The skin lesion response was determined for the 114 patients with ≥ 1 skin lesion at baseline (Table 
16). There was a partial response 9PR) observed with everolimus compared to no response observe in 
the placebo arm.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
A subgroup analysis was conducted to determine whether the angiomyolipoma response in all pre-
defined subgroups correlated with the results from the primary endpoint. The results are shown in 
Figure 6.  
Figure 6: 
Angiomyolipoma response rates by subgroups (double-blind period) (Full 
Analysis Set) – Study M2302 
As depicted graphically in the waterfall plots (Figure 7), 95.5% of evaluable patients in the everolimus 
arm experienced a reduction in the sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions relative to 
baseline (per central radiology review). In contrast, in the placebo arm, 59.4% of evaluable patients 
experienced a reduction from baseline. Conversely, only 4.6% of evaluable patients in the everolimus 
arm experienced an increase from baseline, whereas 40.6% of evaluable patients in the placebo arm 
had an increase from baseline in sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions.

Time to angiomyolipoma response 
Time to angiomyolipoma response applies only to the 33 patients in the everolimus arm who achieved 
a partial response. The median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.86 months. The proportions of 
angiomyolipoma responders who responded by 3 months and 6 months were 63.6% and 97.0%, 
respectively. 
Duration of angiomyolipoma response 
No progressions were observed in everolimus-treated patients who achieved a response. 
Angiomyolipoma responses were ongoing for between 10+ and 85+ weeks at the time of the data cut-
off. 
Duration of skin lesion response 
There was no skin lesion progression in the 20 responding patients. Responses were ongoing for 
between 10+ and 84+ weeks at the time of the data cut-off. 
Exploratory efficacy results 
Correlation between angiomyolipoma volume and longest diameter 
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the link between the sum of the longest diameters and 
the sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions. The correlation between these measures was 
evaluated at each assessment by the calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The correlation 
coefficients were > 0.6 at each time point, indicating that there was a positive linear relationship 
between the sum of volumes and the sum of longest diameters in both treatment arms. 
Incidence and reasons for angiomyolipoma surgery 
No patient in either of the treatment arms reported angiomyolipoma surgery during the double-blind 
period. 
SEGA response rate 
SEGA response was evaluated in the subgroup of patients who had at least one SEGA lesion with 
longest diameter ≥ 1.0 cm at baseline (N=52) (Table 18).

Change from baseline in pulmonary function 
In the 5 patients with sporadic LAM and 29 patients with TSC-associated LAM, changes from baseline 
in pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, and DLCO) were assessed over the course of the trial.  
For FEV1, the median percentage change from baseline at Week 24 was: 
 
 
-1.43% in the everolimus arm 
-3.70% in the placebo arm 
For FVC, the median percentage change from baseline at Week 24 was: 
 
-1.25% in the everolimus arm 
  0% in the placebo arm 
For DLCO, the median percentage change from baseline at Week 24 was: 
 
 
-2.73% in the everolimus arm 
-7.57% in the placebo arm 
Change from baseline in neuropsychological assessments 
Results from the neuropsychological assessment analysis were not interpretable because the scales 
used were not validated in several countries that enrolled patients in the trial (Germany, The 
Netherlands, Poland, and Russia).  
Change from baseline in the severity of seizures 
Changes from baseline in the severity of seizures using the SSQ were assessed in those patients who 
were taking antiepileptic drugs at baseline. A total of 10 patients in the everolimus arm and 5 patients 
in the placebo arm filled out the SSQ. There was no difference in median global change score between 
everolimus- and placebo treated patients at Week 24, 3.50 (range: 2.00-4.75) and 3.88 (range: 3.50-
4.75), respectively. 
Analysis of open-label efficacy 
Seven patients that had progressed on placebo entered into the open-label treatment with everolimus 
phase. In these patients, one subject (14.3%) had an angiomyolipoma response, with a time to 
response of 85 days (dating from the start of everolimus treatment) and the duration of response of 
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
Page 31/75
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
92+ days. Five patients (71.4%) had a best response of stable disease and one patient was not 
evaluable as of the cut-off date. All patients continued to receive everolimus. 
Mutational analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 
The results of the TSC1 and TSC2 mutational analyses are presented below: 
Table 19: 
Mutation status of TSC1 and TSC2 – Study M2302 
In the everolimus arm, patients with mutations in TSC2 had an angiomyolipoma response rate of 
48.3% compared to 35.7% in patients with no mutation. In the placebo arm, disease progression was 
seen in patients with TSC2 mutations (3 of 27, or 11.1%) and in patients with no mutation identified 
(5 of 9, or 55.6%). The three patients who experienced disease progression on the everolimus arm all 
had a mutation in the TSC2 gene. 
Angiogenic markers 
The effects of everolimus on tumour vascularisation were examined through the measurement of 
angiogenic growth factors and their corresponding soluble receptors (VEGF, VEGFD, soluble VEGF 
receptor 1 (sVEGFR1), soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR2), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 
placental growth factor (PLGF), c-Kit and collagen type IV). Samples were collected at screening, week 
4, week 12, every 12 weeks until week 48 and at the end of treatment visit, when applicable during 
the double-blind period. Samples were collected immediately prior to drug administration. Results 
demonstrated an initial and sustained decrease of approximately 60% in VEGF-D, an approximate 45% 
decrease in collagen type IV, and an initial and sustained increase in VEGF levels in everolimus-treated 
patients compared to placebo-treated patients.

Supportive study 
Study M2301 
Study M2301 was a prospective, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre Phase-III trial evaluating treatment with everolimus vs. placebo in patients with TSC who 
had SEGA. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was the SEGA response rate and the 3 key 
secondary endpoints were seizure frequency reduction, time to SEGA progression, and skin lesion 
response rate. The majority of patients were enrolled from the paediatric population and a flexible 
dosing regimen was employed (dose titrated to a trough concentration of 5 - 15 ng/mL).  
Results 
Angiomyolipoma response was an exploratory endpoint and was evaluated in the subgroup of patients 
who had at least one angiomyolipoma lesion with the longest diameter ≥ 1.0 cm at baseline (N=44). 
Angiomyolipoma response in the everolimus arm was 53.3% (95% CI: 34.3, 71.7). There were no 
responses in the placebo arm. 
1.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Study M2302 was designed as a randomized, placebo controlled phase III study investigating the 
efficacy and safety of everolimus in the treatment of AML, specifically to measure angiomyolipoma 
response rate. The study had 2 distinct parts, a core phase and an open-extension phase. The design 
of the trial followed CHMP scientific advice and was generally well conducted.  
Concerning the conduct of trial M2302, the definitions of progression were changed, mostly with 
amendment 1. The change of the definition of progression did not have a relevant impact on the 
interpretation of the results or the outcome of the study.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patients with TS and angiomyolipoma greater than 4 cm have a high risk for the development of 
symptoms and may require surgery. In the pivotal trial, patients were required to have at least one 
lesion ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter. Most of the patients in the everolimus arm (84.8%) and patients in 
the placebo arm (79.5%) presented with angiomyolipomas with a longest diameter ≥ 4 cm; such 
patients are considered to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic rupture. Therefore the study population 
represented an AML population which is at risk of complications from AML growth and at at significant 
risk of renal morbidity. 
The study reached its primary endpoint where there was a statistically significant difference between 
the angiomyolipoma response rate in the everolimus arm compared to the placebo arm (41.8% vs 0%, 
respectively; 95% CI 23.5-58.4; p-value <0.0001).  The effect observed is robust and was supported 
by the subgroups analyses.  
Results of the key secondary endpoints support the observed benefit in the primary analysis. 
Treatment with everolimus was associated with a statistically significant difference with respect to 
prolongation of time to angiomyolipoma progression compared to placebo (HR 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 
0.37; p<0.0001). The proportions of angiomyolipoma responders who responded by 3 months was 
63.6% and by 6 months was 97.0%. Angiomyolipoma progressions were observed in 3 patients 
(3.8%) in the everolimus arm and 8 patients (20.5%) in the placebo arm. Median time to 
angiomyolipoma progression was 11.4 months in the placebo arm and was not reached in the 
everolimus arm.  Skin lesion response rate showed a statistically significant difference, the overall 
effect, a 26.0% response rate in the everolimus arm during an observation time of about 10 months. 
No progression of any skin lesion was observed in the placebo arm during this observation time.  None 
of the 41.8% of patients in the everolimus arm who experienced an angiomyolipoma response 
reported disease progression prior to the data cut-off. Responses were ongoing for between 10+ and 
85+ weeks at the time of the data cut-off. Both the proportion of responses and duration of response 
were considered clinically impressive. Prevention of further tumor growth in these patients was 
considered to reflect a relevant clinical benefit. 
1.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered the study acceptable and adequately designed to support the proposed claimed 
indication. The clinical efficacy of everolimus in TSC patients with angiomyolipoma has been 
demonstrated. The study M2302 clearly showed a reduction in the size of angiomyolipomas and 
changes in the growth kinetics of AML target lesions in the observation period.  
The CHMP considered the following measure necessary to further ascertain the long-term benefit  of 
treatment with everolimus such as improvement of disease-related symptoms, prevention of bleeding 
and reduction of embolization/nephrectomy. The measure was included as part of an Annex II 
condition: 
  Submission of the clinical study report comprising the extension phase of Study M2302 
1.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety evaluation in the claimed indication is based on data from 118 patients enrolled into study 
M2302. This includes 79 in the everolimus arm (10 mg dose) and 39 in the placebo arm. The safety 
population consisted of all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment and had ≥ 1 post-
baseline assessment.

Patient exposure 
The median duration of therapy with everolimus was 38.1 weeks (range: 2 to 105) with 26 patients 
(32.9%) exposed to everolimus for a period of ≥ 48 weeks compared to 34.0 weeks (range: 9-112 
weeks) for placebo. Overall exposure was 67.7 patient-years for everolimus and 29.9 patient-years for 
placebo.

An integrated analysis of safety comprising of the safety of only TSC patients in trial C2485, M2301 
and M2302 was performed at the request of the CHMP. Adverse events with a suspected relationship to 
study drug (as assessed by the investigator) in Studies C2485, M2301, and M2302 were pooled and 
subsequently summarised in a single table by preferred term and grading (severity) (Table 26). 
The methodology used to assess all ADRs for inclusion in SmPC section 4.8 was the following: 
• Higher incidence in the everolimus arm than for placebo (with a clinically relevant difference evident) 
• Related ADRs combined (i.e. hypercholesterolaemia and blood cholesterol increased, acne and 
dermatitis acneiform, etc). This included those categories where events have previously been grouped 
(e.g. stomatitis/related events covers stomatitis, mouth ulceration, aphthous stomatitis, etc) 
• Clinical relevance 
• For ADRs with a reported frequency below 1%, terms were added based on medical assessment. 
In addition, changes have been made to text in section c) Description of selected adverse reactions, to 
reflect those ADRs which have been reported in oncology studies and have been included as identified 
risks in the RMP i.e. haemorrhage, cardiac failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, 
impaired wound healing and hyperglycaemia.

Adverse events of special interest 
Stomatitis/related events 
Stomatitis/related events (primarily stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, and mouth ulceration) were 
reported more commonly among patients in the everolimus arm (78.5%) relative to placebo (23.1%). 
In the everolimus arm, most episodes were of grade 1-2 intensity (Figure 8). 
The median time to first occurrence of stomatitis was 0.59 months in the everolimus arm and was not 
reached in the placebo arm.

Figure 8: 
Time to first occurrence of stomatitis – Study M2302 (double-blind period)  
Although stomatitis/related events are one of the most clinically important side effects associated with 
everolimus, most either resolved without treatment or were effectively managed by following protocol 
guidelines, including dose adjustments/interruptions. In all, 14 (17.7%) patients experienced 
stomatitis/related events (primarily stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, and mouth ulceration) in the 
everolimus arm that required a dose adjustment/interruption. No episodes of grade 4 
stomatitis/related events were observed and no patients discontinued from the study or experienced 
an SAE due to a stomatitis/related event. 
Infections 
Although infection was an identified risk associated with everolimus therapy (median follow-up of 9.5 
months), an increased risk of infection when taking everolimus was not evident for these patients with 
TSC (Figure 9). The incidence of infections was similar among patients in the everolimus arm (64.6%) 
compared with patients in the placebo arm (71.8%). The majority of the infections occurred primarily 
in the respiratory tract (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract, sinusitis, and bronchitis) and 
incidences of pneumonia were uncommon (2.5% with everolimus; 2.6% with placebo). There were no 
Grade 3 or 4 infections in the everolimus arm.

Renal events 
Renal events were observed in 5.1% of patients in the everolimus arm and 15.4% of patients in the 
placebo arm. Increases in blood creatinine occurred less frequently in the everolimus arm (1.3%) than 
in the placebo arm (7.7%). Acute renal failure of grade 2 intensity occurred in the everolimus arm 
(2.5%) and both episodes, considered to be SAEs, resolved with treatment. Proteinuria was reported in 
both the everolimus (3.8%) and placebo (7.7%) arms. Two cases of Grade 2 acute renal failure were 
reported in the everolimus arm.

Grading (severity) of renal events by preferred term irrespective of causality – 
Study M2302 supported by Study M2301  
Haemorrhages 
Haemorrhages were reported in 26.6% of patients in the everolimus arm (epistaxis (8.9%), 
menorrhagia (5.1%) and vaginal haemorrhage (5.1%)) and in 15.4% of patients in the placebo arm 
(haematuria (7.7%) and haematoma (5.1%)). All were Grade 1-2. One patient (1.3%) in the 
everolimus arm required a dose reduction or interruption due to a haemorrhage-related event 
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

(menorrhagia). No patients discontinued from the trial or experienced an SAE due to a hemorrhagic 
event.

Grading (severity) of haemorrhage by preferred term irrespective of 
relationship to study drug (double-blind period) (Safety Set) – Study M2302 
Cytopenia 
Initiation of everolimus therapy is frequently associated with a reduction in blood cell counts. 
Clinically notable cytopenias were reported in 22.8% of patients in the everolimus arm and 20.5% of 
patients in the placebo arms. Most were Grade 1-2. Dose interruption or adjustment was required in a 
number of cases in the everolimus arm, although no patient discontinued from the trial or experienced 
an SAE due to a cytopenia.  Leukopenia occurred in both the everolimus arm (10.1%) and the placebo 
arm (7.7%). Neutropenia and lymphopenia occurred more frequently in the placebo arm relative to 
everolimus. 
Rash and similar events 
Clinically notable rash and related events occurred only in the everolimus arm and with an incidence of 
11.4%. No patients discontinued from the trial or experienced an SAE due to rash and related events 
and all events were classified as Grade 1-2. In all, 2.5% rash-related events in the everolimus arm 
required a dose adjustment/interruption. No patient discontinued study drug due to an AE of rash or 
similar events. 
Amenorrhea 
Amenorrhea was reported as an adverse event (preferred term) in 7 of 52 females (13.5%) in the 
everolimus treated group (including two cases of grade 3) compared to one of 26 females (3.8%) in 
the placebo group.. These amenorrhea events were reported as secondary since these patients had 
experienced normal menses previously. Although 8 patients are listed as having amenorrhea, only 7 
patients had true amenorrhea, as oligomenorrhea and delayed menstruation are not considered to 
represent true amenorrhea. Amenorrhea was reported as an adverse reaction in 6 patients (7.6%) 
(see Table 25). Patients’ with amenorrhea were aged 18 to 48 years with the duration of these events 
ranging from 1 to 66+ weeks (as of the cut-off date).

Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions were reported in 2 (2.5%) patients in the everolimus arm and 
1 (2.6%) patient in the placebo arm. One of the patients in the everolimus arm experienced two 
concurrent Grade 3 SAEs in this grouping (angiooedema and hypersensitivity), in addition to an SAE of 
Grade 3 bronchospasm (resulting in study drug discontinuation). 
Non-infectious pneumonitis 
A single patient in the everolimus arm experienced an episode of non-infectious pneumonitis. This 
episode of non-infectious pneumonitis was of grade 2 intensity and was suspected of being drug 
related by the investigator. The patient had a medical history of partial resections of the left and right 
pleura and a biopsy-proven diagnosis of sporadic LAM. The episode of non-infectious pneumonitis was 
reported after 28 days of study drug administration and resolved within 14 days following a temporary 
dose reduction to 5 mg once daily; no additional treatment was needed. 
Thromboembolism 
A single patient in the everolimus arm experienced an episode of deep vein thrombosis. This episode of 
deep vein thrombosis was of grade 1 intensity and was not suspected of being drug related by the 
investigator; none was reported in the placebo arm. 
Hyperglycemia/new onset of diabetes mellitus 
There were no hyperglycemia/new onset of diabetes mellitus reported in M2302 and there were no 
grade 3 or grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for increased fasting blood glucose. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Six (7.6%) patients in the everolimus arm experienced a SAEs that was suspected of being related to 
study drug.

Deaths and other serious or clinically significant adverse events 
One death was reported in the everolimus arm. The patient had a long-standing medical history of 
intractable seizures (treated with lamotrigine and lorazepam). After about 7 months since start of 
everolimus treatment, the patient presented with increased seizure activity, followed by Grade 4 
convulsion, generalised seizure, status epilepticus, and death. The investigator considered that the 
event was related to worsening underlying epilepsy and was not suspected to be related to study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
Biochemical abnormalities of any grade were more commonly reported in patients in the everolimus 
arm than in those in the placebo arm. Biochemical laboratory abnormalities that were more frequent in 
the everolimus arm compared to placebo (≥ 10%): 
• Increased serum triglycerides (+40.3%) 
• Increased serum total cholesterol (+39.9%) 
• Decreased blood phosphorus (+30.2%) 
• Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (+20.1%) 
• Increased serum AST (+13.8%) 
Renal function 
Severe renal impairment (as assessed by a worst post-baseline GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2) was 
observed in 2.5% of patients in the everolimus arm and 7.7% of patients in the placebo arm. Grade 1 
or 2 elevations in serum creatinine were observed in 7.6% of patients in the everolimus arm and 
15.4% in the placebo arm. No patients in either arm experienced a post-baseline Grade 3 or 4 
elevation of serum creatinine.

Haematology 
Haematologic abnormalities were common in the everolimus arm (predominantly Grade 1-2). More 
than 10% of patients experienced clinically relevant decreases in red cells, white cells, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes and platelets. One episode of Grade 3 lymphopenia and one episode of Grade 4 
neutropenia were observed in the everolimus arm. 
Haematological abnormalities that were more frequent in the everolimus arm compared to placebo (≥ 
10%): 
• Decreased haemoglobin (+17.2%) 
• Decreased platelet count (+15.1%) 
• Decreased white blood cells (+15.0%) 
• Decreased lymphocytes (+11.3%)

The majority of patients in Study M2302 did not have any notable abnormalities in blood, glucose, 
ketones, leukocytes, or protein levels in urine in either treatment arm. 
Safety in special populations 
There were no analyses of safety in special populations. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There was no safety analysis related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, patient discontinuations from study drug were infrequent, however more patients discontinued 
treatment in the placebo arm (10.3%) than in the everolimus arm (3.8%) (Table 33).

Table 33: 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, regardless of causality – Study 
M2302 supported by Study M2301 
The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation were disease progression, which was 
reported only in the placebo arm (9 patients, 23.1%) and adverse events. Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation occurred in 3 patients (3.8%) in the everolimus arm and 4 patients (10.3%) in the 
placebo arm. Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation in the everolimus arm were: 
  One patient with concurrent SAEs of Grade 3 hypersensitivity, Grade 3 angiooedema and 
Grade 3 bronchospasm that occurred on Day 15 of treatment (study drug-related) 
  One patient had a SAE of convulsion on Day 240 that led to death due (not study drug-related) 
  One patient with an AE of Grade 2 blood phosphorus decreased that was ongoing from Day 98 
to Day 134 of treatment (study drug-related) 
None of the patients in the everolimus arm had disease progression as the reason for discontinuation. 
Three patients met the criteria for angiomyolipoma progression according to central radiology review 
but have not discontinued from the trial. Discontinuation for disease progression was at investigator 
discretion and not mandatory. As per investigator’s judgment, these patients were still receiving 
clinical benefit (e.g., reduction in volume for some but not all lesions or discordance between target 
lesion response and kidney volume increase judged by the investigator to represent clinical benefit) 
from everolimus. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation in the placebo arm included 2 cases of angiomyolipoma/ 
LAM-related conditions: one patient required hospitalisation for elective bilateral angiomyolipoma 
embolization and one Grade 2 lymphangioleiomyomatosis. 
Three patients discontinued the study treatment for reasons other than AE/abnormal laboratory value, 
disease progression, or death: 
  One patient randomised to everolimus withdrew consent on Day 14 due to fear of potential 
adverse events (no ongoing AEs suspected to be related at the time of withdrawal) 
  One patient randomised to everolimus discontinued on Day 133 due to protocol deviation (the 
patient did not have angiomyolipoma target lesion by central radiologic review) 
  One patient randomised to everolimus discontinued on Day 168 due to administrative reason 
(inability to comply with protocol visits)

Adverse events requiring dose interruption and/or dose reduction 
Adverse events requiring dose interruptions or dose reductions were more frequent in the everolimus 
arm (53.2%) than in the placebo arm (33.3%). Per protocol, investigators were required to interrupt 
study treatment for Grade 2 AEs suspected to be related to study drug. The most commonly occurring 
AEs leading to everolimus dose adjustment were: 
  Stomatitis (11.4%) 
  Aphthous stomatitis (5.1%) 
  Diarrhoea (+3.8%) 
  Mouth ulceration (+3.8%) 
  Nausea (+3.8%) 
  Sinusitis (+3.8%) 
Thrombocytopenia (+3.8%) 
 
  Hypercholesterolemia (+3.8%)

Post marketing experience 
Everolimus (as Afinitor, Votubia and Certican) is commercially available within European Union and 
other markets worldwide for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC and advanced NET, for SEGA 
associated with TSC and for the prophylaxis of allograft rejection following renal or cardiac 
transplantation. The Applicant estimates an overall exposure to the drug in excess of 14,550 patient-
years.  
1.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Common adverse reactions in the everolimus arm were stomatitis, hypercholesterolaemia, aphthous 
stomatitis, acne, fatigue, anaemia, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, leukopenia and nausea. 
The incidence of infections was similar in both treatment arms when both trials are compared (71.8% 
and 64.6% of patients in the everolimus arm and 66.7% and 71.8% in the placebo arm for study 
M2301 and M2302 respectively). Renal events were observed less frequently in the everolimus arm 
(5.1% of patients) than in the placebo arm (15.4%). Hypercholesterolaemia was observed in a high

proportion of patients in the everolimus arm. An important identified risk in the RMP, regarding 
preventability of dyslipidemia includes ‘Monitoring of blood cholesterol/triglycerides and potential 
concomitant treatment with lipid-lowering agent’ as part of the routine risk minimisation for this risk. 
Thus, the current information in section 4.4 of the SmPC under the subheading ‘Blood glucose and 
lipids’ was updated to reflect this advice. 
Everolimus can be associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage. Epistaxis (8.9%) accounted for 
the majority of haemorrhagic events in the everolimus arm compared with 2.6% of patients in the 
placebo arm. One patient in the everolimus arm (1.3%) had haematuria compared with 3 patients 
(7.7%) in the placebo arm. There were no AEs, SAEs or discontinuations from study drug for bleeding-
related events from angiomyolipoma in the everolimus arm.  
Secondary amenorrhea in post-adolescent females was 13.5% of patient in the everolimus arm (two 
cases of Grade 3) versus 3.8% of patients in the placebo arm. A single Grade 2 case of non-infectious 
pneumonitis was reported in the study. Information on 'haemorrhage' in section 4.8 of the SmPC for 
Votubia was updated to reflect the higher incidence of haemorrhages in the everolimus arm (26.6%) 
compared to placebo arm (15.4%). In addition, a warning regarding haemorrhage and any appropriate 
monitoring/management was included in section 4.4 of the SmPCs. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 29.1% of everolimus-treated patients and 7.7% of placebo treated 
patients. Grade 3 treatment-related events reported ≥ 2% in the everolimus arm included amenorrhea, 
aphthous stomatitis and mouth ulceration. Four grade 4 AEs (each with an incidence of 1.3%) were 
reported in the everolimus arm, two of which were laboratory abnormalities (blood uric acid increased 
and neutropenia) reported by the central laboratory; the other two being convulsion and hypertensive 
crisis. No Grade 4 ADRs were reported. Clinically notable AEs, especially stomatitis-related AEs in the 
everolimus arm and infections in both the everolimus and placebo arms were most commonly observed 
and these events were managed with dose adjustments/interruptions or other treatment modalities. 
An integrated analysis of safety comprising of the safety of everolimus in TSC patients in trial C2485, 
M2301 and M2302 was requested in order to better assess the ADRs in this specific and selected 
patient population which could be diluted if pooled with a patient population in the oncology setting of 
renal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumours and breast cancer.  The safety of these trials (C2485, 
M2301 and M2302) was compared with safety of trials C2324, C2240 and Y2301 (pivotal trials for the 
current indications of Afinitor). The safety information for TSC patients was updated in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
Serious adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus. Serious adverse 
events were reported in similar proportions of patients in the everolimus (19.0%) and placebo 
treatment arms (17.9%) while AEs leading to discontinuation were reported more frequently in the 
placebo arm (10.3% vs 3.8%). Stomatitis and aphthous stomatitis were the most common reasons 
leading to dose reduction and/or temporary interruptions of therapy.The CHMP requested to include 
recommendation for dose adjustment and management in the treatment of ADRs in the SmPC. A single 
death was reported in the everolimus arm. This event was considered to be the result of a worsening 
of underlying intractable epilepsy and was not suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
drug. 
The potential of everolimus to affect male fertility, which has been included in the RMP as a safety 
concern, was not addressed in the application as no further data was provided in this submission. 
Given that most patients with TSC and AML are of reproductive age, the risk of everolimus affecting 
male fertility will be subject to additional monitoring in the PhV plan and has been highlighted in the 
SmPC in section 4.6 with the following wording “Based on non-clinical findings, male fertility may be 
compromised by treatment with everolimus (see section 5.3).” Furthermore, to provide information to 
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

further characterise other risks and missing information identified in the RMP, particularly reproductive 
toxicity, infertility and long-term safety, the MAH, at the request of the CHMP, proposed to implement 
a registry (CRAD001MICO3) to collect data on manifestations, interventions and outcome in patients 
with TSC.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
1.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety assessment of trial M2302 does not reveal any new safety concerns. The safety and 
tolerability of everolimus is consistent with previous experience. The events reported are typically mild 
to moderate in severity and were generally manageable with dose interruption, dose modification, 
and/or supportive intervention.  
1.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure.

Product impurities 
The RMP has been updated to reflect the pharmacovigilance activities related to the patient population 
with SEGA associated with TSC. Therefore, pharmacovigilance activities related to the oncologic 
indication were removed (e.g. breast cancer studies). The CHMP, having considered the data 
submitted, was of the opinion that the below pharmacovigilance activity in addition to the use of 
routine pharmacovigilance was needed to investigate further some of the long-term safety concerns: 
  TSC patients 
Disease registry CRAD001MIC03: An international disease registry collecting data on manifestations, 
interventions, and outcomes in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex – TOSCA 
Safety assessments include safety monitoring and reporting (e.g. SAE). Document fertility in male 
patients at baseline when available; sex hormone values at baseline and yearly updates for male and 
female patients. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
Page 73/75
 
 
 
 
 
  Amendment of the current version the CRAD001MIC03 (TOSCA) protocol and eCRF: Expand 
the collection of adverse events information in line with the expectation described in the new 
EU GPV guidance and collect information about important identified risks and potential risks 
identified in the RMP. The proposed updated protocol of this PASS should be submitted no later 
than 60 days after the conclusion of this procedure. 
1.8.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed. 
The changes are listed in track changes in Annex I. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis that the changes to the PL were limited and a user consultation was deemed not necessary. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The study met its primary endpoint where a 50% volume reduction in the sum of target 
angiomyolipoma lesions was observed in 41.8% patients compared to 0% of patient in the placebo 
arm (95% CI: 23.5 – 58.4; p-value<0.0001). The secondary endpoints as well as subgroup analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the results. The CHMP considered the results adequate to demonstrate the 
clinical benefit of everolimus treatment.  
Although not prospectively identified as an efficacy outcome, a higher incidence of renal events was 
observed in the placebo arm. Fewer patients in the everolimus arm (2.5%) compared with the placebo 
arm (7.7%) experienced severe renal impairment as assessed by a worst post-baseline glomerular 
filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. In addition, no patient in the everolimus arm required surgery or 
embolization during the course of the study, while 1 patient (2.6%) who received placebo required 
bilateral renal embolization; and only patients in the placebo arm (9 patients, 23.1%) versus none in 
the everolimus arm discontinued treatment because disease progression.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Uncertainties in the knowledge of the beneficial effects of everolimus treatment in a patient with 
angiomyolipoma are related to the uncertainty about the long-term benefit. The results from the open 
label phase of the study and the TSC registry will be important in order to determine the long term 
benefit from systemic everolimus treatment in AML. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The main AEs in the everolimus safety database are infections and stomatitis which were manageable 
and were not considered serious.  The events reported were typically mild to moderate in severity and 
were generally manageable with dose interruption, dose modification, and/or supportive intervention. 
The most common adverse drug reactions in the everolimus treated group were stomatitis, 
hypercholesterolemia, aphthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration, acne, fatigue, anemia, blood lactate 
dehydrogenase increased, leukopenia, and nausea.  No new emergent safety concerns have been 
identified for the population in the proposed indication.  
Votubia 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
Page 74/75
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The potential of everolimus to affect male fertility is a concern given that no further data has been 
provided in this submission and there is insufficient data to exclude this risk. Given that most patients 
with TSC and AML are of reproductive age, the risk of everolimus affecting male fertility will be subject 
to additional monitoring in the PhV plan and has been highlighted in the SmPC.  
There is remaining uncertainty on the long term effects of everolimus treatment are adequately 
addressed through routine and additional pharmacovigilance measures, as detailed in the 
pharmacovigilance plan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Untreated AML lesions invariably increase in size over time and are associated with major 
complications such as haemorrhage and, in some cases renal failure. Patients with TS and 
angiomyolipoma greater than 4 cm have a high risk for the development of complications and may 
require surgery. Patients with significant risk of renal morbidity and increased risk of hemorrhagic 
rupture may benefit from the reduction in tumour volume and disease progression from everolimus 
treatment.  
Overall the pivotal study provided compelling results with regards to its primary endpoint (AML 
response rate and decreased tumour volume) and safety in the proposed indication. The evidence of 
efficacy is based on analysis of change in sum of angiomyolipoma volume. None of the patients in the 
everolimus arm who experienced an angiomyolipoma response reported disease progression prior to 
the data cut-off. Both the proportion of responses and duration of response were considered clinically 
impressive. Prevention of further tumour growth in these patients is considered to reflect a clinical 
benefit. This is the first prospective clinical trial to demonstrate the benefit of a pharmacotherapeutic 
approach to treatment for this population.  
The adverse drug reactions reported were typically mild to moderate in severity and were generally 
manageable with dose interruption, dose modification, and/or supportive intervention.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial M2302, the benefits of everolimus treatment in patients with 
AML associated TSC (AML response rate of 41.8% for everolimus treated group vs 0% for placebo 
treated group and reduction in angiomyolipoma volume in the everolimus treated group) outweighed 
the generally mild to moderate toxicity. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance 
for everolimus in the indication “Votubia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal 
angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who are at risk of complications 
(based on factors such as tumour size or presence of aneurysm, or presence of multiple or bilateral 
tumours) but who do not require immediate surgery. The evidence is based on analysis of change in 
sum of angiomyolipoma volume.” was positive.

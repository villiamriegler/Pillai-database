2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disorder, caused by the combined action of multiple disease genes, and 
is also triggered by environmental factors. T-cells are clearly involved, as psoriasis responds to treatment 
with  calcineurin  inhibitors,  which  inhibit  T-cell  activity  (e.g.,  cyclosporine,  tacrolimus).  Successful 
psoriasis therapy correlates with inhibition of IL-17 signalling and is seen, e.g., after IL-17A blockade 
with secukinumab, and it can therefore be concluded that IL-17A contributes to the disease process. 
Psoriasis is one of the most common human skin diseases affecting 2 to 3% of the general population. 
Plaque  psoriasis  affects  80%  to  90%  of  all  psoriasis  patients  of  all  age  groups  and  is  also  the  most 
common  variant  of  the  disease  in  paediatric  patients.  Most  children  manifest  with  plaque  psoriasis  in 
patterns  similar  to  adult  patients,  and  it  is  accepted  that  paediatric  and  adult  psoriasis  represent 
manifestations of the same disease process, as opposed to being distinct disease entities. 
Disease prevalence in children varies depending on study population and age, with 1% as a commonly 
quoted  figure.  Worldwide,  the  incidence  of  paediatric  psoriasis  is  increasing,  affecting  up  to  2%  of 
children in some populations. In Europe, psoriasis is reported to affect 0.5-1% of children, and chronic 
plaque psoriasis is also common among adolescents. 
According to the MAH, the prevalence of psoriasis in children under 6 years is very low (with the highest 
prevalence  published  of  0.3%),  and  the  proportion  of  children  with  a  severe  condition  in  need  of  a 
systemic treatment is 4%, giving a final prevalence of the condition to be about 1 per 10,000 in this age 
group. 
The indication initially proposed by the MAH was as follows: 
Cosentyx  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  children  and 
adolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
The following weight-tiered posology was initially proposed: 
The recommended dose is based on body weight (Table 1) and administered by subcutaneous injection 
with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 75 mg dose 
is given as 1 subcutaneous injection of 75 mg. Each 150 mg dose is given as 1 subcutaneous injection 
of 150 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 150 mg.

Management 
Topical treatments are the mainstay of therapeutic approaches in paediatric psoriasis, and a significant 
proportion of  patients  can  be  adequately  treated  with  topical  therapies  such as  emollients,  vitamin  D 
analogues, corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Various forms of phototherapy are also successfully 
used in many patients. Available systemic treatments include methotrexate, cyclosporine and retinoids. 
It should however be recognised that many of these products have no formal authorisation for use in 
paediatric  psoriasis  and  can  be  associated  with  significant  safety  concerns.  In this  respect,  and  apart 
from  the  better  studied  biological  agents,  paediatric  psoriasis  patients  can  still  be  considered  a 
significantly underserved patient population. 
Three biological agents are currently authorised in the EU for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in the 
paediatric  population:  etanercept  (authorised  in  2009),  adalimumab  (authorised  in  2015),  and 
ustekinumab (authorised in 2015). Etanercept is currently authorised for severe disease from 6 years of 
age; adalimumab is authorised for severe disease from 4 years of age, and ustekinumab is authorised 
for moderate to severe disease from 6 years of age. All three products are authorised as second-line 
therapies,  for  use  in  patients  who  are  inadequately  controlled  by  or  are  intolerant  to  other  systemic 
therapies or phototherapies (the exact wording varies slightly by individual product). 
On  28  May  2020,  the  CHMP  adopted  a  positive  opinion  for  the  following  new  indication  for  Taltz 
(ixekizumab) another medicinal product targeting IL-17: “Paediatric plaque psoriasis: Taltz is indicated 
for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 years and with a 
body weight of at least 25 kg and adolescents who are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a fully human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-17A (IL-17A) antibody of 
the Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)/κ-class. It binds to IL-17A and neutralises the activity of this cytokine. 
Cosentyx was initially approved in the EU on 15 January 2015 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis 
(Pso) in adult patients (procedure EMEA/H/C/003729). Indications for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were approved on 19 November 2015, and an extension of indication 
application for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (Nr-Ax-Spa) was approved on 28 April 2020 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0053/G). Cosentyx is currently approved in over 90 countries 
worldwide. 
The currently approved adult psoriasis indication and posology read as follows: 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The recommended dose is 300 mg of secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 300 mg dose is given as two 
subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. 
2.1.3.  The development programme 
The main studies within the submission are: 
• 
Study A2310, an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo- and etanercept -controlled study 
in paediatric patients 6-17 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. An interim study report, 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 9/131 
 
 
 
 
containing efficacy data until Week 52 as well as summaries of safety data over various periods of time 
in study, including a summary of all safety data until data cut-off, has been provided. 
• 
Study A2311, an ongoing randomised, open-label study with a historical placebo control in 
paediatric patients 6-17 years of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. An interim study 
report, containing efficacy data until Week 24 and a summary of all safety data until last data cut-off 
has been provided. 
The above studies were conducted in line with the agreed PIP (studies 3 and 4 of the PIP). Study 5 of 
the PIP is not yet completed and is not referenced in the application. 
An extensive extrapolation/modelling/simulation package was also submitted to support the full 
indication and posology being applied for. 
Severe psoriasis criteria were agreed with PDCO during the psoriasis PIP discussions and subsequently 
moderate psoriasis criteria were defined. These severity definitions are used in both ongoing paediatric 
studies for psoriasis and in the adult data comparison. The disease severity classification is outlined in

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
The  two  non-clinical  studies  included  in  the  PIP  were  assessed  in  connection  with  the  adult  psoriasis 
indication as part of the initial marketing authorisation: 
•  Study  1:  Fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  (FEED)  study  in  mice  using  a  surrogate 
antibody. 
•  Study 2: Peri- and postnatal study in mice using a surrogate antibody. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a monoclonal antibody, secukinumab is exempt from testing in accordance with the current CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) on environmental risk assessment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Previously conducted non-clinical studies submitted in support of the marketing authorisation of 
secukinumab are considered adequate and sufficient to support the extension of indication to children 
and adolescents from the age of 6 years of age for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis.

The reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mice and in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that 
reproduction or growth and development of the offspring after exposure during gestation period are 
unaffected by inhibition of IL-17A. In mice, there were no adverse effects on the reproductive function, 
fertility and early embryonic development. Also, in the mouse pre- and post-natal developmental 
toxicity study, there were no BZN035-related effects on F0 generation, nor were there any effects on 
survival, growth, development, behaviour or reproductive performance on the F1 offspring. However, 
pharmacology-related changes were observed in lymphocyte populations in the thymus, spleen and 
blood on the F1 generation. No effects were observed in the F2 generation. In cynomolgus monkeys, 
maternal toxicity, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity were not observed. Collectively, the 
preclinical data reveal no hazard to reproduction, growth or development, and indicate no difference in 
safety profile in adult and juvenile animals. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No concerns have been raised based on preclinical data. Section 5.3 of the SmPC has been updated to 
indicate that the preclinical safety data support use in both adults and children which was acceptable 
to CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This submission includes data from two ongoing studies: 1) a clinical study report from an ongoing 
randomised, placebo- and etanercept-controlled Phase 3 study (A2310) assessing the efficacy, safety 
and tolerability of two dosages of secukinumab, administered subcutaneously according to a weight-
tiered regimen, in paediatric patients with severe plaque psoriasis, and 2) a clinical study report of 
Week 24 data from an ongoing randomised, open-label trial (A2311) assessing the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of two dosages of secukinumab in paediatric patients with moderate to severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis. In addition, data from an extrapolation/modelling/simulation approach, using data 
from the secukinumab development program in adult psoriasis along with PK, efficacy and safety data 
from study A2310 is provided to support the full indication being applied for. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

(see supportive studies) 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  samples  were  taken  in  studies  A2310  and  A2311.  In  study  A2311  pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC84-112d and Tmax were evaluated. Furthermore, the sparse samples from study 
2310 were included into a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model which was based on 
adult  data  of  secukinumab  PK;  for  this,  see  Section  2.3.4  on  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics 
(PK/PD) modelling. 
In study A2310, blood samples for PK assessments were collected before dose administration at baseline, 
and immediately before dosing at Weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52. An ELISA method was used for bioanalytical 
analysis  of  secukinumab  in  serum,  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  of  500  ng/mL.  At 
randomisation  (before  treatment  with  secukinumab),  none  of  the  patients  had  quantifiable 
concentrations. 
The mean pre-dose concentrations at Weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52 showed a dose-proportional increase in 
exposure to secukinumab from the low dose level, to the high dose level. Due to more frequent dosing, 
mean  exposure  to  secukinumab  in  samples  drawn  at  Week  4  and  12  in  the  ‘not  affected  group’  was 
higher than at steady-state at Week 24 and Week 52 in both secukinumab low and high dose groups. At 
Week 52, the secukinumab concentrations were still higher in the ‘IRT dose affected group’ than in the 
not affected patients, especially in the high dose group (see Table 3).

Table 3 Mean (%CV) secukinumab serum concentrations in the secukinumab Low and High dose groups 
(Full analysis set) (study A2310) 
With a 2-fold increase in the dose in the same body weight category (i.e., 150 mg instead of 75 mg for 
body weight between 25 and 50 kg and 300 mg instead of 150 mg for body weights ≥50 kg), a dose 
proportional increase in serum exposure was observed at most of the time points. Further, at most time 
points within the low and high dose groups, similar exposure was observed with the 2-fold dose reduction 
for body weights between 25 kg and 50 kg compared with exposure for patients with body weights ≥ 50

mean trough concentrations to secukinumab in samples drawn at Week 4, and at Week 12, were higher 
than at Week 16, as expected due to weekly dosing until Week 4. The rise in concentrations from Week 
12 to Week 13 and the decline from Week 13 to Week 16 represent the typical PK profile during the 4 
weeks dosing interval after s.c. administration, both at the Low and High dose level (see Table 5).

With a 2-fold increase in the dose in the same body weight category, i.e., 150 mg instead of 75 mg for 
body  weight  between  25  and  50  kg  and  300  mg  instead  of  150  mg  for  body  weights ≥50  kg,  a  dose 
proportional  increase  in  serum  exposure  was  observed  at  all  time  points.  Further,  at  all  time  points, 
similar exposure was observed with the 2-fold dose reduction for body weights between 25 and 50 kg 
compared with exposure for patients with body weights ≥50 kg. Serum exposure in patients with body 
weight <25 kg who received 75 mg doses was in the range of what was observed at the higher dose 
levels in the higher body weight categories (see Table 6).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The objectives of the population PK modelling exercise were to confirm that the secukinumab paediatric 
doses  used  in  studies  A2310  and  A2311  achieve  similar  exposure  levels  to  those  observed  in  adult 
patients,  and  to  support  that  paediatric  exposure  comparable  to  that  in  adults  produces  comparable 
efficacy. The pooled analysis uses data from 10 phase I-III studies in adult patients with moderate to

severe plaque psoriasis and from the paediatric study A2310 data until week 24. A subset of dataset, 
originally used in the model building, was used for the population PK model fitting. The PK comparison 
was made with data from Phase 3 studies using the same dosing regimen. The exposure-psoriasis area 
and severity index (PASI) response analysis was based on the phase III studies using the same dosing 
regimen (study A2304 excluded because of the lack of placebo control in the study). 
Some of the PK analyses excluded the concentration after 12 Weeks for 36 subjects (16 subjects in Low 
dose  group  and  20  subjects  in  High  dose  group)  from  Study  A2310  who  erroneously  received  active 
medication at Weeks 13, 14, 15. For the descriptive exposure-response analysis, the following data from 
A2310 were excluded: 
•  Data after 12 Weeks for 36 subjects who erroneously received active medication at Weeks 13, 
14, 15. 
•  Data  from  two  patients  who  had  at  least  one  missing  dose  over  the  24  weeks  of  treatment 
(2 subjects in the High dose group). 
For the model-based exposure-response analysis, no data from A2310 were excluded. 
2.3.3.1.  Population PK model 
The appropriateness of the paediatric dose selection based on secukinumab exposure was first assessed 
graphically.  Paediatric  Exposure  at  week  4,  12,  24  and  52  in  paediatric  patients  (studies  A2310  and 
A2311)  stratified  by  weight  group  were  graphically  compared  to  the  predicted  exposure  from  the 
population PK model developed on adults, the results of which are shown in the figure below. 
Figure 1 Predicted versus observed paediatric secukinumab trough concentrations for Weeks 4, 12 , 24 
and 52 
To further quantify the paediatric effect on secukinumab exposure, the entire pooled dataset (including 
A2310  data  until  week  24)  was  used  to  fit  alternative  models  including  model  with  fixed  allometric 
exponents and paediatric effect on bioavailability. The models in question were linear two-compartment

mammillary models with first-order absorption and elimination. The models are listed in Table 10 and 
the parameter estimates of the most relevant models are detailed in Table 11. 
Table 10 List of population PK models 
Table 11 Parameter values of the previous and updated PK models 
The different bioavailability for the paediatric population was hypothesized due to a seemingly systematic 
difference in apparent clearance and volume of distribution in children versus adults (Figure below).

The CHMP was of the opinion that the rationale for testing a different bioavailability for the paediatric 
population in Model 3 is clear and acceptable. 
Model 3 was considered to adequately describe the exposure data, as summarized by the diagnostics in 
the Figures below.

2.3.3.2.  Exposure-response model 
For  the  exposure-response  model,  graphical  exploration  for  exposure-  efficacy  responses  (%PASI 
improvement, PASI75 and PASI90) were performed. The confidence intervals for the probability of PASI 
response  was  obtained  by  means  of  exact  method  (Clopper,  1934).  The  confidence  intervals  for  the 
median  %  PASI  improvement  from  baseline  was  obtained  by  bootstrapping  (simulate  outcomes  for 
1000 copies of the original dataset and summarize % PASI Improvement across simulated datasets for 
each concentration bin). 
Data from studies A2310 and A2311 were used for the graphical exploration. 
Figure below depicts the paediatric and adult concentration-efficacy response relationships. Specifically, 
the  median  response  (%PASI  improvement  from  baseline),  and  the  %PASI90  response  rate  are 
summarized by patient population and paediatric secukinumab concentration quartile bin at week 12.

The paediatric concentration-response relationships are generally similar to the adult relationships. 
Overall, these results support the extrapolation from the adult to the paediatric population, at least at 
higher secukinumab concentrations.

The consistency of the relationship between secukinumab concentration and PASI score of the patients 
from paediatric Study A2310 across the weight and age ranges was assessed by means of the exposure-
PASI model used for the original adult submission. 
A  preliminary  step  was  to  check  that  the  adult  exposure-PASI  model  described  adequately  the 
relationship  between  secukinumab  concentration  and  PASI  score  in  paediatric  patients.  The 
adequateness was confirmed by Figure below in which: 
• 
• 
the  NPDEs  from  Study  A2310  have  similar  distribution,  overall  and  versus  time,  to  the  adult 
study A2302 NPDEs (used for comparison purpose), and 
the  NPDEs  from  Study  A2310  versus  weight  and  age  by  treatment  group  are  reasonably 
distributed around zero.

Figure 6 
Diagnostic  of  the  adequateness  of  the  adult  PK-PASI  model  to  describe  A2310 
(paediatric) data 
The consistency of the PK-PASI relationship across weights and ages was assessed by using the adult 
model to estimate three individual (i.e., subject-specific) PD parameters informing (1) how much drug 
concentration  is  necessary  to  provide  half  of  the  maximum  PASI  decrease  (EC50),  (2)  how  fast  the 
secukinumab concentration effect on the PASI is washed out (kout), and (3) the PASI slope over time in 
absence of secukinumab concentration (Slope). This was done for each paediatric patient from Study 
A2310 as well as, for comparison purpose, for each adult patient from Study A2302. 
There was no meaningful relationship between the PD parameters of the paediatric patients and weight 
or age (Figure below, 3rd and 4th columns). The apparent higher EC50 for lighter (paediatric) patients is 
mostly due to four paediatric patients with very high EC50 of >150 ug/mL that do not fit the exposure-
PASI model well. When those patients are excluded from the analyses, the apparent relationship between 
weight and EC50 disappears (Figure not reported).

2.3.3.3.  Extrapolation of efficacy from severe to moderate disease state in children 
It is understood that the disease pathology and progression are similar in the adult and the paediatric 
population. The response to therapy was expected to be similar. Thus, an extrapolation of adult efficacy 
data to paediatric data was considered appropriate. 
Summary statistics for key efficacy parameters from the paediatric population and from the adult pool 
population are presented side-by-side, to facilitate comparison and to allow a comparative assessment 
of  efficacy  of  secukinumab  for  the  intended  use  in  the  paediatric  population.  The  statistical  analysis 
includes efficacy data up to Week 24 visit of study A2310. 
The  efficacy  responses  at  Week  12  for  the  paediatric  Study  A2310  and  for  the  pool  of  adult  studies 
(studies A2302, A2303, A2308, and A2309) are presented side-by-side in Table below. 
The efficacy response (PASI75, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)0/1 and PASI90) of Study A2310 
were comparable for the Low and High doses of secukinumab. When compared with the historical data 
from the secukinumab adult studies, the paediatric efficacy response rates for the Low dose arm were

similar (for PASI75) or numerically higher (for IGA0/1 and PASI90) to the adult efficacy response rates 
in the 150 mg group and were similar to adult 300 mg group.

The  analysis  approach  to  demonstrate  consistent  efficacy  between  the  paediatric  population  and  the 
adult  population  with  severe  plaque  psoriasis  disease  and  to  predict  the  efficacy  for  the  paediatric 
population with moderate psoriasis consisted of 4 steps (Figure below):

data to demonstrate superiority of secukinumab over placebo with respect to PASI75, IGA0/1 
and PASI90 and responses at Week 12 in paediatric patients with severe psoriasis 
2.  Extrapolation from severe adult to severe paediatric population: This step consists of predictions 
from the severe adult summary pool (consisting of secukinumab Phase III adult studies A2302, 
A2303, A2308 and A2309) followed by validation with severe paediatric data (from Study A2310)

to demonstrate the consistency of efficacy between adult and paediatric populations with respect 
to PASI75, IGA0/1 and PASI90 responses at Week 12 (qualification model) 
3.  Characterization of efficacy and disease severity in adults: Efficacy meta-analysis to characterize 
difference in efficacy response between moderate and severe patients in adult pool, with respect 
to PASI75, IGA0/1, and PASI90 at Week 12 
4.  Efficacy  prediction  for  moderate  psoriasis  paediatric  population:  Predictive  analysis  to  provide 
evidence of a positive treatment effect for secukinumab versus placebo with respect to PASI75, 
IGA0/1 and PASI90 and responses at Week 12 in paediatric patients with moderate psoriasis. 
This step provided the adjusted efficacy estimates through paediatric and adult data to provide 
a  predicted  treatment  effect  for  a  moderate  psoriasis  paediatric  population  (extrapolation 
model). 
Figure 8 
The 4 steps for the planned statistical analysis 
Inferential statistical efficacy analysis in severe psoriasis paediatric patients (Study A2310, 
Step 1) 
The  inferential  statistical  analysis  using  Study  A2310  data  was  to  demonstrate  superiority  of 
secukinumab over placebo with respect to PASI75, IGA 0/1 and PASI90 responses at Week 12 in severe 
psoriasis paediatric patients. 
Bayesian  meta-analytic  prediction-validation  approach  for  the  severe  psoriasis  paediatric 
population (qualification model, Step 2) 
The  approach  to  perform  extrapolation  and  validation,  as  outlined  in  the  EMA  Concept  Paper  on 
Extrapolation (EMA/189724/2018), is as follows: 
Prediction  step:  A  Bayesian  meta-analysis  using  the  summary  adult  efficacy  pool  in  the  severe 
population was performed. From this analysis, posterior predictive distributions were derived to predict 
outcomes  of  study  designs  matching  the  ones  in  the  available  paediatric  Study  A2310,  in  terms  of 
treatment effect. 
As the overall sample size is relatively large for each adult study, no sensitivity of the results is expected 
due to the uninformative priors on the regression coefficients. However, the choice of the prior for the 
between-study  heterogeneity  parameter  can  have  an  influence  on  the  derived  predictive  distribution. 
The between-study heterogeneity parameter is a variance parameter which would require a large number 
of different adult studies in order to be dominated by the data. As only 4 adult studies are available, the 
prior distribution for the heterogeneity parameter is not expected to be dominated by the data. A prior 
Assessment report

Page 28/131 
 
 
 
 
on  the  between-study  heterogeneity  parameter  with  smaller  (larger)  heterogeneity  may  lead  to  a 
narrower  (wider)  predictive  distribution  for  Study  A2310  data.  The  moderate  heterogeneity  was 
considered an adequate choice to reflect the degree of heterogeneity in the adult trials. 
The  above  model  was  fitted  separately  for  each  treatment  arm,  using  MCMC  in  Stan  version  2.17.1. 
MCMC  non-convergence  Rhat  diagnostic  (Gelman  and  Rubin  1992)  was  monitored  for  all  model 
parameters.  Any  parameter,  with  a  Rhat  value  greater  than 1.1  (suggesting  sampling  problems)  was 
presented for each analysis. In addition, the number of divergent transitions during the sampling phase 
of  the  used  hamiltonian  monte-carlo  (HMC)  algorithm  implemented  in  Stan  was  reported,  which  was 
expected to be zero (Upadhyay et al, 2015). 
Validation step: Assuming similarity between the adult and the paediatric population with respect to 
the efficacy endpoints, the observed outcome of the paediatric severe population study should be in the 
range  of  the  predictive  distribution  derived  from  the  meta-analysis  in  adult.  If  so,  this  was  taken  as 
evidence “to confirm the predicted degree of similarity … in clinical response (efficacy, …)”, according to 
the EMA Concept Paper on Extrapolation (EMA/189724/2018). 
Of note, this approach did not make any model assumption on the paediatric data; it therefore provided 
a complementary view to assess the extent to which the paediatric data were in line with the prediction 
derived from the pool of data in adults. 
The observed log shifted odds ratios for High and Low doses of secukinumab in the paediatric population 
with  severe  psoriasis  (Study  A2310)  were  all  contained  within  the  95%  credible  intervals  of  their 
respective predictive distribution calculated with the qualification model, see Table below. This indicates 
that  the  response  to  treatment  with  Low  or  High  dose  of  secukinumab  would  be  similar  (within  the 
credible interval) in severe psoriasis in the adult and paediatric populations. 
Table 13 Predictive efficacy at Week 12 in paediatric population with severe psoriasis - Pure 
non-responder imputation (FAS) 
The CHMP noted that the Step 2 results are displayed in Table above. All the key results are within the 
95% credible interval. 
Efficacy meta logistic regression analysis testing Baseline severity (Step 3) 
A meta-analysis model, based on pooled patient-level data was fitted to assess the extent of difference 
or similarity in efficacy responses between severe and moderate adult patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 29/131 
 
 
 
 
The logistic regression model was fitted separately for each endpoint. The fixed effects model included 
treatment  arm,  study,  Baseline  severity,  Baseline  bodyweight  and  Baseline  severity  by  treatment 
interaction as fixed explanatory variables. 
The  treatment  by  severity  interaction  was  of  primary  interest,  i.e.,  whether  treatment  effect 
(secukinumab 150 mg/300 mg dose vs. placebo) differs according to initial disease severity (moderate 
or  severe).  The  odds  ratio  for  each  treatment  comparison  for  moderate  and  severe  Baseline  disease 
severity groups were computed and presented along with the p value. For results, see Table below. 
The  treatment  effect  (secukinumab  150/300  mg  dose  vs.  placebo)  did  not  differ  by  Baseline  disease 
severity  (moderate  or  severe).  In  addition,  the  disease  severity  comparison  in  each  treatment  arm 
suggests no differences between moderate psoriasis and severe psoriasis with respect to PASI75 and 
PASI90 responses at both secukinumab doses and placebo as well as IGA 0/1 in the placebo arm. Higher 
response  rates  in  moderate  psoriasis  adults  were  observed  at  both  secukinumab  doses  for  IGA  0/1 
compared  to  severe  psoriasis  adults  (54.3%  in  moderate  adults  vs.  44%  in  severe  adults  in  the 
secukinumab  150  mg  arm  with  p-value  =  0.0155;  67.6%  in  moderate  psoriasis  adults  vs.  58.5%  in 
severe psoriasis adults in the secukinumab 300 mg arm with p-value = 0.0315). Although this step was 
not a formal part of the Bayesian approach, it characterized the difference between moderate and severe 
psoriasis in adults.

An  extrapolation  model  using  all  available  adult  data  (i.e.,  including  data  on  moderate  and  severe

was  analogous  to  the  qualification  model  described  above  but  also  included,  in  addition,  terms  for 
Baseline  severity  (moderate  vs.  severe),  population  indicator  (paediatric  vs.  adult),  treatment  by

severity and treatment by population interaction term. This model allowed estimation of the treatment 
effect in the severe psoriasis paediatric population in independence of the adult data whilst, at the same 
time,  estimating  the  difference  in  the  treatment  effect  of  severe  psoriasis  versus  moderate  psoriasis 
patients  in  the  adult  population.  It  was  assumed  that  the  difference  in  the  treatment  effect  between 
severe  and  moderate  adult  population  is  the  same  as  the  corresponding  difference  in  the  paediatric 
population. Under this assumption, the severity difference in the treatment effect obtained for the adults 
was applied to the paediatric severe treatment effect estimated for Study A2310 to provide a predicted 
treatment effect for a moderate psoriasis paediatric population. Analysis was performed separately on 
IGA0/1, PASI75 and PASI90 responses at Week 12. The median value of the mean log odds ratio as well 
as the 95% predictive credible interval for moderate psoriasis paediatric population were reported for 
secukinumab  High  and  Low  dose.  The  probability  of  a  positive  treatment  effect  (over  placebo)  was 
provided for secukinumab High and Low dose arms. 
Higher predicted log-Odd Ratios (ORs) were calculated with this model for the hypothetical paediatric 
population with moderate psoriasis, when compared to those predicted for the paediatric population with 
severe psoriasis, see Table below. The results showed that the probability of a positive treatment effect 
over placebo is almost certain, being close to 100%.

responder imputation (FAS) 
Subsequently, upon request for supplementary information, the MAH provided interim efficacy data in 
moderately  psoriatic  children  from  the  open-label  study  A2311,  as  an  external  validation  of  the 
extrapolation  model.  These  data  are  displayed  in  Table  below.  Upon  request  for  supplementary 
information,  the  MAH  provided  an  analysis  of  type  I  error  rate  of  the  proposed  extrapolation  model 
(Figure below). The figure displays the probability of wrongly concluding that severe adult and severe 
paediatric population are similar (labelled as “error rate” on the y-axis) as a function of a response rate 
(x-axis) which is assumed to be identical for placebo and secukinumab treatment groups; the similarity 
implies that the extrapolation concept holds, such that the superiority of secukinumab over placebo in 
the severe adult population is also true for the severe paediatric population; in other words, the figure 
shows the probability of wrongly concluding treatment effect through the extrapolation concept if there 
is no treatment effect at all.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
2.3.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH has presented secukinumab trough concentrations up to week 52 for low-dose and high-dose 
groups and at different weight categories for study A2310. In addition, trough data from an on-going 
study A2311 has been presented and PK parameters between week 12 and week 24 have been 
calculated. The data indicates that secukinumab concentrations increase with the dose within the same 
weight groups. The exposure after secukinumab 75 mg dose in children <25 kg is within the range 
seen in paediatrics in other weight categories. Cmax and AUC84-112d are slightly higher in paediatric 
patients treated with 150 mg (group: 25-<50 kg) and 300 mg (group: ≥50 kg) than in paediatrics <25 
kg treated with 75 mg. Mean secukinumab concentrations after the recommended doses at week 24 
are included in the Section 5.2 of the SmPC for the different weight groups which is acceptable to 
CHMP. 
The bioanalytical methods with ELISA are similar between adult and pediatric patients except for 
quantitation limit. LLOQ of 500 ng/ml was used in the study A2310 with pediatric patients and LLOQ of 
80 ng/ml has been used in studies with adult patients. The bioanalytical method used in study A2311

has not been specified. The bioanalytics with pediatric patients were performed at SGS (France) 
instead of WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, China) where the analysis have been performed previously with 
samples from adults. Cross validation between the assay from WuXi AppTec and SGS have been 
performed. The CHMP considered that analytical methods are acceptable and they are adequately 
described. 
2.3.4.2.  Population PK model 
To describe the raw PK data, the MAH has presented secukinumab trough concentrations at Weeks 4, 
12, 24 and 52 for low-dose and high-dose groups, and separately for patients who first received placebo 
and then were followed by low or high dose. 
The MAH submitted additional data from study A2310 and interim data from ongoing study A2311 in 
their response to CHMP request for supplementary information. These additional data were included in 
Figure 1 outlining the agreement between paediatric concentration observations and original population 
PK model predictions. However, the population PK model fittings were performed with a subset of A2310 
data until week 24, that were available at the time of original type II variation submission. To investigate 
the  appropriateness  of  the  paediatric  dose  selection,  the  MAH  has  compared  the  observed  paediatric 
trough concentrations to drug concentrations simulated from the adult population PK model, the results 
of which are shown in Figure 1. The observed concentrations at Week 4 tend to be systematically higher 
than the concentrations predicted based on the population pharmacokinetic model built upon adult data. 
At weeks 12 and 24 this trend diminishes. 
The MAH has included the paediatric study A2310 data until week 24 into the adult population PK 
dataset and fitted new population PK models to the combined dataset. The models are described in 
Table 10, and the results are displayed in Table 11. Model 1 was a re-estimation of the existing model 
based on the new dataset including data from study A2310. Model 2 includes allometric scaling 
exponents of 1 for volume of distribution and 0.75 for clearance, as recommended by the “Modelling 
and simulation: questions and answers” (“Should fixed or estimated values for allometric scaling 
exponents be used in paediatric pharmacokinetic models? November 2018” - 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-
pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-questions-answers), which in this case resulted 
in statistically worse model performance. Model 3 features a different bioavailability for the paediatric 
population versus the adult population, and model 4 (not included in Table 11) implements a study-
specific bioavailability. Model 3 seems to have been chosen as the model to go forward with, and Model 
4 was considered an additional investigation. 
The rationale for testing a different bioavailability for the paediatric population in Model 3 is clear and 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Within the diagnostic plots of Model 3, a remaining trend can be seen in the residuals (NPDE in this case) 
versus nominal time; the residuals are higher at week 4 than during the rest of the treatment. This trend 
is similar to the trend observed in Figure 1, where the observed trough concentrations at Week 4 were 
higher than those simulated from the original population PK model based on adult data. However, the 
observed trend in residuals is unlikely to have major clinical relevance; hence, the issue was not pursued 
by the CHMP.

2.3.4.3.  Exposure-response model 
The MAH has performed a graphical analysis of raw exposure-response data from study A2310 up to 
week 52, and interim data from study A2311 (Figure 5). Displayed are exposure-response data of adults 
and children with moderate and severe disease states. 
Given the raw data analysis, the exposure-response relationship in adults appears similar in moderate 
versus  severe  disease  states.  The  EMA  reflection  paper  on  extrapolation  (EMA/189724/2018  section 
5.1.3)  states that  a  difference in  clinical outcomes between  source  and  target  populations  could  limit 
extrapolation. Some dissimilarities in exposure-response relationship can be observed between adults 
and  children;  however,  these  differences  are  considered  minor  to  the  CHMP  and  they  point  towards 
children being more responsive to secukinumab. 
In  order  to  further  investigate  exposure-response  in  children,  the  MAH  has  included  the  paediatric 
efficacy  data  from  study  A2310  up  to  week  24  into  the  original  adult  PK/PD  model  that  was  used  to 
support the registration of secukinumab. No new models were fitted to the updated dataset; instead, 
the  original  PK/PD  model  was  used  to  calculate  residuals  for  both  the  adults  and  the  children,  and  a 
graphical assessment of the residuals concluded that the model is performing similarly for both the adults 
and  the  children.  Then,  the  model  was  used  to  derive  individual  PK/PD  parameter  estimates  for  the 
children. A graphical assessment of trends in the individual PK/PD parameters of both adults and children 
was undertaken to examine potential differences in exposure-response in adults versus children (Figure 
7). 
A  trend  towards  higher  EC50  values  and  lower  kout  values  at  decreasing  bodyweights  seems  to  be 
present.  However,  overall,  the  CHMP  accepted  that  the  exposure-response  profile  is  similar  enough 
between adults and children to support the extrapolation of efficacy to severely and moderately psoriatic 
children. 
2.3.4.4.  Extrapolation of efficacy from severe to moderate disease state in children 
To facilitate the comparative assessment of efficacy in adults and children, the MAH has summarized the 
adult and paediatric (study A2310) efficacy week 12 response data into a single table (Table 12). From 
the table, it seems as if a dose-response relationship exists for adults, but does not exist for children: 
No apparent difference in efficacy in children between low and high doses, which is in contrast with the 
higher  adult  efficacy  at  the  high  300  mg  adult  dose  when  compared  to  the  low  150  mg  adult  dose. 
However, an exposure-response relationship in children is seen in Figure 5 which is based on more data. 
Data from study A2310 up to week 24 were used in the extrapolation exercise. The MAH has outlined a 
four-step process for extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children. 
•  Step  1  aims  to  establish  the  efficacy  of  secukinumab  in  severely  psoriatic  children;  this  step 
consists of efficacy summaries on the basis of interim data. 
•  Step  2  aims  to  establish  the  similarity  of  efficacy  in  severely  psoriatic  adults  versus  severely 
psoriatic children. In this step, a Bayesian model is fitted based on the adult efficacy data, and 
the model aims to predict the paediatric efficacy data; paediatric data are only used for “external 
validation” of the model. 
•  Step 3 aims to establish similarity of secukinumab efficacy in adults with moderate versus severe 
psoriasis. 
•  Step 4 extrapolates the efficacy of secukinumab to children with moderate psoriasis on the basis 
of the prior steps. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 34/131 
 
 
 
Step 2, the model in was fitted separately for each treatment arm, and therefore no parameters for dose 
strength were estimated. The software used for Bayesian modelling in Steps 2 and 4, Stan, is a relatively 
new software; not considered industry standard, but acceptable nonetheless to the CHMP. 
The Step 2 results are displayed in Table 13. All the key results are within the 95% credible interval. 
Step 3 consisted of running a non-Bayesian meta-analysis model, with treatment arm, study, Baseline 
severity,  Baseline  bodyweight  and  Baseline  severity  by  treatment  interaction  as  fixed  explanatory 
variables. The main objective of this step was to establish that there is no interaction between disease 
severity and treatment; in other words, the aim was to demonstrate that secukinumab efficacy is similar 
in moderately versus severely psoriatic adults. The results of this step are summarized in Table 14. 
Contrary to the MAH’s claim, there appears to be an interaction between disease severity and treatment 
effect for the IGA 0/1 endpoint. Patients with moderate disease state seem to attain the endpoint more 
readily  than  patients  with  severe  disease  state.  However,  this  was  a  problem  to  the  CHMP  as  the 
extrapolation  framework  includes  a  formal  assumption  that  the  treatment  effect  is  similar  in  patients 
with moderate and severe disease states. The data indicate that the treatment effect may be larger in 
patients  with  moderate  disease  state.  Therefore,  in  this  respect,  the  paediatric  predictions  from  the 
extrapolation exercise may be considered conservative, and the true treatment effect in children with 
moderate disease state may be larger than that predicted by the model. The issue of differing treatment 
effects by disease severity was therefore not pursued by the CHMP because it results in conservative 
predictions, and not optimistic predictions. 
Step  4  involved  fitting  a  Bayesian  model  to  the  efficacy  data  of  severely  psoriatic  children,  and 
moderately  and  severely  psoriatic  adults.  This  model  was  used  to  predict  secukinumab  efficacy  in 
moderately  psoriatic  children.  The  model  included  fixed-effects  terms  for  response  rates  (control  and 
treatment effect), Baseline severity (moderate vs. severe), population indicator (paediatric vs. adult), 
treatment by severity and treatment by population interaction term. The variance components of the 
model  were  between-study  heterogeneity  of  response  rates  (control  and  treatment  effect),  and  for 
correlations of the study-specific effects. The extrapolation predictions are displayed in Table 15. The 
model predicts with a positive treatment effect with near certainty. 
When interpreting the results, it is useful to remember that the “Probability of log-OR > 0” denotes the 
probability  of  the  study  drug  having  a  positive  effect  compared  to  placebo,  however  a  positive  effect 
alone may not be clinically meaningful. Also, a second placebo dose would have a “probability of log-OR 
> 0” of 50%. 
The MAH was requested to provide interim data of the open-label Study A2311 of secukinumab efficacy 
in moderately psoriatic children, and to present these interim data in the context of external validation 
for the extrapolation model. The MAH complied and the external validation results are presented in Table 
15 from which it becomes apparent that the response rates observed so far are at least as high as the 
predicted response rates, thus supporting the extrapolation. The MAH was also requested to calculate 
the probability of erroneously concluding a positive treatment effect for secukinumab when in truth there 
is no treatment effect. The MAH complied and based on the information supplied in Figure 9, a very small 
risk  of  a  false  positive  conclusion  in  favour  of  secukinumab  treatment  effect  in  moderately  psoriatic 
children is foreseen. This is found acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Secukimab PK has been studied with population pharmacokinetic methodology. Sparse sampling data 
from the paediatric efficacy study A2310 have been included into the population pharmacokinetic 
dataset used in the original submission, the population pharmacokinetic model has been refined based 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 35/131 
 
 
 
on the new data, and the appropriateness of the paediatric doses has been evaluated. The modelling 
steps have been appropriately conducted. The observed concentration data from studies A2310 and 
A2311 agree with the original population PK model predictions which were used to determine 
paediatric dose strengths. 
The MAH has conducted a statistical extrapolation of efficacy from moderately psoriatic adults to 
moderately psoriatic children. The rationale is that if secukinumab efficacy is similar for severely 
psoriatic adults and children, and the efficacy for moderately psoriatic adults is known, then efficacy 
for moderately psoriatic children can be predicted. The overall strategy is considered rationale by the 
CHMP, and the extrapolation model has been validated with interim efficacy data of moderately 
psoriatic children in study A2311. The extrapolation of secukinumab efficacy for moderately psoriatic 
children is considered acceptable by the CHMP and is adequately described in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No specific studies for dose selection were conducted for secukinumab in paediatric psoriasis patients. 
The dose selection in paediatric patients was based on the completed Phase III program in adults as 
well as modelling and simulation based on the results from adult Phase II/III studies. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
2.4.2.1.  CAIN457A2310 
“A randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active controlled multicentre 
trial to demonstrate efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab compared to 
placebo and etanercept (in a single-blinded arm) after twelve weeks of 
treatment, and to assess the safety, tolerability, and long-term efficacy in 
subjects from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis”. 
Methods 
Study  A2310  is  an  ongoing  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-  and  etanercept  -controlled  study, 
consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a placebo- and active-controlled 12 week induction 
period, an active-controlled 40 week maintenance period, a non-controlled 184 week extension period, 
and  a  16  week  post-treatment  follow-up  period.  An  outline of  the  study  design  is  displayed in  Figure 
below. 
During the induction period (defined as randomisation through Week 12 prior to dose), the study was 
both active and placebo-controlled, and the primary endpoint (Week 12) was assessed at its completion. 
At the start of the induction period, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of four 
treatment groups (etanercept, secukinumab Low dose group, secukinumab High dose group, or placebo 
group).  Moreover,  at  the  Randomisation  visit,  patients  randomised  into  the  placebo  group  were  pre-
assigned to either the Low- or High-dose group of secukinumab for the maintenance period in case they 
did not achieve a PASI 75 response as assessed at Week 12.

Outline of study design for study A2310 
During the maintenance period (defined as Week 12 (from dosing) through Week 52), the study was 
active-controlled and the objectives focused on the maintenance of the response observed at Week 12. 
Patients who received secukinumab or etanercept during induction continued with the same treatment 
in maintenance. Patients who were on placebo during induction and were PASI 75 non-responders at 
Week  12  were  switched  to  either  secukinumab  Low  dose  or  secukinumab  High  dose treatment  group 
according  to  their  pre-assignment  at  baseline;  PASI  75  responders  on  placebo  discontinued  study 
treatment  at  Week  12  and  entered  the  treatment-free  follow-up  period  for  8  weeks  or  until  systemic 
therapy  was  started.  At  the  end  of  the  maintenance  period,  patients  on  secukinumab  entered  the 
extension treatment period whereas patients on etanercept entered the post-treatment follow-up period 
and thereafter completed the study. At the time of the current assessment, all patients have completed 
the maintenanceperiod (or withdrawn). 
During  the  extension  treatment  period  (defined  as  Week  52  (from  dosing)  until  Week  236),  all 
patients are treated with secukinumab and the purpose is the collection of long-term safety and efficacy 
data. At the end of the maintenance period, all patients on secukinumab enter the extension treatment 
period  and  continue  to  receive  the  same  dose  of  secukinumab.  Patients  who  participate  in  the 
maintenance period but prematurely discontinue the study as well as patients receiving etanercept are 
not eligible to enter the extension treatment period. 
During  the  post-treatment  period,  patients  are  monitored  for  an  additional  16  weeks  after  end  of 
treatment. 
Recruitment into the study was started in 2015. The study initially enrolled adolescent patients aged 12 
to  less  than  18  years.  Enrolment  of  children  aged  6  to  less  than  12  years  began  after  a  favourable 
recommendation by an independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) who reviewed data of 
approximately 80 (approximately 40 treated with secukinumab) adolescents (aged 12 to less than 18 
years) treated for 28 weeks. The first patient less than 12 years old was randomised in March 2018. 
To support the initial submission for this extension of indication, an analysis of data was performed after 
all  patients  completed  their  Week  24  visit;  data  cut-off  was  on  07  March  2019.  This  analysis  was 
Assessment report

Page 37/131 
 
 
 
 
presented  in  the  Week  24  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  provided  in  the  initial  submission  and  included 
primary endpoint data at Week 12 and efficacy data up to Week 24 visit. The results from the Week 24 
cut-off date provided 24-week safety data for all paediatric patients as well as long term safety data of 
varying duration (up to 3 years) in patients enrolled earlier in the study. 
Another full analysis of the study was performed when all patients had completed the Week 52 visit, and 
data was reported in the Week 52 CSR provided for assessment in response to the CHMP’s Request for 
Supplemental Information. Data cut-off for the Week 52 CSR was 18 September 2019.

Treatments 
The following study treatments were used: 
Investigational drug 
•  Secukinumab prefilled syringes, available as 150 mg in 1.0 mL and as 75 mg in 0.5 mL. 
Reference therapies 
•  Secukinumab placebo: secukinumab placebo available as 1 mL and 0.5 mL prefilled syringes, in 
a form to match secukinumab prefilled syringes. 
• 
Etanercept active comparator (not a biosimilar). 
Treatment arms 
Patients were randomised using a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: secukinumab Low dose, 
secukinumab  High  dose,  etanercept  or  placebo.  Patients  randomised  to  secukinumab treatment  arms 
(High dose and Low dose) received a dose based on the weight category (< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, ≥ 50 
kg). In order to maintain the treatment blind, all patients in secukinumab or placebo arms received 2 
s.c. injections at each dose, except for patients < 25 kg weight category who received only 1 injection 
of either 75 mg secukinumab or matching placebo. The dosing regimens were as follows: 
•  Secukinumab Low dose group: According to the weight category, s.c. secukinumab 75 mg (in 
< 25 kg and 25 to < 50 kg) or 150 mg (≥ 50 kg) injections at Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48, and placebo at Weeks 13, 14 and 15 during the 
blinded phase of the study; thereafter at Week 52 and every 4 weeks during the Extension period 
until Week 232. 
•  Secukinumab High dose group: According to the weight category , s.c. secukinumab 75 mg (in 
< 25 kg), 150 mg (25 to < 50 kg), 300 mg (≥ 50 kg) injections at Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2, 
3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48, and placebo at Weeks 13, 14 and 15 during 
the blinded phase of the study; thereafter at Week 52 and every 4 weeks during the Extension 
period until Week 232. 
• 
• 
Etanercept  (active  comparator)  group:  s.c.  etanercept  0.8  mg/kg  (up  to  a  maximum  dose  of 
50 mg)  once  per  week,  for  51  weeks.  Subjects  in  this  arm  were  unblinded,  but  the  efficacy 
assessor was blinded as regards treatment assignment. 
Placebo  group:  Placebo  (one/two  s.c.  injections  per  dose)  once  per  week  for  four  weeks  (at 
Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2 and 3), followed by dosing every four weeks (Weeks 4 and 8). At 
Week  12,  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  based  on  their  PASI  75  response  status  at  Week  12 
proceeded as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 40/131 
 
 
 
o  PASI 75 responders on placebo discontinued study treatment at Week 12 and entered 
the treatment-free follow-up period for 8 weeks or until systemic therapy was started. 
o  PASI  75  non-responders  on  placebo  received  High  dose  or  Low  dose  secukinumab, 
according  to  their  pre-assignment  at  the  Randomisation  visit,  and  received  their 
treatment according to the weight category based on the weight measured at Week 12 
visit (<25 kg, 25- <50 kg, ≥50 kg), on Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15, and then every four weeks 
starting at Week 16 until Week 48 during the Maintenance period; thereafter at Week 
52 and every 4 weeks during the Extension period until week 232. 
Concomitant treatments 
Other therapies for psoriasis had to be discontinued prior to randomisation, and wash-out periods for 
different classes were defined in the study protocol. Use of a topical corticosteroid of mild or moderate 
activity was allowed for the face, scalp, hands, feet  and genitoanal area during the screening period. 
After  the  screening  period,  the  use  of  concomitant  medication  for  psoriasis  in  all  body  regions  was 
restricted to bland emollients and other non-medicated interventions. The definition of “bland” excluded 
all topical medications that contain pharmacologically active ingredients such as (but not limited to) lactic 
acid,  salicylic  acid,  urea,  α-hydroxy  acids  or  fruit  acids.  Topical  corticosteroids  and  other  topical 
treatments were only allowed from the Week 12 visit onward and only if they were used for an indication 
other than psoriasis and not on the area affected with psoriasis. The use of any other systemic therapies 
or phototherapies for psoriasis was prohibited throughout the study.

Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 42/131 
 
 
 
o  PASI 50/75/90/100 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response over time, 
o 
time to PASI 75/90 response (up to Week 12), and 
o  PASI score and IGA mod 2011 score over time. 
• 
Patient  reported  outcomes  (PRO)  included  CDLQI  and  CHAQ  assessments  (in  patients  with 
history of psoriatic arthritis). 
Sample size 
It was planned to enroll approximately 160 paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age, with 
2 subgroups:  6  to  less  than  12  years  of  age,  and  12  to  less  than  18  years  of  age.  Stratification  was 
planned for age (< 12 years, ≥ 12 years) and weight (< 25kg, 25 -≤ 50kg and > 50kg). It was targeted 
to have at least 30 patients in the < 12 years subgroup at a minimum. Enrolment of children aged 6 to 
less  than  12 years  proceeded  after  efficacy  and  safety  data  for  approximately  80  (approximately  40 
treated with secukinumab) enrolled adolescents (aged 12 to less than 18 years) treated for 28 weeks 
had been reviewed and deemed satisfactory by a data monitoring committee (DMC). 
Since  two  secukinumab  dose  regimens  were  tested  versus  placebo  with  respect  to  the  co-primary 
endpoints (PAS 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12), the type-I-error was split 
to 1.25% one-sided for each comparison. With 40 patients per group and assuming a response rate of 
10% for PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the placebo group, the power to show 
a  response  rate  of  65%  for  PASI  75  response  and  45%  for  IGA  mod  2011  0  or  1  response  in  the 
secukinumab  groups  based  on  Fisher’s  exact  test  was  approximately  99%  for  PASI  75  response  and 
approximately 88% for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response. 
For the secondary endpoint of PASI 90 response at week 12, assuming a response rate of 8% in the 
placebo  group, the  power to  show  a  significant difference  between  a  secukinumab  dose  and placebo, 
assuming  a  response  rate  of  39%  in  the  secukinumab  groups  based  on  Fisher’s  exact  test  was 
approximately 82% for PASI 90 response. The assumed response rates for secukinumab were based on 
the confirmatory efficacy in severe patients in the adult phase III program. At Week 12, PASI 75 response 
rates of 11% and PASI 90 response rates of 7% have been reported in the placebo group in an earlier 
study with etanercept in children and adolescents aged 4-17 years. 
Randomisation 
At Randomisation (Visit 2), all eligible patients were randomised via Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The qualified site personnel contacted the IRT after confirming that 
the patient fulfilled all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The patient number, the weight of the patient and 
the age was entered. Stratification was planned for age (< 12 years, ≥ 12 years) and weight (< 25 kg, 
25-< 50 kg  and  ≥  50 kg).  The  IRT  assigned  a  randomisation  number to the patient.  For the  patients 
who  received  secukinumab  or  secukinumab  placebo,  this  number  was  used  to  link  the  patient  to  a 
treatment arm and specified a unique medication number for the package or packages of investigational 
treatment  to  be  dispensed  to  the  patient.  Each  patient  received  one  or  two  packages  per  dispensing 
visit, depending on the treatment group and treatment period. For those patients who were randomised 
to etanercept, medication was provided centrally (by a CRO) or purchased from the local market. The 
randomisation number was not communicated to the caller or other site members. 
In this study, an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) error led to additional dosing of patients. The 
dosing errors happened after the primary endpoint (Week 12) assessment. Specifically, 36 patients who 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 43/131 
 
 
 
were  assigned  to  the  Low  dose  (16  patients)  and  High  dose  (20  patients)  secukinumab  groups  were 
dispensed active medication at Week 13, 14, 15 visits. 
At these visits, the patients who were randomised to active treatment groups were expected to receive 
placebo  medication  as  to  maintain  the  blind.  Five  patients  in  the  secukinumab  High  dose  group  (25-
<50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 150 mg at these visits; 16 patients in the 
secukinumab Low dose group (≥50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 300 mg at 
these visits; and 15 patients in the secukinumab High dose group (≥50 kg/300 mg dose) were dispensed 
in error secukinumab 300 mg at these visits. 
The  incident  was  communicated  to  Investigators  and  Health  Authorities,  was  presented  to  internal 
Novartis boards and a corrective action plan was put in place by the IRT vendor. The unblinded DMC 
Board also reviewed data from the affected patients and expressed no safety concerns. The dosing error 
was taken into account in additional efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic reports and its impact on the 
results was to be assessed and documented appropriately. 
Blinding (masking) 
The secukinumab and the placebo arms are double blind (patient, investigator and assessor) until the 
data base lock for Week 52 analysis. However, for placebo PASI 75 responders unblinding occurred at 
Week  12,  since  these  patients  could  not  continue  into  the  Maintenance  period  but  entered  the  post 
treatment follow-up period. 
The etanercept arm is single (assessor) blind until the moment the patient completes the Week 52 visit 
and  enters  the  follow-up  period.  Site  staff  (with  the  exception  of  the  efficacy  assessor),  patient  and 
sponsor are not blinded to the Etanercept arm for the entire treatment duration with Etanercept. 
After  the  interim  database  lock  for  analysis  at  Week  24,  designated  sponsor  team  members  were 
unblinded  to  perform  the  analyses  and  develop  this  clinical  study  report  (CSR),  whereas  patient, 
investigator staff and persons performing the assessment continued to remain blinded until the database 
lock at Week 52. The unblinded Novartis members were not allowed to participate further in the conduct 
of the study nor to communicate any confidential treatment data to blinded Novartis personnel including 
study  monitors.  Thus  blinded  Novartis  team  continuing  with  study  conduct  beyond  Week  24,  study 
monitors, Investigators and patients continued to remain blinded until after Week 52 database lock. 
Any interim data analyses for the DMC or any other interim analyses which could be requested by health 
authorities  during  the  blinded  portion  of  the  study  were  performed  without  unblinding  of  Novartis 
personnel. Unblinded data was only made available to independent Novartis/CRO individuals involved in 
the preparation of the interim analyses and who were not directly involved in the study conduct. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Randomised, Full Analysis, and Safety Analysis Sets were defined. The randomised set was defined as 
all  patients  who  were  randomised.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  mis-randomised  patients,  where  IRT 
contacts were made prematurely and double-blind treatment was not administrated were excluded from 
the randomised set. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all patients from the randomised set to whom 
study  treatment  had  been  assigned.  Following  the  intent-to-treat  principle,  patients  were  analysed 
according to the treatment assigned at randomisation. If the actual stratum was different to the assigned 
stratum in IRT, the actual stratum was used in analyses. The safety set included all patients who took 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 44/131 
 
 
 
at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Patients were analysed according to 
treatment received. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were PASI 75 response at Week 12 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response 
at  Week  12.  The  analysis of  the  co-primary  and  key  secondary  variables  was  based  on  the  FAS.  The 
objective was to demonstrate superiority of Low or High dose of secukinumab with respect to PASI 75 
response or IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12. 
Both co-primary endpoints was to be evaluated using an exact logistic regression model with treatment 
group, baseline body weight stratum, age stratum and baseline PASI score as explanatory variables. If 
convergence  was  not  reached,  the  covariates  could  be  removed  from  the  model  one  by  one  until 
convergence was reached, by starting with continuous covariates (i.e., baseline PASI) and followed by 
removing categorical covariates (i.e., age stratum, body weight stratum). 
Odds ratios were computed for comparisons of secukinumab dose regimens versus placebo utilizing the 
logistic regression model fitted. Confidence intervals for risk difference were derived based on the exact 
method.  In  case  of  rates  of  0%  or  100%  in  one  of  the  treatment  groups,  for  analyses  with  multiple 
imputation, confidence intervals for risk difference and p-values from the t-test for the risk difference 
comparing to 0 were provided; for analyses with non-responder imputation, Fisher’s exact test was to 
be performed and confidence intervals for risk difference were provided. 
Missing data 
Response variables based on PASI score and IGA mod 2011 categories up to week 24 were imputed with 
multiple imputation (MI) as primary imputation method for the missing values and pure-non-responder 
imputation  as  a  sensitivity  method.  Other  response  variables  (e.g.,  CDLQI  and  CHAQ  score)  were 
imputed  with  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF).  MI  was  a  simulation  based  approach  where 
missing  values  were  replaced  by  multiple  Bayesian draws  from  the  conditional  distribution  of  missing 
data given the observed data and covariates, creating multiple completed data sets. These completed 
data sets were analysed using standard methods. Within this analysis, the PASI score or IGA mod 2011 
categories  were  imputed  and  response  variables  were  derived  based  on  the  imputed  scores.  In  the 
multiple imputation analysis, the response status was imputed based on the individual treatment arm 
information. The imputations were done separately for each treatment group. 
Supportive analyses were to be performed as follows: 
•  Co-primary  endpoints  and  key  secondary  endpoint  were  to  be  evaluated  using  the  logistic 
regression  model  (as  described  in  primary  analysis  method)  with  pure  non-responder 
imputations instead of multiple imputations for missing values. 
• 
Primary analysis was also to be evaluated on the subset of adolescents. 
The  secondary  variable  in  testing  strategy  was  the  PASI  90  response  at  Week  12  (for  superiority 
comparison of secukinumab doses versus placebo). The secondary efficacy variable PASI 90 at Week 12 
in the same way as the primary variables. It was analysed using the FAS unless otherwise specified. 
Additional data driven analysis 
Upon  performing  the  pure  non-responder  imputation  it  was  noticed  that  many  Week  12  efficacy 
assessments were noted as missing and thus patients were accounted as non-responders for the analysis 
at Week 12. Therefore, an additional sensitivity analysis with extended Week 12 analysis visit window 
using non-responder imputation and multiple imputation was performed (Week 12 visit window Day 72 
- 102 instead of Day 72 - 88).

Subgroups of interests 
The co-primary endpoints and important secondary endpoints and selected safety endpoints were to be 
evaluated using the following subgroups: 
•  Randomisation weight strata (< 25 kg, 25-< 50 kg, ≥ 50 kg) 
•  Randomisation age strata (< 12 years or ≥ 12 years) 
• 
Previous systemic therapy (Yes, No) 
Multiple testing 
The  graphical  approach  for  sequentially  rejective  testing  procedure  is  used  to  illustrate  the  testing 
strategy in Figure below. 
Figure 11 
Testing strategy 
One-sided p-values were derived. The family-wise error was set to α=2.5% (one sided). The hypotheses 
were  mapped  into  two  sets  (H1,  H3  and  H5)  or  (H2,  H4  and  H6)  such  that  hypotheses  within  a  set 
correspond to the same secukinumab dose regimen. In essence, the type-I-error probability was to be 
equally split for both sets of hypotheses and within each set the hypothesis were tested sequentially as 
follows: 
Within each pair, of hypotheses (H1 or H3) and (H2 or H4), each hypothesis was to be tested at α/2 
(one-sided). Only if both hypotheses of a pair were rejected, the testing sequence was continued. 
In  the  next  step  of  the  sequence,  the  null  hypotheses  corresponding  to  the  PASI  90  comparison  of 
secukinumab versus placebo was to be tested. H5 and H6 were tested at α/2 (one-sided). 
If all hypotheses within a set referring to a secukinumab dose regimen had been rejected, i.e., either 
(H1, H3 and H5) or (H2, H4 and H6), the corresponding type I error probability could be passed on to 
the other set of hypotheses, and if needed, hypotheses could be retested at a higher significance level. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 187 patients were screened, of which 162 completed the screening phase and were randomised 
to the four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The majority of patients (96.3% overall) completed the

Induction period; 1 to 2 patients in each treatment group discontinued during the Induction period. The 
reasons for discontinuations were AE (2 patients: toxic shock syndrome in the secukinumab High dose 
group  and  pustular  psoriasis  in  the  placebo  group),  subject/guardian  decision  (2  patients),  lack  of 
efficacy  (1 patient)  and  protocol  deviation  (1  patient).  Patient  disposition  in  the  Induction  period  is 
displayed in Table below. 
Table 17 
Patient disposition by treatment - Induction period (Randomised set) 
Patient  disposition  in  the  Maintenance  period  is  displayed  in  Table  below.  Of  the  156 patients  who 
completed  the  Induction  period,  151  (~97%)  entered  the  Maintenance  period,  as  5  placebo  PASI  75 
responders  at  Week  12  did  not  proceed  into  the  Maintenance  period  as  expected  per  protocol.  One 
placebo patient  continued into Maintenance, as the site erroneously entered PASI non-responder in the 
IRT  system;  the  patient  was  allowed  to  proceed  in  Maintenance  and  was  treated  actively  until  and 
including Week 16. When the site corrected the entry to PASI responder at Week 16, the system did not 
allow the patient to continue further and the patient was discontinued due to protocol deviation. 
Eleven patients (7.1%) did not complete the Maintenance period. One patient each in the secukinumab 
Low dose and secukinumab High dose groups discontinued the Maintenance period due to adverse event 
and lack of efficacy, respectively. Among the patients originally randomised to placebo who completed 
the  Induction  period  and  were  PASI  75  non-responders  at  Week  12,  16  patients  were  assigned  to 
secukinumab Low dose and 18 patients were assigned to secukinumab High dose starting at Week 12. 
The majority of these patients (placebo - secukinumab Low dose: 15 patients [93.8%] and placebo - 
secukinumab High dose: 16 patients [88.9%]) completed the Maintenance period. 
Of the 41 patients who were randomised to the etanercept group during the Induction period, one patient 
discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  Forty  patients  entered  the  Maintenance  period, 
6 patients in this group (including 3 due to lack of efficacy) discontinued study treatment.

randomisation visit or switched from placebo to secukinumab at Week 12, 106 patients (93.0%) entered 
the Extension period (Any secukinumab Low dose group: 53 patients and Any secukinumab High dose 
group: 53 patients). Ninety-five patients were still continuing in the Extension period at the time of cut-
off date for the Week 52 analysis. The current rate of discontinuation during Extension period is 12.5% 
in the Any secukinumab Low dose group and 6.9% in the Any secukinumab High dose group. It should 
be noted that patients in the etanercept group are not eligible for the Extension period but enter the 
Post-treatment follow-up period at the end of the Maintenance period.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for Study A2310 had an effective date of 26 March 2015, and first patient first visit 
took place on 29 September 2015. The first data cut-off date for the current submission was 7 March 
2019; a second cut-off was done on 18 September 2019 to enable analysis of the full Week 52 dataset. 
The study protocol was amended on three occasions. In Amendment 1, dated 1 April 2015, further detail 
and  clarification  was  added  on  the  duration  of  contraception  requested  during  the  study  and  to  give 
option to align the duration on local label requirements. 
Within Amendment 2, dated 10 February 2016, inclusion criterion #5 (characterisation of a patient being 
a candidate for systemic therapy) was modified to align with text agreed with PDCO. The CHAQ was also 
added  for  subjects  with  a  history  of  psoriatic  arthritis,  following  a  request  by  the  Japanese  Health 
Authority. At the time of Amendment 2, 4 patients had been randomised into the study. 
The  purpose  of  Amendment  3  was  to  introduce  an  additional  Interim  Analysis  prior  to  the  Week  24 
analysis  once  sufficient  safety  and  pharmacokinetic  data  had  been  collected.  At  the  time  of  this 
Amendment, a total of 120 patients were enrolled. However, the MAH ultimately decided that the analysis 
was not warranted and was thus not performed. 
Overall, 75% of the randomised patients had at least one protocol deviation until the time of the Week 
52  analysis  data  cut-off.  Protocol  deviations  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  secukinumab  High 
dose  group  (92.5%)  followed  by  placebo  -  secukinumab  Low  dose  group  (83.3%)  compared  to  the 
etanercept group (73.2%), secukinumab Low dose group (70%) and placebo - secukinumab Low dose 
(56.3%) group. In the placebo group (i.e., the 7 placebo patients who did not enter Maintenance), 3 
(42.9%) patients had at least one protocol deviation. 
The most common protocol deviation was “treatment deviation” (84 patients, 51.9% overall), which was 
most frequent in the secukinumab High dose group (70%) and the secukinumab Low dose group (60%). 
The most common treatment deviation was “active medication instead of placebo administered to patient 
following IRT error” (36 patients, 22% overall), being reported for 20 patients in the secukinumab High 
dose group and 16 patients in the secukinumab Low dose group. The underlying reason was an error in 
the  Interactive  Response  Technology  (IRT)  system  used  in  the  study,  leading  to  additional  dosing  of 
patients. Specifically, 36 patients who were assigned to the Low dose (16 patients) and High dose (20 
patients) secukinumab groups were dispensed active medication at the Week 13, 14 and 15 visits. At 
these  visits,  the  patients  who  were  randomised  to  active  treatment  groups  were  expected  to  receive 
placebo medication as to maintain the blind. However, 5 patients in the secukinumab High dose group 
(25 - < 50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 150 mg at these visits; 16 patients 
in the secukinumab Low dose group (≥ 50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 300 
mg at these visits; and 15 patients in the secukinumab High dose group (≥ 50 kg/300 mg dose) were 
dispensed in error secukinumab 300 mg at these visits. The dosing errors happened after the primary 
endpoint (Week 12) assessment and thus did not impact the primary endpoint analysis. Furthermore, 
the error was rectified before enrolment of patients into the younger age stratum was commenced and 
thus only affected the older age stratum. 
The second most common protocol deviation was  “other deviation” (61 patients, 37.7% overall). The 
most  common  other  deviations  were  “central  laboratory  analyses  not  conducted  at  a  scheduled  visit” 
and “patient reported outcome (PRO) assessment done after study medication administration” (reported 
in 21 and 20 patients, respectively). Prohibited concomitant medication use was more frequent in the 
secukinumab High dose group compared to other groups. According to the MAH, only 6 patients used 
prohibited concomitant medication prior to the Week 12 assessment, and the majority of patients using 
prohibited  concomitant  medications  after  Week  12  either  used  them  only  after  Week  52  or  after 
premature discontinuation and while in the follow-up period.

secukinumab Low dose group than in the secukinumab High dose, placebo or etanercept groups (42.5%, 
22.5%,  22.0%  and  19.5%,  respectively).  The  majority  of  patients  (97.5%  overall)  had  no  previous 
exposure to biologic psoriasis therapies. 
Numbers analysed 
The numbers of patients included in analysis data sets for the various treatment periods are summarised 
in Table below. According to the MAH, no patients were excluded from any analysis set.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Analysis 
As seen in Table below, the study achieved its primary and key secondary objectives at Week 12. Both 
Low  and  High  dose  secukinumab  groups  were  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  the  co-primary 
endpoints of PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response and the key secondary endpoint of 
PASI 90 at Week 12 (p< 0.0001 for all comparisons).

Co-Primary Endpoints 
Both secukinumab dose levels (Low and High) were superior to placebo with respect to PASI 75 response 
and IGA 0/1 response at Week 12 (Table 25; Figure 12). In the primary statistical analyses, performed 
using multiple imputation for missing data, a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was achieved by 80.1% of 
patients in the secukinumab Low dose group and 80.2% of patients in the secukinumab High dose group 
compared with 14.9% of patients in the placebo group. Similarly, at Week 12, an IGA 0/1 response was 
achieved  by  69.8%  of  patients  in  the  secukinumab  Low  dose  group  and  62.6%  of  patients  in  the 
secukinumab High dose group compared with 6.3% of patients in the placebo group. Sensitivity analyses 
based  on  a  pure  non-responder  imputation  strategy  demonstrated  similar  differences  between  the 
treatment groups. 
In  the  etanercept  group,  a  PASI  75  response  was  achieved  by  65.7%  of  patients,  and  an  IGA  0/1 
response by 36.3% of patients. Statistical comparisons between etanercept and secukinumab were not 
part of the formal testing strategy.

Key Secondary Endpoint 
At  Week  12,  PASI  90  response  rates  were  also  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  for  both 
secukinumab dose levels (Table 25and Figure 12); in the multiple imputation dataset, a PASI 90 response 
at  Week  12  was  achieved  by  71.1%  of  patients  in  the  secukinumab  Low  dose  group  and  69.3%  of 
patients in the secukinumab High dose group compared with 2.5% of patients in the placebo group. A 
31.4% response rate was seen in the etanercept group. 
Additional analysis using extended visit window 
As  indicated  above,  upon  performing  the  pure  non-responder  imputation  the  MAH  noticed  that  many 
Week  12  efficacy  assessments  were  noted  as  missing  and  thus  patients  were  accounted  as  non-
responders for the analysis at Week 12, whereas an assessment was in fact available somewhat outside 
the pre-specified Week 12 visit window. Consequently, an additional analysis with an extended Week 12 
analysis visit window was performed using a Week 12 visit window of Day 72 - 102 instead of Day 72 - 
88. Results from this analysis using non-responder imputation are displayed in Table below.

2 to Week 4 onward, with further increases observed until Week 12. A consistent pattern (from Week 
12 to Week 52) was seen among patients switching from placebo to secukinumab at Week 12.

Patient Reported Outcomes (CDLQI, CHAQ) 
At  Week  12,  the  proportions  of  patients  achieving  a  CDLQI  0  or  1  response  (indicating  no  or  little 
impairment) were 44.7% in the secukinumab Low dose group and 50% in the High dose group, compared 
with 36.6% in the etanercept group and 15% in the placebo group. Mean decrease (improvement) in 
CDLQI total score from baseline to Week 12 was: 
-9.05 (-67.43%) in the secukinumab Low dose group, 
-7.71 (-62.50%) in the secukinumab High dose group, 
Assessment report

-6.49 (-62.80%) in the etanercept group, and 
-3.79 (-18.48%) in the placebo group. 
Summary  statistics  for  CHAQ  were  not  computed  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  with  psoriatic 
arthritis. 
Maintenance of Effect 
As seen in Figure 13 above, response rates achieved by Week 12 were generally maintained or increased 
further  during  maintenance.  At  Week  52,  numerically  highest  response  rates  were  observed  in  the 
secukinumab High dose group (Table below). Response rates in both secukinumab groups were higher 
than in the etanercept group at all visits up to Week 52. High response rates at Week 52 were also seen 
for  patients  switching  from  placebo  to  secukinumab  at  Week  12,  although  patient  numbers  in  these 
groups are smaller.

As the study remains ongoing and many patients remain on treatment, opportunities to evaluate relapse 
and rebound are limited. In the analysis of Week 52 data, 6 patients (1 patient in the placebo group, 
one patient in the secukinumab High dose group, one patient in the placebo-Low dose switch group, and

three patients in the etanercept group) met criteria for relapse after treatment discontinuation. Three 
patients experienced a rebound event; one patient in secukinumab High dose group reported an event 
of erythrodermic psoriasis during the Follow up Period, 34 days after the last secukinumab dose; one 
patient in etanercept group also reported an event of erythrodermic psoriasis; the event started 7 days 
after the last etanercept dose; and one patient in the placebo group had new pustular psoriasis starting 
on Day 9, one day after the unique placebo dose. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses: Weight and Age Strata, Previous Exposure to Systemic Therapy 
Results of  a  subgroup  analysis  of  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  at  Week  12  by  weight  strata 
used to define the dosing regimens, based on a pure non-responder imputation strategy, are displayed 
in Table 28. For weight stratum < 25 kg, it should be noted that the same 75 mg dose was used in both 
the Low and High dose groups. 
A  corresponding  subgroup  analysis  was  undertaken  by  age  stratum,  and  the  results  are  displayed  in 
Table below. 
A subgroup analysis was also undertaken to assess response among patients with and without previous 
exposure to systemic therapy, and the results are displayed in Table 30.

An analysis of responses over time until Week 52 was also performed for the groups by body weight and 
dose  group.  In  the  ≥25-<50  kg  weight  category,  the  patients  receiving  High  (secukinumab  150  mg 
(n=15)) and Low dose (secukinumab 75 mg (n=17)) reached comparable PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 
and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses at Week 14. From Week 15, the patients on secukinumab Low dose 
showed higher responses than those receiving secukinumab High dose up to Week 52. At Week 52, the 
PASI  75/90/100  and  IGA  mod  2011  0/1  response  rates  were  80.0%,  66.7%,  26.7%  and  60.0%, 
respectively, for the 150 mg group and 88.2%, 76.5%, 58.8% and 76.5%, respectively, for the 75 mg 
group.

In  the  ≥ 50  kg  weight  category,  throughout  the  Maintenance  period  the  patients  on  High  dose 
(secukinumab 300 mg (n=21)) showed higher PASI and IGA responses than those receiving Low dose 
(secukinumab 150 mg (n=22)). At Week 52, the PASI 75/90/100 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 response rates 
were 100%, 95.2%, 61.9% and 85.7%, respectively, for the 300 mg group and 86.4%, 72.7%, 27.3% 
and 68.2%, respectively, for the 150 mg group. 
2.4.2.2.  Study CAIN457A2311 
“A randomized, open-label, multicenter trial to assess the efficacy of 
subcutaneous secukinumab after twelve weeks of treatment, and to assess 
the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy in subjects from 6 to less 
than 18 years of age with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis” 
Methods 
Study A2311 is an ongoing randomised, open-label, historical controlled study, consisting of a screening 
period of up to 4 weeks, a 208 week treatment period and a 16 week post-treatment follow-up period. 
An outline of the study design is displayed in Figure below. 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either secukinumab Low dose or High dose 
during the treatment period. Randomisation was stratified by body weight (< 25kg, 25-< 50 kg, ≥ 50kg) 
and disease severity (moderate (PASI score 12-<20 and IGA 3 or 4 or PASI score ≥ 20 and IGA 3) or 
severe (PASI score ≥ 20 and IGA of 4), collected at the Randomisation Visit.

There is no within study control drug. A historical placebo control was obtained using data from qualifying 
trials  (adult  secukinumab  placebo-controlled  trials  and  paediatric  placebo-controlled  trials  with 
secukinumab or other biologics), and used as the comparator for the primary and key secondary endpoint 
analysis.  According  to  the  MAH,  this  is  in  line  with  the  guidance  from  and  discussions  with  Health 
Authorities  including  FDA  and  EMA  (PDCO-Paediatric  Committee  of  the  European  Medicines  Agency) 
which  suggested  reducing  placebo  exposure  as  well  as  overall  clinical  trial  burden  for  paediatric 
population and suggest/accept use of extrapolation approach. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of secukinumab in pediatric patients aged 
6 years to less than 18 years old with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with respect to PASI 
75  and  IGA  mod  2011  0  or  1  response  (co-primary  endpoints)  at  Week  12,  compared  to  placebo 
(historical control). 
The secondary objectives defined in the study protocol were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of secukinumab in pediatric patients with respect to PASI 90 at Week 
12 compared to placebo (historical control). 
To investigate the clinical safety and tolerability of secukinumab as assessed by growth, weight 
gain,  vital  signs,  clinical  laboratory  variables,  electrocardiogram  (ECG)s,  and  adverse  event 
monitoring. 
To evaluate the PK of secukinumab in pediatric patients. 
The  exploratory  objectives  defined  in  the  study  protocol  and  assessed  until  Week  16  to  support  the 
current assessment were: 
• 
• 
• 
To  assess  efficacy  of  secukinumab  with  respect  to  PASI  75,  PASI  90,  PASI  100  and  IGA  mod 
2011 0 or 1 over time up to Week 16. 
To investigate the effects of treatment with secukinumab with respect to Children’s Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (CDLQI) 0 or 1 score over time, up to Week 12. 
To investigate the development of immunogenicity against secukinumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The endpoint corresponding to the primary objective was the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 
75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12 in each secukinumab treatment group (Low dose and 
High dose). Placebo data were obtained from adult secukinumab placebo-controlled trials and pediatric 
placebo-controlled trials with secukinumab or other biologics. 
Endpoints for secondary objectives were: 
• 
Proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  PASI  90  response  at  Week  12  in  each  secukinumab 
treatment  group  (Low  dose  and  High  dose).  Placebo  data  were  obtained  from  adult  placebo-
controlled trials and pediatric placebo-controlled trials. 
•  Height and weight, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, ECG and adverse events. 
•  Secukinumab concentration in serum at various time points. 
Endpoints for exploratory objectives were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 63/131 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients in PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response over 
time up to Week 16. 
Proportion of patients achieving CDLQI 0 or 1 over time up to Week 12. 
•  Development of anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to secukinumab. 
Sample size 
Per the current PIP, at least 60 paediatric patients with moderate psoriasis should be enrolled into the 
study; the total sample size is not defined in the KBE’s. No details concerning sample size calculation 
have  been  provided.  Based  on  reported  data,  84  patients  of  whom  61  had  moderate  disease,  were 
enrolled into the study. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either secukinumab Low dose or High dose during the 
treatment period. Randomisation was stratified by body weight (< 25kg, 25-< 50 kg, ≥ 50kg) and disease 
severity (moderate (PASI score 12-<20 and IGA 3 or 4 or PASI score ≥ 20 and IGA 3) or severe (PASI 
score ≥ 20 and IGA of 4), collected at the Randomisation Visit. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients with PASI 75 response and IGA 0/1 
response  at  Week  12.  Analysis  of  the  co-primary  and  secondary  endpoint  (proportion  of  PASI  90 
responders)  was  performed  on  each  treatment  group  separately  (secukinumab  High  dose  against 
historical placebo and secukinumab Low dose against historical placebo) on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
The  statistical  hypothesis  was  that  secukinumab  (High  dose/Low  dose)  was  not  superior  to  historical 
placebo  with  respect  to  co-primary  endpoints  and  key  secondary  endpoint  PASI  90  at  Week  12.  A 
Bayesian  method  was  chosen  to  allow  the  direct  incorporation  into  the  analysis  of  information  about 
placebo response rates from historical data through a meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) prior. 
First, a logistic Bayesian mixed effects model was fitted to the historical placebo data, including terms 
study  and  population  (adult  or  paediatric).  This  was  built  to  predict  efficacy  outcomes  of  a  future 
paediatric trial taking into account between study heterogeneity of the control response rate. The adult 
studies  were  assigned  a  smaller  weight  in  comparison  to  the  paediatric  studies.  This  was  achieved 
through  allocation  to  two  distinct  exchangeability  strata  which  share  a  common  population  response 
rate,  but  differ  in  their  between-trial  heterogeneity  parameter  τs(h).  Moderate  between-trial 
heterogeneity  (with  τ  prior  set  as  HalfNormal(0,  0.5))  was  defined  for  paediatric  study  data  and 
substantial heterogeneity (with τ prior set as HalfNormal(0, 1)) was defined for adult study data, thus 
allowing  paediatric  study  data  to  be  given  a  higher  weight  compared  to  adult  study  data.  From  this 
model, the MAP prior was derived on the logit scale, and represented the predicted placebo log odds of 
the paediatric study, which was used in this study as the comparator. For each endpoint the resulting 
posterior distributions forming the MAP prior were approximated with a parametric distribution. 
A separate logistic Bayesian model was fitted for each endpoint on the log odds scale to active data from 
this study with the term treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 64/131 
 
 
 
These data were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior of the log odds ratio between secukinumab 
and placebo treatment response rate in this study. For the log odds of the secukinumab treatment groups 
a  non-informative  prior  was  used,  whilst  the  placebo  treatment  group  log  odds  response  rate  was 
represented though the MAP prior as described above. 
Comparisons with placebo was performed for the secukinumab Low and High dose group separately on 
each of the efficacy endpoints (PASI 75, PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 at week 12) using MCMC in Stan version 
2.17.1. 
The analysis reported the posterior of the mean log odds ratio as point estimate by its median, its 95% 
credible interval and the probability of a positive treatment effect, which corresponded to the level of 
evidence for a positive treatment effect. 
Missing values with respect to response variables based on PASI score and IGA 0/1 score were imputed 
with  non-response  regardless  to  the  reason  for  missing  data  (e.g.  premature  study  discontinuation, 
missed visit, administrative issues). This imputation was used for the primary and secondary endpoint 
Bayesian analysis. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint of this study is the proportion of patients with a PASI 90 response 
at  Week  12.  These  data  were  analysed  in  the  same  way  as  the  primary  endpoint  though  a  Bayesian 
framework. 
Summary statistics for PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, and IGA 0/1 response by visit were presented in 
contingency tables and included absolute and relative frequencies. In addition, summaries of the above 
efficacy endpoints were presented by age, disease severity strata and body weight strata. Missing data 
were imputed with pure non-responder imputation method (as described above). 
All  safety  evaluations  were  based  on  the  safety  set.  Data  were  presented  by  the  following  treatment 
groups: 
• 
• 
secukinumab Low dose: all patients who were randomized to secukinumab Low dose 
secukinumab High dose: all patients who were randomized to secukinumab High dose 
•  Any secukinumab dose: data on secukinumab groups above pooled together. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  92  patients  were  screened  of  which  84  patients  completed  the  screening  phase  and  were 
randomised  to  the  two  treatment  groups  in  a  1:1  ratio.  All  except  three  patients  (from  secukinumab 
High  dose  group)  completed  the  Week  24  visit  (81/84  patients;  96.4%  overall);  thus  81  patients 
remained ongoing in the study at the time of the data cut-off. The reasons for discontinuations were AEs 
in two patients (ALT and AST elevations in one patient, and haemorrhagic diarrhoea in one patient) and 
lack of efficacy in one patient. Patient disposition is displayed in Table below.

Recruitment 
Study A2311 was conducted across 23 Investigator sites in 9 participating countries: 2 centres in Belgium 
(n=4), 2 centres in Czech Republic (n=5), 1 centre in Estonia (n=7), 2 centres in Germany (n=11), 1 
centre in Peru (n=5), 3 centres in Poland (n=17), 4 centres in Russia (n=14), 4 centres in Spain (n=10), 
and 4 centres in the United States (n=11). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for Study A2311 had an effective date of 7 February 2018, and first patient first 
visit took place on 29 August 2018. The last data cut-off date to support the current submission was 14 
November 2019, enabling analysis of the Week 24 dataset. According to the MAH, there have been no 
amendments to the study protocol. 
The most common protocol deviation was ‘other’ deviation (15/84 subjects; 17.9%) which was reported 
with  a  similar  frequency  between  the  secukinumab  Low  dose  (7/42  subjects;  16.7%)  and  High  dose 
(8/42  subjects;  19.0%)  groups.  These  ‘other’  deviations  included  missing  assessments  (IGA,  PASI, 
haematology  or  pregnancy  test,  haematology  being  the  most  common).  The  second  most  common 
protocol deviation was ‘treatment deviation’ (the study drug was not administered at the scheduled “drug 
dispensing  study  visit”)  in  both  secukinumab  Low  dose  (2/42  subjects;  4.8%)  and  High  dose  (4/42 
subjects; 9.5%) groups. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the study patients are summarised in Table below. In the entire study 
population, mean age was 12.6 years; 61% of patients (N=51) were in the age stratum 12-<18 years 
and 39% (N=33) in the 6-<12 year stratum. Overall mean weight was about 55 kg; 9.5% of patients 
(N=8) were in the weight stratum <25 kg, 29.8% (N=25) in the weight stratum 25- <50 kg, and 60.7% 
(N=51) in the weight stratum >= 50 kg. The patients were predominantly Caucasian, with a 54%:46% 
female:male split.

Disease characteristics and history at baseline are summarised in Tables below. Overall mean PASI score 
was 18.86 (range 12.0 - 45.6) and mean % of affected body surface area was 29.9% (range 10.5% - 
77.0%). Severity of psoriasis was moderate for 72.6% of patients (N=61) and severe for 27.4% (N=23). 
Patients had a mean history of 3.9 years since first diagnosis of plaque psoriasis, and only one patient 
had not received previous treatment for their psoriasis.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results: PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 at Week 12 
Both  secukinumab  doses  (Low  and  High)  were  superior  to  historical  placebo  with  respect  to  PASI  75 
response and IGA 0/1 response at Week 12. Estimates for the log odds ratios and credible intervals from 
the Bayesian analysis are displayed in Table and Figure below. The estimated probability of a positive 
treatment effect (i.e., log OR >0) for secukinumab Low or High dose compared to historical placebo is 1 
(100%).  This  supports  the  conclusion  that  efficacy  response  rates  on  secukinumab  are  better  than 
historical placebo.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
N/A 
Supportive studies 
Comparison of efficacy results from study A2310 vs. previously completed secukinumab studies in adult 
psoriasis patients is discussed in Section 2.3. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current variation application is based on interim analyses of two ongoing studies: 
1)  Analysis  of  data  up  to  Week  52  in  study  A2310,  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  and 
etanercept controlled study in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The study 
consists  of  a  screening  period  of  up  to  4  weeks,  a  placebo-  and  active-controlled  12  week 
induction period, an active-controlled 40 week maintenance period, a non-controlled 184 week 
extension period, and a 16 week post-treatment follow-up period. The study is referred to as 
“Study 3” in the currently agreed PIP for secukinumab in paediatric psoriasis. 
2)  Analysis of data up to Week 24 in study A2311, a randomised open-label study with a historical 
placebo control group and a treatment period of 208 weeks in paediatric patients with moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The study is referred to as “Study 4” in the PIP. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study A2310 
The general design features of this double-blind placebo- and active-controlled study are in accordance 
with the EU Guideline on psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr) and are also in agreement with the PIP 
(recognising  that  the  study  remains  ongoing,  and  possibilities  to  assess  remission  and  relapse  are 
therefore limited). According to the MAH, etanercept was chosen as an active comparator, since it was 
the first biologic medication approved for use in children and adolescents with severe psoriasis in the 
European  Union  and  elsewhere.  This  justification  is  acceptable  to  CHMP.  Placebo  responders  were 
discontinued  from  the  study  at  Week  12.  While  this  may  be  justifiable  from  an  efficacy  assessment 
perspective, it is noted that continuing these already enrolled patients on active medication could have 
provided useful further data regarding the safety of secukinumab. 
The inclusion criteria are appropriate for defining a paediatric population with severe plaque psoriasis. 
According to the MAH, the definition of severe disease was also agreed with PDCO during the psoriasis 
PIP discussions. Exclusion criteria are acceptable and not unduly restrictive. The definition of a patient 
being “a candidate for systemic therapy” was analogous to that used in the adult program, essentially 
permitting use as first-line systemic therapy. 
Secukinumab  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  modelling  and  simulation  from  adult  psoriasis  data; 
separate dose response studies in paediatric patients were not performed. Etanercept was administered 
according to its approved posology in paediatric plaque psoriasis; the duration of treatment per current 
etanercept SmPC is capped at 24 weeks, but re-treatment is permitted.  
It  is  noted  that  a  75  mg  pre-filled  syringe  was  used  for  administration  of  secukinumab  in  the  study. 
Commercial availability of this presentation would facilitate treatment of patients in the < 50 kg weight 
range, and considering that the 150 mg vial may is not available across all Member States, might even 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 78/131 
 
 
 
be critical to enable adequate treatment of these patients. The MAH was invited to comment on plans to 
introduce such a presentation and how the 75 mg dose envisioned in the SmPC would be administered 
for patients in Member States where the 150 mg vial has not been introduced. In its response, the MAH 
assured that the secukinumab 150 mg lyophilised vial can be made available to patients in all the Member 
States, where needed. Furthermore, the MAH indicated that it is currently planning to submit in EU the 
extension application for the registration of the Cosentyx 75 mg/0.5 mL PFS by the end of 2020. 
The pre-defined primary endpoints are in accordance with Guideline requirements; the MAH-developed 
IGA  mod  2011  scale  was  deemed  acceptable  during  assessment  of  the  adult  psoriasis  indication  for 
secukinumab. A large number of secondary and exploratory objectives were defined; however, they were 
not  included  within  the  hierarchical  statistical  testing  strategy.  All  comparisons  to  etanercept  were 
included  within  exploratory  objectives,  and  references  to  statistical  significance  and  p  values  for 
comparisons vs. etanercept were therefore removed from the SmPC proposal. 
The sample size was based on a power calculation that confirms a high likelihood of meeting the study 
aims based on the assumed response rates. The sample size is also in agreement with binding elements 
of the current PIP. The sample size calculation does not include the element of stratification; however 
as it is likely that it would increase the power, the sample size calculation is acceptable to CHMP. 
Forced randomisation was used, which typically forces a deviation from the randomisation scheme. The 
use  of  forced  randomisations  is  not  included  in  the  protocol  deviation  list,  which  suggests  that  this 
conduct  was  according  to  the  protocol;  however,  with  strict ITT  principle,  these  patients  should have 
been treated according to the randomisation scheme, not according to the treatment available at the 
site. The MAH clarified that the decision to permit the use of forced randomisation was based primarily 
on  ethical  grounds.  Actual  use  of  forced  randomisation  was  limited  to  a  few  cases  and  based  on  an 
additional sensitivity analysis presented by the MAH, did not have any significant influence on the results 
of the study. The clarification was acceptable to the CHMP. 
IRT technology was utilised in the randomisation procedure. Due to an error caused by the IRT system, 
dosing errors were recognised, for which further clarification was requested. According to the MAH, the 
unfortunate IRT error affected only subjects that were initially randomised to active drug and was only 
limited  to  weeks  13,  14  and  15.  However,  as  the  error  indeed  happened,  the  MAH  was  requested  to 
clarify the reason for the error, and to further explain how it has been ascertained that this error was 
limited  to  dosing  of  secukinumab  patients  dosed  at  weeks  13,  14  and  15  and  that  the  possibility  of 
additional  mix-ups,  e.g.,  for  dosings  prior  to  week  12  can  be  excluded.  Based  on  additional  details 
provided by the MAH, the CHMP agreed that the IRT error was unlikely to have affected pre-Week 12 
dosings or the integrity of the Week 12 data. 
The blinding procedures of the double-blind treatment arms are acceptable in general. The CHMP noted 
that the open-label use of etanercept was unfortunate, as it may introduce a bias in any data collected 
in this group. 
The analysis populations as defined are commonly used and acceptable to the CHMP. The used statistical 
analysis  method  is  suitable  for  binary  response  data.  The  multiple  testing  strategy  is  appropriate  to 
protect type-I-error rate on acceptable level. 
For missing data of the primary endpoints, two methods were planned to be used, multiple imputation 
assuming MAR and non-responder imputation. 75% of the missing data (18/24) was caused by a narrow 
visit window at week 12, the rest (6/24) was due to treatment discontinuations. The assumption of MAR 
is realistic for the missing caused by narrow visit window, but unlikely for the discontinuations, and the 
non-responder imputation is too conservative for missing caused by narrow visit window, thus neither 
of the planned methods is optimal. A data driven analysis was conducted using extended visit window, 
in which actual observed data was used for all except for missing due to discontinuations. At the CHMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 79/131 
 
 
 
request,  the  extended  time-window  analysis  with  non-responder  imputation  for  discontinuations  was 
used to present the results in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The  study  was  conducted  across  47  Investigator  sites  in  19  countries.  Of  the  total  of  162  patients 
enrolled, the largest numbers were recruited in Poland (28), Germany (25), Russia (13), Egypt (11) and 
Estonia  (11).  More  than  60%  of  the  study  patients  were  enrolled  at  sites  located  within  EU  Member 
States. 
The  overall  attrition  rate  during  the  initial  12  week  induction  period  was  low,  with  95  %  of  patients 
completing Week 12 in all treatment groups. Similarly, over 90 % of patients entering the maintenance 
period completed Week 52. 
An  error  in  the  IRT  system  led  to  incorrect  dosing  of  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
Maintenance  period.  The  primary  endpoint  analysis  (Week  12)  was  not  affected  by  the  error,  but  it 
cannot be excluded that Week 24 analyses were impacted by exposures that are higher than intended. 
However,  subsequent  to  full  Week  52  data  becoming  available  during  assessment,  Week  24  data  is 
considered of limited importance. 
Use of prohibited concomitant medication was reported in a substantial proportion of patients (e.g., 25% 
in the secukinumab High dose group). However, based on additional details provided by the MAH, it is 
unlikely that these medications would have a significant influence on the reported efficacy results. 
The  majority  of  enrolled  patients  were  in  the  older age  stratum  and  in  the  higher  weight  categories; 
37 patients (23%) were under 12 years, and 12 patients (7%) in the weight category < 25 kg. Mean 
PASI score was 28 and mean BSA affected was 40%, consistent with severe disease. Less than 10% of 
patients overall had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. 
In principle, the patients seem to meet the protocol definition “candidate for systemic therapy”; the use 
was essentially second line after failure on a previous systemic therapy in a substantial proportion of 
patients. About 53% of patients had received prior systemic therapies for psoriasis; the most commonly 
used  prior  systemic  therapies  were  methotrexate  (26.5%),  acitretin  (11.7%)  and  ciclosporin  (9.9%). 
The majority of patients (97.5% overall) had no previous exposure to biologic psoriasis therapies. 
Study A2311 
The design features of this study are in agreement with the PIP. Although data is currently available only 
through Week 24, the results can be considered to provide relevant additional information to support 
the overall assessment. 
The eligibility criteria are appropriate for defining a paediatric population with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. The definition of a patient being “a candidate for systemic therapy” was analogous to that used 
in the adult program and study A2310, essentially permitting use as first-line systemic therapy. 
Secukinumab dosing regimens and body weight categories to guide dose selection in study A2311 were 
identical to A2310. The absence of a concurrent control group is noted, and the use of a historical placebo 
control group had been agreed beforehand with the PDCO. The endpoints for this study were aligned 
with study A2310 and represent recognised endpoints in the EU Guideline. Based on reported enrolment 
numbers, the sample size is in accordance with the PIP KBE. 
Randomisation was stratified by body weight category and disease severity. A Bayesian approach was 
used for statistical testing. Considering the context with a historical control group, the described methods 
are acceptable. Non-responder imputation represents a conservative approach to missing data. 
The study was conducted across 23 Investigator sites in 9 countries. Of the total of 84 patients enrolled, 
the largest numbers were recruited in Poland (17), Russia (14), Germany (11), United States (11), and 
Assessment report

Spain (10). More than 60% of the study patients were enrolled at sites located within EU Member States. 
There have been no amendments to the original study protocol and reported protocol deviations seem 
unlikely to jeopardise data integrity. 
Of the 84 enrolled patients, 81 patients completed the Week 24 visit. The attrition rate during the early 
stages of the study was thus low, with over 90 % of patients completing Week 24 in both treatment 
groups. 
Similar to study A2310, the majority of enrolled patients were in the older age stratum and in the higher 
weight  categories;  33  patients  (39.3%)  were  under  12  years,  and  8  patients  (9.5%)  in  the  weight 
category <25 kg. Consistent with the overall aim of the study, the majority of patients (72.6%; N=61) 
had  disease  of  moderate  severity  at  baseline,  and  study  A2311  thus  provides  useful  insight  into  the 
actual performance of secukinumab in this subpopulation. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study A2310 
Statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  treatment  effects  were  seen  with  both  secukinumab 
dosages  on  the  co-primary  endpoints  as  well  as  the  key  secondary  endpoint;  there  was  no  numeric 
difference  between  the  dose  levels.  Although  not  part  of  the  formal  statistical  testing  strategy,  both 
dosages  also  demonstrated  numerically  better  response  rates  compared  to  the  active  comparator 
etanercept on the co-primary and key secondary endpoints. Sensitivity analyses based on non-responder 
imputation  supported  robustness  of  the  observation.  The  study  provides  good  evidence  of  the  short-
term efficacy of secukinumab in paediatric patients with severe psoriasis. 
There was no numeric difference in any efficacy parameter assessed at Week 12 and actual up-titration 
data is not available. In Week 52 data, some incremental efficacy with the higher 300 mg dose could be 
observed in the ≥50 kg weight stratum. In contrast, long-term response rates in the ≥25-<50 kg weight 
stratum were higher with the 75 mg dose than the 150 mg dose, questioning whether a recommendation 
to double the dose to achieve additional benefit would be appropriate in this weight stratum. Hence, the 
MAH proposed SmPC posology wording to indicate that the recommended dose can be increased from 
150 to 300 mg within weight stratum ≥50 kg and that some patients may derive additional benefit from 
a  higher  dose  was  endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  However,  at  the  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  removed  this 
recommendation for the 25-50 kg weight stratum from the SmPC. See also discussions on clinical safety 
(Section 2.5.1). 
Onset  of  activity  of  secukinumab  was  rapid,  with  responses  detected  from  Week  2  onward,  and  a 
consistent pattern was observed among placebo non-responders switching to secukinumab at Week 12. 
Results on the CDLQI indicated a favourable effect on subjectively experienced quality of life. Summary 
statistics for CHAQ were not computed due to the low number of patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Assessment of Week 24 data was hampered by the IRT dosing error affecting a significant proportion of 
subjects in both secukinumab groups. However, Week 52 data is less likely to be affected by the error 
and the CHMP concluded that long-term maintenance of effect until Week 52 has been demonstrated. 
Hence, a long-term indication has therefore been accepted by the CHMP. 
In subgroup analyses of Week 12 data based on age stratum, weight category and previous exposure to 
systemic therapy, substantially better response rates were generally observed in both secukinumab dose 
groups compared to placebo across all subgroups. It should be noted that the number of patients in the 
lowest weight group (<25 kg) is very small (total N=12), and conclusions regarding the younger age 
stratum are also limited by the small sample size (total N=37). Consistent with the main analyses, there 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 81/131 
 
 
 
was generally little difference between the secukinumab dose groups in response rates when assessed 
by the different subgroups although the younger age and lowest weight cohorts in this study alone are 
too small for robust conclusions. See discussion below for general conclusion on that point. 
Study A2311 
The overall results of Study A2311 are well aligned with those of study A2310. Bayesian analysis of co-
primary endpoints (PASI 75 and IGA 0/1) at Week 12 demonstrated superiority over historical placebo 
for both secukinumab High dose and Low dose groups, and very high response rates with rapid onset of 
activity were observed in both treatment groups. Furthermore, similar to A2310, there was no difference 
between the dose levels. Results on the CDLQI indicated a favourable effect on subjectively experienced 
quality  of  life.  The  study  thus  complements  the  results  of  A2310  and  can  be  considered  to  provide 
evidence supportive of short-term efficacy of secukinumab in paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
psoriasis. 
The  Week  24  data,  provided  in  response  to  the  2nd  Request  for  Supplementary  Information,  support 
maintenance of effect and the claim for a long-term indication. Whereas an interim analysis of Week 52 
data has been pre-specified in the study protocol and is also part of the agreed PIP, an analysis of Week 
24 data is not specifically mentioned in the protocol. The MAH should replace the Week 24 data in the 
Section 5.1 SmPC with Week 52 data when they become available. 
In subgroup analyses based on age and weight strata as well as baseline disease severity, high response 
rates were generally observed for both dose levels. Similar to study A2310, the number of patients in 
the lowest weight stratum (< 25 kg) is very small (total N=8), and conclusions regarding the younger 
age stratum are also limited by the small sample size (total N=33). 
Nevertheless, consistent with study A2310 and the main analyses, there was generally little difference 
between  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  in  response  rates  when  assessed  by  the  different  subgroups. 
Furthermore, in the analysis by weight strata, it is noted that similar to A2310, efficacy in the 25-<50 
kg stratum in fact appears to be higher in the Low dose group than the High dose group supporting again 
the  removal  of  the  initially  proposed  posology  recommendation  to  allow  dose  doubling  in  this  weight 
stratum. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Secukinumab is being studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and etanercept -controlled study 
in paediatric patients with severe psoriasis. In an interim analysis, the study met its co-primary and 
key secondary endpoints and demonstrated responses rates exceeding those observed with an 
appropriate active comparator. The CHMP concluded that short-term efficacy of secukinumab in the 
studied population has been demonstrated. Maintenance of effect until Week 52 was also shown, 
supporting a long-term indication. 
Data until Week 24 from study A2311, which is an open-label study in paediatric patients with 
moderate to severe psoriasis, corroborates findings from the placebo-controlled study. 
Results up to Week 24 in study A2311 were consistent with study A2310 and support efficacy in patients 
with disease of moderate severity. 
Although  the  limited  dataset  in  patients  under  25  kg  in  body  weight  is  recognised,  together,  studies 
A2310 and A2311 provide efficacy and safety data from 58 patients <12 years receiving at least a single 
dose  of  secukinumab,  and  16  patients  <25  kg  receiving  at  least  a  single  dose  of  secukinumab.  Total 
exposure to secukinumab was reported as 35.02 patient-years in patients <12 years and 13.2 patient-
years in patients weighing <25 kg. The CHMP considered that sufficient data was available for patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 82/131 
 
 
 
under 25 kg in body weight and that no weight restriction below 25 kg was deemed necessary in the 
indication. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the efficacy was adequately described in the claimed indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The presented paediatric safety data set presented in this dossier is comprised of patients enrolled in 
Studies  A2310  and  A2311.  These  were  male  and  female,  6  to  <  18  years  (at  the  start  of  study 
treatment), with moderate (Study A2311) or severe (Study A2310 and Study A2311) plaque psoriasis, 
a history of plaque psoriasis for at least 3 months and psoriasis that was poorly controlled by topical 
treatments  and/or  phototherapy  and/or  previous  systemic  therapy.  These  paediatric  patients  were 
candidates for systemic therapy. The lower age of enrolment was limited to 6 years since, according to 
the MAH, the prevalence of psoriasis in children under 6 years is very low (with the highest prevalence 
published  of  0.3%),  and  the  proportion  of  children  with  a  severe  condition  in  need  of  a  systemic 
treatment is 4%, giving a final prevalence of the condition to be about 1 per 10,000 in this age group. 
Severe psoriasis criteria were agreed with PDCO during the psoriasis PIP discussions and subsequently 
moderate psoriasis criteria were defined. These severity definitions are used in both ongoing paediatric 
studies for psoriasis and in the adult data comparison. The disease severity classification is outlined in 
Table below.

The adult safety dataset used for comparison with Studies A2310 and A2311 paediatric data was based 
on  the  4  pivotal  studies  (see  Table  below)  that  were  previously  used  to  demonstrate  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  secukinumab  150  mg  or  300  mg  administered  s.c.  in  the  adult  patients:  Studies 
CAIN457A2302, CAIN457A2303, CAIN457A2308 and CAIN457A2309 (first 12 week placebo controlled 
data and up to Week 52 for all studies; referred hereafter as Studies A2302, A2303, A2308 and A2309 
in this AR). These were male and female adults (≥ 18 years) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 
and a history of plaque psoriasis for at least 3 months before randomisation that was poorly controlled 
by topical treatments and/or phototherapy and/or previous systemic therapy. These adult patients were 
candidates for systemic therapy.

Safety  considerations  arisen  from  prior  experience  with  secukinumab  are  addressed  in  the  currently 
approved  RMP.  Identified  risks  include  infections  and  infestations,  neutropenia  and  hypersensitivity. 
Potential risks include malignant or unspecified tumours, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 
immunogenicity, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B reactivation, suicidal ideation and behaviour, 
and interactions with live vaccines. 
Study A2310 was designed to enrol 160 paediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years with severe plaque 
psoriasis. The recruitment started in September 2015 and was completed in September 2018 with 162 
patients enrolled globally. The study is ongoing.   
This study consists of 5 epochs: 
•  Screening: up to 4 weeks to assess eligibility and to taper patients off prohibited medications. 
• 
Induction period: up to Week 12, both active and placebo-controlled and at its completion the 
primary endpoint was assessed. 
•  Maintenance period: of 40 weeks (after Week 12 up to Week 52), it was active-controlled and 
the objectives focused on the maintenance of the response observed at Week 12 
• 
• 
Extension period: open-label (only after the Week 52 data base lock) of 184 weeks, all treated 
with secukinumab, and the purpose was the collection of long-term safety and efficacy data. 
Post-treatment follow-up of 16 weeks. 
Patients were randomised using a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: secukinumab Low dose, 
secukinumab  High  dose,  etanercept  or  placebo.  Patients  randomised  to  secukinumab treatment  arms 
(Low dose and High dose) received a dose based on the weight category (< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, ≥ 50 
kg). Patients in the two secukinumab arms weighing < 25 kg received 75 mg secukinumab in both low 
and High dose groups, 25 to < 50 kg received 75 mg (Low dose group) and 150 mg (High dose group) 
and ≥ 50 kg received 150 mg (Low dose group) and 300 mg (High dose group). 
The following analysis periods were used for safety assessment of paediatric Study A2310: 
• 
Induction period: Day 1 through Week 12 visit and included patients who completed the Week 
12  visit  or  discontinued  the  study  treatment  before  Week  12  and  completed  the  treatment 
discontinuation visit; 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 84/131 
 
 
 
 
•  Up to Week 24: Day 1 through Week 24 visit; and included all patients completing the Week 24 
visit as of the cut-off date or who discontinued the study treatment before the Week 24 visit and 
completed the treatment discontinuation visit. 
•  Up to Week 52: Day 1 through Week 52 visit; and included patients who completed the Week 
52 as of the cut-off date 18 Sep 2019 or who discontinued the study treatment before the Week 
52 visit and completed the treatment discontinuation visit. 
• 
Entire treatment period: included all safety data up to the cut-off date of 18 Sep 2019. For adult 
studies (A2302, A2303, A2308 and A2309), data from the Induction period and up to Week 52 
were considered for safety analysis. 
The following treatment groups were used and compared side-by-side where appropriate: 
For the paediatric Study A2310: 
• 
Induction period (up to Week 12): secukinumab Low dose (< 25 kg – 75 mg; 25 to <50 kg – 
75 mg; ≥ 50 kg – 150 mg), secukinumab High dose (< 25 kg – 75 mg; 25 to <50 kg – 150 mg; 
≥ 50 kg – 300 mg), Any secukinumab, placebo and etanercept. 
•  Up to Week 52: Any secukinumab Low dose, Any secukinumab High dose, Any secukinumab and 
etanercept. 
For the adult studies pool: 
• 
Induction  period  (up  to  Week  12):  Secukinumab  150  mg,  secukinumab  300  mg,  Any 
secukinumab, placebo and etanercept; 
•  Up to Week 52: Any secukinumab 150 mg, Any secukinumab 300 mg, Any secukinumab and 
etanercept. 
The MAH has supplemented an interim report from Study A2311 up until 24 weeks of study treatments. 
This study consisted only one analysis period up to week 16. 
Patients weighing < 25 kg received 75 mg (both Low and High dose groups), patients weighing 25 kg to 
< 50 kg received 75 mg (Low dose group) or 150 mg (High dose group), and patients weighing ≥ 50 kg 
received 150 mg (Low dose group) or 300 mg (High dose group). Patients received one s.c. injection at 
each drug administration of either secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg Pre-filled Syringe (PFS) according to 
their treatment group. Only the patients in the ≥ 50 kg High dose treatment groups received two s.c. 
injections of 150 mg secukinumab PFS at each administration. 
Forty-two  (42)  patients  were  randomised  both  to  the  low  dose  group  and  the  high  dose  group.  Two 
patients discontinued the study until week 16, one for adverse event and another for lack of efficacy. 
Patient exposure 
The mean age of the patients was approximately 13.5 years in the paediatric group in Study 2310 and 
45 years  in  the  adult  population.  Majority  of  the  patients  in  both  populations  were  Caucasian.  In  the 
paediatric  population,  approximately  60%  of  the  patients  were  females,  whereas  in  the  adult  pool, 
majority  were  males  (approx.  70%).  Mean  body  weight  of  patients  in  the  paediatric  population  was 
approx. 53 kg, and the mean body weight in the adult population was 86 kg. 
For Study 2310, characteristics were typical of a population with severe disease; for the adult pool, the 
characteristics were representative of patients with moderate or severe psoriasis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 85/131 
 
 
 
In Study 2311, the mean age was 12.5 years (17 + 16 patients from 6 to 12 years in low + high dose 
groups, and 25 + 26 from 12 to 18 years in low + high dose groups). The mean weight was 54.34 kg in 
the low dose group and 55.73 kg in the high dose group. By the weight strata, there were 4 + 4 patients 
in the <25 kg group, 13 + 12 patients in the 25- <50 kg group, and 25 + 26 patients in the ≥ 50 kg 
group. 
On  the  basis  of  baseline  IGA  mod  2011  score,  58/84  patients  (69.0%)  in  Study  2311  had  moderate 
disease (IGA=3) and 26/84 patients (31.0%) had severe disease (IGA=4). 
Study A 2310 
Induction period (up to week 12) 
A  total  of  162  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  Low  or  High  doses  of  secukinumab,  placebo  or 
etanercept with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1:1. Of these, 6 patients (3.7%) discontinued study treatment 
during the Induction Period (up to Week 12) with 2 patients discontinuing due to Adverse Events (AEs) 
1 each from the High dose and the placebo group), see Table below.

At the end of the Induction period, PASI75 non-responder placebo patients (n=34) were re-randomised 
to receive either Low or High doses of secukinumab. Six patients from the placebo group were PASI75 
responders at Week 12 and thus completed the study. One of these 6 patients continued in the study in 
error up to Week 16 due to wrong responder status recorded by the study site. 
Maintenance period (weeks 13 to 52)

Extension period (weeks 52 to 236) 
Overall, of the 114 patients who received secukinumab at initial randomization visit or switched from 
placebo  to  secukinumab  at  Week  12,  106  patients  (93.0%)  entered  the  Extension  period  (Any 
secukinumab  low  dose  group:  53  patients  and  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group:  53  patients).  95 
patients were still continuing in the Extension period at the time of cut-off date (18-Sep-2019) for the 
Week  52  analysis.  There  were  more  patients  discontinuing  during  the  Extension  period  in  the  Any 
secukinumab low dose group (7 patients, 12.5%) compared to the Any secukinumab high dose group (4 
patients,  6.9%).  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  lack  of  efficacy;  this  was  more 
frequent in the Any secukinumab low dose group (5 patients, 8.9%) than in the Any secukinumab high 
dose group (2 patients, 3.4%), refer to Table below. 
The  median  duration  of  exposure  was  lower  in  the  <  12  years  stratum  (Any  secukinumab  low  dose: 
365.0 days, Any secukinumab high dose: 364.5 days and etanercept group: 370.0 days) when compared 
to the ≥ 12 years stratum (Any secukinumab low dose group: 895.0 days, Any secukinumab high dose 
group: 896.0 days and etanercept group: 391.0 days).

Study A2311 
All except two patients (both from secukinumab High dose group, see Table below) completed the Week 
16 visit (82/84 patients; 97.6% overall). The reasons for discontinuations were AEs in one patient (ALT 
and AST elevations and lack of efficacy in another.

In Study 2310, the most commonly used concomitant medication was paracetamol, used more frequently 
in the Any secukinumab low dose group (35.7%) than the Any secukinumab high dose group (31.0%). 
In  the  etanercept  group,  paracetamol  was  used  by  24.4%  patients.  The  second  most  common 
concomitant  medication  was  ibuprofen,  used  at  a  comparable  frequency  in  the  Any  secukinumab  low 
dose group (23.2%) and Any secukinumab high dose group (24.1%). In the etanercept group, ibuprofen 
was  used  by  19.5%  patients.  Other  most  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  (>10%  in  Any 
secukinumab  dose  group)  were  amoxicillin  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.  The  use  of  amoxicillin  was 
similar in the Any secukinumab low dose group and the Any secukinumab high dose group (12.5% vs 
13.8%). 
Adverse events 
Adverse  events  were  evaluated  by  primary  system  organ  class  (SOC)  and  preferred  term  (PT),  and 
according to severity of AEs (mild, moderate and severe) and Investigator’s assessment of the possible 
relationship to study drug. They were classified as common AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) including 
deaths, and AEs causing permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 
Adverse  events  are  presented  as  absolute  and  relative  frequencies  (i.e.,  absolute  incidence)  for  the 
treatment periods. The comparison of absolute incidence rates vs. placebo is limited only to the Induction 
period of Study A2310. Side-by-side comparison of paediatric data (Study A2310) to adult pooled data 
is presented for the Induction period and Up to Week 52. 
In addition, AEs are also expressed as incidence rate per 100 patient years (PY) of exposure (calculated 
as the number of AEs divided by the PY in the treatment group × 100). Exposure Adjusted Incidence 
Rate  (EAIR)  was  calculated  for  the  long-term  safety  summary  to  adjust  for  patient  exposure.  The  PY 
denominator was the sum of total exposure on study drug in patients with no event and the time to first 
event  divided  by  365.25.  Given  the  much  shorter  duration  of  placebo  exposure,  since  patients  were

switched to secukinumab treatment groups after Week 12, the EAIR allows for comparison of AEs over 
the longer term. 
All safety analyses were based on the Safety set. The safety set includes all patients who took at least 
one dose of study drug during the treatment period. Patients were analysed according to the treatment 
received.  If  a  patient  received  the  wrong  treatment  during  the  Entire  study  period,  the  treatment 
received  was  set  to  this  wrong  treatment.  If  a  patient  received  intermittent  wrong  treatment,  the 
treatment received was set to the original randomised treatment. 
To assess the consistency of the safety profile of secukinumab and to evaluate the effect of secukinumab 
in  younger  and/or  lighter  body  weight  patients,  below  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  in  the 
paediatric  patients  (Study  A2310)  for  selected  study  periods.  Crude  incidence  of  treatment  emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) for these subgroups of interest for selected study periods are presented in this section: 
•  Age at randomisation (< 12 years and ≥ 12 years) 
•  Body weight < 25 kg at randomisation 
•  Body weight and secukinumab dose group stratum 
•  Secukinumab exposure percentile stratum at Week 4 
In Study A2310, an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) error, which occurred early in the study, led 
to additional dosing of some patients in the ≥ 12 age group. The dosing error happened after the primary 
endpoint  (Week  12)  assessment.  Specifically,  36  patients  who  were  assigned  to  the  Low  dose  (16 
patients) and High dose (20 patients) secukinumab groups were dispensed active medication at Week 
13, 14, 15 visits. At these visits, the patients who were randomised to active treatment groups were 
expected  to  receive  placebo  medication  to  maintain  the  blind.  Five  patients  in  the  secukinumab  High 
dose group (25-<50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 150 mg at these visits; 16 
patients in the secukinumab Low dose group (≥50 kg/150 mg dose) were dispensed in error secukinumab 
300 mg at these visits; and 15 patients in the secukinumab High dose group (≥50 kg/300 mg dose) were 
dispensed in error secukinumab 300 mg at these visits. 
The  incident  was  communicated  to  Investigators  and  Health  Authorities,  was  presented  to  internal 
Novartis boards and a corrective action plan was put in place by the IRT vendor. The unblinded DMC 
Board also reviewed data from the affected patients and expressed no safety concerns. The dosing error 
was taken into account in additional efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic reports, and its impact on the 
results was assessed and documented appropriately in the study report. 
Induction period 
Study A2310 
During  the  active  and  placebo-controlled  Induction  period,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar 
between the active treatment groups (57.5% and 62.5% in the low and high dose secukinumab groups, 
respectively and 61% in the etanercept group). The incidence of AEs was slightly lower in the placebo 
group (53.7%) compared to the active treatment groups. Refer to Tables 48 and 49.

Age 
The number of patients < 12 years was low (N=37) compared to the ≥ 12 years stratum (N=125) and 
therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. 
The overall incidence of AEs in secukinumab treated patients aged < 12 years was lower compared to 
≥ 12 years  (35.3%  vs.  66.7%  in  Any  secukinumab  group)  and  the  placebo  group  but  not  for  the 
etanercept group. The incidence of AEs in <12 years and ≥ 12 years, respectively, was: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
secukinumab Low dose: 2 (25%) patients and 21 (65.6%) patients, 
secukinumab High dose: 4 (44.4%) and 21 patients (67.7%), 
placebo: 4 (40%) patients and 18 (58.1%) patients, and 
etanercept: 7 (70%) and 18 (58.1%) patients. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  infestations  in  patients  treated  with 
secukinumab  was  lower  in  patients  <  12  years  compared  to  the  older  patients  (≥  12  years)  and  was 
comparable to patients treated with etanercept and placebo within the same age group (< 12 years). 
The incidence of the most commonly reported AE of nasopharyngitis was (in patient < 12 years and ≥ 
12 years, respectively): 0 and 7 (21.9%) in the secukinumab Low dose group, 1 (11.1%) and 5 (16.1%) 
in the secukinumab High dose group, 1 (10%) and 0 in the placebo group and 1 (10%) and 3 (9.7%) in 
the etanercept group. 
Weight 
In both secukinumab low and High dose groups, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher in the ≥ 50 kg 
weight stratum compared to the other two strata within same dose group. Similar trend was observed 
for the most commonly reported SOC of Infections and infestations. Thus patients ≥ 50 kg had higher 
incidence  of  AEs  irrespective  of  the  dose  administered  (low  secukinumab  or  high  secukinumab  dose) 
compared to paediatric patients from other weight groups in same dose level (secukinumab Low or High 
dose). Within the stratum of patients ≥ 50 kg, the High dose group patients had higher incidence of AEs 
during  the  Induction  period  but  infections  were  comparable  in  incidence.  In  the  5  paediatric  patients 
< 25 kg  treated  with  secukinumab,  there  were  no  different  safety  findings  than  higher  weight  group 
patients. 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  AEs  was  lower  in  secukinumab  treated patients  < 25 kg 
compared to heavier patients. In the secukinumab treated patients ≥ 50 kg the incidence rates of overall 
treatment emergent were comparable to placebo. 
The incidence of the most commonly reported AE of nasopharyngitis was: 
• 
• 
secukinumab Low dose group: none in the 75 mg and < 25 kg strata, 2 (11.8%) patients in the 
75 mg and ≥ 25 - < 50 kg strata, ; and 5 (23.8%) patients in the 150 mg and ≥ 50 kg strata. 
secukinumab High dose group: 1 (33.3%) in the 75 mg and < 25 kg strata; 1 (6.7%) patients 
in the 150 mg and ≥ 25 - < 50 kg strata; and 4 (19%) patients in the 300 mg and ≥50 kg strata. 
The incidence of another commonly reported AE of headache was: 
Assessment report

Page 91/131 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
secukinumab Low dose group: none in the 75 mg and < 25 kg strata, 1 (5.9%) patients in the 
75 mg and ≥ 25 - < 50 kg strata; and 1 (4.8%) patients in the 150 mg and ≥ 50 kg strata. 
secukinumab High dose group: none in the 75 mg and < 25 kg strata; 1 (6.7%) patients in the 
150 mg and ≥ 25 - < 50 kg strata; and 2 (9.5%) patients in the 300 mg and ≥ 50 kg strata. 
Secukinumab exposure 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  in  the  higher  quartile  (≥  75th  percentile)  of  secukinumab 
exposure as defined by trough concentration at all time points (63.2% up to Week 4, 68.4% up to Week 
8 and 73.7% up to Week 12) compared to other percentile categories. This was also true for the most 
frequently occurring SOCs, Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders. By Week 12 when 
more events have occurred, these differences are less apparent, see Table 50. 
The incidence of most commonly reported AEs were generally low and similar across the secukinumab 
exposure percentile at all time points (up to Week 4, up to Week 8 and up to Week 12). The number of 
patients  in  each  the  exposure  categories  are  small  and  therefore  these  results  should  be  interpreted 
carefully.

Study A2311 
Overall, 57.1% (48/84) of subjects had AEs. The incidence of TEAEs was same in secukinumab Low dose 
and High dose (24/42 subjects in each; 57.1%) groups, see Table 51. 
The most commonly affected SOCs (> 10% in any secukinumab dose group) were the infections and 
infestations  (33/84  subjects;  39.3%  overall)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/84  subjects;  14.3% 
overall). A single event from either of these SOCs was serious (AE of infectious mononucleosis in one 
subject  from  Low  dose  group  (150  mg)),  a  single  event  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  (AE  of 
hemorrhagic diarrhea in one subject from High dose group (300 mg)), and two AEs led to study drug 
interruptions (influenza and pharyngotonsillitis in one subject each from Low  dose group (75 mg and 
150 mg respectively).

The incidences of AEs were similar in secukinumab Low dose and High dose groups under infections and 
infestations (Low dose group: 15/42 subjects; 35.7%; High dose group: 18/42 subjects; 42.9%) whilst 
incidence of AEs under gastrointestinal disorders were higher in secukinumab High dose compared to 
Low dose group (High dose group: 8/42 subjects; 19.0%; Low dose group: 4/42 subjects; 9.5%).

(Safety set) 
Treatment emergent adverse events by primary system organ class – Up to Week 24 
The most commonly reported AE was nasopharyngitis in both Low dose (6/42 subjects; 14.3%) and High 
dose (4/42 subjects; 9.5%) groups (Table 12-4). The event of upper respiratory tract infection (3/42 
subjects; 7.1%) was reported only in the High dose group. 
The  AEs  of  pyrexia  (3/42  subjects;  7.1%),  atrioventricular  block  first  degree  (2/42  subjects;  4.8%), 
folliculitis (2/42 subjects; 4.8%), gastroenteritis (2/42 subjects; 4.8%), influenza (2/42 subjects; 4.8%), 
and otitis media (2/42 subjects; 4.8%) were reported only in the secukinumab Low dose group. 
The  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (3/42  subjects;  7.1%),  diarrhea  (3/42  subjects;  7.1%),  upper 
abdominal pain (2/42 subjects; 4.8%), hordeolum (2/42 subjects; 4.8%), rhinitis (2/42 subjects; 4.8%) 
and viral respiratory tract infections (2/42 subjects; 4.8%) were reported only in the secukinumab High 
dose group. 
Leukopenia was reported as AE in 3 subjects, and neutropenia was reported as AE in 3 subjects.

Weight 
A total of 8 subjects (Low dose 75 mg: 4 subjects; High dose 75 mg: 4 subjects) were enrolled in the 
weight group of <25 kg. TEAEs were reported in 6 out of the 8 evaluable subjects (secukinumab low 
dose  +  secukinumab  high  dose).  The  commonly  affected  SOCs  in  any  secukinumab  treatment  group 
were: 
1. 
infections  and  infestations  (3/8  subjects,  37.5%;  AEs:  folliculitis,  nasopharyngitis,  upper 
respiratory tract infection and viral upper respiratory tract infection) 
2.  blood and lymphatic system disorders (2/8 subjects, 25.0%; AE: leukopenia) 
3.  cardiac  disorders  (2/8  subjects;  25.0%,  AEs:  first  degree  atrioventricular  block  and 
intraventricular conduction defect in one subject each). 
All the AEs were mild in severity (except leukopenia of grade 2 which was moderate in severity in patient

of the events were serious, none led to study drug interruption or discontinuation of study drug 
A total of 25 subjects (Low dose: 13 subjects; High dose: 12 subjects) were enrolled in the age group 
of 25-<50 kg of which 8/13 (61.5%) subjects from Low dose and 7/12 (58.3%) subjects from High 
dose group had TEAEs. The most commonly affected SOC in any secukinumab treatment group were 
infections  and  infestations  (9/25  subjects;  36.0%,  AEs:  conjunctivitis,  enterobiosis,  gastroenteritis, 
gastroenteritis  viral,  influenza,  nasopharyngitis,  otitis  media,  pharyngitis,  tonsillitis,  upper  respiratory 
tract infection, and viral upper respiratory tract infection). None of the events were serious, none led to

discontinuation of study drug, and none led to study drug interruption (except for an AE of mild influenza 
in one subject from Low dose group. 
A  total  of  51  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  age  group  of  ≥50  kg  and  TEAEs  were  reported  in  14/25 
(56.0%)  subjects  from  Low  dose  and  13/26  (50.0%)  subjects  from  High  dose  groups.  The  most 
commonly affected SOC in Any secukinumab treatment group for this weight group were the infections 
and infestations (21/51 subjects; 41.2%), and the most common AE was nasopharyngitis (8/51 subjects; 
15.7%) with similar incidence in both Low dose (4/25 subjects; 16.0%) and High dose (4/26 subjects; 
15.4%)  groups.  None  of  these  events  of  nasopharyngitis  were  serious,  and  none  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation/ interruptions. 
Disease severity: 
The  frequency  of  TEAEs  in  any  secukinumab  dose  group  were  comparable  in  both  moderate  (35/61; 
57.4%  subjects)  and  severe  disease  severity  subjects  (13/23  subjects;  56.5%).  The  most  commonly 
affected SOC was infections and infestations in both moderate (26/61 subjects; 42.6%) and severe (7/23 
subjects; 30.4%) subjects. 
None of these events were serious (except for an event of mild infectious mononucleosis in A2311 for 
one patient from Low dose (150 mg) group with moderate disease), none led to discontinuation of study 
drug, and none led to study drug interruption (except for an AE of mild influenza in one subject from 
Low dose group. 
Age: 
The  frequency  of  TEAEs  in  any  secukinumab  dose  group  were  comparable  between  6-<12  years  age 
(20/33, 60.6%) and 12-<18 years age (28/51 subjects; 54.9%) group. The most commonly affected 
SOC was infections and infestations with similar incidence in both 6-< 12 years (13/33 subjects; 39.4%) 
and 12 - <18 years (20/51 subjects; 39.2%) age groups. 
Comparison  with  adult  patients:  During  the  Induction  period,  treatment  emergent  AEs  in  paediatric 
patients treated with secukinumab were comparable to that of adults with moderate psoriasis and were 
slightly higher compared to the adults with severe psoriasis. As expected, the AEs related to Infections 
and  infestations  SOC  occurred  at  a  slightly  higher  frequency  in  the  paediatric  population  with  severe 
psoriasis (35%) compared to the adult population with severe psoriasis (26.9%). Other SOCs that were 
affected  more  frequently  in  the  paediatric  population  compared  to  the  adults  were  Gastrointestinal 
disorders and General disorders and administration site conditions, see Tables 53 and 54.

Up to Week 24 
Consistent with the Induction period, Infections and infestations was the most commonly affected SOC 
overall. The incidence of AEs in this SOC was slightly higher in the Any secukinumab Low dose group 
(51.8%) compared to the Any secukinumab High dose group (46.6%) and the etanercept group (48.8%). 
The higher incidence of AEs in this SOC was mainly driven by PTs of nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis. 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  ( ≥   10%  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group)  up  to  Week  24  were 
nasopharyngitis  and  headache.  The  incidence  of  nasopharyngitis  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Any 
secukinumab high dose group (22.4%) compared to the Any Low dose group (17.9%) and the etanercept 
group  (17.1%).  The  incidence  of  headache  was  similar  between  the  Any  secukinumab  Low  dose  and 
High dose group (12.5% and 10.3%, respectively) and was lower in the etanercept group (2.4%). 
Up to Week 52 
Up to Week 52, patients in the Any secukinumab low dose (45 patients, 80.4%) and Any secukinumab 
high dose groups (47 patients, 81.0%) had AEs, which was similar to the number of patients with AEs 
in  the  etanercept  group  (34  patients,  82.9%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  was  also  similar  between  the 
secukinumab low and high dose groups (34 patients, 85.0% each). 
Overall, the most commonly affected SOC was Infections and infestations. The incidence of AEs in this 
SOC  was  numerically  higher  in  the  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  (69.6%)  compared  to  the  Any 
secukinumab high dose group (62.1%) and the etanercept group (65.9%). The higher incidence of AEs 
in this SOC was mainly driven by non-serious nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis and upper respiratory 
tract infections (Table 55)

The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  headache  and  pharyngitis  (Table  56).  The 
incidence of nasopharyngitis was higher in the Any secukinumab high dose group (34.5%) compared to 
the  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  (25.0%)  and  the  etanercept  group  (26.8%).  The  incidence  of 
headache was similar between the Any secukinumab high dose group (15.5%), Any secukinumab low 
dose group (14.3%), and the etanercept group (9.8%). The incidence of pharyngitis was similar in the

Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  (10.7%),  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  (10.3%)  and  the 
etanercept group (7.3%). 
The  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  had  a  higher  incidence  (>5%  difference)  for  eczema, 
dysmenorrhea and vomiting compared to the Any secukinumab low dose group. The incidence of upper 
respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, eosinophilia, nasal congestion and sinusitis was higher (>5% 
difference) in the Any secukinumab low dose group compared to the Any secukinumab high dose group. 
The incidence of oral herpes was lower in Any secukinumab high and Any secukinumab low dose group 
(1.7% and 1.8%, respectively) compared to the etanercept group (9.8%). All other AEs had comparable 
incidence in both secukinumab dose groups. 
Entire treatment period 
The overall exposure in the etanercept group was considerably lower than secukinumab groups for the 
Entire treatment period, hence for comparison purposes safety data are expressed as exposure adjusted 
incidence  rate  (EAIR)  per  100  patient  years  of  exposure.  Overall,  the  incidence  rate  of  treatment 
emergent AEs was lower in the Any secukinumab dose group compared to the etanercept group (Table 
57). The EAIRs of the most commonly affected SOC ‘infections and infestation’ was higher in the Any 
secukinumab  low  dose  group  (112.3)  than  in  the  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  (85.7)  but  was 
similar to the etanercept group (118.5). This SOC consisted mainly of nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, and 
tonsillitis  related  AEs.  The  SOC  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’  had  similar  EAIRs  in  the 
secukinumab  treatment  groups  (24.2  in  Any  low  dose  and  23.2  in  Any  high  dose)  which  was  lower 
compared  to  the  etanercept  group  (33.2).  Similarly,  the  EAIRs  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  were 
comparable between the Any secukinumab low dose group (21.2) and the Any secukinumab high dose 
group (26.1) which were lower compared to etanercept group (45.2, Table 57). 
The  most  common  AEs  during  the  entire  treatment  period  were  nasopharyngitis,  headache  and 
pharyngitis (Table 57). The EAIRs of tonsillitis, diarrhea, and rhinitis were higher in the Any secukinumab 
dose groups compared to the etanercept group, while the EAIRs of abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper 
and oral herpes were higher in the etanercept group. The EAIRs of upper respiratory tract infection and 
psoriasis  were  similar  between  the  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  and  etanercept  group  and 
comparatively lower in the Any secukinumab high dose group. 
The EAIRs (per 100 patient years) of AEs in patients aged < 12 years compared to ≥ 12 years were: 
165.6 vs. 197.2 in the Any secukinumab low dose group, 177.7 vs. 176.6 in the Any secukinumab high 
dose group and 211.5 vs. 267.2 in the etanercept group. However, since the number of patients in the 
< 12 years age stratum was low (N=35) these incidence rates should be interpreted with caution. 
In patients aged ≥ 12 years, the EAIRs of AEs were similar to that in the overall population. 
No particular trend was observed in EAIRs when analysed in body weight strata between the treatment 
groups. 
In < 25 kg stratum the incidence rate was higher in the secukinumab treatment group (Any low dose: 
142.9 and Any high dose: 161.4) when compared to the etanercept group (92.4). However, since the 
number of patients in the 25 kg age stratum was low (N=12), these incidence rates should be interpreted 
with caution. 
‘≥  25  kg  and  <  50  kg’ stratum: the  incidence  rate  was  lower  in  the  secukinumab treatment  group 
(Any low dose: 161.6 and Any high dose: 179.2) when compared to the etanercept group (304.9).

The overall incidence of AEs possibly related to the study medication was higher in the Any secukinumab 
high  dose  group  (24  patients,  41.4%)  compared  to  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  (16  patients, 
28.6%) and etanercept group (14 patients, 34.1%). 
The frequency of most commonly affected SOC Infections and infestations and AE nasopharyngitis were 
similar to those reported up to Week 52. 
Exposure adjusted incidence rates (per 100 patient-years) of AEs possibly related to the study drug were 
18.9 in Any secukinumab low dose group and 31.8 in Any secukinumab high dose group, which were 
lower than the etanercept group (42.5).

Exposure  adjusted  incidence  rates  of  AEs  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  in  the  most  commonly 
affected SOC Infections and infestations were similar between the secukinumab treatment groups (13.3 
in the Any low dose group and 14 in the Any high dose) and lower compared to the etanercept group 
(18.9); and was mainly driven by AEs of nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. 
Long-term safety, including the safety data until the Week 52, has been compared between the paediatric 
and the adult populations using exposure-adjusted incidence rates. The overall incidence rates of AEs in 
the  paediatric  population  up  to  Week  52  was  294  per  100  PY  in  Any  secukinumab  treated  paediatric 
patients with severe psoriasis which was slightly higher than the adults with severe psoriasis (223.0 per 
100 PY). Consistent with the trends seen in the Induction period there was an increase in incidence rates 
for  infections  with  the  paediatric  population  (147.5  per  100  PY)  compared  to  the  adult  with  severe 
psoriasis (86.1 per 100 PY), mainly driven by nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract 
infection.

There were no deaths in either of the Studies A2310 and A2311. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Study A2310 
Up to week 12 
During the Induction period, 1 patient (2.5%) each in the two secukinumab treatment arms had SAEs 
(alanine aminotransferase increased and toxic shock syndrome) compared to 4 patients (9.8%) in the 
etanercept  arm  (Table  58).  The  increase  in  alanine  aminotransferase  was  transient  and  the  patient 
continued  the  study  treatment;  in  the  case  of  toxic  shock  syndrome,  the  study  treatment  was 
discontinued. The investigators consider none of these SAEs related to study treatment.

Up to week 24 
In addition to the SAEs reported during the Induction period, 3 more patients had SAEs up to Week 24, 
i.e.,  1  patient  each  in  the  secukinumab  Low  dose  group  (bronchitis),  secukinumab  High  dose  group 
(lymphadenopathy)  and  etanercept  group  (abdominal  pain).  The  SAEs  of  bronchitis  and 
lymphadenopathy  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug  did  not  lead  to  study  drug 
discontinuation. Additionally, 1 patient in the placebo-secukinumab Low dose group (reactive arthritis 
and worsening of psoriasis) and 1 patient in the placebo–secukinumab High dose group (pneumonia and 
thrombophlebitis) reported SAEs. The SAE of reactive arthritis was suspected to be related to the study 
drug and led to study drug discontinuation. 
Entire treatment period 
After adjusting for exposure, the incidence rates of non-fatal SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
the  study  drug  were  lower  in  the  Any  secukinumab  dose  group  compared  to  the  etanercept  group 
(Table 59). The EAIRs for non-fatal SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar between the

One SAE (infectious mononucleosis) was reported in one patient  randomized to secukinumab Low dose 
(150 mg). The event started on Day 93 (on 7th day after patient received the 7th dose of study drug). 
The event was mild in severity and was not considered to be related to the study drug. 
One Patient  had Grade 1 ALT elevation (73 U/L, normal range: 5-30 U/L) and Grade 2 AST elevation 
(116 U/L; ULN: 37 U/L) on Day 1 (Randomization/Day 1). At screening as well, the patient had high ALT

(62 U/L) and AST (106 U/L) levels. On Day 2, one day after the first dose of study drug, these ALT and 
AST elevations were recorded as AEs. The events were mild in severity and were not considered to be 
related to study drug. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Study A2310 
Searches for events that represent each of AEs of special interest were made for paediatric Study A2310 
as well as for the adult pool using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms 
(PTs), standardized MedDRA query (SMQ), Novartis MedDRA query (NMQ) or high level term (HLT), as 
listed below.

Infections: Infections and infestations SOC 
•  Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity (SMQ) (narrow) 
•  Neutropenia: Neutropenia (NMQ) (narrow) 
•  Malignant or unspecified tumour: Malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ)

Up to week 12 
During the Induction period, only infections and hypersensitivity related AESI were reported. No events 
related  to  the  AESI  of  neutropenia,  Crohn’s  disease,  MACE  and  malignancy  were  reported  during  the 
Induction period in the paediatric population. 
The incidences of infection related AEs in the secukinumab and etanercept groups were comparable to 
the  placebo  group  (32.5%  in  the  secukinumab  Low  dose,  37.5%  in  the  High  dose,  26.8%  in  the 
etanercept group and 39% in the placebo group). The higher incidence of infection related AEs in the 
paediatric population compared to adults was mainly driven by nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis and upper 
respiratory tract infection. None of the infection related AEs were serious or led to the discontinuation of 
the study drug. 
•  Nasopharyngitis was reported in 7 (17.5%) patients in the Low dose and 6 (15%) patients in the 
High dose group, 1 (2.4%) patient in the placebo group, and 4 (9.8%) patients in the etanercept 
group. 
• 
Pharyngitis was reported in 2 (5%) patients each in the secukinumab Low dose and the High 
dose group, 4 (9.8%) patients in placebo group and none in the etanercept group. 
•  Upper respiratory tract infections were reported in 2 (5%) patients in the secukinumab Low dose 
group, 3 (7.3%) patients in the placebo, 1 (2.4%) patient in the etanercept group and none in 
the secukinumab High dose group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 105/131 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity related AEs were also low and were reported in 3 (7.5%) patients in the secukinumab 
Low dose group, 2 patients each in the secukinumab High dose (5%) and etanercept group (4.9%) and 
1  (2.4%)  patient in the  placebo  group.  All  hypersensitivity  related  events including  eczema,  injection 
site hypersensitivity, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria were reported in 1 patient each. Allergic conjunctivitis 
was the only hypersensitivity related event that occurred in 2 (4.9%) patients in the etanercept group. 
A  total  of  483  serum  samples  from  118  patients  were  analysed  for  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA). 
Treatment-emergent ADAs were detected in only one patient in the secukinumab Low dose at Week 12. 
This was not associated with clinically relevant AEs or loss of efficacy. 
In the < 12 years age stratum, there were no cases of hypersensitivity AEs in the secukinumab treatment 
groups. The incidence of Infections was 3 (17.6%) patients in the Any secukinumab group compared to 
2 (20%) patients in the placebo and 3 (30%) in the etanercept group. In the ≥ 12 years age stratum, 
the  incidence  of  infection  was  25  (39.7%)  patients  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group  compared  to  14 
(45.2%) patients in the placebo and 8 (25.8%) patients in the etanercept group; hypersensitivity was 5 
(7.9%) patients in the Any secukinumab group compared to none in the placebo or etanercept group. 
In  patients  with  body  weight  <  25  kg,  the  only  identified  risk  that  was  reported  was  infection  with  1 
patient each in the Any secukinumab (nasopharyngitis) and the placebo (influenza) groups. 
The incidences of AESI in the paediatric population did not increase compared to the adult population 
during the Induction period with the exception of increased rate of infections in paediatric patients, which 
is expected this patient population. 
Entire treatment period 
The  potential  risk  of  suicide/self-injury  (SMQ)  occurred  in  one  patient  in  the  secukinumab  low  dose 
group. No events related to the risks of hepatitis B reactivation, inflammatory bowel disease, interaction 
with live vaccines, MACE and malignant or unspecified tumours were reported 
The  EAIR  for  AEs  related  to  the  risk  of  infections  and  infestations’(SOC)  was  higher  in  the  Any 
secukinumab  low  dose  group  compared  to  the  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  but  not  higher 
compared  to  etanercept  group.  The  EAIR  for  Hypersensitivity  (SMQ)  (narrow)  was  higher  in  the  Any 
secukinumab high dose group compared to the Any secukinumab low dose group but not compared to 
etanercept group. The EAIR for neutropenia (NMQ) (narrow) was low across treatment groups (Table 
62). 
An additional case of neutropenia was reported in Any secukinumab low dose. This patient was 14-year 
old male with normal neutrophil count at baseline (3.20 x 109/L, NR: 1.54 - 7.04 x 109/L), developed 
Grade 2 neutropenia (1.32 x 109/L) on Day 198 (Week 28 visit) which was fluctuating till Day 303 (Week 
44). On Day 338 (Week 48), the neutrophil count returned to normal (1.67 x 109/L). In the Extension 
period, the patient reported Grade 2 neutropenia (1.17 x 109/L), which was reported as a non-serious 
AE. The patient’s neutrophil count was 1.21 x 109/L (Grade 2) at the time of data cut-off. The event was 
resolved and the event of neutropenia was considered as related to the study drug.

Over the entire treatment period, 13 patients were presented with injection sites reactions as defined 
above. Three were in the secukinumab low dose group, 4 in the secukinumab high dose group, 4 in the 
etanercept group and 2 in the placebo group. All AEs were mild in intensity and required no treatment, 
except in 2 cases: application site erythema in the etanercept group was treated with loratadine (1 day) 
and injection site hematoma in the placebo group. 
The EAIRs of important and potential risks in patients aged < 12 years compared to ≥ 12 years at study 
entry are described below: 
• 
Infections and infestations (SOC): 65.2 vs. 129.0 in any secukinumab low dose group, 118.0 vs.

Study A2311 
The incidence of AEs related to the ‘Infections and infestations’ was seen in 42.9% (18/42 subjects) in 
the secukinumab High dose group and 35.7% (15/42 subjects; 35.7%) in the Low dose group (Table 
63).  The  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  neutropenia  (NMQ)  were  comparable  between  Low  dose  (3/42 
subjects; 7.1%) and High dose (2/42 subjects; 4.8%) groups. 
Upper respiratory tract infections (HLT): The most frequently reported infections were upper respiratory 
tract  infections  [HLT])  in  both  secukinumab  Low  dose  (8/42  subjects,  19.0%)  and  High  dose  (11/42 
subjects, 26.2%) groups. 
The higher incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was mainly driven by the PT nasopharyngitis 
(Low dose group: 6/42 subjects; 14.3% and High dose group: 4/42 subjects; 9.5%) which was mild in 
severity in all subjects except in one subject  from  High dose group who experienced a severe AE of 
nasopharyngitis. The event resolved in 6 days with treatment. The event of nasopharyngitis that was 
reported in 10 subjects overall resolved completely in all while the subjects were still on treatment.

related to the study drug. The study drug was permanently discontinued due to this event. The event 
resolved at Day 177 with treatment. 
One patient randomized to secukinumab High Dose group (300 mg) had short episodes of vulvovaginal 
candidiasis (2 episodes; episode 1: Day 9 to Day 10; episode 2: Day 13 to Day 21), that were considered 
to  be  mild  in  severity  and  related  to  the  study  drug.  Both  the  episodes  resolved  completely  with 
treatment. The events did not lead to interruption or discontinuation of study drug. The patient continued 
treatment and remained on trial at the time of Week 16 data cut-off. 
None of the patients in the study developed treatment emergent ADAs until the Week 24 cut-off. Patient 
randomized to secukinumab High dose (300 mg) group was positive for ADA (Anti-AIN457 antibodies 
(titer): 7.98) at Randomization (Day 1). The patient did not have ADA at Week 16 and 24. 
Laboratory findings 
Study A2310 
Up to week 12 
Haematology:  All  newly  occurring  or  worsening  laboratory  abnormalities  in  haematology  parameters 
during the Induction period were common technical criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or 2. 
The  most  commonly  reported  haematology  abnormalities  during  the  Induction  period  were  Grade  1 
decreased haemoglobin and Grade 1 decreased leukocyte count. Most patients had haematology values 
within normal range at baseline and remained within normal range post-baseline during the Induction 
period. The majority of CTCAE category shifts were from Normal to Grade 1 or Grade 2 or Grade 1 to 
Grade  2.  None  of  the  increase  or  decreases  or  shifts  in  haematological  parameters  were  considered 
clinical significant by the investigator. 
The majority of the population were ≥ 12 years of age and the incidence of newly occurring or worsening 
haematology  parameters  were  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  overall  population.  In  the  patient 
population < 12 years of age, the incidence of haematological abnormalities was low and sporadic. One 
patient weighing < 25 kg each in the Any secukinumab, placebo and etanercept group had neutrophils 
< 1.5-1.0x 10E9/L, haemoglobin < lower limit of normal (LLN) -100 g/L, and neutrophils < LLN - 1.5x 
10E9/L, respectively. 
Newly occurring haematological abnormalities in the paediatric population were not increased compared 
to  the  adult  population  during  the  Induction  period except  for  decreased  haemoglobin  (Grade  1)  and 
decreased leukocytes (Grade 1) which were reported at a slightly higher rates in the paediatric population 
compared to the adult population. 
Biochemistry:  All  newly  occurring  or  worsening  biochemistry  parameters  in  the  paediatric  population 
during the Induction period were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2, except 1 patient in the secukinumab Low dose 
group who had increased aspartate amino transferase (AST) of Grade 3 (had normal AST at baseline). 
The majority of CTCAE category shifts were from Normal to Grade 1 or Grade 2 or Grade 1 to Grade 2. 
One  patient  in  the  etanercept  group  had  Grade  3  increased  gamma  glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)  at 
baseline and post-baseline (not newly occurring or worsening after baseline). 
During  the  Induction  period,  the  incidence  of  liver  enzyme  abnormalities  was  generally  low  and 
comparable between the Any secukinumab dose group, placebo group and etanercept group. No patient 
had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law criteria. Two patients in secukinumab Low dose group and 1 
patient  in  etanercept  group  had  alanine  amino  transferase  (ALT)  or  AST  >  3x  upper  limit  of  normal 
(ULN). One patient in secukinumab Low dose group had ALT or AST > 5x ULN. This patient with ongoing 
Gilbert’s  syndrome  at  baseline  had  an  elevated  level  of  ALT  and  AST  during  the  study.  During  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 109/131 
 
 
 
Induction  period  (Visit  8,  Day  48)  the  AST  level  increased  to  256  U/L  with  ALT  level  at  62  U/L.  The 
patient’s ALT and AST returned to normal levels of 13 U/L and 19 U/L, respectively, on Day 92 (Week 
12 visit). 
Newly occurring chemistry abnormalities in the paediatric population during the Induction period were 
similar compared to the adult population with no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment 
groups or any dose-related trends between the secukinumab treatment groups. 
Up to week 24 
Haematology: All newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in haematology parameters up 
to Week 24 were CTCAE  Grade 1 or 2, except 1 patient in the Any secukinumab Low dose (150 mg) 
group with Grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count. This patient had normal neutrophil count at baseline, 
which decreased on Day 57 (Week 8 visit) and further worsened to Grade 3 on Day 141 (Week 20 visit). 
From Day 127 to Day 134, the patient presented with a non-serious AE of viral upper respiratory tract 
infection. Neutrophil count returned to normal on Day 225 (Week 32 visit) and the event of neutropenia 
was considered as resolved (without any treatment). The event of neutropenia was considered related 
to the study drug; however, no action was taken with the study treatment. 
Biochemistry: The majority of newly occurring or worsening abnormalities in biochemistry parameters 
up to Week 24 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. In addition to 1 patient with Grade 3 increase in AST in the 
Induction period (discussed above), 1 patient each in the secukinumab High dose and etanercept group 
had Grade 3 AST increase up to Week 24. One patient each had Grade 3 increase in ALT and ALP in the 
etanercept group up to Week 24. 
No patient had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law criteria up to Week 24. One in the etanercept group 
had ALT or AST > 10x ULN. One patient each in secukinumab Low dose group and etanercept group had 
ALT or AST > 5x ULN. Two patients in secukinumab Low dose group and one patient in etanercept group 
had ALT or AST > 3x ULN. One patient in the secukinumab Low dose group had ALT or AST > 3x ULN 
and total bilirubin (TBL) > 1.5x ULN. One patient in the etanercept group had alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
> 5x ULN. 
Up to week 52 
Haematology: All newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in haematology parameters up 
to Week 52 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2, except for 2 patients in the secukinumab low dose group and in 
the  etanercept  group)  with  Grade  3  decrease  in  neutrophil  count  and  two  patients  in  the  etanercept 
group with Grade 4 decreased platelet count. 
The most commonly reported haematology abnormality up to Week 52 was Grade 1 decreased leukocyte 
count  and  Grade  1  decreased  haemoglobin  count.  Grade  1  decreased leukocyte  count  occurred  more 
frequently in the Any secukinumab low dose group (13 patients, 24.1%) than the Any secukinumab high 
dose group (9 patients, 16.4%) and etanercept group (8 patients, 20.5%). 
Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient each in the Any secukinumab low dose and etanercept group 
(1.8% in Any secukinumab low dose group and 2.4% in etanercept group). Grade 2 neutropenia was 
similar between Any secukinumab low dose group (7 patients, 12.7%) and etanercept group (5 patients, 
12.2%)  and  high  compared  to  the  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  (5  patients,  9.1%).  Grade  1 
neutropenia  was  high  in  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group  (9  patients,  16.7%)  compared  to  Any 
secukinumab high dose group (5 patients, 9.1%) and etanercept group (4 patients, 9.8%). 
Grade 1 decreased lymphocyte count occurred more frequently in the Any secukinumab low dose group 
compared to Any secukinumab high dose group and etanercept group.

There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  newly  occurring  or  worsening  haematology 
abnormalities across the treatment groups up to Week 52. 
Up to Week 52, the majority of CTCAE category shifts were from Normal to Grade 1 or Grade 2 and a 
few were from Grade 1 to Grade 2, consistent with the new or worsening post-baseline abnormalities 
shown  in  Table  12-11.  All  patients  with  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  laboratory  abnormality  in  haematology 
parameters had a shift from Normal at baseline. 
Biochemistry: All newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in chemistry parameters up to 
Week 52 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 (Table 12-13). Grade 3 increased AST and ALT was reported for one 
patient in the etanercept group and one patient each in secukinumab low dose group and in the switchers 
to secukinumab high dose group had Grade 3 increased AST. One patient in the etanercept group had 
Grade 3 increased ALP. 
Grade  2  increased  ALT  was  reported  in  1  patient  (2.6%)  in  secukinumab  low  dose  group.  Grade  2 
increased bilirubin was reported in 4 patients (10.3%) in the secukinumab low dose group and 2 patients 
(4.9%)  in  the  etanercept  group.  Grade  1  increased  ALT  was  the  most  commonly  reported  chemistry 
abnormality up to Week 52. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or 
worsening chemistry abnormalities across the treatment groups up to Week 52. 
Entire treatment period 
Haematology:  The  majority  of  newly  occurring  or  worsening  laboratory  abnormalities  in  haematology 
parameters  during  Entire  treatment  period  were  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2.  One  patient  in  the  Any 
secukinumab high dose had Grade 3 decreased lymphocyte count. Consistent with the observations up 
to Week 52, the most commonly reported haematology abnormality during Entire treatment period was 
Grade 1 decreased leukocyte count. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences between the secukinumab treatment groups in the newly 
occurring or worsening haematology abnormalities during Entire treatment period. 
Most  patients  had  haematology  values  within  normal  range  at  baseline  and  also  post-baseline  during 
Entire treatment period. The majority of CTCAE category shifts during the Entire treatment period were 
from Normal to Grade 1 or Grade 2 and a few were from Grade 1 to Grade 2, consistent with the new or 
worsening post-baseline abnormalities. The single patient with a Grade 3 abnormality mentioned above, 
had a shift from Normal at Baseline. 
Biochemistry:  The  majority  of  newly  occurring  or  worsening  laboratory  abnormalities  in  chemistry 
parameters during Entire treatment period were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. There were no additional Grade 3 
or Grade 4 cases in the Entire treatment period. Consistent with the observations up to Week 52, the 
most commonly reported chemistry abnormality during Entire treatment period was Grade 1 increased 
ALT occurring more frequently in the Any secukinumab high dose group (10 patients, 19.6%) than the 
Any secukinumab low dose group (7 patients, 13.5%). Grade 2 increased bilirubin was reported for 4 
(7.3%) patients in the Any secukinumab low dose group and 2 (4.9%) in the etanercept group. 
Vital signs and ECGs 
The  most  commonly  reported  vital  signs  abnormality  was  high  pulse  rate,  which  was  less  frequently 
reported in the Any secukinumab low dose group compared to Any secukinumab high dose group and 
the etanercept group. 
The differences in the frequency of the vital sign abnormalities between the treatment groups were not 
clinically significant.

The non-serious AEs of increased systolic blood pressure (Day 294), orthostatic hypotension (Day 333) 
and  hypotension  (Day  203)  were  reported  for  single  patient  in  the  secukinumab  low  dose  group, 
secukinumab high dose group and etanercept group, respectively. The events of increased systolic blood 
pressure and orthostatic hypotension resolved on the same day, while the event of hypotension resolved 
after  28  days.  All  events were  considered  as  not  related to  study  drug  and  no  action  was  taken  with 
study drug. 
High  pulse  rate  continued  to  be  the  most  commonly  reported  vital  signs  abnormalities  during  Entire 
treatment period. The frequency of high pulse rate was lower in the Any secukinumab low dose group 
(7 patients,  13.2%)  than  the  Any  secukinumab  high  dose  group  (15  patients,  27.3%);  and  it  was 
(10 patients,  25.6%)  in  the  etanercept  group.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the 
frequency of vital sign abnormalities between the treatment groups. 
A non-serious AE of low diastolic blood pressure was reported for one patient in the secukinumab low 
dose  group.  The  event  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  data  cut  off  for  this  analysis  (18-Sep-2019).  This 
event was considered as not related to study drug and no action was taken with study drug. 
Up  until  52  weeks,  one  patient  (2.6%)  in  the  secukinumab  high  dose  group  had  QTcF  changes  from 
baseline > 450 msec. Three patients (7.7%) in the secukinumab high dose group, 3 patients (7.3%) in 
the etanercept group and one patient in the switcher from placebo to secukinumab high dose group had 
QTcF changes from baseline > 30 msec. One patient (2.4%) in the etanercept group had QTcF changes 
from baseline > 60 msec. These ECG abnormalities were considered not clinically significant. 
One  patient  in  the  secukinumab  low  dose  group  had  a  non-serious  AE  of  intraventricular  conduction 
defect (mild) on Day 85, which was considered as related to study treatment but no action was taken 
with the study drug and event resolved on Day 108. 
During the entire treatment period, one patient (1.8%) in the Any secukinumab high dose group had 
QTcF > 450 msec. Four patients (7%) in the Any secukinumab high dose group and 4 patients (9.8%) 
in  the  etanercept  group  had  QTcF  changes  from  baseline  >  30  msec.  One  patient  (2.4%)  in  the 
etanercept  group  had  QTCF  changes  from  baseline  >  60  msec.  These  ECG  abnormalities  were  not 
clinically significant. 
Study A2311 
Haematology 
Only  grade  1  or 2  haematological  abnormalities  were  reported  in  any  secukinumab  dose  group  up to 
Week 24 with the most commonly reported being grade 1 decreased leukocyte count. There were no 
clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening hematology abnormalities between 
the treatment groups. 
Most subjects in both the treatment groups had haematology values within normal range at baseline and 
also at post-baseline up to Week 24. Of the few CTCAE categoryshifts reported, the most frequent was 
Normal at baseline to grade 1 as the most extreme post baseline in both treatment groups. Two subjects 
had  shift  from  grade  1  to  grade  2  (one  each  from  Low  dose  (Leukopenia)  and  High  dose  group 
(neutropenia) up to Week 24. 
Grade 2 neutropenia were reported in 4 subjects from Low dose and 4 subjects from High dose group. 
Of these 8 subjects, the grade 2 neutropenia in subject with moderate disease, grade 2 neutropenia in 
a subject enrolled in A2311 with severe disease, and grade 1 neutropenia in a subject enrolled in A2311 
with moderate disease were reported as AEs. 
All the subjects with grade 2 neutropenia continued study treatment and remained on trial except for 
subject  a  subject  enrolled  in  A2311  who  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AE  of  haemorrhagic

diarrhoea. In six out of 8 subjects, the ANC values returned to normal by Week 24. For a subject enrolled 
in A2311, the ANC values returned to normal by Week 32 (3.57 10E9/L; normal range: 2.03 to 8.36 
10E9/L) and in subject a subject enrolled in A2311, the grade 2 neutropenia persisted at Week 24. 
Clinical chemistry 
All  newly  occurring  or  worsening  chemistry  abnormalities  are  presented  in  Table  64.  Majority  of  the 
chemistry abnormalities reported in any secukinumab dose group till Week 24 were of grade 1. Grade 1 
ALT elevation was the commonly reported (6/74 subjects; 8.1%) chemistry abnormality up to Week 24 
followed by grade 1 ALP and AST elevations. 
The  ALT  and  AST  elevation  in  one  subject  from  High  dose  group  were  reported  as  AEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Grade 2 TBL elevation was reported in one subject from High dose group. Grade 2 increased eGFR was 
reported for one subject each in Low dose and High dose groups. Grade 2 GGT elevation was reported 
only in the Low dose group (2/42 subjects; 4.8%) (Table 64). 
Most subjects in both the treatment groups had chemistry values within normal range at baseline and 
also at post-baseline up to Week 24. Of the few CTCAE category shifts reported, the most frequent was 
Normal at baseline to grade 1 or grade 2 as the most extreme post baseline in both treatment groups. 
Post-baseline variations in the chemistry parameters were seen in both the treatment groups, with no 
meaningful treatment-specific or dose-related trends.

Vital signs and ECGs 
The  most  commonly  reported  vital  signs  abnormality  up  to  Week  24  was  high  pulse  rate,  which  was 
reported with a slightly higher frequency in secukinumab Low dose (8/42 subjects; 19.0%) compared to 
the  High  dose  (6/42  subjects;  14.3%)  group.  The  second  most  common  vital  signs  abnormality  was 
diastolic  BP  (category:  Low  only)  that  was  noted  with  a  slightly  higher  frequency  in  High  dose  (8/41 
subjects; 19.5%) compared to Low dose (4/42 subjects; 9.5%) group. 
Post-baseline small variations in the vital signs parameters were seen in both the treatment groups, with 
no meaningful treatment-specific or dose related trends and none of them were reported as AEs. 
Safety in special populations 
Three  cases  of  pregnancy  were  observed  in  the  study.  A  17-year  (at  randomisation)  patient  had  an 
ectopic pregnancy, discontinued the study on Day 282, and proceeded to salpingectomy. A 16-year (at 
randomisation) patient discontinued the study on extension period on Day 540, and delivered a healthy 
child with initial jaundice. A 15 year (at randomisation) patient discontinued the study on Day 504 and 
underwent elective termination of the pregnancy.

The  male  and  female  paediatric patients  enrolled in  this  study  did not have  any  notable  effect  of  the 
study treatment on their growth and development and most remained between 5th and 95th percentile 
of weight and height expected for age. 
At  Baseline,  the  majority  of  male  and  female  patients  in  the  Any  secukinumab  low  dose  group,  Any 
secukinumab high dose group and etanercept group were pubertal (Tanner stage ≥ 2), see Figure 18. 
The Any secukinumab high dose group had a higher proportion of pre
pubertal (Tanner stage 1) male 
and female patients at Baseline compared to the Any secukinumab low dose group and the etanercept 
‑
group. 
By  Week  52,  majority  of  the  evaluable  male  and  female  patients  in  all  three  treatment  groups  were 
pubertal (Tanner stage ≥ 2) except for approximately 20% pre-pubertal (Tanner stage 1) patients in the 
Any secukinumab high dose group which was not unexpected given higher percentage of pre-pubertal 
patients in this group at baseline. Except for males in Any secukinumab high dose group, the majority 
of patients had reached Tanner stage 4 or 5. 
By  Week  104,  the  majority  of  evaluable  male  and  female  patients  in  the  Any  secukinumab  low  dose 
group and the Any secukinumab high dose group had reached Tanner stage 5 (full sexual maturation).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information. The concomitant medications used in Study A2310 are discussed above in Section 
“Patient exposure” of this AR. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study A2310 up to Week 52 
The 4 patients reporting AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation up to Week 52 are described 
below: 
•  One Patient in the secukinumab low dose group had behavior disorder, major depression, mental 
disorder and suicidal ideation. Major depression and suicidal ideation were serious and suspected 
to be related to the study drug. 
•  One Patient in the secukinumab high dose group had toxic shock syndrome. 
•  One Patient in the placebo – secukinumab low dose group had arthritis reactive (SAE) suspected 
to be related to the study drug. 
•  One Patient in the etanercept group had hepatic enzyme increased suspected to be related the 
study drug. 
Study A2310 entire treatment period 
Exposure adjusted incidence rates (per 100 patient-years) for treatment emergent AEs leading to study 
treatment  discontinuation  for  the  Entire  treatment  period  were  slightly  lower  in  the  secukinumab 
treatment  groups  (1.8  in  any  low  dose  and  0.8  in  any  high  dose)  compared  to  the  etanercept  group 
(2.4). 
Study A2311 up to week 24 
Two subjects in the high dose secukinumab group discontinued treatment due to AEs, one due to ALT 
and AST elevations and the other due to hemorrhagic diarrhea. Both the AEs resolved and the subjects 
resumed study treatment. 
Post marketing experience 
Secukinumab  is  not  approved  for  use  in the paediatric  population.  Secukinumab  is  approved  in  more 
than 90 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. In addition, secukinumab is being evaluated in other inflammatory 
conditions such as non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and hidradenitis 
suppurativa. As of 25-Dec-2018, a total of 17,942 patients and healthy volunteers received secukinumab 
treatment  in  Novartis  sponsored  investigational  clinical  trials.  As  of  the  same  date,  the  secukinumab 
cumulative patient exposure since the International Birth Date (26-Dec-2014) is over 285,000 PY and 
secukinumab has been evaluated in more than 100 studies. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Introduction 
The presented paediatric safety data set presented in this application is comprised of patients enrolled 
in  Studies  A2310  and  A2311.  These  were  male  and  female,  6  to  <  18  years  (at  the  start  of  study 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 116/131 
 
 
 
treatment), with moderate (Study A2311) or severe (Study A2310 and Study A2311) plaque psoriasis, 
a history of plaque psoriasis for at least 3 months and psoriasis that was poorly controlled by topical 
treatments  and/or  phototherapy  and/or  previous  systemic  therapy.  These  paediatric  patients  were 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The results from Study A2310 were analysed and presented in intervals of induction period with initial 
weekly injections of secukinumab up to week 12, where the safety findings could be compared from all 
groups  receiving  placebo,  low  dose  of  secukinumab,  high  dose  of  secukinumab,  or  etanercept;  up  to 
week 24 until which the patients on placebo were switched to secukinumab with initial weekly injections; 
up to week 52, where treatment with etanercept stops, and the entire study period including also the 
secukinumab patients in the extension phase. 
Further safety information was provided from Study A2311 interim analysis up to week 24. 
In the paediatric population in Study 2310, the mean age was 13.5 years and the mean weight 53 kg. 
There were 17 patients aged 6 to <12 years and 63 patients aged 12 to <18 years receiving initially 
secukinumab. There were only 8 patients weighing less than 25 kg, 32 patients weighing 25 to <50 kg, 
and  43  patients  weighing  over  50  kg  receiving  initially  secukinumab.  All  with  severe  presentation  of 
psoriasis. 
A dosing error involved 36 patients in the low and high dose secukinumab groups, resulting in extra up 
titration doses of active medication instead of placebo on weeks 13, 14, and 15, took place. The effect 
of this error on the safety findings was separately evaluated. 
In the paediatric population in Study 2311, the mean age was 12.5 years and the mean weight 55 kg. 
There were altogether 33 patients aged 6 to <12 years and 51 patients aged 12 to <18 years. There 
were  only  8  patients  weighing  less  than  25  kg,  25  patients  weighing  25  to  <50  kg,  and  51  patients 
weighing over 50 kg. 69% of the patients had moderate psoriasis and 31% severe psoriasis. 
Adherence  to  the  study  protocol  and  treatments  was  good  as  evidenced  by  low  number  of  drop-outs 
from both of the studies. In Study A2310 93% of the patients receiving secukinumab either low or high 
dose, entered the extension period beyond week 52. In Study A2311, 98.9% of the patients carried on 
at week 16 interim analysis point and also further to 24 week analysis point. 
Concomitant medications during the study included paracetamol, ibuprofen, and some antibiotics. Locally 
applied emollients were also used. No new drug interactions were reported. There were single cases of 
patients in Study A2310 reported using also topical betamethasone (one in low dose group) or topical 
hydrocortisone (one in low dose group and one in high dose group). This seemed to be a minor deviation 
and not significantly alter the efficacy or safety interpretations. 
Adverse events 
At 52 weeks, the TEAEs in the paediatric patients vs. adult patients with moderate or severe psoriasis 
slightly increased incidences were observed in SOCs infections and infestations (61.4% vs. 57.7% vs. 
49.6%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (24.6% vs. 21.6% vs. 21.1%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (26.3% vs. 21.9% vs. 21.0%), general disorders and administration site conditions (18.4% 
vs. 15.1% vs. 13.1%), blood and lymphatic disorders (7.9% vs. 4.7% vs. 3.8%), and reproductive 
system, and breast disorders (7.9% vs. 2.9% vs. 3.4%). 
From preferred terms, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, pharyngitis, pyrexia, rhinitis, fatigue, 
abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, tonsillitis, eczema, vomiting, acne, and dysmenorrhoea were slightly 
more common in the paediatric population compared to adults. 
During the induction period in Study A2310, infections and infestations were equally common in both 
secukinumab  groups  and  placebo  group,  32.5%  low  doses,  37.5%  high  doses,  39.0%  placebo,  but 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 117/131 
 
 
 
somewhat lower in the etanercept group 26.8%. The gastrointestinal disorders were the second most 
common  AEs  being  more  common  in  the  etanercept  group,  in  15.0%,  17.5%,  14.6%,  and  24.4%, 
respectively. Skin and subcutaneous disorders were more frequent in the secukinumab group, in 12.5%, 
7.5%, 7.3% and 2.4%, respectively. 
Nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis were the most common infections in all study groups in Study A2310. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms in the etanercept group consisted of abdominal pain and nausea. Both in the 
secukinumab  and  etanercept  groups  two  AST  elevations  were  reported  in  each  -  refer  below  to 
“Laboratory  findings”.  Most  other  adverse  events  as  preferred  term  were  present  in  single  or  double 
occurrences only. The overall tolerability of secukinumab was not worse compared to etanercept, judged 
from the TEAE incidences. 
Number of patients <12 years of age was low (37) compared to older patients (137). Further, this young 
population was subdivided into four treatment groups (8 low doses, 9 high doses, 10 placebo, and 10 
etanercept)  which  makes  the  number  of  observations  very  small.  However,  no  clinically  meaningful 
differential trends in the incidence of infections could be observed between the age groups. 
The same applied to the safety findings by the weight strata, as the number of patients in the group <25 
kg was equally low (2, 3, 3, and 4 respectively). 
The effect of secukinumab exposure by percentiles (<25, 25 to <50, 50 to <75, and 75 to 100) up to 
week 12 implied to a dose dependence in some extent regarding the overall incidence of AEs, infections 
and infestations, and gastrointestinal AEs. From a safety perspective, the lowest efficacious dose would 
be preferential for the paediatric psoriasis patients. In Week 52 data, some incremental efficacy with the 
higher 300 mg dose could be observed in the ≥50 kg weight stratum. In contrast, long-term response 
rates in the ≥25-<50 kg weight stratum were higher with the 75 mg dose than the 150 mg dose. The 
MAH proposed SmPC posology wording to indicate that the recommended dose can be increased from 
150 to 300 mg within weight stratum ≥50 kg and that some patients may derive additional benefit from 
a  higher  dose  was  endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  However,  at  the  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  removed  this 
recommendation for the 25-50 kg weight stratum from the SmPC. See also discussions on clinical efficacy 
(Section 2.4.3). 
Observation of the patient groups by disease severity (moderate or severe), age group (6 to <12 or 12 
to <18 years) or weight (<25, 25 to <50, or ≥50 kg) did not reveal remarkable differences in the AE 
profiles. 
The  most  common  AEs  during  the  entire  treatment  period  in  Study  A2310  were  nasopharyngitis, 
headache and pharyngitis. The  Exposure adjusted incidence rates of tonsillitis, diarrhoea, and rhinitis 
were  higher  in  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  compared  to  the  etanercept  group,  while  the  EAIRs  of 
abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper and oral herpes were higher in the etanercept group. 
Higher  dose  induced  more  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  possibly  related  to  study  medication 
(41.4%  vs  28.6%)  in  Study  A2310.  In  Study  A2311  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  were  comparable  in 
secukinumab low dose group (28/42; 59.5%) and secukinumab high dose group (25/42; 60.0%). 
No significant differences could be pointed out between the different weight strata, age groups, or dose 
levels  regarding  Study  A2311.  When  comparing  the  paediatric  psoriasis  patient  findings  with  adult 
moderate or severe psoriasis patients, slightly increased incidences of TEAEs in the SOCs of infections 
and infestations (35.0% vs 30.0% vs. 26.9%), gastrointestinal disorders (16.3% vs. 12.1% vs. 11.5%), 
general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (11.3%  vs  6.5%  vs.  6.7%),  and  investigations 
(5.0% vs. 2.5% vs. 1.8%) were observed. Looking at the most common preferred terms, the incidences 
of  nasopharyngitis  (16.3%  vs.  12.0%  vs.  11.3%),  abdominal  pain  (7.5%  vs.  1.4%  vs.  1.0%)  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 118/131 
 
 
 
observed. These differences did not seem clinically significant to CHMP. It was also observed, that the 
TEAE profile in adult patients was similar in both moderate and severe psoriasis groups. 
Deaths and serious adverse events 
During  induction  period  in  Study  A2310,  two  SAEs  were  reported  from  secukinumab  group:  ALT 
increased in the low dose group (due to viral gastroenteritis, no suspected causality, continued in study), 
and  toxic  shock  syndrome  (MRSA  infection  in  the  right  calf,  no  suspected  causality,  discontinued  the 
study) in the high dose group. 
Until week 24, two more SAEs were reported from secukinumab group: bronchitis in the low dose group 
(erroneous  extra  doses  during  weeks  13,  14,  and  15,  treated  with  amoxicillin,  suspected  causality, 
continued  in  study),  and  lymphadenopathy  (due  to  skin  infection  treated  with  cephalexin  and 
trimethoprim,  suspected  causality,  temporary  dosing  cessation,  continued  in  study)  in  the  high  dose 
group. 
From  etanercept  group  four  SAEs  emerged:  autoimmune  pancreatitis  (no  suspected  causality, 
discontinued  the  study),  gallbladder  polyp  (previously  diagnosed,  gallbladder  ectomy,  no  suspected 
causality, continued the study), GI toxicity (“poisoning”, no further information, no suspected causality, 
continued the study), and syncope (during physical education class, no suspected causality, continued 
the study). Up to week 24 one episode of abdominal pain was reported as SAE. 
Further,  one  patient  in  placebo  to  low  dose  group  had  reactive  arthritis  and  worsening  of  psoriasis 
(suspected causality to reactive arthritis but not to worsening of psoriasis, discontinued the study), and 
one  patient  in  placebo  to  high  dose  group  experienced  pneumonia  and  thrombophlebitis  (co-existing 
morbidity including immunodeficiency, history of pneumonia and thrombophlebitis, atrial septal defect, 
etc., no suspected causality, continued in study) as SAEs. 
There  were  no  distinctive  differences  in  the  SAE  profiles  in  Study  A2310  attributable  to  dose  level  of 
secukinumab. But the EAIRs of SAEs in patients aged <12 years compared to ≥12 years were: 7.6 vs. 
4.3 in the secukinumab low dose group, 19.0 vs. 4.0 in the secukinumab high dose group. Analysis of 
the TEAE and SAE profiles by age, weight, or dose groups did not reveal any safety concerns in any of 
the groups, even in those weighing less than 25 kg. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  from  several  secukinumab  patients  but  the  specific 
manifestations were single occurrences. Treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies were observed in one 
secukinumab low dose patient on week 12 and there was no associated AE or loss of efficacy. Neutropenia 
is  discussed  below  under  “Laboratory  findings”.  There  were  no  malignancies,  MACEs,  or  hepatitis  B 
reactivations in patients receiving secukinumab. One case of IBD was reported from Study A2311. One 
case of suicidal ideation in Study A2310 has been discussed thoroughly by the MAH and did not awake 
concern of causality to the CHMP. 
Cautionary language is already included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of Cosentyx relating to the risk of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Exclusion criteria number 10 of trial CAIN457A2310 addresses active 
ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of 
secukinumab  and/or etanercept therapy. Therefore,  the  CHMP  understood that  no patient  with  active 
ongoing  IBD  were  allowed  entering  the  trial.  It  is  noted  that  although  there  were  reported  cases  of 
abdominal  pain  and  diarrhoea,  no  specific  diagnosis  of  IBD  was  registered  during  the  trial 
CAIN457A2310. The MAH has evaluated these cases and there were no verified cases of IBD in Study 
A2310. 
Laboratory findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 119/131 
 
 
 
During induction period in Study A2310, one patient receiving secukinumab and one patient receiving 
etanercept had neutropenia < 1.5 x 10E9/L. One secukinumab patient had Grade 3 AST elevation and 
one  etanercept  patient  Grade  3  GGT  elevation.  ALT  or  AST  elevations  >  3x  ULN  were  seen  in  two 
secukinumab low dose patients. One patient had ALT and AST elevations > 5x ULN - due to Gilbert´s 
syndrome.  
Up to week 24, one patient in secukinumab low dose had a reversible Grade 3 neutropenia due to viral 
infection. Several other ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL elevations were observed, but none of them met Hy´s 
law criteria. In the entire duration of Study A2310 only two patients secukinumab had reversible Grade 
3 neutropenias. During rest of the study there were only single cases of transient Grade 3 abnormalities 
in all of the study groups. Up until 52 weeks, one patient (2.6%) in the secukinumab high dose group 
had QTcF changes from baseline > 450 msec. 
In  study  A2311  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  and  ECG  abnormalities  were  rare.  Analysis  of  the 
laboratory and vital sign findings by age, weight, or dose groups did not reveal any safety concerns in 
any of the groups, even in those weighing less than 25 kg. 
Other issues 
There were no patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency in the study population. Secukinumab has not 
been studied either in adult populations with hepatic or renal insufficiency. The SmPC is up to date in 
this respect. 
Three cases of pregnancies imply to a breach of the exclusion criteria of the study. However, this issue 
was not pursued further by the CHMP. 
There  were  no  apparent  effects  on  the  growth  and  development  of  the  populations  in  either  of  the 
studies. 
No new information arises from Study 2310 concerning the drug interactions. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Over 17,900 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in 
various indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other autoimmune 
conditions), representing 29,978 PY of exposure. Of these, over 11,700 patients were exposed to 
secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of secukinumab is consistent across all 
indications. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are upper respiratory tract 
infections (most frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). No new ADRs were identified in the paediatric 
patients other than those seen in the adults. 
In the paediatric populations, the mean age was 13.5 years, mean weight 53 kg, and there was a 
female predominance in Study A2310. In study A2311, the mean age was 12.5 years and the mean 
weight 55 kg. There were 16 patients weighing less than 25 kg in both studies altogether. There were 
no patients with moderate plaque psoriasis in the presented paediatric population in Study A2310. In 
Study A2311 69% of the patients had moderate psoriasis and 31% severe psoriasis. 
In general, the AE profiles observed in studies A2310 and A2311 do not reveal new safety concerns. 
Secukinumab in the studied paediatric population appeared equally well tolerated as in adult psoriatic 
patients. No clinically significant differences regarding safety were observed between the low and high 
dose groups in either of the studies. Compared to etanercept, the tolerability was not worse either. 
Based on the data from Studies A2310 and A2311 the CHMP concluded, that there seems to be no 
specific safety concerns preventing treatment of patients 6 years of age or older, weighing less than 25

kg, with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, with secukinumab. Consequently, the wording of the 
indication, as originally proposed by the MAH, was considered supported from a safety perspective.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 of the SmPC are 
updated. Section 6.6 of the SmPC for the solution for injection is also updated. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI (Annex II) to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 
10.1, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of the Netherlands. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated to indicate that, prior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is 
recommended that paediatric patients receive all age-appropriate immunisations as per current 
immunisation guidelines. This change was endorsed by the CHMP.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disorder, caused by the combined action of multiple disease genes, and 
is also triggered by environmental factors. T-cells are clearly involved, as psoriasis responds to 
treatment with calcineurin inhibitors, which inhibit T-cell activity (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus). 
Successful psoriasis therapy correlates with inhibition of IL-17 signalling and is seen, e.g., after IL-17A 
blockade with secukinumab, and it can therefore be concluded that IL-17A contributes to the disease 
process. 
Psoriasis is one of the most common human skin diseases affecting 2 to 3% of the general population. 
Plaque psoriasis affects 80% to 90% of all psoriasis patients of all age groups and is also the most 
common variant of the disease in paediatric patients. Most children manifest with plaque psoriasis in 
patterns similar to adult patients, and it is accepted that paediatric and adult psoriasis represent 
manifestations of the same disease process, as opposed to being distinct disease entities. 
Disease prevalence in children varies depending on study population and age, with 1% as a commonly 
quoted figure. Worldwide, the incidence of paediatric psoriasis is increasing, affecting up to 2% of 
children in some populations. In Europe, psoriasis is reported to affect 0.5-1% of children, and chronic 
plaque psoriasis is also common among adolescents. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Topical treatments are the mainstay of therapeutic approaches in paediatric psoriasis, and a significant 
proportion of patients can be adequately treated with topical therapies such as emollients, vitamin D 
analogues, corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Various forms of phototherapy are also successfully 
used in many patients. Available systemic treatments include methotrexate, cyclosporine and 
retinoids. It should however be recognised that many of these products have no formal authorisation 
for use in paediatric psoriasis and can be associated with significant safety concerns. In this respect, 
and apart from the better studied biological agents, paediatric psoriasis patients can still be considered 
a significantly underserved patient population. 
Three biological agents are currently authorised in the EU for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in the 
paediatric population: etanercept (authorised in 2009), adalimumab (authorised in 2015), and 
ustekinumab (authorised in 2015). Etanercept is currently authorised for severe disease from 6 years 
of age; adalimumab is authorised for severe disease from 4 years of age, and ustekinumab is 
authorised for moderate to severe disease from 6 years of age. All three products are authorised as 
second-line therapies, for use in patients who are inadequately controlled by or are intolerant to other 
systemic therapies or phototherapies (the exact wording varies slightly by individual product).

On 28 May 2020, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following new indication for Taltz 
(ixekizumab) another medicinal product targeting IL-17: “Paediatric plaque psoriasis: Taltz is indicated 
for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 years and with a 
body weight of at least 25 kg and adolescents who are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main studies within the submission are: 
• 
Study A2310, an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo- and etanercept -controlled study 
in paediatric patients 6-17 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. An interim study report, 
containing efficacy data until Week 52 as well as summaries of safety data over various periods of time 
in study, including a summary of all safety data until data cut-off, has been provided. 
• 
Study A2311, an ongoing randomised, open-label study with a historical placebo control in 
paediatric patients 6-17 years of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. An interim study 
report, containing efficacy data until Week 24 and a summary of all safety data until last data cut-off 
has been provided. 
Study A2310, evaluating treatment of severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents over 6 years 
of age with low or high dose of secukinumab and comparator etanercept has progressed to 52 week 
cut-off with all enrolled patients. Patients have continued in the extension, open phase until up to week 
236. Secukinumab was administered at two dose levels and the dose is further adjusted by the weight 
of the patients (< 25 kg, 25 - < 50 kg, and ≥ 50 kg). It is to be noted, that there were no patients with 
moderate plaque psoriasis in this study population. 
Study A2311 involved also subjects with moderate psoriasis and evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
two dose levels of secukinumab in similar weight groups as above. 
Pooled safety results from the studies of secukinumab in treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adult patients ≥ 18 years of age (Studies A2302, A2303, A2308, and A2309) were used for 
comparison. Presenting the adult data separately for “moderate” and “severe” adult patients enabled 
comparison for “severe” paediatric patients, and helps in extrapolation of the safety conclusions from 
“severe” paediatric patients to “moderate” paediatric patients. 
The results from the adult studies were compared with the results from the induction period up to 12 
weeks, and from the start of medication up to 52 weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Secukimab PK has been studied with population pharmacokinetic methodology and the appropriateness 
of the paediatric doses has been evaluated. The modelling steps have been appropriately conducted. 
The MAH has conducted a statistical extrapolation of efficacy from moderately psoriatic adults to 
moderately psoriatic children which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The main favourable effects in study A2310 are as follows: 
At Week 12 (time point for primary analysis), both secukinumab dose levels (Low and High) were 
superior to placebo with respect to the co-primary endpoints of PASI 75 response and IGA 0/1 
response as well as the key secondary endpoint of PASI 90 response (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). 
In the primary statistical analyses, performed using multiple imputation for missing data, a PASI 75 
response at Week 12 was achieved by 80.1% of patients in the secukinumab Low dose group and 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 126/131 
 
 
 
80.2% of patients in the secukinumab High dose group compared with 14.9% of patients in the 
placebo group. Similarly, at Week 12, an IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response was achieved by 69.8% of 
patients in the secukinumab Low dose group and 62.6% of patients in the secukinumab High dose 
group compared with 6.3% of patients in the placebo group. 
In the multiple imputation dataset, a PASI 90 response at Week 12 was achieved by 71.1% of patients 
in the secukinumab Low dose group and 69.3% of patients in the secukinumab High dose group 
compared with 2.5% of patients in the placebo group. 
In the etanercept group, a PASI 75 response was achieved by 65.7% of patients, an IGA mod 2011 0 
or 1 response by 36.3% of patients, and a PASI 90 response by 31.4% of patients. Statistical 
comparisons between etanercept and secukinumab were not part of the formal testing strategy. 
Among other endpoints at Week 12, the proportions of patients achieving a CDLQI 0 or 1 response 
(indicating no or little impairment) were 44.7% in the secukinumab Low dose group and 50% in the 
High dose group, compared with 36.6% in the etanercept group and 15% in the placebo group. 
Depending on the endpoint, responses in both secukinumab groups were detected from Week 2 to 
Week 4 onward, with further increases observed until Week 12. 
Maintenance of effect until Week 52 was demonstrated supporting a long-term indication. 
Results up to Week 24 in study A2311 were consistent with study A2310 supporting efficacy in patients 
with disease of moderate severity. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the limited dataset in patients under 25 kg in body weight is recognised, together, studies 
A2310 and A2311 provide efficacy and safety data from 58 patients <12 years receiving at least a 
single dose of secukinumab, and 16 patients <25 kg receiving at least a single dose of secukinumab. 
Total exposure to secukinumab was reported as 35.02 patient-years in patients <12 years and 13.2 
patient-years in patients weighing <25 kg. The CHMP considered that sufficient data was available for 
patients under 25 kg in body weight and that no weight restriction below 25 kg was deemed necessary 
in the indication.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the AE and SAE profiles observed in Study A2310 do not reveal new safety concerns. 
Secukinumab appears equally well tolerated as in adult psoriatic patients and not less tolerable than 
the comparator etanercept.  
The effect of secukinumab exposure by percentiles (<25, 25 to <50, 50 to <75, and 75 to 100) up to 
week 12 implied to a dose dependence in some extent regarding the overall incidence of AEs, 
infections and infestations, and gastrointestinal AEs. In Week 52 data, some incremental efficacy with 
the higher 300 mg dose could be observed in the ≥50 kg weight stratum. Hence, the MAH proposed 
SmPC posology wording to indicate that the recommended dose can be increased from 150 to 300 mg 
within weight stratum ≥50 kg and that some patients may derive additional benefit from a higher dose 
was endorsed by the CHMP. In contrast, long-term response rates in the ≥25-<50 kg weight stratum 
were higher with the 75 mg dose than the 150 mg dose. Hence, at the CHMP request, the MAH 
removed this recommendation for the 25-50 kg weight stratum from the SmPC. 
At 52 weeks, the TEAEs in the paediatric patients vs. adult patients with moderate or severe psoriasis 
slightly increased incidences were observed in SOCs infections and infestations (61.4% vs. 57.7% vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/374601/2020  
Page 127/131 
 
 
 
49.6%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (24.6% vs. 21.6% vs. 21.1%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (26.3% vs. 21.9% vs. 21.0%), general disorders and administration site conditions (18.4% 
vs. 15.1% vs. 13.1%), blood and lymphatic disorders (7.9% vs. 4.7% vs. 3.8%), and reproductive 
system, and breast disorders (7.9% vs. 2.9% vs. 3.4%). From preferred terms, nasopharyngitis, 
headache, cough, pharyngitis, pyrexia, rhinitis, fatigue, abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, tonsillitis, 
eczema, vomiting, acne, and dysmenorrhoea were slightly more common in the paediatric population 
compared to adults. These differences did not seem clinically significant to CHMP.  
It was also observed, that the TEAE profile in adult patients was similar in both moderate and severe 
psoriasis groups. 
In conclusion, the safety profile in paediatric patients is largely consistent with extensive experience 
gained in adult patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The current experience in children under 12 years of age as well as children weighing under 25 kg 
remains limited. Long-term experience is mostly available from study A2310, in which 15 children in 
the age cohort 6-<12 years, and 5 children weighing under 25 kg had been exposed for 52 weeks or 
more at the time of data cut-off. However, based on the data from Studies A2310 and A2311 the 
CHMP concluded, that there seem to be no specific safety concerns preventing treatment of patients 6 
years of age or older, weighing less than 25 kg, with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, with 
secukinumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Secukimab PK has been studied with population pharmacokinetic methodology and the appropriateness 
of the paediatric doses has been evaluated. The MAH has conducted a statistical extrapolation of 
efficacy from moderately psoriatic adults to moderately psoriatic children which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
Based on the co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, secukinumab has statistically 
significant and clinically relevant efficacy in the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis among 
paediatric patients. Maintenance of effect until Week 52 was demonstrated supporting a long-term 
indication. Favourable efficacy against an already authorised active comparator was also seen, 
although formal statistical comparisons against the active comparator were not undertaken. Results up 
to Week 24 in study A2311 were consistent with study A2310 supporting efficacy in patients with 
disease of moderate severity.  
The general safety profile observed is largely consistent with previous experience in adult patients. 
Overall, it can be concluded that secukinumab could be a valuable alternative for the treatment of 
moderate to severe paediatric plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.

Page 129/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the reported studies provide adequate evidence of efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of 
moderate to severe paediatric plaque psoriasis, and response rates with the studied dosages match or 
even exceed those previously reported among adult patients. The safety profile is largely consistent 
with extensive experience gained in adult patients. A favourable overall profile has been demonstrated 
among patients over 6 years of age and weighing less than 25 kg. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH has proposed an essentially first-line systemic indication for secukinumab in paediatric 
psoriasis, with wording matching the already authorised adult indication. Whereas all currently 
authorised biological therapies for paediatric psoriasis still carry indications consistent with second-line 
therapy, it is recognised that first-line indications are currently being increasingly accepted and have 
been consistently authorised for recent approvals in the adult population. Taking into account the 
favourable experience gained in the adult population to date and the data submitted as part of this 
application, the CHMP considered that this wording is also acceptable for the paediatric population. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cosentyx in the following indication is positive: 
Cosentyx  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  children  and 
adolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy.

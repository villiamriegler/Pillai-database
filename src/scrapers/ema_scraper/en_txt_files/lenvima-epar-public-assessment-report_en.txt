2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem Statement 
Differentiated thyroid cancinoma (DTC) 
Thyroid cancer is rare, representing less than 1% of all cancers (Hundahl, et al., 1998; Pacini, et al., 
2012; Tuttle, et al., 2010). There are three main histologic types of thyroid carcinoma: differentiated, 
medullary, and anaplastic. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common of all thyroid cancers 
accounting for approximately 90% to 95% of cases (Hundahl, et al., 1998). It arises from follicular 
epithelial cells. Based on histological appearance, DTCs are designated as either papillary (≈80%), 
follicular (≈10%), or Hürthle cell (≈5%). Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma is currently considered as an 
oncocytic variant of follicular carcinoma. 
The remaining 5% to 10% are either C cell-derived medullary (MTC) or anaplastic (ATC) thyroid 
carcinomas. 
Prognosis and treatment 
In general, prognosis for thyroid cancer at the time of diagnosis is good, with a 5 year relative survival 
rate of 98% (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014) and a 10-year survival rate of 85% (Hundahl, et al., 
1998). Up to 10-15% would either present with distant metastasis at diagnosis or develop them after 
initial treatment. Distant metastases are associated with 5-year survival rates of approximately 50% 
(Schlumberger et al., 1986; SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014), 10-year survival rates of 40% 
(Schlumberger et al., 1986), and 15 year survival rates of 30% (Schlumberger et al., 1986; 
Schlumberger et al., 1996).  Differentiated thyroid cancer is usually asymptomatic for long periods and 
commonly presents as a solitary thyroid nodule. First-line treatment for primary management of DTC is 
surgery (total thyroidectomy or unilateral lobectomy), often followed by radioiodine (131I) ablation and 
thyroxine therapy (European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines, Pacini, et al, 2012). The goals of this 
treatment strategy are to destroy any residual thyroid tissue and prevent locoregional recurrence. 
External beam radiotherapy may be indicated when complete surgical excision is not possible or when 
there is no significant uptake in the tumor (Pacini et al, 2012). Only 30% of patients with distant 
metastasis respond to radioiodine therapy with complete remission (Schlumberger, et al., 1999). 
Tumor recurrence occurs in 3-25% of patients with DTC, depending  on histology and tumor extension at 
diagnosis, with a median follow-up period of 16.6 years, 16% had local recurrence and 8% had distant 
metastases (which includes 2% with both local and distant metastases) (Mazzaferri and Kloos, 2001).  Of 
the 5-20% who develop locoregional recurrences, approximately two-thirds involve cervical lymph nodes. 
Distant metastases in lung, bones and brain occur in up to 10% of patients and are associated with a 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 10/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
median survival of 5 years from the time of discovery of metastases (Schlumberger, et al., 1986; SEER 
Cancer Statistics Review, 2014). Approximately one-third of metastatic DTCs lose the functional ability to 
concentrate iodine and no longer respond to radioiodine (131I) treatment (Schlumberger, et al., 1996, 
Durante, et al., 2006). 
Upon the absence or loss of 131I uptake, tumors assume a more aggressive behavior, resulting in a 
10-year survival rate of approximately 10% (Schlumberger et al., 1996; Durante et al.,2006). 
Single-agent or combination chemotherapy in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer 
(RR-DTC) offers patients little to no benefit, is associated with significant toxicity and is no longer 
indicated (Haugen and Sherman, 2013, Shimaoka, et al., 1985; Matuszczyk, et al., 2008; Pacini et al, 
2012). Current clinical consensus guidelines recommend that patients with RR-DTC avoid traditional 
chemotherapy and move directly to treatment with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 
clinical trials (American Thyroid association guidelines, Cooper 2009; ESMO guidelines, Pacini et al., 
2012; NCCN guidelines, Tuttle, et al., 2010). 
To date, one TKI, sorafenib, has been approved in the European Union (EU) and United States (US) for the 
treatment of RR-DTC. This approval was based on the results of one Phase 3 study (the DECISION trial) 
of sorafenib in 417 subjects with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic RR-DTC (EPAR Nexavar). In 
this study, median PFS time was 10.8 months in the sorafenib group compared to 5.8 months in the 
placebo group (HR=0.587; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.454, 0.758; one-sided p <0.0001) (see 
SmPC Nexavar).   
About the product 
Lenvima comprises the antineoplastic agent lenvatinib mesilate. Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase 
(RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and 
oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, 
the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The antitumor effects of lenvatinib in patients with thyroid cancer are based primarily on its activity 
against proangiogenic VEGFR2. Other potential mechanisms involve the inhibition of oncogenic FGFR1, 
FGFR2, and RET kinase (see non-clinical section). 
Indication and dosage 
Lenvima is formulated in 2 strengths of hypromellose hard capsules containing lenvatinib mesilate 
equivalent to either 4 mg or 10 mg of lenvatinib. 
The applied indication was for the treatment of patients with progressive, radioiodine-refractory (RR) 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). 
The recommended indication is Lenvima is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, 
locally advanced or metastatic differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC), 
refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) (see SmPC section 4.1) 
Lenvima treatment should be initiated and supervised by a health care professional experienced in the 
use of anticancer therapies (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg taken once daily.  The daily dose is to be modified as 
needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan (see dose adjustment in SmPC section 4.2). 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 11/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
If a patient misses a dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and 
the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration.  Treatment should continue as long as 
clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs (see SmPC section 4.2).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lenvatinib is 
4-[3-Chloro-4-(N’-cyclopropylureido)phenoxy]-7-methoxyquinoline-6-carboxamide methanesulfonate 
and it has the following structure: 
The active substance is a white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, slightly soluble in water and 
practically insoluble in ethanol. The structure of lenvatinib mesilatewas elucidated by using elemental 
analysis, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Lenvatinib is achiral.  
Lenvatinib mesilate exhibits polymorphism. Polymorphism is controlled during the manufacturing process 
of the active substance..

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  of  lenvatinib  mesilate  consists  of  two  synthetic  steps  followed  by  salt 
formation.  Five  crystallisations  ensure  the  control  of  the  impurity  profile  of  lenvatinib  mesilate.  Well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used.  
A quality by design (QbD) approach was used in the process development of lenvatinib mesilate. A quality 
target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  for  the  finished  product  and  the  properties  of  the  active 
substance shown to impact on this were defined as critical quality attributes (CQAs). Active substance 
CQAs are impurities, residual solvents, residual genotoxins, particle size, and polymorphic form. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) in the synthetic process were identified by risk assessment (including 
failure mode effects analysis, FMEA), process knowledge, and both uni- and multi-variate experiments. 
Each of the 3 steps contains CPPs and thus all are considered critical. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for 
all the CPPs have been defined. However, no design space is claimed by the applicant so for each step, 
only one CPP may be moved within its PAR with other CPPs help at their target set-point. 
The quality of the active substance is assured by a control strategy composed of the above-mentioned 
PARs and a series of in process controls designed to limit impurities and residual solvents. Despite the 
QbD approach to development, the applicant employs traditional release testing to ensure the quality of 
the active substance. Data from the first process validation batch of lenvatinib mesilate is provided. The 
CPPs  were  all  controlled  within  the  PARs  and  the  lenvatinib  mesilate  thus  produced  was  of  adequate 
quality and in line with the active substance specification. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their  origin  and  characterised.  All  potential  impurities  and  the  starting  material  (SM)  itself  have  been 
evaluated according to CHMP guidelines on genotoxic impurities. This analysis is based on experimental 
and computational SAR analysis using DEREK and MCASE software systems and Ames-test. There have 
been no impurities detected above the reporting threshold (0.05%) in 10 batches. A HPLC method was 
developed to detect the 16 potential impurities. Specifications for only 2 from 16 potential impurities have 
been defined based on spiking studies. The spike study of genotoxic impurity demonstrates that during 
manufacturing process is able to purge to levels below the TTC of 60ppm, from 0.30% to 3ppm, in the 
intermediate. The genotoxic impurities show no detectable levels in 10 batches. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, XRPD), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC, HPLC), residual benzene 
(GC),  water  content  (KF),  heavy  metals  (USP),  methanesulfonic  acid  content  (ion  chromatography), 
particle size (light diffraction measurement) and microbial limits (Ph Eur). 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data (6 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Stability 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 5 ºC ± 3 ºC  and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 °C ± 2 ºC /60 ± 5 % RH  according to the ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  identification  (XRPD), 
related substances, genotoxic impurities, water content and assay. No significant changes to any of the 
measured parameters was observed. 
Stress testing on the active substance in the solid state was performed under conditions of heat (60 ºC), 
light  exposure  (ICH  photostability  conditions)  and  high  humidity  (30  ºC/75  %  RH).  Under  the  stress 
conditions of light exposure and high humidity, no degradation products were observed and therefore the 
active substance can be considered photostable and non-hygroscopic.  Genotoxic impurities remain below 
LOQ or unchanged at 5°C and slightly increases at 25°C/60%RH. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Lenvatinib mesilate was found to be a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor which works as an anticancer drug, 
and it was decided to develop it as an immediate release solid oral dosage form. The aim was to develop 
and oral immediate release form which allows patents to administer the drug themselves, easy to handle, 
and  obtain  desired  bioability.    The  product  is  presented  in  multiple  strengths  easily  distinguished  by 
combination of shape, color, shape and prints to allow dose adjustments and minimizes risk of side effects 
and the mix-up of strengths and products.   
The active substance stability, solubility, polymorphism and particle size characteristics were taken into 
account during the pharmaceutical development. Lenvatinib mesilate, potentially includes a genotoxic 
impurity and degradant, which is also a synthetic intermediate of lenvatinib. It was found to increase in 
the active substance by decomposition by heat stress. In addition, lenvatinib mesilate forms a gel when 
it is in contact with dissolution media. Therefore, the related substances and dissolution were designated 
as critical quality attributes for lenvatinib capsules.  
Film-coated tablets were first developed and used in the early clinical trials. However, it was found that 
the  excipients  and  process  used  to  manufacture  this  pharmaceutical  form  had  a  negative  impact  on 
related substances and increased the level of the genotoxic impurity in the finished product. Because of 
these concerns, development of another formulation for commercial production was initiated. A capsule 
formulation was developed in order to address the manufacturability issues associated with the initial 
tablet  manufacturing  process.  These  were  used  for  pivotal  clinical  studies  and  selected  as  the 
pharmaceutical form of the marketed product.  
The excipients for lenvatinib capsules were selected to ensure both appropriate stability and dissolution of 
the finished product. Therefore, compatibility of the active substances with excipients, their functions, 
and their relative concentrations were studied. 
Non-hygroscopic excipients were chosen to limit the level of water and reduce the risk of degradation of 
lenvatinib mesilate. Calcium carbonate was selected as a water insoluble inorganic diluent, which could 
effectively  avoid  gelation  of  the  active  substance  without  preventing  dispersion  of  drug  substance 
particles.  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 14/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and for the majority, their quality is compliant 
with Ph Eur standards. The only non-pharmacopeial excipients are low-substituted hydroxypropyl 
cellulose and the hypromellose capsule shells. The specification for low-substituted hydroxypropyl 
cellulose complies with the National Formulary (NF) and is considered to be acceptable. The components 
of the capsules comply with the Ph Eur with the exception of butyl alcohol for which no Ph Eur monograph 
exists. This component complies with the NF monograph. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that proposed for commercialization. 
A bioequivalence study was performed between capsules and tablets, which  concluded that the same 
strength of capsules (10mg) could be used for pivotal clinical studies.  
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  consisting  of  mixing,  granulation,  drying,  milling, 
blending and encapsulation steps. An initial risk assessment for the manufacturing process at commercial 
production scale was performed so as to identify process parameters that were likely to have an impact 
on  the  CQAs  of  lenvatinib  capsules..  Development and  formal  validation  data  are  convincing  that  the 
physical  state  of  the  active  substance  is  under  control  throughout  manufacturing  of  the  capsules. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP recommended testing the first 10 commercial batches intended for marketing in 
order  to  determine  the  physical  state  of  lenvatinib  mesilate  in  the  finished  product.  The  CHMP  also 
recommended testing of the physical form (type C crystal level) of lenvatinib mesilate in formal stability 
studies up to the end (60 months) and in at least on the first 2 commercial batches of each strength to be 
included in the post approval stability studies. 
Lenvatinib capsules are packaged in polyamide and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) laminated aluminium film 
with push-through aluminium foil blisters (Alu/Alu blisters). Specifications for the forming film and lidding 
foil have been provided. The specifications contain an IR identification test. The forming lid is stated to 
comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.11, EC Directive 2002/72EC and EC Directive 78/142/EEC. The lidding foil is 
stated to comply with EC Directive 2002/72EC and EC Directive 78/142/EEC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Lenvima capsules consists in a conventional wet granulation of nine steps: 
mixing, granulation, drying, milling, blending, encapsulation, weight-sorting, bulk packaging, and blister 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Primary stability batches have been manufactured. Three batches of each strength (4 mg and 10 mg) 
were manufactured; two batches were manufactured at pilot scale and one batch was manufactured at 
full commercial scale.  Formal validation of the process has been completed on 3 commercial batches 
ofeach strength. The full validation results have not been provided yet. The applicant made a declaration 
that the validation results are acceptable (process parameters within PARs and expected values; IPCs 
compliant, final results within specs and additional tests within expected range).  As the manufacturing 
process  is  a  standard  process,  this  is  considered  acceptable.  During  formal  validation,  further 
investigation  has  been  performed  on  the  physical  state  of  the  active  sunstance.  The  processes  from 
drying through weight-sorting did not have any impact on the physical state of the active substance in the 
finished product. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description, identification (UV, HPLC, HPLC-PDA), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), dissolution 
(Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), and microbial limits (Ph Eur). 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 15/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Batch analysis results are provided for 37 pilot scale batches used in clinical and stability studies 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  All batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 (1 commercial scale and 2 pilot scale batches per strength of finished product stored 
under long term conditions for up to 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. A commitment is provided that two additional full commercial scale 
batches of 4 mg and 10 mg capsules will be place on stability. A satisfactory stability protocol identical to 
the on-going stability studies at accelerated and long term conditions has been provided. 
Samples were tested for description, dissolution, related substances, assay, water content and 
microbiological limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Under  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  after  24  months  and  6 
months respectively, no significant changes were observed and there was no difference between the 4 
and 10 mg capsule strengths. During photostability studies no changes were observed in comparison to 
the initial time-point or to a control sample stored in an open dish in the dark. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of lenvatinib capsules. Therefore, 
there  is  no  risk  with  respect  to  transmissible  spongiform  encephalopathy  (TSE)  agents,  bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or other contamination with adventitious agents. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
active substance. PARs are claimed for CPPs identified in both active substance and finished product 
manufacturing processes.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To test the first 10 commercial batches intended for marketing to determine the physical state of 
lenvatinib mesilate in the finished product. 
- To test the physical state (type C crystal level) in the batches of the formal stability study up to the end 
(60 months) and in at least on the first 2 commercial batches of each strength to be included in the post 
approval stability studies. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal toxicology studies and the battery of safety pharmacology studies were conducted in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. In addition, all GLP studies were conducted 
by laboratories in countries that adhere to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) system for mutual acceptance of chemical safety data. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, preliminary and dose-range finding (DRF) toxicology studies were 
generally non-GLP studies. 
Nonclinical studies of lenvatinib were generally conducted using lenvatinib mesilate, and doses are 
expressed in terms of the mesilate salt. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics effects of lenvatinib were evaluated in in vitro kinase inhibition (profiling) 
assays, kinetic interaction studies, X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of the VEGFR2-lenvatinib 
complex, in vitro cell-based assays, and in vivo studies in various human tumour xenograft models in 
athymic mice.  In vivo studies in various human xenograft models included evaluation of the activity of 
lenvatinib as a single agent as well as in combination with other anticancer agents. 
In vitro studies 
Kinase Inhibition Profiling Studies 1 and 2 (Studies W-201208 and W-20120814) 
Two kinase inhibition profiling studies against a total of 66 purified recombinant protein kinases (including 
tyrosine kinases and serine threonine kinases) showed that lenvatinib is a potent multiple kinase 
inhibitor.  IC50 values were determined by measuring the cell-free kinase activities with lenvatinib 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 17/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(0.3 - 10,000 nmol/L) by ELISA or mobility shift assay. The profile for sorafenib, another multikinase 
inhibitor in clinical use, was also studied under the same condition as a reference. 
The most sensitive kinases for lenvatinib included VEGF receptors (VEGFR1 – 3), and RET with IC50 
values below 10 nmol/L, specifically 4.7, 3.0, 2.3, and 6.4 nmol/L, respectively.  The second highly 
sensitive group included FGF receptors (FGFR1 - 4), PDGFRα, and KIT with IC50 values between 10 and 
100 nmol/L, specifically 61, 27, 52, 43, 29, and 85 nmol/L, respectively.  All are typical pro-angiogenic 
and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs. 
Against VEGFR1 – 3 and FGFR1 – 3, IC50 values for lenvatinib were several-fold lower than those of 
sorafenib.  In particular, the IC50 of lenvatinib against FGFR4 was approximately 80-fold lower than that 
of sorafenib.  In contrast, the IC50 values for lenvatinib against PDGFRα, PDGFRβ and RAF1 were higher 
than those of sorafenib. In these assays, lenvatinib was more selective to VEGF receptors and FGF 
receptors and less selective to PDGF receptors and RAF1 compared to sorafenib. 
In regard to inhibition of PDGFR tyrosine kinases, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, the inhibitory activity of 
lenvatinib towards PDGFRβ was lower than that for PDGFRα.  A cell-free kinase inhibitory assay showed 
that IC50 values of lenvatinib for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were 29 and 160 nmol/L, respectively.  These 
values were about 10-fold and 53-fold higher, respectively, than that for VEGFR2 (3.0 nmol/L), indicating 
that the inhibition of PDGFRβ by lenvatinib is very weak. 
With regards to the FGFRs, as compared to the IC50 values for FGFR-1 (61 nmol/L or 31.9 ng/ml), FGFR-3 
(52 nmol/L or 27.2 ng/ml) and FGFR-4 (43 nmol/L or 22.5 ng/ml) the IC50 value for FGFR2 was 27 
nmol/L (14.1 ng/ml).  FGFR2 was more sensitive to inhibition by lenvatinib as compared to FGFR1, 3, 4. 
IC50 values for the inhibition of the 66 protein kinases tested with lenvatinib or sorafenib were grouped 
into the following ranges:  below 10 nmol/L, 10 – 100 nmol/L, 100 – 1000 nmol/L, 1000 – 
10,000 nmol/L, and above 10,000 nmol/L.  For lenvatinib, IC50 values in these ranges were observed 
against 5, 8, 16, 10, and 27 kinases, respectively.  For sorafenib, IC50 values in the same ranges were 
observed against 3, 11, 14, 12, and 26 kinases, respectively, suggesting that the kinase selectivity of 
lenvatinib is comparable to that of sorafenib. 
Kinase Inhibition Profiling Study 3 (Study No. W-20120815) 
This study determined the inhibition constants (Ki) for selected kinases. The Ki values were calculated 
using a Dixon Plot of the inhibition by lenvatinib (0.3 – 260 nmol/L) under 6 different concentrations of 
ATP.  Ki values of lenvatinib against VEGFR1, 2, and 3, and RET were approximately 1 nmol/L (1.3, 0.74, 
0.71, and 1.5 nmol/L, respectively).  Lenvatinib also inhibited other RTKs including FGFR1, 2, and 3, and 
KIT with Ki values of 22, 8.2, 15, and 11 nmol/L, respectively. The inhibition mode against these kinases 
was found to be competitive. 
Kinetic Interaction Analysis against VEGFR2 (Study No. W-20140526) 
This study determined the dissociation rate constant (koff = 1/ residence time), association rate constant 
(kon), and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = koff / kon) for VEGFR2. These values for the binding of 
lenvatinib and sorafenib against human recombinant protein of VEGFR2 including kinase domain 
(Leu834-Asn1162) were measured using a reporter displacement assay (Neumann, et al., 2011).  The Kd 
value for lenvatinib against VEGFR2 was 2.1 nmol/L, which is about 16 fold lower than that of sorafenib.  
This difference is due to the balance for koff and kon values of lenvatinib, which are about 3.8-fold and 
60-fold higher than for sorafenib, respectively. These results suggested that lenvatinib dissociated sooner 
from the target, but associated much more rapidly to the active site of VEGFR2, and the overall result was 
a superior binding affinity (based on a lower Kd value) to the target compared to sorafenib.

Crystal Structure of VEGFR2-Lenvatinib Complex (Study No. W-20140522) 
X-ray analysis for the crystal structure of the VEGFR2-lenvatinib complex showed that lenvatinib binds to 
both the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site and the neighboring allosteric region in the kinase 
domain adopting an “aspartic acid-phenylalanine-glycine (DFG)-in” configuration, suggesting a different 
binding mode compared to sorafenib. 
The amino acid residues located in the vicinity of lenvatinib or sorafenib with a maximum distance of 3.9 
Å were identified as those belonging to an ATP-binding site including a gate-keeper residue (common site 
for protein kinases), or the neighboring region, a non-conserved allosteric region (Traxler and Furet, 
1999).  Among the total of 25 amino acid residues, 16 residues were common for lenvatinib and sorafenib.  
Lenvatinib and sorafenib binded to the ATP-binding site at their common core from the urea group to the 
quinoline ring (lenvatinib) and pyridine (sorafenib). They binded to the neighboring allosteric region via 
the cyclopropane ring (lenvatinib) or the 4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl ring (sorafenib).  This 
suggested a strong hydrophobic interaction between the cyclopropane ring of lenvatinib and the phenyl 
ring of Phe1047.  Both compounds could exert their kinase inhibitory activity through binding to the 
ATP-binding site, while enhancing kinase selectivity through binding to the neighboring region (Liao, 
2007; Zuccotto, et al., 2010; McTigue, et al., 2012). 
Effects on VEGF-Driven VEGFR2 Phosphorylation, Proliferation, and Tube Formation in the HUVEC Model 
(Studies M03008, M03006, M03005, W-20100606)  
Four studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of lenvatinib on VEGF-driven cellular functions of 
HUVECs, which could be considered as in vitro angiogenesis models, specifically VEGFR2 phosphorylation, 
proliferation, and three-dimensional organization for tube formation.  
Lenvatinib inhibited VEGF-driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and tube formation in the 
HUVEC model in concentration-dependent manners (IC50HUVECphosphorylation=0.25 nM (0.11 ng/ml); 
IC50HUVECproliferation= 3.4 nM (1.28 ng/ml); IC50HUVECtube formation= 2.1 nM (0.90 ng/ml). In the 
fourth study (Study No. W-20100606) the effect of lenvatinib on HUVEC proliferation driven by both VEGF 
(20 ng/mL) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, a MET ligand [30 ng/mL]) was also studied.  Lenvatinib 
(0.3 – 300 nmol/L) showed a concentration dependent, but partial inhibition (approximately 60% at 300 
nmol/mL), as predicted by the kinase inhibitory profile in which lenvatinib strongly inhibited VEGFR2 but 
not MET.   
Effects of Lenvatinib Metabolites on VEGF-Driven Proliferation of HUVECs (Study No. M06002) 
Primary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib metabolites M1, M2, and M3 produced by liver 
microsomes were evaluated by measuring the inhibitory effects on VEGF-driven proliferation of HUVECs 
M1, M2, and M3 showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values of 57 nmol/L 
(95% confidence interval [CI]:  18 – 180), 250 nmol/L (95% CI:  240 – 270) and 230 nmol/L (95% CI:  
120 – 440), respectively, against the VEGF-driven proliferation of HUVECs, suggesting that VEGFR2 
inhibitory activities of M1, M2, and M3 were 6%, 1%, and 1%, respectively, of the activity of lenvatinib. 
Additional literature data 
Tohyama, et al. (2014) described the anti-proliferative activity of lenvatinib against 11 human thyroid 
cancer cell lines in vitro. Antiproliferative activity of lenvatinib was evaluated by using IC50 values and the 
ratios of the IC50 values of the thyroid cancer cell lines relative to that of Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Lenvatinib did 
not show the potent in vitro antiproliferative activity for 9 out of the 11 cell lines with IC50 values being 
greater than 10 
M. Lenvatinib did, however, showed antiproliferative activity against the human DTC 
𝜇𝜇
RO82-W-1 (= follicular TC cell line) and MTC TT cell lines (= medullary TC cell line), with IC50 values of 
3.8 µM (1622 ng/ml) and 0.078 µM (33 ng/ml), respectively; moreover, it was selective against these two 
DTC cell lines compared with normal thyroid cells (
/
 = 0.25 and 0.01, resp.). The results suggested that 
EMA/250082/2015

RTK signaling pathways may have roles in oncogenic proliferation of these two human thyroid cancer cells 
lines. 
Orally administered lenvatinib significantly inhibited tumour growth of 1 PTC (a major type of DTC), 4 FTC 
(another major type of DTC), 1 MTC, and 5 ATC xenografts in nude mice.  Lenvatinib inhibited tumour 
angiogenesis in 5DTC and 5ATC xenograft models as evidenced by a decrease in MVD.  
The results suggested the antitumor activity of lenvatinib against a broad panel of human thyroid cancer 
models can be primarily attributed to its anti-angiogenic effects. Okamoto, et al. (2013) evaluated the 
activity of lenvatinib in RET-gene fusion-driven in vitro assays.  It was showed that lenvatinib suppressed 
the growth of papillary thyroid CCDC6-RET, KIF5B-RET and NcoA4-RET cancer cell lines (CCDC6-RET and 
NcoA4-RET account for more than 90% of the RET  fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma). Lenvatinib 
inhibited oncogenic RET signaling in vitro at concentrations in the 30-100 nM (15.69-52.30 ng/ml) range. 
The results suggest that lenvatinib can exert antitumor activity against RET gene fusion driven tumour 
models by inihibiting oncogenic RET fusion signaling and thus directly inhibit transformed cell growth. In 
addition, the results showed that lenvatinib can directly inhibit transformed cell growth at therapeutically 
relevant plasma exposures.

K1 Human Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Xenograft Model in Athymic Mice (A10004 and M13012) 
Lenvatinib showed significant antitumor effects against K1 human papillary thyroid carcinoma xenograft 
model in athymic mice at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. The body weight loss (BWL) was within 10% (not 
severe) at all doses tested compared to the body weight at the initiation of dosing. 
In a second model, lenvatinib showed significant and dose-dependent antitumor effects at doses from 3 
to 100 mg/kg with a maximum effect giving a minimum mean T/C value of 16%, demonstrating

reproducible dose-dependent antitumor activity. In contrast, sorafenib showed significant antitumor 
effects at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg with higher minimum mean T/C values ranging from 47% to 35%, 
suggesting that the maximum antitumor effect of lenvatinib was greater than that of sorafenib in this 
model. 
RO82-W-1 Human Follicular Xenograft Model in Athymic Mice (M13013) 
Lenvatinib showed significant antitumor effects against RO82-W-1 human follicular thyroid carcinoma 
xenograft model in athymic mice (at doses from 1 to 100 mg/kg). The BWL was within 10% (not severe) 
at all doses tested compared to the body weight at the initiation of dosing (M13013). 
In a second model, dose dependency was observed for lenvatinib between 1 and 100 mg/kg with a 
maximum effect giving a minimum mean T/C value of 20%. In contrast, sorafenib showed significant 
antitumor effects at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg in this model with higher minimum mean T/C values ranging from 
55% to 38%, suggesting that the maximum antitumor effect of lenvatinib was greater than that of 
sorafenib in this model. 
8305C Human Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma Xenograft Model in Athymic Mice (M13003) 
Lenvatinib showed significant and dose-dependent antitumor effects against 8305C human anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma xenograft model in athymic miceat doses from 1 to 100 mg/kg without severe BWL. 
MVDs (microvessel density – analysed using immunohistochemistry staining for the endothelial marker, 
CD31) in the tumors were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Significant decreases in tumor MVD 
were observed at doses from 3 to 100 mg/kg. The good correlation of the antitumor effect with the 
decrease of tumor MVD suggested that lenvatinib exerted a significant antitumor effect through its 
antiangiogenesis activity. 
SW579 and TT Human Thyroid Carcinoma Xenograft Models in Athymic Mice (W-20120359) 
Lenvatinib showed a significant and dose-dependent antitumor effect against SW579 human 
thyroid-derived squamous cell carcinoma and TT human medullary thyroid xenograft models in athymic 
mice at doses of 3 to 100 mg/kg. Tumor regression, without severe BWL, was observed at 10 to 100 
mg/kg. 
Lenvatinib showed a significant and dose-dependent antitumor effect against the thyroid medullary 
carcinoma TT xenografts at doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg, with tumor regression observed at 100 mg/kg. 
Severe BWL was not observed at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg; however, lenvatinib at a dose of 100 mg/kg 
caused some BWL, with a mean relative body weight (RBW) value of 0.87 compared to the body weight 
at the initiation of dosing.  
Marked inhibition of RET autophosphorylation in the TT xenografts was observed at all doses at which 
lenvatinib exhibited antitumor activity. Since TT cells have a constitutively active mutant form of RET 
(C634W), which strongly drives the growth of the cells, this RET inhibition is postulated to contribute to 
the antitumor effect of lenvatinib against TT xenografts in this model. 
PLC/PRF/5 Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Xenograft Model in Athymic Mice (K08004) 
Lenvatinib showed significant antitumor effects against PLC/PRF/5 human HCC xenograft model in 
athymic mice at doses from 3 to 100 mg/kg. BWL was continuously observed in 5 of 6 mice in the vehicle 
control group resulting in a mean RBW value of 0.91 at Day 15 compared to the body weight at the 
initiation of dosing. This suggests that the BWL was likely a result of tumor burden (cachexia-like). This 
BWL was weakly enhanced at the high dose of lenvatinib (100 mg/kg), with a mean RBW value of 0.81. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 21/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Another experiment was performed to compare the antitumor effect of lenvatinib with that of sorafenib in 
the PLC/PRF/5 human HCC xenograft model in athymic mice. The results suggested that the maximum 
antitumor effect of lenvatinib was greater than that of sorafenib in this model. 
H460 Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Xenograft Model and Colo205 Human Colorectal Cancer 
Xenograft Model in Athymic Mice (M0312 & M030011) 
Also in the H460 Human NSCLC Xenograft Model and the Colo205 Human Colorectal Cancer Xenograft 
Model in Athymic Mice, lenvatinib showed antitumor effects at all doses without severe BWL. 
Effects of lenvatinib on plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 in mice (Study W-20140842) 
The effects of oral lenvatinib mesilate at 3 and 10 mg/kg and oral sorafenib tosylate at 9 and 30 mg/kg 
were examined against plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels 24 hours after the 
administration in mice.  
Lenvatinib mesilate significantly increased plasma FGF23 level at a dose of 10 mg/kg in mice. At a dose 
of 3 mg/kg, no significant elevation was seen as compared to controls. Taking into account the 96.28% 
protein binding in mice, the free Cmax in mice at 3 mg/kg = 3.72% of 1965.1 ng/ml = 73 ng/ml. This 
value corresponds to about 9 times the free Cmax in humans at therapeutic doses (7.9 ng/ml).  
Sorafenib tosylate at 9 and 30 mg/kg did not show significant elevation of plasma FGF23 levels. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The binding of lenvatinib to a panel of 50 non-kinase receptors known to play significant biological roles 
(ExpresSProfile) was evaluated in vitro at concentrations of 1 and 10 μmol/L. No significant binding 
(>50% inhibition) to any receptor of the ExpresSProfile was observed at the tested concentrations, 
except for the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (58%) and human norepinephrine transporter (50%) at 
10 μmol/L. 
It should be noted that at therapeutic dose levels of 24 mg/day, total Cmax amounted to 573 ng/ml. 
Taking  into  account  98.62%  protein  binding,  free  Cmax  attained  7.9  ng/ml.  As  such  no  secondary 
pharmacodynamic effects are expected. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of lenvatinib was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies.

Central Nervous system 
Lenvatinib (E7080) at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, was administered orally, by gavage, as a single dose to 
conscious male Sprague-Dawley IGS rats to evaluate the effects of the drug on the central nervous 
system using Irwin’s method. E7080, up to 100 mg/kg, showed no effects on general physical condition 
and behaviour in rats. 
Cardiovascular system 
Two in vitro electrophysiology studies were conducted to assess the effect of lenvatinib on  the human 
ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) tail current recorded from stably transfected HEK293 cells (whole-cell 
patch-clamp method) or action potential parameters in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle (glass 
microelectrode method).  
In the first study, lenvatinib inhibited hERG tail current in a concentration-dependent manner with a 
statistically significant inhibition of tail current observed at concentrations of 10 and 30 µM. Lenvatinib 
inhibited hERG tail current in a concentration-dependent manner, with 25%, 50%, and 75% inhibitory 
concentration values of 5.13, 11.89 (= 6.2 µg/ml), and 25.70 μmol/L, respectively. 
In the second in vitro study, lenvatinib, at 1 and 10 µmol/L (100 µM could not be dissolved), showed no 
significant effect on the action potential parameters (Resting membrane potential (RMP), action potential 
amplitude (APA), maximal upstroke velocity of depolarization (V max), and action potential duration at 
50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization) in isolated papillary muscles of guinea-pigs. 
Lenvatinib was administered orally, by gavage, as a single dose to conscious male and female beagle dogs 
at doses of 6 and 30 mg/kg to evaluate the effects on the cardiovascular system, and on body 
temperature. E7080 at 6 and 30 mg/kg (~ 30x20/37x70kg=1135 mg  HRD = 24 mg/d) had no 
significant effects on heart rate, mean blood pressure, ECGs (including QT), or body temperature except 
for a minimal increase in mean blood pressure within the normal biologic range. 
The lack of effect on ECG parameters in the in vivo study and the weak inhibitory effects of lenvatinib in 
the hERG assay (IC50 = 11.89 μmol/L or 6,2 µg/ml) at a concentration approximately 10-fold higher than 
the total maximum observed concentration (Cmax) at the clinical dose of 25 mg (0.544718 μg/mL from 
Day 1 of Cycle 2 in Study E7080-E044-101) and 785-fold higher than the free Cmax at the human 
therapeutic dose, suggest that lenvatinib has a low potential to cause QT prolongation.  
Respiratory System 
The effects of a single oral dose of lenvatinib mesilate (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg) on respiratory function 
(respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume) in conscious SD rats were evaluated using 
unrestrained whole body plethysmography. Lenvatinib at doses up to 100 mg/kg 
(~100x6/37x70kg=1135 mg) showed no effects on respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume in 
rats.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted which was considered acceptable by 
CHMP.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lenvatinib was evaluated by in vivo studies with athymic mice (BALB/c 
AnNCrj-nu/nu), Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The strains and 
species evaluated were those used in pharmacology and toxicity studies. For assessments of metabolic 
characteristics, in vitro studies using hepatocytes, recombinant metabolic enzymes, liver microsomes or 
other subcellular fractions of the liver were also conducted. 
Method 
A method using HPLC with UV detection was validated for quantification of lenvatinib in plasma samples 
of mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. In these validation studies, plasma concentration of 
lenvatinib was expressed in terms of the mesilate salt.  Radiolabeled lenvatinib mesilate ([14C] lenvatinib 
mesilate and [14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate) were synthesized to conduct mass balance and metabolite 
identification studies. The concentration of radioactivity derived from carbon 14 in the blood, plasma, 
tissues, urine, bile, and faeces was determined by LSC with external standard method.  The concentration 
of radioactivity was expressed as the equivalent of lenvatinib mesilate (µg eq./mL or g). 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of lenvatinib in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys were 
characterized by a low total plasma clearance (100.2 – 368.3 mL/h/kg) and a small to moderate volume 
of distribution (391.5 – 1610.0 mL/kg). The terminal elimination phase half-life after intravenous 
administration was 2.05 to 5.27 hours. After oral administration of lenvatinib mesilate at 3 mg/kg as a 
solution, lenvatinib was absorbed rapidly and had absolute bioavailability in mice (64.4%), rats (68.7%), 
dogs (70.4%), and monkeys (78.4%).

Doses and plasma concentrations for lenvatinib were expressed as those of the mesilate salt, and related parameters 
were calculated.  In mice, each parameter except t max was calculated with the average concentration of 3 animals, 
and in other species, each value except t max represents the mean of 4 animals.  The t max represents the mode value, 
except for mice.  F was calculated using the formula: AUC (0-inf) in oral dosing / AUC (0-inf) in intravenous dosing × 100. 
AUC (0-inf) = area under the concentration-time curve from zero time extrapolated to infinite time, CL p = total plasma 
clearance, C max = maximum observed concentration, F = absolute bioavailability, IV = intravenous, NA = not 
applicable, NC = not calculated, PO = oral, SD = Sprague Dawley, t 1/2 = terminal elimination phase half-life, t max = 
time at which the highest drug concentration occurs, V ss = volume of distribution at steady state. 
a:  Lenvatinib mesilate was administered as solution in all administration groups.

Source:  Study Nos. B03014 (mouse), B03015 (rat), B03016 (dog), and B04003 (monkey). 
Overall, repeated-dose toxicokinetic studies of lenvatinib in male and female rats, dogs, and cynomolgus 
monkeys conducted with once daily oral doses for up to 26, 4, and 39 weeks, respectively, indicated no 
systemic accumulation of lenvatinib in the toxicology studies.  Systemic exposures in males and females 
were generally comparable in each species. With the exception of rats, systemic exposure of lenvatinib 
was not affected by repeated administration in these species. In dogs at doses < 30 mg/kg, the systemic 
exposure generally increased in a dose-proportional manner. The systemic exposure increased in a less 
than dose-proportional manner at higher dose levels in rats (>10 mg/kg). In contrast, in monkeys, 
systemic exposure increased in a more than a dose-proportional manner at low dose levels (0.1 – 3 
mg/kg). Unlike the rat or the monkey, the systemic exposure in humans increased in a dose-proportional 
manner (see clinical pharmacokinetics section). 
Distribution

Tissue distribution of radioactivity was investigated after a single oral administration of 14C-lenvatinib 
mesilate (3 mg/kg) to male SD rats and male cynomolgus monkeys and after a single oral administration 
of 14C-CB-lenvatinib mesilate (3 mg/kg) to male cynomolgus monkeys. 
In rats, the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found at 0.5 hours postdose (Tmax) in most 
tissues (the small intestine, liver, adrenal gland, and stomach showed concentrations 1.19 to 2.59 times 
higher than that in plasma), and decreased almost in parallel with that in blood. Elimination half-life was 
1.9 days. 
In monkeys, the highest concentrations of 14C-lenvatinib-radioactivity were found at 4 hours postdose 
(Tmax) in the bile in gall bladder, being 556.73 times that in the plasma. The mean concentrations of 
radioactivity in the urine in bladder, gall bladder, liver, choroid, ciliary body, and renal cortex were next 
highest, being 57.85-10.11 times that in the plasma. At 24 hr postdose, the choroid, iris, large intestine, 
sclera, cornea, and lens reached their maxima.  
The mean concentrations of radioactivity in many tissues decreased almost in parallel with that in the 
plasma. Elimination half-life was 3.43 days. 
In monkeys, the highest concentrations of 14C-CB-lenvatinib-radioactivity were found at 2 hours 
postdose (Tmax). The radioactive concentrations in the bile in gall bladder and urine in bladder were the 
highest, being 33.59 and 24.55 times those in the plasma, respectively. The radioactive concentrations in 
the choroid and liver were the next highest, being 7.14 and 7.02 times those in the plasma, respectively. 
The radioactive concentrations in the gall bladder, iris, renal cortex, kidney, ciliary body, renal medulla, 
and lung were 3.28 to 1.49 times those in the plasma. The radioactive concentration in the central 
nervous system was 0.07 times or lower than that in the plasma. Elimination half-life was 3.70 days. 
Protein Binding and Distribution in Blood Cells 
The plasma protein binding of lenvatinib mesilate (0.3 to 30 μg/mL) in athymic mice, SD rats, beagle 
dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans was determined by equilibrium dialysis in vitro (Study No. 
B09009). Incubation was conducted for 72 hours at 37 °C. Among the species tested, lenvatinib exhibited 
the highest plasma protein binding in human, independent of concentrations (97.87% to 98.62%), 
followed by rat (97.70% to 98.20%), athymic mouse (96.28% to 96.92%), monkey (95.90% to 
96.17%), and dog (89.71% to 91.75%). 
To assess the specific proteins that bind lenvatinib in human plasma, protein binding of lenvatinib 
mesilate (0.3 to 30 μg/mL) to albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and γ-globulin was determined by 
equilibrium dialysis in vitro (Study No. B09011). Lenvatinib mainly bound to albumin, and the 
contribution of α1-acid glycoprotein and γ-globulin to lenvatinib protein binding was minor in human 
plasma. Based on the results at the lowest lenvatinib mesilate concentration tested (0.3 μg/mL), the 
contributions of albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and γ-globulin to the human plasma protein binding of 
lenvatinib were estimated to be 93.2%, 6.1%, and 0.7%, respectively. 
Blood to plasma concentration ratios (Rb) of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate (0.1 to 10 μg/mL) in athymic mice, 
SD rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans were determined in vitro after a 30-minute 
incubation at 37 °C. A species difference in the Rb of 14C-lenvatinib was observed, and ranked from 
highest to lowest as follows: dog > monkey = mouse ≥ rat > human. The Rb values in animals declined 
with increasing concentration; however, in human, the Rb was constant between 0.1 and 10 μg/mL. 
The in vitro transfer ratios of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate to blood cell were 23.1%, 22.1%, and 18.8% in the 
mouse; 8.86%, 7.59%, and 4.36% in the rat; 51.4%, 44.3%, and 42.1% in the dog; 29.7%, 21.9%, and 
18.3% in the monkey; and 17.2%, 14.5%, and 14.8% in the human at the spiked 14C- lenvatinib 
mesilate blood concentration of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 26/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
As for the stability of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate in the blood, the radiochemical purity declined in the dog 
blood. The decreased rate was low as approximately 10%, but taking account of dog showing higher Rb 
than other species, it could not be fully excluded that decomposed 14C-lenvatinib mesilate in dog blood 
may be distributed to blood cells more than unchanged 14C-E7080. 
Placental transfer studies 
Placental transfer was investigated after a single oral administration of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate (3 mg/kg) 
to pregnant rats (Study No. AE-6750-G). On Days 13 and 18 of pregnancy, the concentrations of 
radioactivity in fetuses were low, and were 2% or less of the concentration in maternal plasma at 0.5 
hours post-dose, the first sampling time point. The distribution of radioactivity for each foetus was 0.02% 
or less of the dosed radioactivity.  
Placental transfer of lenvatinib mesilate in rats (on day 13 and 18 of pregnancy) was low (2% or less of 
the concentration in maternal plasma). 
Metabolism 
In vitro and in vivo studies using lenvatinib, [14C] lenvatinib, or [14C]CB-lenvatinib were conducted to 
determine the metabolic profile of lenvatinib. 
Lenvatinib mesilate (final concentration: 10 μg/mL) was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes in mouse, rat, 
dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes (protein concentration: 1 mg/mL) with or without the reduced 
form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and the reaction mixtures were analyzed 
by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to investigate the in vitro metabolism 
of lenvatinib (Study No. B03025). 
8 metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M8) were detected in at least one animal species as well 
as in human liver microsomes. M1, M2, and M3 were identified as decyclopropylated, demethylated, and 
N-oxidated forms of lenvatinib, respectively. M1 could be a chemical (or non-enzymatic) degradation 
product, as M1 was detected in lenvatinib solution and in the incubation mixtures without microsomes or 
NADPH. M4 was proposed as a hydroxylated form at the cyclopropyl group of lenvatinib, M5 was proposed 
as the quinoline form, formed by O-dearylation, M6 was proposed as a form hydroxylated at the 
cyclopropyl group of M2, M7 was proposed as a form doubly hydroxylated at cyclopropyl group, and M8 
was proposed as the N-oxidated form of M2. 
Six metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M7) were common among the species tested. M6 and M8 were 
detected in monkey and human liver microsomes but not in mouse, rat, and dog liver microsomes. In the 
human liver microsomes, M2 appeared to be a major metabolite. All metabolites in human liver 
microsomes were also qualitatively represented in monkey liver microsomes. Six metabolites out of eight 
(M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M7) were also detected in rat liver microsomes.  
To determine the CYP-mediated metabolism of lenvatinib in humans in vitro, lenvatinib was incubated 
with recombinant human CYPs. CYP3A4 was the predominant (≥80%) isoform contributing to the 
CYP-dependent metabolism of lenvatinib in humans in vitro over the concentration range of 
0.005 to 10 µg/mL, followed by CYP1A2 (2.4% to 7.6%) and CYP2B6 (3.0% to 6.7%). To further 
evaluate CYP isoforms responsible for the CYP-dependent metabolism of lenvatinib, the effects of CYP 
isoform-specific inhibitors on lenvatinib metabolism were also assessed in HLMs. The results obtained 
further showed that CYP3A4 was a major CYP isoform involved in the CYP-dependent metabolism of 
lenvatinib in HLM. 
In addition, aldehyde oxidase (AO) contributes to the formation of M2´ and M3’, the major metabolites in 
human feces.

To clarify the metabolic profiles of lenvatinib in vivo, the metabolites after oral administration of 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to rats and a single monkey at 30 mg/kg were investigated (Study No. B10006). 
In this study, 36 radioactive components in total were found in rat and monkey samples, and were 
assigned serial numbers with the prefix “Met” (Met 1 to Met 36). Based on comparisons of retention times 
and mass spectral data with the corresponding references, Met 14 (me37), Met 28 (me88), Met 32-1 
(me107), Met 33 (me114), and Met 35 (me116) were identified as M5, M1, M3, M2, and lenvatinib, 
respectively.  
In addition to oxidative metabolism, one of the major metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in the rat and 
monkey appeared to be glutathione conjugation at the quinoline moiety, and 15 glutathione 
conjugation-related metabolites including Met 12 (me36) and Met 15 (me40) were detected in this study. 
Three metabolites were isolated from monkey urine samples, and their chemical structures were 
determined by NMR to be Met 13 (me33) further oxidized from Met 12 (me36), Met 16 (me45) dimerized 
of Met 21 (me47), and Met 20 (me49) conjugated from Met 21 (me47) and Met 19-2 (me44) forming 
disulfide, respectively (Study No. C10320). 
The metabolic profiles of lenvatinib were further investigated following single oral administrations of 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to male rats and monkeys at 3 mg/kg (Study No. AE-6748-G). Plasma, liver, 
kidney, urine, feces, and bile were collected and subjected to metabolite analyses using LC/MS(MSn). In 
this study, 41 radioactive peaks on HPLC radiochromatograms were found in rat and monkey samples, 
and the metabolites were assigned serial numbers with the prefix “m” (m1 to m41). 
In these in vivo studies, the presence of the oxidized human metabolites, M1 (me88), M2 (me114), M3 
(me107),  M5  (me37),  M2´(me118),  and  M3´(me115)  were  confirmed  by  LC/MS  analysis  of  rat  or 
monkey  samples  after  single  oral  administrations  of  lenvatinib.  An  additional study  was  conducted  to 
clarify the metabolic profile of lenvatinib in monkeys using  14C-labeled lenvatinib radio-labeled on the 
chlorobenzene moiety. After a single oral dose of 14C-CB-lenvatinib at 3 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys, 
radioactive components in biological samples were analyzed. More than 90% of plasma radioactivity was 
extracted  with  methanol,  and  major  component  in  plasma  was  lenvatinib.  Unchanged  lenvatinib  was 
found in bile and feces but not in urine. The main primary metabolic pathway of lenvatinib was indicated 
to be the cleavage of O-aryl bond to form mCB31 (ER-236273), and further biotransformations of mCB31 
(conjugate  with  glucuronic  acid,  sulfuric  acid,  glutathione,  and  N-acetyl  glucosamine  with  or  without 
hydroxylation) were confirmed, resulted in forming many kinds of metabolites. 
Excretion 
After oral administration of [14C] lenvatinib mesilate to rats and cynomolgus monkeys or 
[14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate to monkeys, greater than or equal to 90% of the radioactive dose was 
recovered in the excreta by 168 hours post-dose. In rats, fecal excretion via bile was the main route of 
excretion, while in monkeys fecal and urinary excretion was a major excretion route of radioactivity after 
dosing of [14C]lenvatinib mesilate and [14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate, respectively. These results indicated 
that metabolites derived from the quinoline moiety were excreted mainly in the feces, and those from the 
chlorobenzyl moiety were excreted primarily in the urine.

The excretion of radioactivity into milk was investigated after a single oral administration of 3 mg/kg 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to lactating SD rats (Study No. AE-6750-G). The concentration of radioactivity in 
milk was higher than that in plasma, indicating a relatively high transfer of lenvatinib into milk. However, 
the concentration of radioactivity in milk decreased rapidly with a similar time profile as that in plasma, 
suggesting no tendency for lenvatinib to remain in milk for a long period. 
Pharmacokinetics drug interactions 
The induction of CYPs, UGTs, and P-gp by lenvatinib was evaluated in vitro (Study Nos. XT063020 and 
XT103078). Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 3 μmol/L lenvatinib had a tendency to 
slightly increase CYP3A but had no effect on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and P-gp did not induce CYP2B6, 
UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 enzyme activities or mRNA expressions.  
Additionally, the inhibition of CYPs and UGTs by lenvatinib was studied in vitro (Study Nos. B03023, 
PK-Test-0072, PK-Test-0040, PK-Test-0079, and XT105084). Lenvatinib mesilate (100 µmol/L) weakly 
inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Lenvatinib showed virtually no 
inhibitory effects on CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Lenvatinib exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 (IC50 
= 10.1 µmol/L) and a weak inhibitory effect on CYP3A (IC50: approximately 100 µmol/L) in human liver 
microsomes. 
The potential inhibitory activity of lenvatinib mesilate (0.03 to 30 μmol/L) on UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, 
UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) was assessed in HLM using UGT isoform specific substrates. Lenvatinib 
inhibited UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 with IC50 values of 10.6 and 14.0 μmol/L, respectively.  Lenvatinib weakly 
inhibited UGT1A9, with 31.9% inhibition observed at 30 μmol/L; however, the IC50 value for this enzyme 
was greater than 30.0 μmol/L.  There was little or no evidence of inhibition of UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 by 
lenvatinib. 
A series of in vitro studies was conducted to assess the substrate recognition and inhibitory activity of 
lenvatinib on the known human transporters, including P-gp, BCRP, OATPs, OATs, OCTs, and BSEP.  
The roles of P-gp in mediating the membrane permeability of [14C]lenvatinib and the potential inhibition 
of P-gp-mediated [3H]digoxin transport by lenvatinib were assessed using human P-gp expressing and 
control LLC-PK1 cell monolayers (Study No. GE-0556-G). These results demonstrated that lenvatinib was 
a substrate for P-gp. Lenvatinib weakly inhibited P-gp-mediated transport, and the IC50 for the inhibition 
of [3H]digoxin transport mediated by P-gp was estimated to be more than 30 μmol/L. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 29/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  potential  of  [14C]lenvatinib  to  serve  as  a  substrate  for  BCRP  and  the  potential  inhibition  of 
BCRP-mediated [3H]prazosin transport by lenvatinib were assessed using human BCRP expressing and 
control LLC-PK1 cell monolayers (Study No. GE-0791-G). In this study, it was shown that lenvatinib was 
a BCRP substrate and it weakly inhibited BCRP-mediated transport (IC50 > 30 µmol/L). 
To assess whether lenvatinib is a substrate or inhibitor for OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, 
the transport of lenvatinib and inhibition of the various transporters by lenvatinib were examined using 
specific transporter expressing cells (Study No. GE-0791-G). These results indicated that lenvatinib was 
not a substrate of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. The inhibition of these transporters by 
lenvatinib was evaluated by assessing the inhibition of cellular uptake of radiolabeled typical substrates 
for  each  transporter.  Lenvatinib  showed  concentration-dependent  inhibitory  effects  on  OAT1,  OAT3, 
OCT2, and OATP1B1 with the IC50 values of 7.36, 4.11, 10.8, and 7.29 μmol/L, respectively, and minimal 
or no inhibitory effect on OATP1B3 (IC50 >30 μmol/L). 
The potential for [14C]lenvatinib to be a substrate for OCT1 and BSEP, and the potential of lenvatinib to 
inhibit these transporters were assessed using OCT1 expressing HEK293 cells and BSEP expressing closed 
inside-out vesicles (Study No. GE-0942-G), respectively. Lenvatinib was not a substrate for OCT1 and 
BSEP.  Lenvatinib  showed  concentration-dependent  inhibitory  effects  on  OCT1-  and  BSEP-mediated 
uptake of each respective radiolabeled typical substrate with IC50 values of 14.9 and 14.2 μmol/L. 
In Study No DMPKT2012-004, the potential inhibition of human AO activity by lenvatinib and its 
metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M2´, M3´, and M5) was evaluated using human liver cytosol. AO specific 
activity was assessed using phthalazine, known to be a substrate of AO, by measuring the concentration 
of its metabolite, phthalazone, with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS). Lenvatinib did not inhibit AO activity (IC50 >100 μmol/L).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations, 
and designed in accordance with the relevant guidelines.  
Single dose toxicity 
The single dose toxicity of lenvatinib was evaluated in oral single-dose toxicity studies in rats, followed by 
a 4-day or 4-week observation period, and in dose escalation studies in dogs and monkeys. 
Table 5: Overview of single dose toxicity studies with lenvatinib mesilate

Rats 
In both the oral dose range-finding (DRF) toxicity study (Study No. TKB02006) and the GLP-compliant 
single-dose oral toxicity study (Study No. S04094) lenvatinib mesilate was suspended with 75% 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 aqueous solution and administered as a single oral dose, by gavage, to 
male and female SD rats (3 animals/sex/group in the DRF, 5 animals/sex/group in the GLP compliant 
study) (vehicle control, 75% PEG 400 aqueous solution). In the DRF study, at 1000 mg/kg, decreased 
food consumption was observed in males, and red spots in the stomach were observed macroscopically in 
both males and females. Watery contents in the small intestine were observed in 1 female rat at 1000 
mg/kg. No abnormalities were observed in any rats administered 100 or 300 mg/kg. 
In the GLP-compliant study, a 4-week observation period was included. Delayed deaths (observed from 
Day 14 onward) were observed in 3 animals administered 1000 or 2000 mg/kg. In these animals, 
decreased activity, hypothermia, staining of the nose region, chromaturia (reddish urine), or 
discoloration of the eyeball were observed before death. At necropsy, dilatation, mucosal thickening, and 
red focus were observed in the stomach and duodenum. In addition, agglomeration of food and test 
article was found in the stomach or occluded the duodenum. Similar GI changes were observed in 
surviving animals at 1000 or 2000 mg/kg. White discoloration of incisors, decreased food consumption, 
and subsequent suppression of body weight gain were observed in these groups. No test article related 
changes were observed at the dose of 500 mg/kg. 
Dogs 
Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally in gelatin capsules, as a single dose, to 1 male and 1 female 
beagle dog in a dose escalation study (Study No. TKB02022). Each dog received single doses of 100, 300, 
or 1000 mg/kg as a 3-fold trituration with lactose with an interval of 1 week between doses in a dose 
escalation manner. 
There  were  no  deaths.  No  toxicologically  significant  changes  in  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  or  food 
consumption were observed in the dogs orally administered doses up to 300 mg/kg. At 1000 mg/kg, the 
female dog showed vomiting immediately after administration. 
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from zero time to 
24 hours (AUC(0-24)) values increased with dose escalation from 100 to 300 mg/kg. Cmax and 
AUC(0-24) values at 1000 mg/kg were lower than those at 300 mg/kg. 
Monkeys 
Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally by gavage, as a single dose, to 2 male cynomolgus monkeys 
at doses of 0 (vehicle control, 75% PEG 400 aqueous solution, 30, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg with an 
interval of 1 day between each dose in a dose escalation study (Study No. S03060). Both animals were 
necropsied after completion of the observation period following the final administration. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 31/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
There were no deaths. No abnormal clinical signs were induced by lenvatinib treatment except for watery 
stool, which was also present following dosing with the vehicle. One male showed decreased food 
consumption after administration of 300 mg/kg and higher. Macroscopically, abnormal materials in the 
stomach and watery contents in the small and large intestine were observed in both animals treated with 
lenvatinib, while red spots in the stomach were only observed in 1 animal. 
Cmax and AUC(0-24) values at 30 mg/kg were 13.31 μg/mL and 95.19 μg·h/mL, respectively. The 
plasma concentration of lenvatinib 2 hours after administration did not increase proportionally with 
administered dose between 100 and 1000 mg/kg.

Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with the ICH S9 guideline which states that carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to 
support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, no study evaluating 
the carcinogenic potential of lenvatinib was submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In accordance with the ICH S9 guideline, the reproduction and developmental toxicity assessment for 
lenvatinib is comprised of only EFD studies in both rats and rabbit. Because lenvatinib was teratogenic in 
the rat and rabbit EFD studies, fertility and early embryonic development studies, and pre- and postnatal 
development toxicity studies were not conducted.

A 2-week dose range finding study in juvenile rats 
In order to determine the dosing regimen and the dose levels for the pivotal study in juvenile rats, a 
2-week dose range-finding study was conducted with 2 phases. Lenvatinib mesilate was administered

orally, by gavage, once daily for 2 weeks to male and female SD rats (5 animals/group/sex) at doses of 
0 (vehicle control, water for injection), 0.2, 0.4, 1, or 5 mg/kg from postnatal day (PND) 7 (Phase 1) or 
at doses of 0, 0.4, 1, 5, 25 mg/kg from PND21 (Phase 2). 
Cmax and AUC(0-24) increased dose-proportionally, and there were no biologically significant differences 
in systemic exposure between males and females. Following repeated administration, the systemic 
exposure on Day 14 was relatively lower than on Day 1; however, these differences were not considered 
biologically significant by the applicant.  
An overview of the findings including toxicokinetics (as mean values of male and female data) is

In phase I, the lowest dose of 0.2 mg/kg can be considered as the NOAEL, while in phase II, the dose of 
1 mg/kg was considered to be NOEL. 
In summary, toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in PND7 juvenile rats than PND21 rats. Lenvatinib 
mesilate at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher were lethal in PND7 animals while no death was observed up to 
25 mg/kg in PND21 animals. 
An 8-week toxicity study in juvenile rats 
Because of the severe toxicities observed in the DRF when dosing the animals from PND7, the pivotal 
study was conducted with animals of the age of PND 21. Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally by 
gavage once a day for 8 weeks to male and female SD rats (10 animals/group/sex) from PND 21 at doses 
of 0 (vehicle control, water for injection), 0.4, 2, or 10 mg/kg. 
The Cmax and AUC(0-24) were increased proportionally. No gender difference and no effect of repeated 
dosing  on  Cmax  and  AUC(0-24)  was  observed.  Differences  in  systemic  exposure  observed  following 
repeated administration were not considered biologically significant by the applicant.

Toxicokinetic data 
Rats 
The median time at which the highest drug concentration occurred (tmax) was between 0.25 and 1.5 
hours  after  administration.  No  apparent  gender  difference  was  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetic 
parameters. The Cmax and AUC(0-24) of lenvatinib increased approximately dose-proportionally from 0.4 
to  10  mg/kg  on  Days  1  and  181  (149)  in  males  and  females,  respectively.  The  pharmacokinetic 
parameters of lenvatinib were not significantly affected by repeated administration, except at doses of 30 
mg/kg and above, the mean systemic exposure decreased after a 4-week administration. 
Dogs 
The median tmax was 2 hours after dosing. The mean Cmax and AUC(0-24)  of lenvatinib increased dose 
proportionally from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg. No difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed 
between males and females in any dosing group. No apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters as 
a result of repeated administration for 4 weeks were observed in males. 
Monkeys 
The median tmax values were between 1 and 4 hours after administration. No apparent gender difference 
in Cmax or AUC(0-24)  was observed. The mean Cmax and AUC(0-24) generally increased in a more than 
dose-proportional manner from 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg in males and females on Day 1. There were no 
significant changes in Cmax or AUC(0-24) after repeated administration for up to 39 weeks.

Local Tolerance  
Specific local tolerance studies for lenvatinib have not been conducted. Local tolerance of lenvatinib was 
assessed by examination of the GI tissues from oral administration studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
An in vitro 33 NRU phototoxicity study was conducted (Study No. SBL038-070) to assess the phototoxic 
potential of lenvatinib because lenvatinib absorbs light within the range of 290 to 700 nm, and has an 
affinity to melanin based on the slow elimination of radioactivity in the tissues containing melanin. These 
results showed that lenvatinib had no phototoxic potential under the conditions employed in the in vitro 
3T3 NRU phototoxicity test.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lenvatinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases.  The most sensitive 
kinases for lenvatinib included VEGFR (1, 2, and 3), RET, FGFR (1, 2, 3, and 4), PDGFRα, and KIT. The 
precise mechanism of action of lenvatinib is not elucidated, but it has shown mainly antiangiogenic 
properties in vitro and in vivo, and direct inhibition of tumour growth was also observed in in vitro models. 
(see SmPC section 5.1). 
It should be noted that at therapeutic dose levels of 24 mg/day, total Cmax amounted to 573 ng/ml. Taking 
into account 98.62% protein binding, free Cmax attained 7.9 ng/ml. As such IC50 levels for 
antiproliferative effects on medullary and follicular thyroid cancer cell lines are 4.2- to 205-fold higher 
than the free plasma concentrations at human therapeutic dose levels.  The antitumor activity in vitro of 
RET-gene fusion driven tumour models occurs at plasma exposures 2- to 7-fold above free plasma 
concentrations at therapeutic dose levels. As such the anti-tumour effect of lenvatinib is considered to be 
primarily due to its anti-angiogenic action and where relevant to its inhibition of oncogenic RET fusion 
signaling and thus direct inhibiton of tumour growth. Limited effects on FGFR1-4 are expected. 
Regarding the potential secondary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib, no significant binding (greater 
than 50% inhibition) of lenvatinib to any of the 50 receptors was observed at the tested concentrations 
with the exception of binding to the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1B (58%) and human 
norepinephrine (noradrenalin) transporter (50%) at 10 μmol/L (5.2 µg/ml).  These are not considered 
relevant at human therapeutic dose levels. 
Results of the non-clinical safety pharmacology studies suggest that lenvatinib has a low potential for 
exerting adverse effects on the CNS, cardiovascular system, or the respiratory system. The lack of effect 
on ECG parameters in the in vivo study and the weak inhibitory effects of lenvatinib in the hERG assay at 
a concentration approximately 10-fold higher than the total maximum observed concentration (Cmax) at 
the  clinical  dose  of  25  mg  (0.544718  μg/mL  from  Day  1  of  Cycle  2  in  Study  E7080-E044-101)  and 
785-fold  higher  than  the  free  Cmax  at  the  human  therapeutic  dose,  suggest  that  lenvatinib  has  a  low 
potential to cause QT prolongation. No significant effects on heart rate and mean blood pressure were 
noted in the in vivo study in dogs. However, hypertension is an identified risk associated with clinical use 
of lenvatinib and other inhibitors of the VEGF/VEGFR pathway (see RMP). Furthermore, in the lenvatinib 
clinical studies, there was a numerically higher incidence of QTc-prolongation events with lenvatinib in 
patients with advanced malignancy and associated complications (see clinical safety section).  
In human liver microsomes, M2 (me114, demethylated form of lenvatinib) was identified as the major 
metabolite  and  CYP3A4  was  the  predominant  enzyme  ( ≥ 80%)  involved  in  the  CYP-dependent 
metabolism of lenvatinib. Major metabolic pathways in rats and monkeys are suggested to be oxidation 
by CYP and aldehyde oxidase (AO), and conjugation by glutathione. These pathways are qualitatively the 
same in humans. Quantitative comparisons between species have not been discussed. However as can be 
concluded from the mass balance study of [14]C-Lenvatinib in Humans (E7080-E044-104), the identified 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 43/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
human metabolites are limited to small percentages, with the so-called major metabolite M2 accounting 
for 4.76% in feces and 0.133% in urine (and around the limit of quantification in plasma (<1 ng/mL)).  
The contribution of lenvatinib metabolites to the overall pharmacological activity is considered negligible.  
Lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk with concentrations being higher than those in 
plasma. It is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk (see SmPC section 5.3).  Excretion 
of  lenvatinib  in  milk  is  addressed  in  the  RMP.  A  risk  to  newborns  or  infants  cannot  be  excluded  and, 
therefore, lenvatinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 4.3). 
Regarding drug-drug interaction potential, lenvatinib showed minimal (CYP3A) or no induction potency on 
CYPs, UGTs and P-gp up to 3 µmol/L in human hepatocytes. 
For intestinal enzymes induction, the studied exposure range of lenvatinib (0.3 µmol/L, 1µmol/L and 
3µmol/L) proposed in study n°XT063020 do not to cover the maximum concentration according to the 
guideline on the investigation of drug interactions. Additional physiologically based PK (PBPK) simulations 
to investigate the DDI risk for lenvatinib and the CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam, where all inhibition 
effects were disabled, and only the effect of induction was kept, was conducted. However, the in vitro data 
on the potential induction, in particular induction of CYP 3A4 in the intestine, are not considered sufficient. 
In this context, an in vivo study with midazolam as a probe substrate for CYP3A4 should be provided 
post-marketing (see clinical pharmacokinetics and RMP) to investigate adequately the potential of 
lenvatinib for CYP3A4 induction. In vitro data that could generate a better estimate of the induction 
activity of lenvatinib could be provided concomitantly.   
All IC50 values for CYPs, UGTs, AO, and transporters were more than 1 μmol/L, and thus, the potential for 
clinical DDI of lenvatinib by inhibition of these drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in liver 
and kidney is considered to be low. 
In  addition,  two  clinical  drug-drug  interactions  studies  were  conducted  (Study  E7080-A001-004  and 
study E7080-A001-007) in which it was shown that the impact of ketoconazole (CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor) 
on  lenvatinib  human  PK  was  small  and  that  repeated  administration  of  rifampicin  (CYP3A4/P-gp 
induction) did not lead to clinically relevant interaction (see clinical pharmacokinetics); thus indicating 
that the potential for drug-drug interactions of lenvatinib via CYP3A and P-gp as a victim was low. 
Toxicology 
Repeated oral administration of lenvatinib to SD rats (up to 26 weeks), beagle dogs (up to 4 weeks), and 
cynomolgus monkeys (up to 39 weeks) resulted, at clinically relevant exposures, in toxicological changes 
in  various  organs  and  tissues  related  to  the  expected  pharmacologic  effects  of  lenvatinib  including 
glomerulopathy,  testicular  hypocellularity,  ovarian  follicular  atresia,  gastrointestinal  changes,  bone 
changes,  changes  to  the  adrenals  (rats  and  dogs),  and  arterial  (arterial  fibrinoid  necrosis,  medial 
degeneration, or haemorrhage) lesions in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys.  Elevated transaminase 
levels asociated with signs of hepatotoxicity, were also observed in rats, dogs and monkeys.  Reversibility 
of the toxicologic changes was observed at the end of a 4-week recovery period in all animal species 
investigated (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Soft  stool  and  watery  stool  were  observed  as  GI  effects  in  rats,  dogs,  and  monkeys  and  were 
accompanied with histopathologic changes including hemorrhage, inflammation, ulcer, mucosal atrophy, 
submucosal edema and crypt hyperplasia. In particular, bloody and blackish stool were observed in dogs 
at lethal doses. All species showed anorexia at higher doses and experienced lethality/severe morbidity. 
The corresponding plasma exposures in rats, dogs and monkeys to these lethal doses were about 10–fold 
higher, 2-fold lower, or 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than the ones obtained in humans at the therapeutic 
recommended  dose.  Reversibility  appeared  after  a  4-week  off-dose  period.  GI  perforation,  fistula 
EMA/250082/2015

formation and significant body weight loss have been observed in clinical trials with lenvatinib. Some of 
the gastrointestinal toxicities may be related to the expression of VEGFR1 in the gastrointestinal tract 
(Hagedorn  et  al.,  2005).  Human  data  on  VEGFR1  expression  in  the  duodenum  are  not  available.  The 
relevance  for  humans  of  the  duodenal  lesions  observed  in  rats  and  monkeys  can  therefore  not  be 
excluded.  Gastro-intestinal  toxicities  have  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  important  potential  risk  (see 
RMP). 
Lenvatinib caused bone changes characterized by increased thickness of epiphysial growth plate in rats 
and monkeys and dysplasia in incisors in rats as evidenced by white discoloration and fracture. Partial 
reversibility was apparent in rats. Bone lesions were more pronounced and occurred earlier in rats (after 
4 weeks, at 10 mg/kg) compared to monkeys (after 39 weeks, at 0.5 mg/kg) and incisor changes were 
observed in rats only. Because of the differences in growth characteristics between rodent and human 
bone, these lesions are not considered relevant to adult humans that lack an active growth plate. Similar 
effects have also not been reported during clinical trials with lenvatinib. However, the effects on bone 
were observed in monkeys at plasma exposures about 4–fold lower, than the ones obtained in humans at 
the therapeutic recommended dose of 24 mg QD. Moreover, growth plate abnormalities in children have 
been  observed  after  administration  of  other  VEGF/VEGFR  blocking  agents  (Voss  et  al.,  Pediatr  Blood 
Cancer, 2014) (see also juvenile studies below). Therefore, the effects on growth plate are considered to 
be potentially clinically relevant, in particular for children. Bone and teeth abnormalities in the pediatric 
population are covered in the RMP as important potential risk (see RMP). 
Testicular (hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium)  and ovarian changes (follicular atresia) were 
observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in animals at exposures 11 to 15 times (rat) or 0.6 to 7 times 
(monkey)  the  anticipated  clinical  exposure  (based  on  AUC)  at  the  maximum  tolerated  human  dose.  
These findings were reversible at the end of a 4-week recovery period (see SmPC section 5.3). In the 
absence of clinical data, these effects on the ovaries and testes in rats, dogs, and monkeys have been 
reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3). Male and female fertility is included in the RMP as 
important potential risk. 
Pancreatic toxicity of lenvatinib was observed in rats and monkeys during nonclinical development. In 
addition, clinical data suggest that lenvatinib (as the other members of this class of compounds) may 
exert pancreatic toxicity and therefore pancreatitis was considered as an important potential risk (see 
RMP). 
Repeated-dose toxicokinetic studies of lenvatinib in male and female rats, dogs, and monkeys conducted 
with once daily oral doses for up to 26, 4, and 39 weeks, respectively, indicated no systemic accumulation 
of lenvatinib in the toxicology studies.  
Embryo-fetal toxicity was observed in the EFD studies of lenvatinib both in rats and rabbits in the absence 
of maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.3 mg/kg in rats and 0.1 mg/kg in rabbits. A 
fetal NOAEL in rats could not be established because external and skeletal abnormalities were observed 
at the lowest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg). The fetal NOAEL in rabbits was 0.03 mg/kg. At 0.1 mg/kg an 
above, external, visceral, or skeletal anomalies were noted. No toxicokinetic data were provided for the 
rat  or  rabbit  EFD  studies. Nevertheless,  the  developmental  toxicity  was  shown  to  occur  at  levels  well 
below the human exposure (25 mg QD) by using exposures estimated from a separate study (rats) or the 
dose normalized to body surface area (rabbits). These findings indicate that lenvatinib has a teratogenic 
potential, likely related to the pharmacologic activity of lenvatinib as an antiangiogenic agent (see SmPC 
Section 5.3). 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking lenvatinib and for 
one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).

Lenvatinib, in the presence or absence of S9 activation, showed no mutagenic effects on bacterial strains 
and was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the mouse lymphoma tk assay. In addition, it did not induce in 
vivo clastogenic effects in rat bone marrow micronucleus assay when administered orally at doses up to 
2000 mg/kg. Thus, lenvatinib was not genotoxic. 
In view of the observed teratogenicity and/or in accordance with the ICH S9 guideline, fertility and early 
embryonic  development  studies,  pre-  and  postnatal  development  toxicity  studies  and  carcinogenicity 
studies were not conducted which is considered acceptable.  
Mortality was the dose-limiting toxicity in juvenile rats in which dosing was initiated on postnatal day 
(PND) 7 or PND21 and was observed at exposures that were respectively 125- or 12-fold lower compared 
with the exposure at which mortality was observed in adult rats, suggesting an increasing sensitivity to 
toxicity with decreasing age (see SmPC section 5.3). Though mortality was attributed to complications 
related to primary duodenal lesions, additional toxicities to immature target organs may also have 
contributed. 
The toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on PND7) compared with 
those with dosing initiated on PND21 and mortality and some toxicities were observed earlier in the 
juvenile rats compared with adult rats administered the same dose level. Growth retardation, secondary 
delay of physical development, and lesions attributable to pharmacologic effects (incisors, femur 
[epiphyseal growth plate], kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) were also observed in juvenile rats (see 
SmPC section 5.3). 
In  conclusion,  there  are  remaining  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  exact  aetiology  and  hence  the 
extrapolation to children of the increased toxicity risk. It is therefore unknown until what corresponding 
age in children this increased sensitivity may persist and caution is needed in the absence of clinical data 
(see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.3). 
Lenvatinib was negative in the in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake (NRU) phototoxicity test. 
Specific local tolerance studies have not been conducted since the product is administered orally, which is 
considered acceptable.  
Regarding  the  environmental  risk,  LogKow  was  determined  to  be  3.3  using  the  shake-flask  method. 
Therefore, an assessment for PBT is not necessary. The applicant provided published data to calculate the 
prevalence of the disease population targeted by Lenvima and this was used to refine Fpen. Using the 
refined Fpen, a PECsw  was calculated that was  far  below the action limit. Therefore, lenvatinib is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Apart from the toxicities that were included in the RMP as described above, there are no specific 
non-clinical issues that require further action post-marketing.

This application is for the capsule formulation of lenvatinib. Film-coated tablets containing the drug 
substance lenvatinib mesilate were first developed and used in the early stages of Phase 1 and Phase 2 
clinical studies including Study 201. Lenvatinib hard capsules were developed and used in all subsequent 
Phase 1 to 3 studies.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of in vitro studies were performed to determine the plasma protein binding, the metabolism, 
and the potential of Lenvatinib to be a substrate of a number of drug transporters.  Lenvatinib was also 
tested as an inhibitor and inducer of drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters. 
The clinical pharmacology studies included 6 studies in healthy subjects (E7080-A001-001, -002, -003, 
-004, -007, -008), one study in healthy subjects and subjects with renal impairment (E7080-A001-005), 
one study in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment (E7080-A001-006), and one mass 
balance study in subjects with advanced solid tumours (E7080-E044-104). The clinical pharmacology 
studies also included studies on bioavailability of different formulations, food effect, drug-drug interaction 
(DDI) and potential effects on the QT interval.  
The doses ranged from either 0.1 mg to 24 mg twice daily (BID) or 0.2 mg to 32 mg once daily (QD).  
Studies were conducted in male and female healthy subjects, individuals of different racial origin (few 
data on non-Caucasian and non-Asian population) and in subjects with solid tumours or lymphomas. 
A population PK (PopPK) analysis (Report CPMS-E7080-007R-v1) for lenvatinib was based on pooled data 
collected from:  
o  Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects (Studies E7080-A001-001, E7080-A001-002, 
E7080-A001-003, E7080-A001-004, E7080-A001-007, E7080-A001-008), plus 
E7080-A001-005, and E7080-A001-006 which included otherwise healthy renally and 
hepatically impaired subjects,  
o  3 Phase 1 clinical trials in subjects with solid tumours including lymphoma refractory to 
existing therapies or for which no treatment is available (Studies E7080-E044-101, 
E7080-A001-102, and E7080-J081-103), an additional Phase 1 trial in subjects with solid 
tumours (Study E7080-J081-105),  
o  a Phase 2 trial in subjects with advanced or recurrent thyroid cancer (Study 
E7080-J081-208), 
o  a Phase 2 trial in subjects with medullary and 131I refractory, unresectable differentiated 
thyroid cancers (Study E7080-G000-201), and  
o  a Phase 3 trial in subjects with 131I-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (Study 
E7080-G000-303) was conducted.   
This analysis was conducted to describe the PK of lenvatinib and identify covariates explaining 
intersubject variability in lenvatinib PK.  The covariates included demographics, clinical laboratory data, 
and tumour type (DTC, MTC, and other). 
Absorption  
Lenvatinib, from both tablet and capsule formulations, was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with 
a time to reach maximum concentration of drug in plasma (t max) typically observed 1 to 4 hours 
post-dose. The observed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ after a single dose of 24 mg (SD) in healthy volunteers 
were 325 (105) ng/mL, 2990 (974) ng.h/mL and 3010 (974) ng.h/mL, respectively (Study A001-005). In 
patients, Cmax and exposure after administration of a single 24 mg dose appear to be higher than in 
healthy volunteers: values of 655 (97) ng/mL and 4905 (2145) ng.h/mL have been observed for Cmax 
and AUC(0-24), respectively (Study A001-102). There were no data after multiple dosing in healthy 
volunteers.  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 50/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In the POPPK analysis healthy volunteers had a 15% higher CL/F compared with subjects with malignant 
solid tumours. 
The absolute bioavailability of lenvatinib was not determined. 
Influence of food 
Study E7080-A001-003 
The primary objective of this trial was to determine the effect of food on the bioavailability of lenvatinib 
following single oral administration of a capsule containing 10 mg E7080 with and without a meal. The 
study was a Phase I, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-treatment (dosing condition), 2-period, 
2-sequence, cross-over study in healthy volunteers. Sixteen subjects (12 males and 4 females) received 
10 mg of E7080 as a single dose under the two different conditions (fed versus fasting) in a randomised 
order. Two single dose administrations (one in each of the two consecutive treatment periods) were 
separated by a washout period of 14 days between the two dosing. “Fasting” was defined as deprivation 
of food for ≥ 10 hours (tap water was allowed), whereas “fed” was defined as administration of the drug 
30 minutes after the start of a standard high-fat breakfast (approximately 150 calories of protein, 250 
calories of carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories of fat). 
The administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg lenvatinib with a standard high-fat breakfast was 
associated with non-significant increases in lenvatinib AUC(0-inf) (ratio%, 90% CI: 106.3, 95.66 to 
118.09) and AUC(0-t) fold (ratio%, 90% CI: 103.7, 92.25 to 116.50). However, Cmax point estimate was 
reduced by approximately 5% compared to that in the fasted state. As the 90% CIs of the ratio of this 
pharmacokinetic parameter were without the standard bioequivalence range, these results indicated that 
food delays the rate of absorption in a significant way. In addition, median t max for lenvatinib was 
approximately 2-fold increased after administration with food (4.02 h) compared to administration in the 
fasted state (2.02 h). 
Study E7080-E044-101 
Study E7080-E044-101 was an open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in eighty-two male 
and female subjects with solid tumors or lymphomas resistant or refractory to existing therapies or for 
whom no treatment was available. This Phase 1 study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for lenvatinib. A pilot evaluation of the influence of food on lenvatinib pharmacokinetic at the 
MTD (25 mg) was also conducted in this study.   
Eleven subjects entered and completed the food effect pilot study at a once daily lenvatinib dose of 25 mg 
(2 x 10 mg tablets and 5 x 1.0 mg tablets). These subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single oral 
dose of 25 mg lenvatinib administered after a high-fat breakfast (approximately 150 calories of protein, 
250 calories of carbohydrate, and 600 calories of fat) or following at least a 10 hour fast on the morning 
or either Cycle 1 Day 15 or Cycle 1 Day 22. The effect of food on lenvatinib pharmacokinetics was 
evaluated by comparing AUC0-24 and Cmax. 
Administration of a single oral dose of 25 mg lenvatinib after a standardized high fat breakfast had no 
impact on the mean plasma exposure (AUC0-24) for lenvatinib. Compared to overnight fasting, the mean 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of lenvatinib was slightly reduced in the presence of food (2 %). 
The 90% CIs of the ratio of this pharmacokinetic parameter being without the standard bioequivalence 
range, it indicated that food significantly decreases the rate of absorption of lenvatinib. Moreover, t max 
was prolonged in the fed conditions (5 hours, median value) compared with the fasted conditions (2 
hours, median value) and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0146), indicating that dosing 
with food delays the time to maximum plasma concentrations (t max).

Bioequivalence (BE) 
The relative bioavailability of the 10 mg capsule and 10 mg tablet was determined in healthy volunteers 
(E7080-A001-001 (Relative Bioavailability)). This was a single-centre, single-dose, open-label, 
randomized, 2-period cross-over study conducted in 20 healthy men under fasting conditions.  The 
objective was to determine the relative bioavailability of a capsule formulation to a tablet formulation.  
The subjects received either one 10-mg capsule or one 10 mg tablet on the first day of the first period.  
The subjects received the study drug following an overnight fast of at least 10 h.  They received the 
alternate formulation on the first day of the second period.  There was a 1-week (7-day) washout between 
the 2 treatment periods.  Nineteen subjects completed the study. 
Mean total exposure (AUC(0-inf)) of the 10-mg lenvatinib capsule was approximately 10% less than that of 
the 10-mg lenvatinib tablet. Mean Cmax for the capsule was approximately 14% lower than that of the 
tablet. Median tmax was 2.0 hours for both the capsule and tablet. Mean t 1/2 values for the capsule and 
tablet were comparable (27.6 h and 29.1 h, respectively). The variability in exposures was low, with the 
highest coefficients of variation, Cmax, less than 26% for both formulations. Even though the study was 
not powered for BE, the 90% confidence intervals for AUC(0-inf) and AUC(0-t) were within the 80% to 125% 
confidence interval typically used to demonstrate BE. However, the lower bound of the confidence interval 
for Cmax (79.84%) was outside the 80% bound. 
In  vitro  dissolution  studies  and  the  bioequivalence  study  E7080-A001-008  showed  the  bioavailability 
equivalence among lenvatinib 10-mg capsules with the different Type-C crystal levels. Absorption and 
disposition profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with linear PK over a 0.8-mg to 32-mg range for single 
and repeat dose (Study E7080-E044-101). 
A bioavailability study comparing the 4-mg to the 10-mg capsule was not done. The 4-mg capsule was 
shown to have a similar dissolution profile as 10-mg capsule.  Additionally, proportionate increases in 
lenvatinib  exposure  (based  on  dose  normalized  AUC(0-24)  and  Cmax)  following  single  doses  and  at 
steady-state, were seen over the 0.2-mg to 32-mg QD dose range (E7080-E044-101) and the 0.1- to 
12-mg BID dose range (E7080-A001-102). Also, the 4-mg strength capsule is proportionally similar in its 
active and inactive ingredients to the 10-mg strength.   
The 4- and 10-mg capsules (and occasionally the 1-mg) were used in most of the Phase 1 and 2 trials.  
The 4- and 10-mg capsules were used in the Phase 3 trial and are the intended commercial formulation. 
Distribution 
As there is no study with intravenous administration of lenvatinib, the volume of distribution has not been 
determined. Apparent volume (V/F) was generally not reported in the studies with healthy volunteers. 
Only in the renal and hepatic impairment studies (Studies A001-005 and A001-006), values were 
reported. The total values were 428 (153) L and 408 (216) L, respectively, and the unbound values were 
6700 (4460) L and 6760 (6370) L, respectively. In the patient studies, the reported Vz/F values ranged 
from 50.5-92 L (Study E044-101) and 136-312 L (Study J081-103). At steady state, the values ranged 
from 43.2-121 L (Study E044-101) and 155-261 L (Study J081-103). 
The estimated V/F values from the POPPK analysis showed values of 49.3, 30.7 and 37.1 L for the central 
and 2 peripheral compartments, respectively.  
In humans, the in vitro plasma protein binding of lenvatinib (concentration range: 0.3 to 30 μg/mL, 
mesilate) was 97.87% to 98.62%, with binding mainly to albumin and to a lesser extent to 
α1-acid-glycoprotein and γ-globulin. Protein binding was linear across concentrations. This observation 
was confirmed in vivo, with serum protein binding values ranging from 96.6% to 98.2% (Study 
E7080-J081-103). 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 52/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of lenvatinib remained constant (0.589 to 0.608) in 
humans over the concentration range tested (0.1 to 10 μg/mL [14C]lenvatinib mesilate). The 
predominance of lenvatinib in plasma over blood was also confirmed in the mass balance study, where 
blood concentrations were 29% and 36% lower than plasma concentrations for total radioactivity and 
lenvatinib, respectively. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Following Cmax, the plasma concentrations of lenvatinib declined bi-exponentially. The mean terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) of total lenvatinib ranged from 20.6 hours to 34.3 hours in the studies in 
healthy volunteers. The mean terminal exponential half-life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. 
The PK of lenvatinib was characterised by an oral clearance of 6.7 L/hour (Study E7080-E044-104). In the 
population PK analysis, CL/F was 6.56 L/h and its %CV was 25.5%. 
After administration of an oral solution of lenvatinib in the mass balance study, 85.5% of the administered 
dose has been found in urine or as metabolites in faeces. Degradation of lenvatinib in faeces is judged 
unlikely and urinary excretion of unchanged drug is negligible. Metabolism appeared to be the major 
elimination pathway for lenvatinib and the excretion of lenvatinib and its metabolites occurred mainly via 
the faecal route. 
Metabolism  
In  vitro  results  with  recombinant  CYPs  indicated  that  CYP3A4  was  the  predominant  (>80%)  isoform 
contributing to the CYP-dependent metabolism of lenvatinib in humans, followed by CYP1A2 (5.2% to 
6.5%) and CYP2B6 (5.2% to 5.7%). Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is responsible for the metabolisation to M3’ 
and M3’ glucuronide.   
The  in  vivo  metabolism  has  been  studied  in  a  human  radiolabelled  study  E7080-E044-104.  In  this 
absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion  (ADME)  study,  in  which  24  mg  of  14C-lenvatinib 
(approximately  100  µCi  (~3.7  MBq))  was  administered  to  3  men  and  3  women  with  advanced  solid 
tumours or lymphomas, who were unsuitable for, or had failed, existing therapies, most of the recovered 
radioactivity was found in faeces, 64% of mean total recovery, and 25% of mean total recovery recovered 
in urine (i.e. 89% of the dose was recovered in the excreta) (see SmPC section 5.2).  
In the mass balance study, the mean recovery of 14C-radioactivity was 89%, with approximately 64% 
excreted in the feces and 25% in the urine. In urine and faeces, 0.38% and 2.5%, respectively of the 
radioactive  dose  was  found  as  lenvatinib.  Fractions  of  the  dose  eliminated  in  the  urine  as  unchanged 
lenvatinib  were  not  dependent  on  the  dose  administered.  The  M3’  metabolite  was  the  predominant 
analyte in excreta (~17% of the dose), followed by M2’ (~11% of the dose) and M2 (~4.4% of the dose) 
(see SmPC section 5.2).     
In plasma samples collected up to 24 hours after administration, lenvatinib constituted 97% of the 
radioactivity in plasma radiochromatograms while the M2 metabolite accounted for an additional 2.5%.  
Based on AUC(0 – inf), lenvatinib accounted for 60% and 64% of the total radioactivity in plasma and blood, 
respectively (see SmPC section 5.2).

Extraction recovery of radioactivity in plasma samples appeared to decrease in time (with a minimum of 
10%  72h  after  administration)  and  was,  for  the  later  time-points,  also  highly  variable  (%CV  up  to 
46%).80% of the recovered radioactivity in excreta (urine and faeces) was identified.  
Based on the in vivo data, the following overview of metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans has 
been proposed. 
In total, the contribution to lenvatinib clearance in human is summarized in the table below. The ratio of 
aldehyde oxidase (AO): CYP3A: non-enzymatic process is approximately 3:4:3 in humans.

In normal healthy subjects, variability (as coefficient of variation [%CV] of AUC, fasted subjects) ranged 
from  about  8%  to  20%.  In  Study  E7080-A001-102  (Combination  Therapy),  PK  parameters  exhibited 
moderate to high variability, with %CV estimates ranging from 19.44% to 78%. Compared to normal 
subjects, subjects with renal or hepatic impairment had greater variability (39% to 45%). In a formal 
population PK analysis, the %CV of basal apparent total clearance following extravascular administration 
(CL/F) was 25.5%. 
In  order  to  explain  inter-individual  variability  in  lenvatinib  exposure  (AUC),  in  the  POPPK  analysis  for 
lenvatinib,  the  effect  of  various  covariates  was  tested  on  CL/F,  and  formulation,  H2-blockers,  proton 
pump  inhibitors,  antacids,  and  combined  category  of  pH  elevating  agents  was  tested  on  relative 
bioavailability. None of these influenced in an important way the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality 
In patients with solid tumours administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, exposure 
to lenvatinib (Cmax and AUC) increased in direct proportion to the administered dose over the range of 
3.2 to 32 mg once-daily (QD) (see SmPC section 5.2).   
In study E7080-E044-101, the observed t 1/2 values decreased with increasing dose. However from a dose 
of 6.4 mg on, this appeared to be relatively stable. 
When data from E7080-E044-101 and E7080-J081-103 were combined, the dose-normalized Cmax was 
very consistent across doses of 4 mg and higher, although variability was high across the lower doses 
(less than 4 mg). Cmax showed a linear profile at clinical doses, i.e., 4 mg or higher.  In vitro study data 
indicate that lenvatinib is a substrate of permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). Thus, a likely explanation of the 
nonlinearity of Cmax at lower doses is that P-gp expressed in the gut has an efflux functional effect on 
lenvatinib, which leads to slower absorption of lenvatinib at these doses.   
From the POPPK analysis, the CL/F was reported to be 6.56 L/h and this value appeared to be constant 
upon repeated dosing and through different dosing levels.  
For the linearity in CL/F, the PK model was run without the effect of dose on CL/F. There was an increase 
of  128.176  points  in  the  objective  function  value,  from  64389.472  to  64517.648.  In  addition,  the  PK 
model was run without the effect of dose on F1 and again there was an increase of 62.288 points in the 
objective function value, from 64389.472 to 64451.76. To further investigate the relationship between 
dose and CL/F, the final PK model was run using only capsule formulation PK data and without estimating 
F1. This is of value as the term “F1” is a relative bioavailability term in the model linking the tablet and 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 55/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
to-be-marketed capsule formulations. Adding dose effect on CL/F decreased the objective function value 
by 5.067 points (from 37346.978 to 37341.901, which is not statistically significant).   
Time-dependency 
Upon  multiple  dosing,  steady-state  plasma  concentrations  were  achieved  within  5  days.  Lenvatinib 
displayed  minimimal  accumulation  at  steady  state.    Over  the  dose  range  3.2  to  32  mg,  the  median 
accumulation index (Rac) ranged from 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). 
This was consistent with the approximately 28 hour half-life of lenvatinib and once daily administration. 
Apparent clearance and volume of distribution were generally similar between first dose and steady-state 
and between doses. 
Special populations 
In the population PK analysis, apparent total clearance following oral administration (CL/F) was 15% 
higher in healthy subjects compared to patients and hence the extent of exposure (AUC) was slightly 
lower for healthy subjects. The PK parameters of lenvatinib were similar in subjects with DTC, medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC) and other tumour types.

In the population PK analysis that included data from 196 healthy subjects and 583 patients, age was not 
a  significant  covariate  that  could  account  for  the  inter-subject  variability  in  the  PK  of  lenvatinib 
(CPMS-E7080-007R-v1).  Median  dose  and  weight  adjusted  lenvatinib  exposure  in  cancer  patients 
receiving lenvatinib capsules was 3480 ng•h/mL for subjects with age ≤65 years and 3710 ng•h/mL for 
subjects with age >65 years.

Impaired renal function (study E7080-A001-005) 
A Phase 1, multicentre, open-Label, non-randomized, single-dose, pharmacokinetic and safety study of 
E7080  (24  mg)  administered  to  subjects  with  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  renal  impairment  and  to 
healthy subjects was submitted  to describe and compare the PK of lenvatinib from a single 24-mg oral 
dose of lenvatinib administered to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (N=6 in each

group) and to healthy subjects (N=8) distributionally matched in age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) 
and to describe the safety of a single 24-mg oral dose of lenvatinib. Both total (bound + unbound) and 
unbound drug concentrations of lenvatinib were determined. A method using a centrifugal ultrafiltration 
followed with LC-MS/MS was used to determine unbound lenvatinib in plasma. 
Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-inf) exhibited moderate to high variability. For subjects with mild, moderate, and 
severe renal impairment, overall exposure (AUC(0-inf)) to lenvatinib was estimated to be 1.01, 0.90, and 
1.22 times that of normal subjects. The half-life for lenvatinib was similar between the normal and the 
renally  impaired  subjects.  Using  a  regression  method,  no  statistically  significant  correlation  between 
lenvatinib exposure and creatinine clearance (CL cr) was observed.   
Lenvatinib exposure, based on AUC0-inf data, was 101%, 90%, and 122% of normal for subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see SmPC section 5.2)..   
• 
Impaired hepatic function (study E7080-A001-006) 
A Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic and safety study of lenvatinib in subjects 
with mild (10 mg) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (10 mg) (Child-Pugh B), and severe hepatic impairment (5 
mg) (Child-Pugh C) and normal hepatic function (10 mg) evaluated the PK of lenvatinib from a single oral 
dose of 10 mg in subjects (N=6) with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and from a single oral dose 
of 5 mg in subjects (N=6) with severe hepatic impairment compared to a single oral dose of 10 mg in 
healthy subjects with (N=8) normal hepatic function and to assess the safety of lenvatinib in subjects with 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  
The median half-life was comparable in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment as 
well as those with normal hepatic function and ranged from 26 hours to 31 hours.  The percentage of the 
dose of lenvatinib excreted in urine was low in all cohorts (<2.16% across treatment cohorts). 
Lenvatinib exposure, based on dose-adjusted AUC0-t and AUC0-inf data, was 119%, 107%, and 180% of 
normal for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively.   
•  Gender 
The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. 
No significant differences between sexes were found in lenvatinib exposure. 
•  Race 
The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. 
According to this POP PK analysis, the PK of lenvatinib was unaffected by race. 
•  Weight 
The effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. In 
this  POP  PK  analysis,  weight  (37.8  –  178  kg)  added  as  an  allometric  constant  on  CL/F  and  volume 
parameters  showed  a  statistically  significant  effect,  but  only  explained  1.2  %  of  the  inter-individual 
variability on CL/F. PK simulations showed a major overlap in the steady-state exposure in the presence 
and absence of this covariate.  
Subjects with body weight <60 kg had 36% higher exposure compared with subjects >60 kg.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro metabolism and transporter data (see non-clinical aspects), drug-drug interactions of 
lenvatinib were designed to assess effects of P-gp inhibition, CYP3A induction and inhibition on lenvatinib 
as a substrate, and to assess potential for lenvatinib to inhibit CYP2C8 and CYP3A.

Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib (as victim) 
•  Study E7080-A001-004 with ketoconazole (CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitor) 
The objective of the study E7080-A001-004 was to assess the influence of simultaneous CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibition using ketoconazole on lenvatinib PK following single-dose oral administration of 5 mg lenvatinib 
(formulated as a capsule) to healthy volunteers and to evaluate the safety, in healthy subjects, of a single 
dose of 5 mg lenvatinib administered with and without simultaneous CYP3A4/P-gp inhibition 
(ketoconazole). Ketoconazole inhibits CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP. Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 18 
days) increased lenvatinib AUC about 15% and Cmax increased about 19% following administration of 5 
mg lenvatinib on Day 5. The half-life of lenvatinib was not affected suggesting that inhibition of enterocyte 
P-gp was responsible for the changes observed rather than inhibition of CYP3A. In the population PK 
analysis, CYP3A inhibitors decreased CL/F by 7.8% (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1). 
•  Study E7080-A001-007 with rifampin (CYP3A4 and PgP inducer) 
The objective of the study E7080-A001-004 was to assess the influence of P-gp inhibition and 
simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induction on lenvatinib PK following single-dose oral administration of 24 
mg lenvatinib to healthy volunteers and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 24 mg 
lenvatinib administered alone, following P-gp inhibition and following simultaneous induction of P-gp and 
CYP3A4 in healthy subjects.  
Coadministration of a single dose of rifampin (600 mg) with 24 mg of lenvatinib increased lenvatinib AUC 
and Cmax by 31% and 33%, respectively, without prolonging half-life. Following multiple doses of 
rifampin (600 mg once daily for 21 days) and a single 24 mg dose of lenvatinib on Day 15, lenvatinib AUC 
and half-life were reduced by 18% and 27%, respectively, while Cmax was unchanged. This result 
reflected the net effect of enzyme induction and P-gp inhibition. The effect of strong CYP3A induction in 
the absence of P-gp inhibition was estimated. As expected, the effect of induction in the absence of P-gp 
inhibition was slightly greater than the net effect of the combination of the 2 effects of rifampin. This 
finding represents a worst case scenario for the effect of a strong inducer on lenvatinib exposure since it 
is assumed that the P-gp inhibition effect on the PK of lenvatinib is similar under induced and non-induced 
conditions even though it is known that P-gp is also subject to PXR mediated induction. The effect of 
induction was relatively small, and consistent with in vitro and in vivo metabolism data.  
• 
Temozolomide (TMZ) 
As part of a study primarily assessing the benefit of co-administration of lenvatinib with TMZ in subjects 
with melanoma, lenvatinib’s PK parameters were assessed. This study was not designed as a formal DDI 
study. Coadministration of TMZ with lenvatinib (24 mg QD) did not alter lenvatinib’s PK parameters. 
•  Carboplatin – paclitaxel 
As part of a study primarily assessing the benefit of coadministration of lenvatinib with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer, the PK parameters of all 3 drugs were assessed 
(Study E7080-J081-110). This study was not designed as a formal DDI study. Lenvatinib PK parameters 
following coadministered with carboplatin and paclitaxel were similar to those observed with lenvatinib 
monotherapy. The PK parameters of carboplatin and paclitaxel with coadministration of lenvatinib were 
generally consistent with historical values observed without lenvatinib coadministration. 
•  H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors 
In the population PK analysis of lenvatinib (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1), for DDI, co-administration of CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers, proton pump inhibitors, H2-blockers, antacids and combined category of pH 
EMA/250082/2015

elevating agents were tested. Agents that elevate gastric pH (H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and 
antacids) did not have a significant effect on the absorption and bioavailability of lenvatinib.  
Effects of lenvatinib on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (as perpetrator) 
•  Midazolam as CYP3A4 substrate 
A human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for lenvatinib (Study 
DMPKA2013-156), to simulate the human AUC profiles of midazolam with or without coadministration of 
lenvatinib, and to assess the potential risk of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between lenvatinib and the 
CYP3A4 substrate midazolam.  
In the original physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model DDI simulation analysis, the fumic 
was calculated by Simcyp (Prediction Toolbox) based on logPo:w (partition-coefficient, the ratio of 
concentrations of a compound in the 1-octanol and water at equilibrium) , compound type, pKa, assay pH, 
and microsomal protein concentration. The fumic for CYP3A4 was calculated to be 0.503 based on 1 
mg/mL microsomal protein concentration in the in vitro assay condition for CYP3A4 time-dependent 
inhibition. Fumic was also measured in an in vitro assay at 1 mg/mL microsomal protein concentration 
and determined to be 0.74. With the new fumic value, DDI simulation for lenvatinib and CYP3A4 substrate 
midazolam was reevaluated and the geometric mean AUC ratio (AUCR) for midazolam was determined to 
be 1.18 with 95% CI of 1.16 - 1.20 and 1.22 with 95% CI of 1.20 – 1.24, respectively, for 
co-administration with 24-mg and 32-mg doses of lenvatinib, indicating low DDI risk. 
•  Repaglinide 
In vitro, lenvatinib exhibited a weak to moderate, reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 (see non-clinical 
aspects). A human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for lenvatinib 
(Study DMPKA2013-156), to simulate the human AUC profiles of repaglinide with or without 
coadministration of lenvatinib, and to assess the potential risk of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between 
lenvatinib and the CYP2C8 substrate repaglinide. 
For the DDI simulation, repaglinide was given as a 0.25-mg oral dose either alone or concomitantly on 
Day 1 with lenvatinib 24 mg p.o. dose QDx8 (Day 1-Day 9). In an additional simulation, repaglinide 
0.25-mg p.o. was dosed with a supratherapeutic 32-mg p.o. dose of lenvatinib. This was done as a “worst 
case” scenario to confirm the effect at excessively high lenvatinib concentrations. 
The geometric mean AUCR for repaglinide 0.25-mg p.o. with or without lenvatinib 24-mg and 32-mg were 
1.005 and 1.007, respectively, suggesting a less than 1% increase in exposure to repaglinide when 
concomitantly given with lenvatinib. The results of these simulations suggested no DDI risk between 
lenvatinib and repaglinide, even at supratherapeutic doses. 
•  Warfarin 
Regarding R-Warfarin and CYP3A4: Lenvatinib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4 with inhibition constants 
(Ki and Ki´) of 106.4 µmol/L and 57.0 µmol/L, respectively. These constants were derived using a 
complex type inhibition model (Study No. B03023). For enterocytes and according to the EMA Guideline 
on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, the [I]/Ki was calculated to be 3.9 (24-mg QD dose) using the 
lower Ki of 57 µmol/L. As the [I]/Ki was less than 10, DDI is not considered a concern for the CYP3A4 
reversible inhibition in enterocytes. 
Regarding the systemic circulation relevant CYP3A4 reversible inhibition DDI concern, the [I]/Ki was 
calculated to be 0.0004 using Cmax,ss of 518 ng/mL (Study E7080-J081-105) at the maximum clinical 
dose (24 mg QD) and fu of 0.02 and the lower Ki of 57 µmol/L. As this calculated [I]/Ki value was much 
less than 0.02, there is no DDI concern for the CYP3A4 reversible inhibition in the systemic circulation. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 59/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Lenvatinib also exhibited weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A with kinact of 0.0835 minutes-1, and 
Ki of 72.266 µmol/L (Study PK-TEST-0040). Based on the physiologically based modeling of the CYP3A4 
probe substrate midazolam (Study DMPKA2013-156), lenvatinib did not significantly inhibit CYP3A4. 
Effects on warfarin pharmacologic effect via this mechanism would be trivial (lower potency enantiomer 
marginally affected). 
Lenvatinib only slightly increased CYP3A4 mRNA expression (Study XT063020) and thus is not an inducer 
of CYP3A4 (He et al., 1997). 
Regarding R-Warfarin and CYP1A2: The in vitro data indicated lenvatinib neither inhibits nor induces 
CYP1A2 (Study XT063020, Study B03023, and Study PK-Test-0079).  
Regarding S-Warfarin, and CYP2C9: Lenvatinib neither inhibits nor induces CYP2C9 (Study XT063020, 
Study B03023, and Study PK-Test-0079).  
• 
Levothyroxine 
Thyroxine is generally administered to subjects with DTC or medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) as standard 
of care. In contrast, thyroxine is not generally administered to subjects with other solid tumor types. The 
PK parameters of lenvatinib were similar in subjects with DTC and MTC compared to subjects with other 
solid tumor types (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1). This indicated thyroxine did not affect lenvatinib PK.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lenvatinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in 
angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression. Lenvatinib was evaluated for its inhibitory 
activity against a variety of kinases.  The most sensitive kinases for lenvatinib included VEGFR (VEGFR1 
(FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)), RET, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors (FGFR1, 2, 3, 
and 4), the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, and KIT. The precise mechanism of 
action of lenvatinib is not elucidated, but its anti-angiogenic activity appears to be its primary effect, while 
anti-proliferative activity is rather limited at least in in vitro assays (see non-clinical section).  
Primary pharmacology 
Inhibition of several kinases is thought to contribute to anti-tumor activity of lenvatinib and to its toxicity. 
Pharmacodynamic properties relative to efficacy and safety of lenvatinib that are expected based on its 
mechanism of action (inhibition of VEGFRs, FGFRs and PDGFRs) were discussed. The safety profile of 
lenvatinib in patients is largely similar to other VEGFR-targeting TKIs with hypertension and proteinuria 
being the most prominent adverse reactions.  Inhibition of several types of tyrosine kinases (VEGFRs, 
FGFRs, PDGFRs) may potentially contribute towards the embryotoxicity observed after administration of 
lenvatinib to pregnant animals during organogenesis and towards impaired wound healing. FGFR 
inhibition causes antiangiogenic effects and therefore embryotoxic/teratogenic effects are possible safety 
concerns in treatment with FGFR inhibitors (see non-clinical aspects and SmPC section 5.3). Increased 
inorganic phosphorus can occur as a result of FGFR inhibition and hyperphosphatemia is a known 
FGFR-inhibition associated safety signal given that FGFR1c signaling in the kidney regulates phosphate 
reabsorption and calcium homeostasis upon binding to a ligand, FGF-23 (Tacer, et al, 2010; Javier, et al, 
2012; Kharitonenkov, et al., 2009; Lanske, et al, 2013). 
Lenvatinib has also activity against PDGFR tyrosine kinases although the IC50s were lower for PDGFRβ. 
PDGFRα is expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes surrounding vascular endothelial 
cells, and has roles for stabilizing newly formed vasculature. Inhibition of PDGFRα may contribute towards 
EMA/250082/2015

the antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib. Publicly available and relavely limited non-clinical data (Roberts 
et al, 2005) and clinical data (Lewis et al, 2009; Smith et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2014 in regards to more 
specific PDGFR inhibitors do not currently inform on particular additional toxicities.   
Genetic differences in PD response 
An overview of known molecular alterations in differentiated thyroid cancer that form a basis for increased 
targeted therapeutic possibilities for patients with thyroid cancer was provided (Xing et al., 2013; 
Alonso-Gordoa et al., 2015; Elisei et al., 2012; Volante et al., 2009).  
The RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway seems to be one of the main pathways 
involved in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer. RAS, BRAF mutations or RET/PTC rearrangements have 
been observed in almost 70% of PTC whereas FTC predominantly includes alterations in RAS and 
PAX8/PPARγ. Although RAS mutations have been associated with worse prognosis in both PTC and FTC, 
larger studies are required for definitive conclusions regarding their prognostic value (Alonso-Gordoa et 
al., 2015). Molecular profiling of Hurthle cell tumors suggests that they represent a unique class of thyroid 
malignancies at a genetic level (Ganly et al, 2013; Wells and Santoro, 2014). 
In Study E7080-G00-201, genotype analyses performed in a subset of patients (n=23 of 58 DTC subjects 
on study) suggested a benefit in patients harboring RAS mutations (Sherman et al., 2011).   
In retrospective placebo-controlled analysis in the pivotal Study 303, lenvatinib PFS benefit compared 
with placebo was maintained regardless of BRAF or RAS mutation status, and neither mutational status 
appeared to be predictive for lenvatinib benefit (Schlumberger et al., 2015).  In the Study 303, genotype 
analyses performed in about 47% of randomized subjects showed that 27.9% of patients in the lenvatinib 
arm and 11.7% of patients in the placebo arm had tumours with a RAS mutation; 21.1% of patients 
receiving lenvatinib and 32.2% receiving placebo had tumours with a BRAF mutation (Tahara et al., 2014, 
Schlumberger et al., 2015).  
Biomarkers analysis 
Serum biomarkers: circulating angiogenic factors (CAFs)  
In the Study E7080-G000-303, focused analysis of 3 serum biomarkers VEGF, Ang2, and soluble Tie2 
(sTie2) (pre- and post-treatment levels) was performed in both the treatment and placebo arms (Tahara 
et al., 2014). Blood samples were collected during the randomisation phase for biomarker discovery and 
validation from all subjects prior to the first dose of the study drug, on Day 15 of the first cycle and on Day 
1 of all subsequent cycles. 
The analysis of these specific serum markers was based on biomarker data obtained from various clinical 
studies of lenvatinib across several different indications. Notably, biomarkers have been investigated in 
multiple indications across various Phase 2 studies including thyroid cancer (DTC, MTC, and anaplastic 
thyroid  cancer),  HCC,  glioblastoma,  endometrial  cancer,  renal  cell  carcinoma  and  melanoma  (with  or 
without  BRAF  V600E).    Exploratory  biomarkers  including  a  broad  panel  of  45  circulating  circulating 
angiogenic  factors  (CAFs)  as  well  as  tumour  genetic  markers  were  investigated  across  these  various 
Phase  2  studies  to  gain  insight  into  the  PD  markers  as  well  as  predictive  markers  for  response  to 
treatment  (Vergote  et  al.,  2014;  Cabanillas  et  al.,  2014,  Schlumberger  et  al.  2012,  Funahashi  et  al., 
2013, Sachdev et al. 2013). Increases in circulating levels of VEGF and PlGF have been observed following 
treatment with various VEGFR-targeted TKIs and are suggested as potential PD markers for these agents 
(Murukesh et al., 2010). The panel of selected CAFs (combination of ELISA and multiplex assays) was 
based on published literature as well as preclinical translational research with lenvatinib. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 61/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
A graphical anlysis was performed to describe the link between exposure and different serum biomarkers 
including thyroglobulin for DTC, calcitonin and CEA for MTC, free T4 and TSH, apoptosis marker (caspase 
3/7, cytochrome C, and M-30 neo-antigen) and circulating cytokine and angiogenic factors (CAFs). CAFs 
included: angiogenic growth factor (EGF, FGF2, IL-6, TGF-α,VEGF/VEGF(100), VEGF-D, PGF), chemokine 
(GM-CSF,  MIP-1α,  MIP-1β,  Rantes,  SDF-1α,  G-CSF),  endothelium  function  (Ang2/Ang2(90),  Tie-2, 
sVEGFR-1, sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB), interleukin/immune response (IL-1α, 
IL-1rα, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-13), others (FLT3LG). Subsequently, baseline CAFs values were tested as 
predictors of lenvatinib efficacy (inhibition of tumor growth) using a model based analysis. Percentage 
changes of CAFs from baseline at Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 8 were also tested in tumor growth 
inhibition model and PFS analysis as described below. Consistently with findings in other Phase 2 studies 
of lenvatinib, an increase in VEGF levels and a decrease in Ang-2 and sTie-2 levels from baseline were 
observed in Study 303 at various post-treatment time points. Ang2 levels correlated with ORR and PFS 
(OS  data  was  too  immature  for  correlative  analysis).  Similarly,  significant  association  was  observed 
between PFS and low baseline VEGF alpha and angiopoietin-2 levels (p=0.02 and HR=0.386) (Ball et al, 
2012).It was noted that all patients treated with lenvatinib showed superior clinical benefit compared with 
placebo  regardless  of  baseline  Ang-2  levels  (Tahara  et  al.,  2014).  Baseline  VEGF  levels  did  not  show 
significant correlation with clinical outcome measures such as PFS. In contrast, baseline levels of VEGF in 
a study with motesanib in DTC or MTC did correlate with response on treatment (Bass et al., 2010). 
In addition to 3 above-mentioned serum biomarkers (Ang2, sTie2, and VEGF), serum levels of FGF23, a 
peptide hormone regulating mineral metabolism, were measured in study 303. Analysis of serum levels of 
FGF-23 in pretreatment (baseline) and post-treatment (at Cycle 1 Day 15 [C1D15] and Cycle 2 Day 1 
[C2D1])  blood  samples  collected  in  the  Study  303,  showed  that  FGF-23  levels  were  higher  in  the 
lenvatinib arm compared with the placebo arm (Study W-20140951). Increase in plasma levels of FGF-23 
has been considered as a compensatory mechanism of FGFR1 inhibition (Kim et al., 2011).  
In the study 201, most subjects were taking thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) during the study (66% of 
subjects in the DTC cohort and 86% in the MTC cohort). Thyroglobulin levels decreased after lenvatinib 
treatment in most subjects. Higher drop in thyroglobulin levels post lenvatinib treatment was associated 
with higher response rate. Also lower baseline tumor size was associated with higher response rate. 
Biomarkers  of  apoptosis,  circulating  endothelial  cells  and  imaging  biomarkers  using  dynamic  contrast 
enhanced  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (DCE-MRI)  were  evaluated  in  a  limited  number  of  patients  in 
phase 1 and 2 studies. 
Secondary pharmacology 
QT assessment 
In  the  clinical  program,  a  thorough  QT  study  was  performed  (E7080-A001-002).  This  study  was 
conducted  in  52  healthy  volunteers.  This  was  a  single  center,  single-dose,  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo  controlled,  three  treatment,  three–way  crossover  study  (each  a  14-day  period)  conducted  to 
evaluate  the  potential  for  QT/QTc  prolongation  by  32  mg  lenvatinib  using  a  placebo  control  and 
moxifloxacin (Avelox 400 mg) as the positive control. 
The QTcF change from baseline (ΔΔQTcF) was evaluated from serial electrocardiograms. The relationship 
between lenvatinib plasma concentration and QTcF was analysed with linear mixed-effects modeling.  
50 subjects completed the study. Two subjects withdrew consent prior to completion. The mean age of 
subjects was 34 (SD = 13.8) years.  
Lenvatinib plasma concentrations were measured; the peak plasma level (arithmetic mean ± SD) of 417 
± 201.8 ng/ml was observed at a median of 3.0 h. At this plasma level, the change in QTcF is projected 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 62/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
to – 4.83 msec (90% CI -6.12 to – 3.53). The median half-life was 21.3 h. Mean peak plasma levels of 
moxifloxacin reached 3.2 µg/ml and were observed at a median of 2.0 h after dosing.  
Following administration of a single 32 mg dose, lenvatinib did not exert a clinically relevant effect on 
ΔΔQTcF. A small QTc shortening effect was observed and QTc prolongation exceeding 10 ms could be 
confidently excluded. The mean ΔΔQTcF was negative at all time points postdosing with the exception of 
23.5 hours and the upper bound of the CI did not exceed 2 ms at any time point. Concentration effect 
modeling suggested lenvatinib does not cause QTc prolongation at clinically relevant, high plasma levels. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure - Efficacy after a starting dose of 24-mg (in Phase 3 Study 303) 
Graphical PK/PD analysis of OS, ORR, DCR, CBR, dSD, maximum change in tumour size, and time to 
response with lenvatinib AUC based on starting dose of 24 mg or dose intensity did not reveal any direct 
relationship. 
A time-to-event analysis for efficacy using data only from the Study E7080-G000-303 was conducted to 
explore the relationship between lenvatinib exposure (AUC0-24 ) and the primary efficacy endpoint (PFS), 
as well as several secondary and exploratory endpoints (e.g., OS and ORR) using S-plus 8.1. It also 
identified other predictors of PFS in patients with DTC. The analysis described the relationship between 
lenvatinib exposure and longitudinal tumour size measurements in subjects with DTC and identified 
covariates that affect this relationship.  
All the exposure-response analyses except tumour size included 260 subjects with DTC who received 
lenvatinib from Study 303.  For PFS, 107 subjects had observed events and 153 subjects had censored 
events. 
Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis showed that lenvatinib treated subjects showed similar PFS 
across the full range of exposures (AUC0-24 between 1410 and 10700 ng.h/mL).  
A similar analysis for PFS and AUCDose Intensity showed that subjects in the 4th quartile of lenvatinib 
exposure had an apparent poorer PFS relative to the other lenvatinib quartiles (Kaplan-Meier plots not 
shown). This finding however was driven by a disproportionate randomization of early dropout subjects to 
this quartile.  Eighteen of the 36 early dropout subjects were randomized to the 4th quartile.  The early 
drop-out subjects had a higher proportion of poor prognostic confounding baseline factors (like higher 
baseline tumour size and larger ECOG scores) which influence PFS.  Once all subjects with PFS ≤2 months 
were removed from the data set, comparable PFS was seen for all quartiles. 
Baseline factors which were found to be significant predictors of PFS were body weight, ECOG 
performance status, baseline tumour size, and M-Stage. Treatment-emergent hypertension was 
associated with a longer PFS.  Other subject characteristics (age, sex, race) or previous anti-VEGF 
therapy were not significantly associated with PFS in subjects with DTC.  An early assessment of change 
in tumour size (Week 8) was also a significant predictor of PFS and higher reduction in tumour size at 
Week 8 was associated with longer PFS. 
The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and lenvatinib exposures, 
which were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets to be used in the subsequent population PK/PD 
analyses. 
 A  PK/PD model was developed to describe tumor growth inhibition by lenvatinib. NONMEM 7.2 was used 
for this purpose. The dataset used for this purpose included data from 374 subjects for which baseline and 
at least one postdose tumour assessment was available.  Out of 374 subjects, 248 subjects received 
active treatment of lenvatinib and 126 subjects received placebo.  A total of 2373 tumour size 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 63/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
observations were included.  Of the 374 total subjects, 183 were female, 295 were white, and 243 had 
papillary DTC. The population age and weight ranged from 21 to 89 years (median = 63 years) and 31 to 
165 kg (median = 74 kg), respectively. Two hundred eighty five subjects received previous anti- VEGF 
therapy. Most subjects were classified with an ECOG PS = 0 (N = 210) or ECOG PS = 1 (N = 152), with 
12 subjects ECOG PS >1. Median baseline tumour size was 59.2 mm, ranging from 15.1 to 331 mm. 
Hypertension Grade 2 or higher was experienced by 68.5% of subjects in the lenvatinib arm compared 
with 14.3% in the placebo arm. 
Eta shrinkage for the 3 parameters of the tumour growth inhibition model, KG, KL and λ, was 34.0%, 
30.5% and 40.0% respectively. The effects of covariates were tested only on both KG and KL as they have 
borderline shrinkage. Previous VEGF therapy, histology effect, and |ECOG > 1 on KG and gender, ECOG 
> 0, baseline tumour size and histology on KL was tested. The number of subjects with M-stage IVB was 
4 (1.05%) and race Black/African American was 8 (2.14%). Thus, the effects of these covariates were not 
tested. 
The multivariate analysis with backward deletion resulted in a final longitudinal tumour size model with 
significant effects of sex, ECOG, and baseline tumour size on KL. Compared to the base model, the 
addition of the 3 significant covariates reduces IIV on KL by 7%. Longitudinal tumour size data was 
described by a linear growth rate constant and linear kill rate dependent of lenvatinib AUC based on dose 
intensity between two tumour assessment and an exponential resistance factor. The final model had 
significant effects of sex, ECOG, and baseline tumour size on KL. The KL was 15.7% lower for subjects 
with ECOG PS >0, was 22.1% lower in females and decreased with the increase in baseline tumour size 
(power function = -0.45). 
Regarding gender, although statistically significant, the effect size was small. The kill rate was 22% lower 
for female compared to males. The subgroup analysis in E7080-G000-303 CSR reported the hazard ratio 
compared to placebo group of 0.21 (95% CI 0.14 – 0.32) for males and 0.26 (0.16 – 0.41) for females.  
Cox univariate regression analysis results for PFS for the lenvatinib arm showed that gender was not a 
significant predictor of PFS.  
PK/PD analysis for tumour size showed that reduction in tumour size (the sum of the longest diameter for 
target lesions) was correlated to lenvatinib exposure (see Figure 2).

Exposure-Response Analyses for Safety 
The objectives of the exposure response analyses for safety of lenvatinib in subjects with DTC (Study 
E7080-G000-201, Study E7080-J081-208, and Study E7080-G000-303) were to explore the relationship 
between lenvatinib exposure and the occurrence of the AEs of hypertension, proteinuria, weight loss, 
fatigue, and thromboembolic event and time to first dose reduction.  
Exposure-response analyses were graphically conducted for hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, nausea, 
and vomiting using AUC based on starting dose and AUC based on dose intensity, which was defined as 
total dose (mg) during the study divided by the duration of study (in days) on a per-subject basis.  
Two  of  the  most  frequently  reported  clinically  significant  events  observed  with  lenvatinib  were 
hypertension and proteinuria, and both are mechanism-related events.  The occurrences of hypertension 
(as  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  [MedDRA]  preferred  term)  and  proteinuria  were 
highest during the first 6 months of exposure, and then declined over subsequent time periods. 
Additional  exposure-response  analyses  for  two  of  these  AEs  (hypertension  and  proteinuria)  were 
conducted  using  binary  logistic  regression  analysis  with  NONMEM  version  7.2.0  (ICON  Development 
Solutions, Ellicott City, MD) interfaced with PDxPop 5.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). 
For the hypertension model, systolic and diastolic blood pressure data obtained during the first cycle in 
subjects with DTC from Studies E7080-G000-201, E7080-J081-208, and E7080-G000-303 were used to 
derive CTC grades.  The PK/PD dataset for hypertension included 1216 hypertension records from 458 
(placebo = 131, lenvatinib treated = 327) subjects.  Proteinuria AE grades were derived from dipstick 
test/24 h urine measurements for Studies E7080-J081-208 and E7080-G000-303.  The PK/PD dataset for 
proteinuria  model  development  consisted  of  6290  proteinuria  AE  records  from  412  (placebo  =  131, 
lenvatinib treated = 281) subjects.  For weight loss and fatigue, thromboembolic events CRF recorded AE 
data were used.  The PK/PD dataset these AE analyses included 5331 AE records from 458 (placebo = 
131,  lenvatinib  treated  =  327)  subjects  from  Studies  E7080-G000-201,  E7080-J081-208,  and 
E7080-G000-303.  Probabilities of having AEs of Grade 0, 1, 2, and higher were estimated as a function 
of lenvatinib exposure and other predictors such as demographics (age, sex, race, body weight), ECOG 
performance status, previous anti-VEGF therapy and prior antihypertensive therapy.  Exposure-response

relationships  for  response  time  to  first  dose  reduction  and  thromboembolic  events  were  evaluated 
graphically. 
Hypertension 
The probability of hypertension Grade 2 and 3 increased gradually with increased in lenvatinib Cmin. Prior 
use of antihypertensive drugs (indicating a prior condition of hypertension) increased the probability of 
experiencing hypertension post-lenvatinib treatment.   
For non-Japanese subjects with no prior condition of hypertension, at the median Cmin of 51.5 ng/mL, the 
probability of hypertension with CTC Grade 2 and 3 was estimated to be 22.9% and 5.11%, respectively.   
For Japanese patients, the probability increased by 5.2% for CTC Grade 2 and 1.82% for CTC Grade 3.  
Data  from  Studies  E7080-G000-201,  E7080-J081-208,  and  E7080-G000-303  showed  that  prior 
hypertension condition increased the probability of CTC Grade 2 and 3 hypertension in Japanese subjects 
by 16.3% and 8.09%, respectively. 
Proteinuria 
The PK/PD analysis for proteinuria indicated that the time course of proteinuria events was described by 
a proportional odds model with the effect proportional to log-transformed lenvatinib cumulative AUC.  The 
slope  of  the  effect  on  the  logit  scale  was  estimated  at  -0.172 ug∙h/mL.    Based  on  data  from  Studies 
E7080-G000-201, E7080-J081-208, and E7080-G000-303, the probability of proteinuria Grade 1 and 2 
increased  rapidly  up  to  cumulative  AUC  values  of  approximately  200 ug∙h/mL  followed  by  a  slow  rise 
thereafter.   
For Japanese patients, slope (logit scale) for the effect of lenvatinib exposure was estimated to be 2.72 
times higher than for non-Japanese.  At the median cumulative AUC of 444 µg*h/mL the probability of 
experiencing proteinuria of CTC Grade 1, 2 and 3 for non-Japanese subjects was 10.1%, 1.21%, and 
0.03%, respectively.  In Japanese patients, the probability increased to 36.7%, 6.92%, and 0.2% for CTC 
Grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
Overall, the results showed that lenvatinib exposure based on starting dose was a significant predictor for 
the occurrence of any grade proteinuria, nausea, and vomiting, and for Grade 3 or higher hypertension.  
Increased  lenvatinib  exposure  based  on  dose  intensity  was  a  statistically  significant  predictor  for  any 
grade hypertension, proteinuria, nausea, and vomiting, and for Grade 3 or higher proteinuria.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Intravenous data were not provided therefore it is not possible to judge whether absorption is high based 
on absolute bioavailability. However, it has been estimated from the mass balance study in humans to be 
in the order of 85.5% (see SmPC section 5.2). In vitro data indicated that lenvatinib permeability was 
comparable to the highly permeable compound prazosin, and 10-fold greater than the poorly permeable 
compound, mannitol. Solubility data showed that the highest clinical dose (24 mg) is not soluble in 250 
mL of water in the pH range of 3 to 7. Therefore, lenvatinib is considered to be poorly soluble but as 
absorption cannot be definitively stated as >90% it is unknown if it is BCS class II or IV. 
Lenvatinib, from both tablet and capsule formulations, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with 
a time to reach maximum concentration of drug in plasma (t max) typically observed 1 to 4 hours post-dose 
(see SmPC section 5.2). The exposure in patients after multiple dosing appeared to be higher than in 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 66/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
healthy volunteers, which has been confirmed in the POPPK analyses, where it is estimated that the CL/F 
in healthy volunteers is 15% higher compared with subjects with malignant solid tumours.   
Although the degree of intestinal/first-pass metabolism via CYP3A4 cannot be determined, data from a 
mass-balance study indicated that it is at most low to moderate. 
Two clinical studies investigated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib, one in healthy 
volunteers and one in patients. Food did not affect the extent of absorption, but slowed the rate of 
absorption.  When administered with food to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations were delayed 
by 2 hours (see SmPC section 5.2).  These studies showed only a minimal effect of food.  Lenvatinib 
capsules should be taken at about the same time each day with or without food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
The capsules should be swallowed whole with water.  Caregivers should not open the capsule, in order to 
avoid repeated exposure to the contents of the capsule. 
A  tablet  formulation  was  used  in  the  early  clinical  development  of  lenvatinib.    A  capsule  formulation, 
which  will  be  the  commercial  formulation,  was  used  for  the  subsequent  development  of  lenvatinib 
including Phase 3 trial. Bioequivalence between the 10 mg lenvatinib capsule (New formulation) and the 
10 mg lenvima tablet (Old formulation) was shown through the bioequivalence Study 001. The observed 
small  differences  in  exposure  with  the  two  formulations  are  not  considered  clinically  relevant. 
Bioequivalence  for  batches  containing  various  levels  of  polymorph  in  the  range  seen  for  batches 
manufactured according to the current manufacturing process and used in the pivotal clinical study was 
shown.  The 4-mg capsule meets the criteria for waiver of in vivo BE studies for lower strengths. 
The  level  of  lenvatinib  protein  binding  is  yet  not  considered  to  be  known.  The  in  vivo  percentage  of 
unbound lenvatinib in plasma in the renal impairment study (Study A001-005) (7.70% ± 3.31%) was 
much higher than what has been observed in vitro (1.4-2.1%) and the reported protein binding in serum 
(96.6-98.2%) (Study E7080-J081-103). This is probably due to the high variability associated with the 
bioanalytical  method  used  for  the  former  study  (reflected  also  in  the  failure  of  the  incurred  sample 
reanalysis: 59 out of 68 samples differed often >70% with the original values).  
Results from the mass balance study indicate that 40% of lenvatinib-related material in plasma (under 
the form of parent and M2) appears to be covalently bound to macromolecules. Considering that covalent 
binding to macromolecules is only one of the different mechanisms of DILI and in view of the 
recommended daily dose the DILI induction potential of lenvatinib is considered low. However, from the 
clinical studies and the treatment emergent liver events noted within these studies the presence of DILI 
associated with lenvatinib administration cannot be ruled out. DILI should be further followed in the 
framework of genetic characterisation of potential predicitive biomarkers for treatment-related safety 
issues (see clinical pharmacodynamic). 
As there is no study with intravenous administration of lenvatinib, the volume of distribution has not been 
determined. In patients, the median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of the first dose ranged from 
50.5 L to 92 L and was generally consistent across the dose groups from 3.2 mg to 32 mg. The analogous 
median apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vz/Fss) was also generally consistent and ranged 
from 43.2 L to 121 L (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Lenvatinib is a substrate for MDR1 (P-gp) and BCRP. However these transporters did not appear to impact 
on the absorption of lenvatinib. In animal studies (rats and monkeys) some distribution to the brain has 
been observed, potentially showing that lenvatinib is only a moderate to weak substrate of P-gp and 
BCRP. Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, and BSEP (see 
non-clinical aspects and SmPC section 5.2).  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 67/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In vitro, cytochrome P450 3A4 was shown as the predominant (>80%) isoform involved in the P450 
mediated metabolism of lenvatinib.  However, in vivo data indicated that non-P450-mediated pathways 
contributed to a significant portion of the overall metabolism of lenvatinib.  Consequently, in vivo, 
inducers and inhibitors of CYP 3A4 had a minimal effect on lenvatinib exposure (see SmPC sections 5.2 
and 4.5). 
In human liver microsomes, the demethylated form of lenvatinib (M2) was identified as the main 
metabolite (see also non-clinical aspects).  M2’ and M3’, the major metabolites in human faeces, were 
formed from M2 and lenvatinib, respectively, by aldehyde oxidase . 
Data from a human mass balance/excretion study indicated lenvatinib is extensively metabolised in 
humans.  The main metabolic pathways in humans were identified as oxidation by aldehyde oxidase, 
demethylation via CYP3A4, glutathione conjugation with elimination of the O-aryl group (chlorbenzyl 
moiety), and combinations of these pathways followed by further biotransformations (e.g., 
glucuronidation, hydrolysis of the glutathione moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and 
intramolecular rearrangement of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates with subsequent 
dimerisation).  These in vivo metabolic routes align with the data provided in the in vitro studies using 
human biomaterials (see SmPC section 5.2). 
The totality of data gathered from the different clinical studies for which phenotype data were available 
(476 subjects in total), showed that there was no effect of phenotypes for CYP2C19 on lenvatinib 
exposure (data not shown). Given the limited effect of ketoconazole and rifampicin on lenvatinib 
pharmacokinetics, CYP3A4 metabolism does not seem to be of importance for lenvatinib metabolism. 
Therefore, there is no need to discuss its genetic polymorphism. In vitro data indicate that lenvatinib is a 
BCRP substrate, however, in vivo information concerning the involvement of this transporter in the 
pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was lacking. From the available data, it is agreed that ketoconazole 
represents the ‘worst case’ scenario for BCRP inhibition. From the in vivo study with ketoconazole, even 
if the effect on the PK of lenvatinib was completely due to BCRP inhibition (and none to inhibition of P-gp), 
it is concluded that the effect was relatively small (15% and 19 % increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively). 
In the same line, the effect of any BCRP polymorphism on lenvatinib PK would be equally or less than what 
has been observed with ketoconazole.  
Lenvatinib is characterised by a moderate to high variability with regards to PK parameters in cancer 
patients, whereas in healthy volunteers variability appeared to be low. This could partially be explained by 
a variability in drug distribution due to changes in body size or to the ratio of fat to total mass (lenvatinib 
is  a  lipophilic  drug)  which  could  be  different  in  patients  vs.  healthy  subjects.  It  has  been  shown  that 
weight  has  an  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenvatinib,  although  this  was  not  considered  to  be 
clinical significant. An additional source of variability could be variable protein levels in cancer patients. 
Information  on  intra-patient  variability,  both  in  healthy  subjects  and  patients  has  been  provided  and 
lenvatinib showed a high intra-subject variability for Cmax and a moderate intra-subject variability for 
AUC, both in patients and healthy volunteers. 
No formal assessment of the dose proportionality of single and multiple doses was submitted. 
Interpretation of the data from Study E7080-E044-101 was difficult due to the low number of patients 
included and the high variability. In addition, there appeared to be non-linearity for Cmax in study 
E7080-J081-103. Additional analysis was conducted to assess the PK nonlinearity using popPK analysis. 
When using data from the capsule and tablet formulation the dose effect on CL/F and F1 was confounded 
and, hence, the influence of dose was estimated to be more appropriately tested simultaneously on both 
CL/F and F1, as was performed in the final PK model.  The nonlinearity on Cmax was not supported by the 
results of the PopPK analysis.

Regarding time-dependency, the extent of accumulation was minimal in subjects with QD dosing of 
clinically relevant doses of lenvatinib. 
Special populations 
Subjects with severe renal impairment were predicted to have a 2.4-fold increase in exposure compared 
to the average exposure seen in subjects from a Phase 2 study who had 131I-refractory, unresectable DTC. 
According  to  these  results,  an  effect  of  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  on  lenvatinib 
pharmacokinetics appears negligible and no dose adjustment is judged necessary.  
It  is  unknown  whether  there  is  a  change  in  the  plasma  protein  binding  in  renally  impaired  subjects. 
Considering that the within-study, relative comparisons of PK data based on unbound drug concentrations 
across groups, which may offset systematic error occurring in the sample analysis, do not rule out the 
possibility  that  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  may  be  exposed  to  higher  unbound  drug 
concentrations  compared  to  other  renal  function  groups.  Therefore,  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment should be carefully monitored, and a dose reduction is recommended. The recommended 
starting dose is 14 mg taken once daily.  Further dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual 
tolerability.  Patients with end stage renal disease were not studied, therefore the use of lenvatinib in 
these patients is not recommended (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2).  
The applicant is recommended to determine of unbound drug concentrations in patients with renal 
impairment, taking into account that the assessment of renal impairment should be based on free 
fraction. 
Based on the results of study A001-006 (hepatic impairment), it is concluded that patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment would most likely have the same benefit from the 24 mg dose as patients 
with no hepatic impairment. Therefore, no adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of hepatic 
function in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. For severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a dose adjustment is proposed based on total drug concentrations 
and steady state projections. The recommended starting dose is 14 mg taken once daily.  Further dose 
adjustments may be necessary on the basis of individual tolerability (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). As 
for patients with renal impairment, it is unknown whether there is a change in the plasma protein binding 
in hepatically impaired subjects and the Applicant is recommended to provide the determination of 
unbound drug concentrations in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving up to 24 mg lenvatinib once daily, 
age,  sex,  weight,  and  race  (Japanese  vs.  other,  Caucasian  vs.  other)  had  no  significant  effects  on 
clearance (see SmPC sections 5.2 and 4.2). The higher incidence of AE in the Japanese population did not 
appear  to  be  linked  to  changes  in  the  lenvatinib  exposure  in  this  population,  but  rather  to  a  higher 
sensitivity of Japanese patients to VEGF inhibition. No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis 
of race and age (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Subjects with body weight <60 kg had 36% higher exposure compared with subjects >60 kg and it is 
considered  that  this  small  effect  of  body  weight  on  lenvatinib  exposure  does  not  warrant  any  dose 
adjustment. Simulations showed that there is an important effect of the combination of bodyweight and 
liver function on drug exposure. This effect surprisingly did not show any impact on neither hypertension 
nor  proteinuria  and  the  absence  of  a  valid  PKPD  model  for  drug  efficacy  prevented  for  exploring  the 
impact on drug efficacy. This is expected to be further explored based on the results of the planned study 
211 (see RMP).  
Lenvatinib must not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns identified 
in animal studies (see non-clinical section and SmPC section 5.3).  The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in 
EMA/250082/2015

children aged 2 to <18 years have not yet been established (see sections on clinical efficacy and clinical 
safety and SmPC section 5.1).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Results from study Study E7080-A001-004 suggest that strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors have a small 
effect on lenvatinib exposure.  
Like ketoconazole, rifampin is well established as an inhibitor of transporters including P-gp following 
single dose administration (Reitman et al., 2011). Overall, the data indicate that there is a small 
drug-drug interaction between lenvatinib and P-gp inhibitors and CYP3A inducers. Therefore, no dose 
adjustments are required when coadministering lenvatinib with known PXR agonists.  
Co-administration of temozolomide with lenvatinib (24 mg QD) did not alter lenvatinib’s PK parameters. 
Concomitant administration of lenvatinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has no significant impact on the PK 
of any of these 3 drugs. The potential of drug-drug interaction study with a variety of other anti-neoplastic 
agents has been discussed by the applicant from a mechanistic perspective, especially the ones relevant 
for common concomitant medications. Based on the data provided, drug-drug interactions with other 
anti-cancer agents are not expected clinically. 
In vitro, the proportion of the aldehyde oxidase (AOX) contribution to the lenvatinib metabolism is 
estimated to 17.4%, the proportion for CYP1A2 is 2.4% to 7.6% and for CYP2B6 is 3.0% to 6.7%.  Little 
is still known about PK interaction of this enzyme AOX. However, its inhibition is observed with many 
drugs (Obach RS et al. 2004). Neither lenvatinib nor its metabolites have been shown to inhibit aldehyde 
oxidase (DMPKT2012-004), so there is no reason to expect that lenvatinib would lead to any effects on 
the clearance and so exposure of any coadministered drugs that are predominantly metabolised via 
aldehyde oxidase. 
Results from in vitro studies with human microsomes have shown that lenvatinib exhibit time-dependent 
inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4 (see non-clinical aspects). Due to insufficient data on the risk of induction at 
the intestinal level, the poor predictive value of the PBPK model for induction, the observed in vitro signal 
for inhibition and the major importance of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of drugs, the MAH will perform an in 
vivo study with midazolam as a probe substrate for CYP3A4 (see Risk Management plan) to investigate 
correctly the potential of lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction.    
No data is available that can be used to exclude the risk that lenvatinib could be an inducer of CYP3A4 or 
Pgp in the gastrointestinal tract. This could potentially lead to decreased exposure to oral CYP3A4/Pgp 
substrates. This should be considered if co-administering oral CYP3A4/Pgp substrates for which retained 
efficacy is very important (see SmPC section 4.5).  Awaiting the result of this DDI study, CYP3A4 
substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, 
quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)) should therefore be administered 
with caution in patients receiving lenvatinib (See SmPC section 4.5).  
For a drug intended for use in fertile women, the potential for drug interactions and common adverse 
events (e.g. thromboembolic events) with the oral contraceptives should always be considered. It is 
currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. When 
the results of the midazolam study become available, the Applicant is recommended to discuss the 
potential interaction with oral contraceptives in light of these results and to consider the need for an 
additional DDI study with oral contraceptives. Awaiting these results, women using oral hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method (see SmPC sections 4.5 and 4.6).   
A minimal DDI risk for S- and R-Warfarin is expected when co-administered with lenvatinib. There is also 
a minimal DDI risk for lenvatinib when co-administered with thyroxine. For the effect of lenvatinib on 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 70/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
thyroxine, TSH is routinely monitored in patients with RR-DTC who are taking angiogenic TKIs and 
thyroxine doses are implemented or adjusted as needed. Therefore, even if this is known that angiogenic 
TKIs elevate levels of serum TSH, it is agreed that a drug-drug interaction study is not required. 
Pharmacodynamic 
Regarding genetic differences as assessed in tumor samples, although there was improved clinical benefit 
observed in the RAS mutated subset in Study 201, the small sample size in this single arm Phase 2 study 
does not allow to draw firm conclusions.  Nevertheless, RAS mutations were identified as potential 
predictors of benefit. In the retrospective analysis conducted in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
(Study 303), lenvatinib PFS benefit compared with placebo appeared to be maintained regardless of BRAF 
or RAS mutation status. However, the retrospective character of this subgroup analysis and limited 
number of patients do not allow drawing definitive conclusions on predictive value of particular mutational 
status for lenvatinib benefit. Even though activity of lenvatinib is claimed in all patients with RR-DTC 
irrespectively of molecular characteristics of tumours, targeting of multiple kinases and anti-proliferative 
activity in patients harbouring tumors with particular mutations would allow better individualization of 
benefit-risk assessment, what is particularly important in patients with higher risk of toxicities. 
Genetic background of patients was associated with efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents in numerous 
studies. Therefore, analysis of host genetic factors that would predict efficacy and/or safety of lenvatinib 
is recommended. Prospective collection of constitutive DNA samples in clinical studies is recommended to 
enable retrospective genetic characterisation of potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy and of 
treatment-related safety issues (e.g. hypertension, proteinuria, serious liver injury cases, etc).   
Many of undersirable effects of TKIs are on-target effects of these drugs given that tyrosine kinases are 
widely distributed with specific functional roles in different organs (Shah et al, 2013).  
Although not studied directly with lenvatinib, the mechanism of action (MOA) for hypertension is 
postulated to be mediated by the inhibition of VEGFR2 in vascular endothelial cells.  Similarly, although 
not studied directly, the MOA for proteinuria is postulated to be mediated by downregulation of VEGFR1 
and VEGFR2 in the podocytes of the glomerulus.  The mechanism of action for hypothyroidism is not fully 
elucidated (see SmPC section 5.1). Thyroid disfunction is among the most common endocrine 
sytem-related adverse events of thyrosine kinase inhibitors with several mechanisms proposed in relation 
to thyroid gland integrity, thyroid hormone transport and methabolism (Lodish, 2013; Illouz et al, 2014). 
At least three serum biomarkers (VEGF, Ang2, and soluble Tie2 (sTie2)) investigated in the Phase 3 study 
appeared to be of value to predict lenvatinib treatment outcomes in DTC. However, further validation is 
needed. Changes in CAFs (in Studies 201 and 303) that correlated with lenvatinib exposure did not show 
consistent significant correlations with clinical outcome measures such as change in tumor size 
(maximum tumor shrinkage) PFS and OS. Combination of mutation status and serum biomarkers appears 
to improve their predictive value (Sherman et al, 2011). 
No firm conclusions could be drawn for other types of biomarkers due to the limited number of patients, 
such as biomarkers of apoptosis, imaging biomarkers or circulating endothelial cells. 
Further investigation of predictive value of serum biomarkers is expected in the planned clinical study 211 
(see RMP). At least three of the biomarkers explored in the study 303 (VEGF, Ang2, and soluble Tie2) 
should be explored. A new PK/PD model, including data from study 211, is also expected and should 
ideally describe the effect of CAF on tumor size on a continuous time scale. 
Given an inter-individual variability and heterogeneity in tumor response, monitoring of multiple 
biomarkers, rather than relying on a single biomarker, would be advantageous (Sharan and Woo, 2015). 
It seems unlikely that the use of single biomarker will be sufficient to predict efficacy and/or toxicity and 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 71/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
to account to tumor heterogeneity and genetic heterogeneity at tumor and host levels (Vasudev and 
Reynolds, 2014). It is important to translate candidate biomarkers into valid biomarkers to increase 
efficacy and decrease toxicity while improving overall guided personalised therapy. 
With regard to the relationship between plasma concentration and effect, the applicant used an empirical 
and sequential approach to describe the changes in biomarkers and clinical endpoints related to drug 
efficacy. The approach was non informative for dose selection. An integrated and mechanism-based 
approach would have given more insight in the understanding of drug PK/PD and inform optimal dose 
selection. The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and lenvatinib 
exposures, which were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets to be used in the subsequent population 
PK/PD analyses. An indirect model was used to describe tumor size and different predictors including 
exposure and CAF changes were tested using multiplicative models. The fact that drug exposure and CAF 
changes were concomitantly used as predictors was found to be an issue given their possible correlation. 
Overall, the model used was not considered valid and therefore no conclusion can be drawn on the 
correlation between reduction in tumour size and lenvatinib exposure and whether the effect of gender, 
ECOG, and baseline tumour size affected this relationship. The results of a new modeling as mentioned 
above is expected before valid concludions can be drawn in this regard. 
In tumor growth inhibition model, correlation was shown between reduction in tumor size and lenvatinib 
exposure. However, given some limitations of the model used, a post marketing modelling study was 
recommended that will include some newly collected data in a study to be conducted (study 211). 
PK/PD models were also developed to study the exposure response for hypertension and proteinuria. 
Hypertension is a known dose-related effect of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies and it has been 
considered to be a biomarker of the efficacy of these agents (Chen and Cleck, 2009; Rixe, et al., 2009; 
Dienstmann, et al., 2011). A preliminary indirect model was developed only using data from study 201. 
Albeit not fully mechanistic, the indirect model used to describe drug effects on blood pressure from study 
201 was considered acceptable and could be used for predictive purposes. 
For the pooled data analysis for hypertension, the data were categorized and treated as a binary variable 
and a logistic model was developed to describe them. A number of issues regarding the model were 
discussed by the Applicant including the use of dose instead of presence of concomitant antihypertensive 
drugs, consideration of other (more mechanistic) model to describe their effects, justification of the 
choice of the parameter on which the effects were imputed and the addition of a markov element in case 
valid arguments could be provided to justify categorization of blood pressure in a binary variable. An 
indirect model instead of a logistic model would have been more adequate. Therefore no conclusion can 
be drawn at this stage and the company is requested to use the indirect instead of logistic model for blood 
pressure in the PK/PD modelling that will be conducted upon completion of study 211 (see RMP). 
For the pooled data analysis for proteinuria, the data were treated as a categorical variable and a logistic 
model was developed to describe them. A Markov element was then added and endorsed. Based on the 
results from the model development stage, a PKPD model with Markov element and with logarithmic 
relationship for CAUC was superior to other exposure relationships. The PK/PD modelling that will be 
conducted upon completion of study 211 will provide further information on the dose-exposure-response 
relationships for drug safety including proteinuria. 
Lenvatinib belongs to a class of drugs that potentially can prolong QT. However, the available clinical 
data, as well as the results of a published thorough QT study in healthy volunteers (Shumaker, 2014) 
showed  only  a  minimal  effect  of  lenvatinib  on  QT  prolongation.  Nevertheless,  QT/QTc  interval 
prolongation has been reported at a higher incidence in patients treated with lenvatinib than in patients 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 72/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
treated with placebo (see SmPC section 5.1). QTc prolongation is an important potential risk addressed in 
the Risk Management plan.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib has been investigated to an acceptable extent. Overall, the 
potential for in vivo DDI with lenvatinib can be considered as low. In vitro, it was shown that lenvatinib 
inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C8, UGT1A4, UGT1A1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 but clinical relevant inhibition 
can be excluded.  
An in vivo study with midazolam as a probe substrate for CYP3A4 is expected to provide further data on 
the potential of lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction (see RMP).   
In order to correctly characterise the dose-exposure-response relationships for clinically relevant 
endpoints either for drug efficacy (PFS and response rate) or for drug safety (hypertension, proteinuria, 
hematology, etc) (see also clinical safety) and ultimately to optimise dose recommendation, additional 
PK/PD analyses should be done post-marketing based on already available and newly acquired data. An 
integrated and mechanism-based model should be used and blood pressure should be modelled as 
continuous variable when data from the study 211 will be available. The data analysis plan for PK/PD 
modelling including clear description of the study design optimization ensuring collection of informative 
data during this study will be provided at the time of submission of the clinical study 211 protocol. The 
results of the integrated and mechanism-based PK/PD modelling will be submitted at the time of 
submission of the CSR (see RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of lenvatinib (E7080, Lenvima), 4 mg and 10 mg capsules, for the treatment of 
patients with progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), is based on one 
pivotal Phase 3 study E7080-G000-303 (Study 303, the ‘SELECT’ trial). Supportive efficacy data for the 
RR-DTC indication were provided by: 
- Study E7080-G000-201 (Study 201), a multicentre, international, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study 
in subjects with advanced cancer (RR-DTC or MTC) and, 
- Study E7080-J081-208 (Study 208), an ongoing, multicentre, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study in 
Japanese subjects with advanced thyroid cancer (RR-DTC, MTC or ATC).

E7080-J081-103 (Study 103) and E7080-J081-105 (Study 105)) were conducted to determine the

maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenvatinib and the optimal dosing regimen. These studies examined 
escalating doses of lenvatinib administered QD or BID using continuous and interrupted dosing schedules.   
Study 101 
In Study 101, escalating doses of lenvatinib from 0.2 to 32 mg were given QD in continuous 28-day cycles 
to 82 patients with advanced solid tumours or lymphomas resistant or refractory to existing therapies or 
for whom no treatment was available. 
In this study, a clear dose-response trend was observed with respect to partial response and progressive 
disease. However, there was also a clear relationship between dose and the probability of developing 
hypertension and proteinuria. Both the hypertension and proteinuria were manageable. Hypertension 
was managed with antihypertensive agents at the first occurrence of a diastolic BP >100 mmHg and dose 
reduction, if needed.  Proteinuria was managed with dose interruption or reduction with no need for renal 
support.  Dose reductions were required for 11% of the subjects with hypertension and for 17% of the 
subjects with proteinuria. As the dose increased, the number of patients requiring a dose reduction 
increased. Proteinuria was the dose-limiting toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
lenvatinib was determined to be 25 mg QD. Dose reductions were required in 54% of subjects at the MTD 
of 25 mg QD.

 Data from Study E7080 E044-101. In Study 101, escalating doses of lenvatinib from 0.2 to 32 mg were given QD in 
continuous 28-day cycles to 82 subjects with advanced solid tumours.  The initial dose levels and number of subjects 
in each group were as follows:  0.2 mg (n = 4), 0.4 mg (n = 4), 0.8 mg (n = 4), 1.6 mg (n = 3), 3.2 mg (n = 3), 6.4 
mg (n = 3), 12 mg (n = 12), 12.5 mg (n = 9), 16 mg (n = 6), 20 mg (n = 3), 25 mg (n = 24), and 32 mg (n = 7).

Study 102 (monotherapy portion) was a dose escalation study with 2 dosing schedules examined 
(Schedule 1 - dose escalation from 0.1 mg BID to 3.2 mg BID in a 7 days on/7 days off schedule; then 
Schedule 2 - dose escalation from 3.2 mg BID to 12 mg BID with continuous daily dosing). The study was 
conducted in 77 patients with solid tumours or resistant/refractory lymphomas. The MTD was determined 
to be 10 mg BID with continuous dosing.  
Study 102 recruited 6 subjects who had thyroid cancer (5 with MTC and 1 with DTC).  Three subjects with 
MTC had a PR; the initial dose was lenvatinib 5 mg BID for one subject and was 8 mg BID for the 2 other 
subjects.  One subject with MTC and the 1 subject with DTC had stable disease (SD). 
Study 103 
Study 103 was a dose-escalation study (0.5 to 20 mg BID) in which 27 Japanese subjects with advanced 
solid tumours were treated with lenvatinib BID in a 2 week on/1 week off schedule. The MTD was 
determined to be 13 mg BID. 
Study 105 
Study 105 was a dose-escalation study in which 9 Japanese patients with solid tumours who were 
resistant to standard therapies were treated with lenvatinib (20 and 24 mg) on a once daily dose schedule 
in 28-day cycles. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in either the 20-mg or 24-mg QD group. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
E7080-G000-303 (SELECT) (study 303) 
Study E708-G000-303- (Study 303) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study in subjects who had RR-DTC and had radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 
12 months. 
Methods 
The  study  was  conducted  in  3  phases:  Pre-randomisation,  Randomisation  and  Extension  Phases.  The 
design of Study 303 is depicted in the Figure below. 
Figure 3: Design of the Study 303 (‘SELECT’)

OOL = optional open label, PD = progressive disease, R = randomisation 
a: After confirmation of the progression of the disease, only subjects who requested to receive OOL lenvatinib were 
unblinded to the study drug administration. Only those subjects who received placebo as the blinded study drug could 
receive OOL lenvatinib. Subjects who did not wish to participate in the OOL Phase entered the Follow-up Period of the 
Extension Phase. 
• 
The  Prerandomization  Phase  included  a  screening  period  to  establish  subject  eligibility  and  a 
baseline period to establish disease characteristics prior to treatment and to confirm eligibility.  
• 
The Randomization Phase was the blinded study treatment phase, which began when the first 
subject was randomly assigned to treatment and ended at the time of the data cut-off for the primary 
study analysis (214 progression events or deaths prior to disease progression).  
Subjects  received  blinded  study  drug  until  documentation  of  disease  progression  (confirmed  by 
Independent Imaging Review (IIR)), development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.  
Subjects were evaluated for tumour response every 8 weeks or sooner if clinically indicated.  
Subjects who discontinued treatment due to disease progression entered the Extension Phase. Subjects 
who  discontinued  treatment  for  any  reason  other  than  disease  progression  were  followed  in  the 
Randomization Phase until disease progression or start of another anticancer treatment; these subjects 
then entered the Extension Phase for survival follow-up. All subjects on treatment at the time of the data 
cut-off for the primary analysis entered the Extension Phase. 
• 
The Extension Phase included an optional, open-label (OOL) Lenvatinib Treatment Period and a 
Follow-up Period.  
Subjects in the placebo arm who had disease progression confirmed by IIR could request to enter the OOL 
Lenvatinib  Treatment  Period  and  receive  lenvatinib  treatment.  Subjects  entering  the  OOL  Lenvatinib 
Treatment Period have to have baseline tumour assessments re-established unless the last assessment in 
the Randomization Phase was performed within the following time periods before OOL Cycle 1/Day 1: 4 
weeks for body and brain CT/MRI scans and 6 weeks for bone scans.  
After  the  primary  analysis  was  completed,  subjects  treated  with  lenvatinib  who  had  not  experienced 
disease progression could request to continue open-label lenvatinib at the same dose, according to the 
clinical judgment of the investigator.  
Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding could be treated with lenvatinib in the OOL Lenvatinib 
Treatment Period immediately or at the time of progression after a documented discussion of the risks 
and benefits with the investigator. Qualified subjects received lenvatinib treatment in the OOL Lenvatinib 
Treatment  Period  until  disease  progression  (investigator’s  assessment),  development  of  intolerable 
toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.  
Subjects  who  had  disease  progression  during  the  Randomization  Phase  and  did  not  enter  the  OOL 
Lenvatinib  Treatment  Period  and  all  subjects  who  discontinued  lenvatinib  treatment  entered 
the Follow-up Period. Subjects were followed for survival, and all anticancer treatments were recorded 
until the time of death. The Follow-up Period will continue as long as study subjects are alive or until 
discontinuation of survival follow-up by the sponsor. 
Independent Imaging Review (IIR) 
Sites were required to submit all tumor assessment scans (CT/MRI/bone) to the IIR within 2 working days 
of acquisition. Scans submitted to the IIR were to be reconciled on an ongoing basis with entries in the 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 77/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
clinical electronic case report form (eCRF) for subject, date, anatomy, modality, and nominal time point. 
Once a time point was reconciled, it was to be read by 2 IIR radiologists. 
Essentially, for a subject to be considered as having confirmed PD and therefore to stop therapy based on 
progression, a minimum of 2 readers (either both at the IIR or one each at the IIR and the investigator 
site radiologist) had to determine PD at the current time point. 
Study Participants  
Approximately 360 patients with RR-DTC and radiographic evidence of disease progression within the 
prior 12 months (+1 month screening window) were planned for randomization in this study.

Extension Phase - OOL Lenvatinib treatment period 
Inclusion criteria 
1. Placebo-treated subjects in the Randomisation Phase who had progressive disease (PD) confirmed by 
IIR, and who requested treatment with lenvatinib. 
2. Subjects who continued to satisfy inclusion criteria 6-20 and exclusion criteria 4-16 as presented in the 
study protocol 
3. Subjects with maximum interval between the day of confirmation of PD by IIR and Cycle 1/Day 1 of the 
OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period of ≤3 months. 
4. No systemic anticancer treatment during the interval between the day of confirmation of PD by the IIR 
and Cycle 1/Day 1 of the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period. 
Treatments 
Randomisation Phase 
The starting dose of lenvatinib was 24 mg QD in the Randomization Phase. Lenvatinib 24 mg or matching 
placebo were taken orally as 2 capsules of 10 mg and one capsule of 4 mg, once daily (QD), continuously.  
A treatment cycle was defined as 28 consecutive days. 
If a subject missed a dose, it could be taken within the 12 hours following the usual time of the morning 
dose. If more than 12 hours elapsed from the time of the usual daily dose, study drug was to be taken the 
next day at the usual time in the morning. If the subject vomited after study drug administration, the 
subject was not to take another dose until the next scheduled dose. 
Criteria for interruption of treatment, dose reduction, and resumption of treatment 
Dose reductions occurred in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, and 10 mg QD). Any 
dose reduction below 10 mg QD had to be discussed with the sponsor. Once the dose was reduced, it 
could not be increased at a later date.  
Dose reduction and interruption instructions for subjects who experience treatment-related toxicity were 
as described in Table below: 
Table 23: Study treatment dose reductions and interruption instructions 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 80/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All prior medications (including over-the-counter medications) administered 30 days prior to the first 
dose of study drug and any concomitant therapy administered to the subject during the course of the 
study (starting at the date of informed consent) until 30 days after the final dose of study drug were 
recorded. Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures relating to malignancy were 
recorded. Any medication which was considered necessary for the subject’s health and which was not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of, or interact with, study drug could be continued during the 
study. 
Treatment of complications or AEs or therapy to ameliorate symptoms (including blood products, blood 
transfusions, fluid transfusions, antibiotics, and antidiarrheal drugs) could be given at the discretion of 
the investigator, unless it was expected to interfere with the evaluation of, or to interact with, study drug. 
Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were 
allowed but were to be used with caution. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-CSF) or equivalent 
could be used in accordance with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), institutional, or national 
guidelines. Erythropoietin could be used according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the 
subject was to be carefully monitored for increases in red blood cell (RBC) counts. 
If concomitant medication/therapy was administered for an AE, investigators recorded that AE on the 
Adverse Events CRF.

Sample size 
The sample size estimate was based on the primary endpoint, PFS, with the assumptions that survival 
follows an exponential distribution, an HR of 0.5714 corresponding to a 75% improvement when 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 82/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparing lenvatinib versus placebo (from a median of 8 months PFS for subjects treated with placebo to 
14 months for those treated with lenvatinib), 2-tailed α = 0.01, 90% power, and an enrollment rate of 20 
subjects per month. 
Based on the above assumptions and the consideration of a 10% dropout rate, approximately 360 
subjects were to be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio into the lenvatinib versus placebo arms, 
respectively. 
A total of approximately 214 PFS events (progression, or deaths in the case of no progression) were 
required for the final analysis of PFS. The 214 PFS events were estimated to occur approximately 29 
months (18 months, enrollment period; 11 months, follow-up period) after the start of the Randomisation 
Phase. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation Phase 
Eligible subjects were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the 2 study drugs, administered 
continuously as QD oral dosing within 28-day treatment cycles: lenvatinib 24 mg or matched placebo. 
Randomisation was performed centrally by an interactive voice and web response system. 
The  randomisation  scheme  was  stratified  by  region  (Europe,  North  America,  Other),  age  group  (≤65 
years  or  >65  years),  and  no  prior  VEGF/VEGFR  targeted  therapy  vs  one  prior  VEGF/VEGFR  targeted 
therapy (0, 1). 
Extension Phase - OOL Lenvatinib treatment period 
Subjects randomized to placebo: 
  who experienced disease progression (confirmed by IIR) during the randomisation phase could 
request to enter the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period and receive lenvatinib treatment 
 
at the time of unblinding due to the completion of the study primary analysis of PFS subjects could 
be treated with lenvatinib in the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period immediately or at the time of 
progression after a documented discussion of the risks and benefits with the investigator. 
Subjects  randomized  to  lenvatinib:  who  had  not  experienced  disease  progression  at  the  time  of 
unblinding due to the completion of the study primary analysis could request to continue lenvatinib at the 
same dose. 
Blinding (masking) 
Subjects received blinded study drugs (lenvatinib or matching placebo) during the randomisation Phase 
of the study. The subject and all personnel involved with the conduct and the interpretation of the study, 
including investigators, study site personnel, and Sponsor staff, were blinded to treatment codes. Study 
drugs  were  packaged  by  the  sponsor  as  double-blinded  supplies  for  the  Randomisation  Phase  of  the 
study, and lenvatinib was packaged as open label drug for the Extension Phase of the study. 
Statistical methods 
General principles 
Results  were  summarized  using  frequency  and  percentages  for  categorical  data  and  mean,  standard 
deviation  (SD),  median,  minimum,  maximum  for  continuous  data.  All  analyses  have  been  performed 
separately  for  Randomisation  Phase  and  OOL  Lenvatinib  Treatment  Period  respectively  except  OS 
analysis.  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 83/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint, PFS, was compared between lenvatinib and placebo using the stratified log-rank 
test two-sided alpha level of 0.01 stratified by region (European, North America, Other), age group (≤ 65, 
> 65 years), and prior VEGF/VEGFR therapy (0, 1). The test was performed when the target number of 
214 progression or deaths prior to disease progression occurred. The calculation of PFS as the primary 
analysis was based on disease progression as determined by tumour assessments performed by IIR. The 
unstratified  log-rank  test  has  been  performed  as  supportive.  The  treatment  effect  was  further 
characterized  by  the  hazard  ratio  (HR,  lenvatinib/placebo)  with  associated  2-sided  95%  and  99% 
confidence intervals (CIs). This estimate has been provided using the Cox proportional hazards model 
stratified by region, age, and prior anti-VEGF/VEGF therapy. The median and quartiles for PFS, and the 
PFS  rates  at  6,  12,  18,  and  24  months,  were  calculated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  (K-M)  product-limit 
estimates  for  each  arm,  and  presented  with  2-sided  95%  CIs.  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was 
performed on the Intent to Treat analysis set with Per-Protocol analysis set as supportive. The following 
sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint (PFS) were conducted: 
1. 
Using the actual reported date of progression by IIR or death to define PFS regardless of missing 
assessments, treatment discontinuation, or use of new anticancer therapy 
2. 
3. 
Using the radiologic assessment data from the investigator and death to define PFS 
Using the uniform scheduled date of radiologic assessment to define the date of censoring and 
events depending on equivalence of radiologic assessment intervals between 2 treatment arms. 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
After achieving statistical significance at α = 0.01 (2-sided) with primary endpoint, PFS, in favour of the 
lenvatinib arm, the secondary endpoints of ORR and OS were to be compared between the treatment 
arms by controlling the overall family-wise error rate at level α = 0.05, using the fixed sequential testing 
procedure. The ORR was tested first at the 0.05 level. If the ORR achieved statistical significance at the 
0.05  level  (2-sided)  in  favour  of  the  lenvatinib  arm,  then  the  OS  was  to  be  tested  at  the  0.05  level 
(2-sided). 
  Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
The  null  hypothesis  of  no  difference  in  ORR  between  lenvatinib  versus  placebo  was  tested  using  the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, stratified by region, age, and 
prior  VEGF/VEGFR  therapy.  The  ORR  and  corresponding  2-sided  95%  CIs  using  asymptotic  normal 
approximation was calculated by treatment arm. The 2-sided 95% CIs of the differences and odds ratio 
(lenvatinib versus placebo) in the ORRs between lenvatinib and placebo were calculated using asymptotic 
normal approximation. 
  Overall Survival (OS) 
Since  placebo-treated  subjects  develop  disease  progression  can  crossover  to  active  treatment,  to 
estimate the true treatment effect on OS, the rank preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model was 
planned to estimate OS curves as the primary analysis for survival. The difference in OS between the 2 
treatment arms was evaluated using a bootstrap method. The adjusted K-M curves for the placebo arm 
with adjusted HR and 95% CI were estimated. 
Overall survival curves were also estimated using an unadjusted K-M method and compared between 
treatment arms using the stratified log-rank test in the Intent-to-Treat Set. The Cox proportional hazards 
model was used to estimate the HR of lenvatinib versus placebo for OS and its 95% CI (stratified by the 
factors used for the PFS analysis). Additionally, the inverse probability of censoring weighted analysis was 
performed as a sensitivity analysis (see conduct of the study).

Results 
Participant flow 
Randomisation Phase 
A total of 392 patients (n=261 lenvatinib, n=131 placebo) were randomized to receive treatment (ITT 
population). The Per Protocol (PP) population consisting of subjects who were randomised and received at 
least one dose of assigned study drug– IIR comprised 384 patients (n=257 lenvatinib, n=127 placebo). 
Figure 4: Flowchart of subject disposition in Randomisation Phase 
a: Adverse events, including non-PD death, reported as the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment by the 
investigator. (This number does not include all AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, only those events recorded 
by the investigator as the primary reason for discontinuation.) 
b: Disease progression reported by the investigator as the reason for withdrawal from the study. This differs from the 
number of subjects with progressive disease in the primary efficacy analysis, which followed FDA censoring guidelines 
for PFS and was determined by formal independent imaging review (IIR) by 2 radiologists, with adjudication where 
necessary. 
c:  Disease  progression  not  confirmed  by  IIR  includes  subjects  with  disease  progression  as  assessed  by  the 
investigator. In 7 cases (lenvatinib 3; placebo 4), postbaseline imaging scans were not performed, and in 21 cases 
(lenvatinib 20; placebo 1), postbaseline scans were available but IIR did not confirm disease progression; however, the 
investigator withdrew the subject from treatment.

occurred on 15 November 2013 following the occurrence of 214 progression events or death events 
without disease progression. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The original protocol was approved on 19 January 2011. There were 5 protocol amendments: Amendment 
01 (08 January 2011), Amendment 02 (07 July 2011), Amendment 03 (10 April 2012), Amendment 04 
(20 February 2013), and Amendment 05 (19 February 2014). 
The main amendments are presented below. 
Amendment  01  added  an  inclusion  criterion  specifying  that  eligibility  must  exclude  possible  curative 
surgery.  
Amendment 02 led to the addition of an exploratory objective of efficacy and safety for the Optional Open 
Label E7080 Treatment Period, of the corresponding analysis set and clarification in regard to separate 
analysis of OLL data. Clarifications were provided in regard to a separation of biomarker assessments and 
pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomics assessments to improve comprehension and clarification regarding 
planned analyses of gene mutations that may affect ADME. 
Amendment 03 provided clarifications in regards to eligibility criteria in the OLL part, the timing of tumor 
assessments in randomisation and OLL phases, collection of tumor sample at any time during the study 
and in regard to the types of CT/MRI, bone, and brain scans to be used and the procedures for performing 
tumor assessments. Dose reduction and interruption instructions were modified to allow dose reductions 
at  first  occurrence  of  intolerable  Grade  2  toxicity;  clarified  that  each  dose  reduction  is  a  one-level 
reduction and occurs in succession based on the previous dose level. 
Amendment 04 
• As of this amendment, subjects randomized to placebo who experienced disease progression and chose 
to enter the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period were enrolled at a 1-level dose reduction of lenvatinib, i.e., 
20 mg QD, per Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommendation. 
•  After  completion  of  the  study  primary  analysis,  at  the  time  of  unblinding,  subjects  treated  with 
lenvatinib who had not experienced disease progression could request to continue lenvatinib at the same 
dose. Subjects taking placebo and who had radiographic evidence of disease progression could receive 
lenvatinib starting at 20 mg QD, per DMC recommendation. 
Amendment 05 (implemented after the cutoff date for the primary analysis) 
• Included guidance on the management of hepatotoxicity and thromboembolic events per agreement 
with the Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure (VHP). 
• Required unblinding of all subjects remaining on randomized treatment after the data cutoff for the 
primary analysis. 
• After having completed the primary analysis, subjects treated with lenvatinib who had not experienced 
disease  progression  could  request  to  continue  lenvatinib  at  the  same  dose,  according  to  the  clinical 
judgment of the investigator. Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding could be treated with 
lenvatinib  in  the  OOL  Lenvatinib  Treatment  Period  immediately  or  at  the  time  of  progression  after  a 
documented discussion of the risks and benefits with the investigator. The starting dose of lenvatinib was 
reverted back to 24 mg QD, because the results from the completed randomized provided definitive and 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 87/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
highly  significant  evidence  of  efficacy  for  the  dose  regimen  starting  with  24  mg,  while  maintaining  a 
positive benefit/risk ratio. 
Changes to the planned analyses 
Before treatment unblinding 
The definitions of the Per Protocol Analysis Set and Safety Analysis Set were changed from those stated 
in the protocol as follows: 
• Per Protocol Analysis Set included those subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
the assigned study drug and had no major protocol deviations. The population included those who had 
both baseline and at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment, or those who died within 125 days after 
randomisation in the absence of post-baseline tumor assessment. This was the secondary analysis set for 
all tumor response related efficacy endpoints. 
• Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received any amount of study drug. This was the analysis 
set for all safety evaluations. 
After treatment unblinding 
Changes to the planned analyses after treatment unblinding included the following: 
• The IPCW analysis (Robins and Finkelstein, 2000) was planned as a sensitivity analysis. 
The analysis was tested but not fully implemented because the statistical model did not converge. 
•  Due  to  a  limited  amount  of  archived  tumor  tissue,  the  GEP,  proteomic,  and  IHC  analyses  were  not 
conducted. 
• Ad hoc sensitivity analyses were requested by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) as follows: 
− PFS by time from most recent PD to the time of randomisation (of ≤ 3 or >3 months) 
−  Time  to  treatment  failure  (time  from  randomisation  until  objective  tumor  progression,  use  of  new 
anticancer therapy, and treatment discontinuation due to any other reasons such as toxicity, withdrawal 
of consent, etc.) 
− PFS using the worst case scenario when missing data were considered events. This analysis was not 
performed because in this study missing radiologic assessments were minimal and the treatment effect 
was large, therefore, worst case scenario would not change the overall result. 
• Additional ad hoc analyses were performed to better characterize the benefit-risk profile of lenvatinib  
− disposition, efficacy, and exposure by responder/non-responder status 
− correlation of efficacy and safety with treatment-emergent hypertension 
− time to dose reduction 
− dose level at which response first reported 
− AE rates before and after dose reduction 
− AE rates by additional baseline and demographic subgroups 
− weight change by body mass index (BMI) 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 88/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• The PK data were summarized by actual concentration, not by dose-normalized concentrations as stated 
in the SAP. This was done to be consistent with a previous lenvatinib study (E7080-G000-204). The mean 
dose at each sample collection time point was added to the figure. 
Protocol deviations 
In  the  randomisation  phase,  major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  4  (1.5%)  subjects  in  the 
lenvatinib arm and 4 (3.1%) subjects in the placebo arm. One subject in the lenvatinib arm had 2 major 
protocol deviations: an overdose of study medication (144 mg) and deviation from eligibility criterion 
(subject had brain metastases and was not off steroids for 1 month prior to start of study drug). For two 
other patients eligibility criteria were not met (blood pressure outside the range; brain metastases and 
was not off steroids for 1 month prior to start of study drug) and one more subject had thoracocentesis for 
malignant pleural effusion. In placebo arm, eligibility criteria were not met for three patients and one 
patient received cytoreductive surgery and withdraw from the study. 
One subject treated with 24 mg of lenvatinib in the OOL Treatment Period had a major protocol violation. 
This subject had radiotherapy during lenvatinib treatment.

Prior therapies 
Overall, excluding cancer therapies, 90.4% of subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 84.7% of subjects in the 
placebo arm had received at least one prior medication (see Table below). The type and frequency of prior 
medications in the 2 treatment arms were comparable. The most frequently reported prior medications 
(>15%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment  arm)  were  in  the  following  ATC  classes:  Alimentary  Tract  and 
Metabolism (67.4% lenvatinib; 58.0% placebo), Nervous System (52.1% lenvatinib; 48.9% placebo), 
Musculoskeletal System (31.8% lenvatinib; 26.0% placebo), Cardiovascular System (27.6% lenvatinib; 
27.5% placebo), Blood and Blood Forming Organs (24.5% lenvatinib; 26.0% placebo), and Respiratory

Randomisation Phase  
All 392 subjects randomly assigned to treatment in the study were included in both the Full Analysis Set 
(Intent to-treat [ITT]) and the Safety Analysis Set. The Per Protocol Analysis Set excluded 8 subjects with 
major protocol violations (see above) and 1 subject who had no postbaseline assessments and comprised

383  (97.7%)  subjects,  256  (98.1%)  subjects  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  and  127  (96.9%)  subjects  in  the 
placebo arm. The Full Analysis Set was the primary analysis set used for efficacy analyses. 
The analysis sets and the number of patients in each analysis set are summarised in Table below.

Extension Phase - OOL Lenvatinib treatment period 
The OOL Lenvatinib Analysis Set included 109 of the 131 (83.2%) subjects in the placebo arm who 
entered the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period and crossed over to OOL lenvatinib.  
As of the 15 Jun 2014 cutoff, of the 8 subjects who were receiving placebo in the randomization phase as 
of 15 Nov 2013, 6 subjects crossed over to the OOL Lenvatinib treatment phase.

•  Secondary efficacy endpoint -  overall survival  
Using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model without making any adjustments for placebo-treated 
subjects who crossed over to treatment with open-label lenvatinib, the HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.07, 
p=0.1032) at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. The median OS had not been reached for either 
the lenvatinib group or the placebo group. The OS rates were numerically higher in the lenvatinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm (12 months: 81.6% vs 75.4%, respectively; 18 months: 72.3% vs 
62.5%, respectively; 24 months: 58.2% vs 54.6%, respectively). 
Updated OS analysis at data cutoff date June 2014 is presented below.

groups (HR=0.53; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.82, p=0.0051). The difference had already bordered statistical 
significance at the data cutoff for the primary efficacy analysis (see Table 32).

An analysis of concordance of the BOR between tumor assessments by the IIR and by investigator for 
each subject using a weighted Kappa coefficient for interrater agreement, showed substantial agreement; 
the Kappa observed was 0.69 for the lenvatinib arm and 0.70 for the placebo arm, where 0 is no 
agreement and 1 is perfect agreement. 
The ORR, based on the IIR assessments, in the per protocol analysis set, was consistent with the ORR 
based on the IIR assessments in the full analysis set. The ORR, based on the IIR assessments, in the per 
protocol analysis set, was 65.2% (95% CI: 59.4, 71.1) in the lenvatinib arm and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0, 2.3) 
in the placebo arm. The difference between the 2 arms was 64.4% (95% CI: 58.4, 70.5). The odds ratio  
was 29.20 (95% CI: 12.25, 69.59), which was statistically significant (p<0.0001) in favour of lenvatinib 
treatment.

Additional  ad  hoc  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  time  of  the  tumour  shrinkage.  Lenvatinib 
induced a rapid onset of tumour shrinkage, with an initial large reduction (median reduction >20%) in the 
sum of the diameters of target lesions at the first tumour assessment (8 weeks after randomisation), 
followed by a slower decline that continued despite dose interruptions or dose reductions. The maximum 
percentage of tumour shrinkage was correlated with longer treatment duration. In subjects who had a 
dose reduction due to toxicity, the majority of tumour shrinkage occurred during treatment with the 24 
mg dose, prior to the first dose reduction. 
• 
Efficacy outcome(s) to subsequent treatments  
Study 303 was not planned or designed to evaluate subsequent lines of therapy, i.e., progression-free 
survival 2 (PFS2) or end-of-next-line-treatment. There was no further radiology data collected after 
lenvatinib discontinuation. Therefore, PFS2, in this situation, is estimated by end of next treatment. 
A total of 108 lenvatinib subjects and 10 placebo subjects discontinued due to PD and did not enter the 
OOL treatment period (lenvatinib subjects were not eligible for the OOL treatment period). Only 40 (37%) 
lenvatinib and 4 (40%) placebo subjects received next-line anticancer therapy. Median PFS2 (as 
end-of-next-line therapy) for the lenvatinib subjects was 16.1 months (95% CI: 12.6, 19.7) and was 4.2 
months (95% CI: 0.3, 11.6) for the placebo subjects. Further, a total of 48 lenvatinib and 5 placebo 
subjects discontinued treatment due to reasons other than PD. Of these subjects, 17 lenvatinib (35.4%) 
and no placebo subjects received next-line anticancer treatment. Median time to progression or death for 
the lenvatinib subjects was 16.4 months (95% CI: 8.9, NE). Four of the 5 placebo subjects died; median 
time to progression or death was 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.9, NE).

All efficacy analyses for the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period were descriptive only. All efficacy endpoints 
for the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period using the OOL analysis set were considered exploratory. 
Results 
Data cutoff date:  15 Nov 2013 
Patients’ disposition is presented in Figure 6. 
More subjects have received the 24 mg starting dose of lenvatinib, and these subjects received lenvatinib 
treatment for a longer duration than those whose starting dose was 20 mg. Median duration of treatment 
was  more  than  2  times  longer  in  subjects  taking  the  24  mg  regimen  than  in  those  taking  the  20  mg 
regimen: 8.9 months (range: 0 to 25 months) and 3.9 months (range: 0 to 8 months), respectively.  
• 
• 
• 
The  median  PFS,  as  assessed  by  the  investigators,  for  all  subjects  in  the  OOL  Lenvatinib 
Treatment  Period  was  10.1  months  and  was  12.4  months  for  those  who  received  the  24  mg 
lenvatinib regimen. The median was not yet reached at the time of data cutoff  for those who 
received the 20 mg regimen due to the short follow-up time. The PFS curves appeared similar for 
the 24 mg and for the 20 mg regimens through the end of follow-up for the 20 mg regimen. 
The BOR for the OOL subjects included CR in 1 subject (1.2%) and PR in 44 subjects (53.7%) 
taking the 24 mg regimen and PR in 12 subjects (44.4%) taking the 20 mg regimen. This resulted 
in an ORR of 52.3% (95% CI: 42.5, 61.9) for all the OOL subjects combined and an ORR of 54.9% 
(95% CI: 43.5, 65.9) for the 24 mg regimen and 44.4% (95% CI: 25.5, 64.7) for the 20 mg 
regimen. 
The DCR was 72.5% for the OOL subjects combined and was 76.8% for the 24 mg regimen and 
59.3% for the 20 mg regimen. The CBR was 67.0% for all the OOL subjects combined and was 
72.0% for the 24 mg regimen and 51.9% for the 20 mg regimen. 
Although  comparisons  between  the  dose  regimens  are  difficult  to  make  due  to  differences  in  subject 
numbers,  exposure  to  lenvatinib,  and  length  of  follow-up,  the  ORR,  DCR,  and  CBR  were  numerically 
greater for the 24 mg regimen compared to rates achieved for subjects treated with the 20 mg regimen. 
Data update – data cutoff date: 15 Jun 2014 
A total of 115 subjects were treated with lenvatinib in the OOL treatment period as of the 15 Jun 2014 
cutoff, since of the eight (8) subjects who were receiving placebo in the Randomization Phase as of 15 Nov 
2013 six (6) subjects crossed over to the OOL lenvatinib treatment phase (3 subjects each received OOL 
lenvatinib 24 mg or 20 mg). Subjects who received the 20-mg regimen represented a small (n=30) 
subset of the overall population. The remaining 85 subjects received lenvatinib at a starting dose of 24 
mg. 
Furthermore, only placebo-treated subjects who had confirmed disease progression (by IIR) during the 
Randomization Phase and who met protocol-specified eligibility criteria were treated with lenvatinib in the 
OOL phase of the study. Consequently, these patients were further advanced in the course of their 
disease, since they had experienced 2 sequential, confirmed disease progressions (by IIR)—the first 
before randomization at the time of study entry and the second during treatment with study drug in the 
Randomization Phase. 
Because the allocation of patients to the OOL phase of the study happened sequentially and was not 
randomized, major intergroup differences were observed. Baseline patient characteristics, previous 
treatments, geographical allocation, on-study placebo exposure, lenvatinib exposure in the OOL phase, 
as well as median follow up times vary considerably for these 2 dose regimens. Therefore, the 30 subjects 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 110/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
who received the 20-mg regimen represent a different population compared with those subjects who 
received the 24-mg regimen in both the Randomization Phase and the OOL lenvatinib treatment phase.  
All 6 placebo-treated subjects who crossed over were still receiving OOL lenvatinib treatment as of 15 Jun 
2014. Of the 58 placebo-treated subjects who were ongoing in the OOL lenvatinib treatment phase as of 
15 Nov 2013, 49 subjects were still receiving OOL lenvatinib (31 subjects started at a 24-mg dosage and 
18 started at a 20-mg dosage) as of 15 Jun 2014 and 9 subjects had ended treatment (6 for radiographic 
PD, and 1 each for AE, withdrawal of consent, and clinical progression with death).  
For all 115 subjects combined, the median PFS as of 15 Jun 2014, based on investigator assessments in 
the OOL Lenvatinib treatment period, was 22.1 months (95% CI: 9.4, NE). Median PFS was 17.5 months 
(95% CI: 8.3, NE) for subjects in the 24-mg regimen and not estimable (95% CI: 10.9, NE) for subjects 
in the 20-mg regimen. PFS rate at 6 months was 74.9% vs 71.1% and at 12 months – 68.1% vs 53.2%, 
respectively. The ORR (CR+PR) was 52.9% (95% CI: 41.8, 63.9) for subjects in the 24-mg cohort and 
60.0% (95% CI: 40.6, 77.3) in the 20-mg cohort. The estimated PFS rates for all 115 subjects were as 
follows: 72.1% at 6 months, 56.7% at 12 months, 52.7% at 18 months, and 47.4% at 24 months. Almost 
all subjects at the ≥ 12-month time points were receiving the 24-mg regimen. 
The BOR as of 15 Jun 2014 for all subjects combined was as follows: CR in 1 (0.9%) subject (who received 
the 24-mg regimen), partial response (PR) in 62 subjects (53.9%), and stable disease (SD) in 26 subjects 
(22.6%). This resulted in an ORR (CR+PR) of 54.8% (95% CI: 45.2, 64.1) for all of the subjects in the 
OOL treatment period combined. The ORR was 52.9% (95% CI: 41.8, 63.9) for subjects in the 24-mg 
cohort and 60.0% (95% CI: 40.6, 77.3) in the 20-mg cohort. 
Study 201 
Study 201 was a multicenter, multinational, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study. The purpose of this 
study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  lenvatinib  in  subjects  with  advanced  thyroid  cancer 
stratified by histological subtypes RR-DTC and MTC. 
At the start, eligible subjects were dosed with one 10 mg tablet BID. The starting dose was changed to 24 
mg QD as per Protocol Amendment 01. The basis for the increase in the starting dose was the PK/PD 
analyses of the results of the 2 Phase 1 studies (Study 101 and Study 102). Of the 58 subjects in the 
RR-DTC cohort, 2 subjects were treated with lenvatinib 10 mg BID and 56 subjects with lenvatinib 24 mg 
QD given continuously in 28-day cycles.  
The Treatment Phase began at the time that the first subject began study drug administration and ended 
at  the  time  at  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff  for  the  primary  study  analysis  (when  all  enrolled  subjects 
completed 8 cycles of treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to the eighth cycle). All subjects 
then entered the Extension Phase. The Extension Phase consisted of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up 
Period.  The  Extension  Phase  began  immediately  after  the  Treatment  Phase  ended  and  included  all 
subjects  who  were  either  still  receiving  treatment  or  in  follow-up.  For  subjects  who  discontinued 
treatment due to disease progression, survival was followed during the Follow-up Period of the Extension 
Phase.  
At  the  time  of  DCO  (11  April  2011),  of  the  58  RR-DTC  subjects  who  received  lenvatinib,  23  (39.7%) 
subjects continued treatment in the Extension Phase and 35 (60.3%) subjects were discontinued from the 
treatment  in  the  Treatment  Phase  (including  the  2  subjects  who  received  one  10-mg  tablet  BID); 
18 (31.0%)  due  to  disease  progression,  14  (24.1%)  with  an  AE(s)  as  the  primary  reason  for 
discontinuation,  3  subjects  (5.2%)  discontinued  due  to  other  reasons  including  subject  choice  and 
withdrawal of consent. The median duration of exposure was 12.9 months (range:  0.7 - 17.7 months).  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 111/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The median total amount of drug (total dose) taken per subject was 5,350 mg (range:  480 - 11,880 mg).  
The median dose intensity (mg/day) per subject was 19.5 mg/day (range:  7 - 24 mg/day).   
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study, the ORR based on assessments by the IIR, was 50.0% (95% 
CI:  36.6, 63.4). No subject had a BOR of CR. PR was observed in 50.0% of subjects and SD in 43.1% of 
subjects. Durable SD (SD for a minimum of 23 weeks) was observed in 27.6% of subjects. 
The median duration of response for the responders (n=29) was 12.7 months (95% CI: 8.8, NE).   
Secondary efficacy results were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
The median estimate of PFS was 12.6 months based on assessment by the IIR. 
The 6-month and 12-month PFS rates were 77.7% and 54.7%, respectively.   
The median OS based could not be reliably estimated due to a relatively short follow-up time for 
OS.    The  median  follow-up  time  was  16.1  months  (range:    15.0 - 16.6).    The  OS  rate  at  12 
months was 85.8% and at both 18 and 24 months was 77.9%.   
•  Based on assessments by the IIR, the DCR was 93.1% (95% CI:  83.3, 98.1) and the CBR was 
77.6% (95% CI:  64.7, 87.5).  
• 
The median time to response for responders in the Efficacy Evaluable Population (n=28) was 3.6 
months.   
Results for secondary efficacy endpoints based on the investigators’ assessments were similar to those 
based upon IIR.   
The  efficacy  variables  were  also  evaluated  separately 
for  subjects  who 
received  prior 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy and those who did not.  The numbers of subjects with or without prior 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted treatment were small which limited the comparisons of the results, however the 
following was observed.  The ORR, based on assessments by the IIR, was 58.8% (95% CI:  32.9, 81.6) 
in subjects with prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted treatment (n=17) and was 46.3% (95% CI:  30.7, 62.6) in 
subjects without prior VEGF therapy (n=41).  
As of the 15 Jun 2014 cutoff, 7 RR-DTC subjects were still receiving treatment and 37 (63.8%) subjects 
with RR-DTC had died. 
After a median follow-up time of 51.6 months, the median OS was 32.3 months (95% CI: 23.3, 35.8) 
compared with 27.7 months [95% CI: 27.7, NE]) as of the cutoff date of 15 Sep 2013. 
Study 208 
Study 208 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study. The purpose of this study is 
to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  lenvatinib  in  Japanese  subjects  with  advanced  thyroid  cancer, 
stratified by histological subtypes i.e. RR-DTC, MTC and ATC. The evaluation of efficacy is a secondary 
objective. Secondary efficacy outcomes are PFS, OS, ORR, DCR and CBR. Eligible subjects are to receive 
lenvatinib 24 mg by continuous QD dosing given continuously in 28-day cycles.   
The study start date was 03 Sep 2012.  An interim CSR, based on the DCO date of 15 Sep 2013, has been 
provided. 
Tumour assessments using RECIST 1.1 are to be performed by the investigators during the Pre-treatment 
Phase and then every 8 weeks after the first dose for RR-DTC subjects.   
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 112/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
At the time of DCO, 22 subjects with RR-DTC received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib.  Nineteen subjects 
(86.4%) were still receiving study drug at the DCO date, and 3 (13.6%) had discontinued:  2 (9.1%) due 
to disease progression and 1 (4.5%) due to subject choice.   
At the time of DCO, the median duration of exposure was 4.5 months (range: 0.7 - 11.0 months).  The 
median total amount of drug (total dose) taken per subject was 1487 mg (range:  332 - 5832 mg).  The 
median dose intensity (mg/day) per subject was 13.8 mg/day (range:  7.5 - 20.3 mg/day).   
• 
The median PFS was not estimable at the DCO date, as 2 subjects had disease progression and 20 
subjects were censored without events.   
•  At the time of DCO, the response rate was evaluated in 21 subjects, as 1 subject did not have a 
post-baseline tumour assessment reported during the study.   
•  No subjects had a complete response, 10 of 21 subjects (47.6%) had a BOR of PR.   
• 
• 
The ORR was 47.6% (95% CI:  25.7, 70.2).   
Eleven subjects (52.4%) had a BOR of SD.   
•  At the time of DCO, the disease control rate (DCR= CR+PR+SD) was 100.0% (21/21) and the 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR=CR+PR+durable SD) was 78.6% (11/14).   
• 
The median OS could not be estimated at the DCO date for subjects as only 1 RR-DTC subject. 
As of the 15 June 2014 cutoff, 23 RR-DTC subjects had been treated with lenvatinib, which includes one 
additional RR-DTC subject enrolled since the cutoff date of 15 Sep 2013. Treatment was still ongoing for 
20 subjects with RR-DTC. One of 23 subjects had died. 
The ORR (CR+PR) based on investigator’s assessments was 69.6%, the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) 
was 100.0%, and the best overall response was PR in 16 subjects (69.6%) and SD in 7 subjects (30.4%). 
Median PFS had not yet been reached, and median OS was not estimable.

Paediatric population 
Paediatric Investigation Plan was first agreed with the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) on 28 May 2013 
(EMEA-001119-PIP-01-11). Measure 5 of the PIP related to the treatment of papillary and follicular 
thyroid cancer (which together comprise differentiated thyroid cancer) includes an open-label, 
multi-centre, non-controlled trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability and 
safety of lenvatinib in children from 2 years to less than 18 years of age with a relapsed or refractory solid 
malignant tumour and, in patients with osteosarcoma, an extension phase to evaluate lenvatinib in 
combination with ifosfamide and etoposide.  
No other separate clinical studies have been undertaken to investigate the clinical efficacy of lenvatinib in 
special populations. Mostly PK data were provided by studies in patients with renal and hepatic 
impairment.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-finding 
The initial clinical experience with lenvatinib in thyroid cancer came from the Phase 1 Study 102.   
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) analysis of the results of the two Phase 1 
studies (Study 101 and Study 102) indicated that PFS and response (PR or durable SD) significantly 
increased with higher lenvatinib exposure.  With a half-life of 28 hours, the steady state would be 
achieved within 5 days. Therefore, given the totality of the data from Study 101, a starting dose of 
lenvatinib 25 mg QD was proposed.  Lenvatinib 25 mg QD maximizes efficacy (antitumor activities) while 
inducing a degree of hypertension controllable by administration of antihypertensive therapy. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 116/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To simplify drug administration in view of the two strengths developed (10 mg and 4 mg capsules), a 
dosage of 24 mg QD (two 10-mg capsules plus one 4-mg capsule) was selected for continued lenvatinib 
development. 
Based on the results of the Phase 2 studies, the Phase 3 Study 303 was designed using a lenvatinib 
dosage of 24 mg QD given continuously in 28-day cycles, with a dose interruption and reduction 
management plan implemented based on observed adverse events (AE).  Standard supportive therapies 
would also be used to treat the AEs.  Thus, the dose of lenvatinib was individualised for each subject over 
the course of the study to maximize anti-tumour response and minimize adverse events.   
Clinical efficacy 
The primary evidence for the efficacy of lenvatinib for the target indication comes from one pivotal Phase 
3 study, E7080-G000-303 (Study 303), and is supported by data from a Phase 2 study, E7080-G000-201 
(Study 201) and an ongoing Phase 2 Study, E7080-J081-208 (Study 208).  
Protocol assistance from the CHMP was solicited throughout the development program for lenvatinib. The 
design and methodology of the pivotal study was reviewed and considered adequate. Since at the time of 
this study protocol initiation and until recently, there was no authorised effective therapy for RR-DTC, the 
use of placebo as control in the pivotal Study 303 is considered acceptable. 
The independence of the confirmation of progressive disease status at study entry and of disease 
progression prior to discontinuation of therapy in the randomization phase, and the independence of 
tumour assessments review for the primary analysis of PFS were reassuring the quality and reliability of 
the study data. 
The claimed indication for lenvatinib is the treatment of patients with progressive, radioiodine-refractory 
differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). The definition of RR-DTC was congruent with that used for the 
sorafenib pivotal Phase 3 study and is considered appropriate. 
All but 3 subjects in the lenvatinib arm had metastatic disease. These 3 subjects had locally advanced 
disease that met inclusion criteria. The response to treatment (efficacy and safety) of these 3 subjects 
with locally advanced disease was clinically apparent (one subject achieved complete response) and was 
consistent  with  that  observed  for  the  overall  study  population  and  the  majority  of  subjects  who  had 
metastatic disease (data not shown). 
Follicular thyroid cancer includes oncocytic follicular (Hürthle) cell carcinoma, which is associated with a 
poorer outcome, less favourable response to RAI and distinct molecular features. A post-hoc analysis in 
Hürtle cell subtype population, however, showed that the efficacy and safety in these patients are in line 
with those in the overall population (data not shown). 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  Study  303  appropriately  reflect  the  target  population  of  the 
indication  sought.  In  addition,  subjects  having  had  one  previous  VEGF/VEGFR  targeted  therapy  were 
eligible. As this subpopulation of patients was excluded from therapy with sorafenib and with an unmet 
medical need, the inclusion of such patients is endorsed. In Study 303, approximately one-fourth of the 
randomized subjects have had a previous VEGF/VEGFR targeted therapy, mainly consisting of sorafenib 
(approximately 77 %). 
The  use  of  a  blinded  and  independent  radiological  assessment  of  PFS  in  order  to  reduce  possible 
investigator bias and the conduction of sensitivity analyses in order to assess the robustness of the PFS 
results in accordance with current EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1) are endorsed. 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 117/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Randomization  was  stratified  according  to  geographic  region,  age  and  prior  VEGF/VEGFR-targeted 
therapy in order to minimize the potential for imbalance between the treatment groups with respect to 
pre-treatment characteristics that may influence treatment response. 
Cross-over to lenvatinib was optional for subjects initially randomized to placebo either at the time of 
disease progression during the Randomization Phase or at the time of the completion of the study primary 
analysis of PFS and mandatory unblinding of treatment assignment.  
The use of concomitant supportive medication and use of an algorithm of dose interruptions/reductions to 
manage toxicity outlined in the study protocol is endorsed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The subject demographic and baseline characteristics of Study 303 (randomization phase), were 
generally well balanced between both treatment arms. The percentage of subjects with an ECOG PS of 0, 
1 or 2 was similar across treatment arms. One subject in the lenvatinib arm had an ECOG PS of 3, which 
was considered a minor protocol deviation. 
Prior cancer therapies and procedures were similar in the two treatment arms. The subject disease 
characteristics at study entry were generally balanced between both treatment arms. A higher 
percentage of subjects had a histological diagnosis of PTC (66.1% overall, 64.8% lenvatinib, 68.7% 
placebo vs subjects with a diagnosis of FTC: 33.9% overall, 35.2% lenvatinib, 31.3% placebo).  The type 
and frequency of metastatic disease were similar in the two treatment arms. Approximately half of all 
subjects (56.3% lenvatinib, 56.5% placebo) had hypertension at baseline. Subgroup analysis showed 
consistent results between patients with papillary thyroid cancer (66.1%) and other subgroups, such as 
in patients with follicular thyroid cancer (33.9%) which included Hürthle cell 14.8% and clear cell 3.8%. 
The estimation of benefit becomes more difficult in smaller patients populations, especially when 
considering such groups as separate pathological entities with potentially distinct activity due to 
differences in pathogenic pathways involved. From this point of view, types of DTC (papillary/ follicular/ 
Hürthle cell) are specified in the indication (see SmPC section 4.2). 
RR-DTC is characterized by very heterogeneous clinical behaviour as relative to size; location and growth 
dynamics of metastases. All patients included into the pivotal study had progressive disease but the rate 
of tumour growth was not known. No personalized therapeutic strategies could be proposed based on 
available data and decision when to start therapy would depend on benefit/risk assessment in individual 
patients.  
RR-DTC patients are generally asymptomatic at the time of progression. Symptomatic disease was not a 
requirement for a start of therapy. Given that symptomology and PRO collection were not a part of pivotal 
study design, no data are available to date. The CHMP recommends collecting such data, along with 
adherence safety and efficacy data in the planned Study 211.  
Study  303  met  its  primary  objective  of  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  benefit  of 
lenvatinib  as  measured  by  PFS.  Based  on  blinded  IIR  and  FDA  guidance  on  PFS  censoring,  lenvatinib 
prolonged  median  PFS  by  14.7  months  compared  with  placebo  (18.3  months  vs  3.6  months, 
respectively). The HR was 0.21 (stratified Cox proportional hazard model, 99% CI: 0.14, 0.31) in favour 
of lenvatinib. The difference in PFS between lenvatinib and placebo was highly significant (p<0.0001) 
using both stratified and unstratified log-rank tests. 
The results of the PFS analysis in the per protocol analysis set and of all 3 planned sensitivity analyses 
using  different  progression  events  were  all  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  The  HRs  for  all  the 
analyses  were  comparable  (0.21  to  0.24).  The  log-rank  tests  all  showed  a  statistically  significant 
difference between lenvatinib treatment and placebo (p<0.0001). 
EMA/250082/2015

Analyses of the secondary endpoints ORR and OS support the demonstrated efficacy of lenvatinib for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of PFS. 
ORR, based on IRR assessments in the full analysis set, was significant higher with lenvatinib treatment 
compared  with  placebo  (64.8%  vs  1.5%;  OR:  28.87,  p<0.0001).  The  ORR,  based  on  investigator’s 
assessment in the full analysis set, was consistent with the ORR based on IRR assessment. Moreover, the 
ORR based on the IIR assessments in the per protocol analysis set, was consistent with the ORR based on 
the IIR assessments in the full analysis set. 
The overall survival analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between treatments but this 
is not surprising given the study was not powered for it. The results are also confounded by the fact that 
the majority of placebo subjects crossed over to lenvatinib after disease progression. Nevertheless the 
survival results are numerically better for lenvatinib than placebo and there is certainly no evidence of a 
detrimental effect of treatment.  
As of the most recent cutoff date of 15 Jun 2014, the OS analysis still showed a numerical superiority for 
lenvatinib with an HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.12; P=0.1993). The RPSFT-adjusted HR was 0.53 (95% 
CI:  0.34,  0.82),  in  favour  of  the  lenvatinib  arm.  The  difference  in  OS  between  the  2  treatment  arms 
became statistically significant as determined using the resampling method (bootstrapping) (P=0.0051). 
With a median follow-up period of 23.6 months in the lenvatinib arm, the median OS was not yet reached. 
In the placebo crossover arm with a median follow-up of 24.1 months, the median OS was 19.1 months 
(95% CI: 14.3, not estimable [NE]). Although RPSFT model is one of the most commonly methods used 
to estimate survival time after treatment switching, it has some serious limitations. The main assumption 
in  this  model  is  that  treatment  effect  is  the  same  regardless  of  when  the  experimental  treatment  is 
initiated, e.g. delayed start of experimental treatment has the same effect as starting upfront. However, 
this structural assumption is untestable and, bearing in mind how a patient’s prognosis changes after 
disease  progression,  it  is  also  likely  to  be  untrue.  This  adjustment  is  therefore  likely  to  result  in  a 
treatment effect over-estimation. The results are also sensitive to the method used for determination of 
acceleration  factor  F  and  the  re-censoring  is  applied  to  all  censored  patients  irrespectively  of  switch. 
Bearing all this in mind, the results from the adjusted model can only be used as supportive.  
The results of the analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints of Study 303 (DCR, CBR and durable SD rate) 
overall further support the clinical effectiveness of lenvatinib. 
Hypertension is a known dose-related effect of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies and it has been reported 
to  be  a  biomarker  of  the  efficacy  of  these  agents.  Therefore,  ad  hoc  analyses  were  conducted  to 
investigate the relationship between the treatment-emergent AE of hypertension and the effectiveness of 
lenvatinib  treatment  (data  not  shown).  The  various  ad  hoc  analyses  (PFS,  OS,  ORR  and  tumour 
shrinkage) overall further support the concept that the treatment-emergent AE of hypertension can be a 
predictive biomarker of tumour response and target inhibition. However no conclusions can be drawn at 
this stage on the predictivity of such biomarkers for the activity of lenvatinib.  
At a request of CHMP during protocol assistance, the Applicant did a comparative analysis of the efficacy 
and safety of lenvatinib and the recently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of RR-DTC 
sorafenib. Whereas the baseline demographic characteristics were in general similar for both Phase 3 
studies,  a  number  of  differences  in  study  design  and  disease  characteristics  suggest  that  subjects  in 
Study 303 had a slightly poorer prognosis. The differences in populations might have contributed to the 
differences  observed  between  the  placebo  arms  of  the  two  studies.  Nevertheless,  broadly,  both  the 
pivotal study 303 for lenvatinib and the sorafenib pivotal trial had similar eligibility criteria and endpoints. 
In  both  studies,  the  active  treatment  highly  significantly  improved  PFS  (p<0.0001)  compared  with 
placebo. However, the difference in median PFS between the active treatment and placebo arms was 14.7 
EMA/250082/2015

months in  Study 303 and  5.0 months in the DECISION study. The CIs of the  HR of lenvatinib versus 
placebo in Study 303 (0.21; 99% CI: 0.14, 0.31) were lower than, and did not overlap compared with 
those of sorafenib versus placebo in the DECISION trial (0.59; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.76). 
Study 303 was not planned or designed to evaluate subsequent lines of therapy, i.e., progression-free 
survival 2 (PFS2) or end-of-next-line-treatment. PFS2 was estimated by end of next treatment. The data 
shown were therefore limited in quantity and represented an ad-hoc exploratory evaluation. Overall, the 
PFS2 analyses do not allow drawing valid conclusions. It is recommended to include PFS2 estimation in 
the planned study 211. 
In the OOL phase, efficacy between the starting doses of 24 mg and 20 mg was compared. Similar results 
in terms of PFS and ORR were observed for the starting doses of 24 mg and 20 mg. Overall, considering 
the small number of patients, and possible confounding factors, firm conclusions could not be based on 
the results provided (see discussion on starting dose under clinical safety). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the efficacy of lenvatinib in the proposed indication has been shown. Lenvatinib (24 mg QD) 
demonstrated statistically (p<0.0001) and clinically meaningful prolongation of PFS by 14.7 months 
compared to placebo, as assessed by IIR. The HR was 0.21 (99% CI: 0.14, 0.31). The PFS results were 
robust, as established by using multiple sensitivity and secondary efficacy analyses. 
At the time of primary PFS analysis, there was no obvious sign of detrimental effect in OS. However, the 
OS data were immature. An updated OS analysis still showed a numerical superiority for lenvatinib with 
an HR of 0.80, although non-significant. Exploratory analyses of OS to correct for cross-over did not 
reveal any concerns in terms of a possible detriment in terms of OS. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety profile of lenvatinib is based on a pooled analysis of data from 1108 subjects from completed 
studies who had received single agent lenvatinib on a continuous basis.  It includes 452 subjects with 
RAI-refractory DTC who received the recommended dose in the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial and two 
Phase 2 clinical trials.  
Ten clinical studies in cancer patients, who received single-agent lenvatinib continually, including Study 
303, were pooled for the integrated safety analysis (see table below).

The safety cut-off date for these studies was 15 September 2013, except for Study 303 (safety cut-off 
date was 15 March 2014).  The main analyses of safety were based on the following 4 safety sets for the 
pooled studies, with emphasis on the studies in patients with RR-DTC.   
1)  DTC Randomized Safety Set (N=392):  Placebo-treated (N=131) and lenvatinib-treated (N=261) 
subjects from the randomized portion only of Study 303 
2)  DTC Non-randomized  Safety  Set  (N=191):  Lenvatinib-treated  subjects  with  DTC  from 
Studies E7080-G000-201 and E7080-J081-208, and the optional open-label (OOL) portion of 
Study 303 
3)  All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=452):  Lenvatinib-treated subjects from Studies 201, 208, and 
303 (both the randomized and the OOL portions of the study) 
4)  Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set (N=656):  All subjects who received single-agent lenvatinib 
continually  in  cancer  studies,  excluding  DTC:    Studies  E7080-E044-101,  E7080-A001-102 
(monotherapy cohort/continuous dosing), E7080-E044-104, E7080-J081-105, 201 (subjects 
with  medullary  thyroid  cancer  [MTC]  only),  E7080-G000-203  (monotherapy  cohort), 
E7080-G000-204, E7080-G000-206, and 208 (subjects with MTC or anaplastic thyroid cancer 
[ATC] only)

DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, Max = maximum, Min = minimum, NA = not applicable, Q1 = first quartile, Q3 
= third quartile, SD = standard deviation, SY = subject-years. 
a:  Duration of treatment (in months) is defined as (Last dose date – First dose date + 1) × (12÷365.25). 
b:  Subject-years of treatment = sum of duration of treatment (in years) for all subjects in each category, including 
dose interruptions. 
c:  Duration of exposure is defined as number of days a subject actually received a dose, excluding dose 
interruptions.  Subject-year = sum of duration of exposure (in years) for all subjects in each category. 
d:  Average daily dose is calculated as total dose (mg) ÷ duration of treatment (days). 
e:  The dose most frequently received during the treatment period was defined as the mode of all dose levels 
received.  The highest dose was chosen if there was a tie in the number of dose levels most frequently received.  
f:  Subjects in the thyroid cancer studies followed a planned treatment and individualized dose reduction algorithm 
for toxicity as follows:  24 mg → 20 mg → 14 mg → 10 mg. 
Dose  interruptions  and  reductions  were  integral  to  the  management  of  lenvatinib-related  toxicities.  
Following a starting dose of 24 mg, subjects could have sequential, stepwise dose reductions to 20 mg 
(first reduction), 14 mg (second dose reduction), or 10 mg (third dose reduction) on an individual basis 
as  needed  for  AEs.    Across  all  safety  sets,  exposure  to  lenvatinib  was  highest  for  the  24-mg  dose 
(89.71 SY,  146.20 SY,  and  127.42 SY  for  the  DTC  Randomized,  All  DTC  Lenvatinib,  and  Non-DTC 
Monotherapy Safety Sets, respectively) compared with each of the lower doses administered.  Exposure 
to the 20-mg dose and 14 mg dose were 50.8 SY and 71.8 SY respectively.  When considering starting 
dose of 24 mg, the median dose intensity was lower for lenvatinib-treated subjects in Study 303 (16.8 
mg/day/subject) compared with those in Study 201 and open label part of the Study 303 (19.5 and 19.4 
mg/day/subject, respectively). With the starting dose of 20 mg/day, the median dose intensity was 20 
mg/day/subject. 
A shorter duration of exposure in some patient subpopulations, (those older than 75 years, Asians, and 
subjects with renal impairment) were observed in the lenvatinib treated subjects across safety sets. Such 
patients had lower exposure, shorter median duration of treatment and lower median cumulative dose, 
lower relative dose intensity, and sometimes lower average daily dose across all safety sets. These 
differences were not observed for the respective subgroups in the placebo arm of the DTC Randomized 
safety set. 
Japanese subjects had a shorter duration of treatment vs. non-Japanese subjects (median of 8.1 vs. 11.9 
months in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set) and received a lower average daily dose of lenvatinib 
(median of 11.3 mg vs. 17.9 mg in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set). However, median duration of 
lenvatinib treatment was similar (16.9 vs. 16.0 months) between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects, 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 123/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively, in the DTC Randomized Safety Set, although total dose and dose intensity were lower for 
Japanese subjects. 
Lenvatinib-treated subjects who received prior VEGF-targeted therapy had a numerically shorter duration 
of treatment than subjects who had not received prior VEGF-targeted therapy (median, 11.1 vs 16.9 
months); however, no meaningful differences in other exposure parameters were seen in the DTC 
Randomized Safety Set. A decrease in the duration of treatment (median, 3.6 vs 4.2 months) was also 
seen in subjects who received prior VEGF-targeted therapy in the placebo group. 
Lenvatinib-treated subjects with ECOG ≥1 or hepatic impairment had lower exposure, shorter duration of 
treatment and lower cumulative dose across safety sets; however, the same trend was observed in the 
placebo group in the DTC Randomized safety set. 
Adverse events 
Nearly 100% of lenvatinib-treated subjects across all Safety Sets and 90% of placebo-treated subjects in 
the  DTC  Randomized  Safety  Set  had  at  least  1  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE).    More 
lenvatinib-treated subjects had a TEAE with maximum CTCAE Grade of 3 or greater (range 72% to 87% 
across all Safety Sets) than did placebo-treated subjects (30%).

For each row category, a subject with two or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. 
AE = adverse event, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, SAE = serious 
adverse event, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
a:  Treatment-related TEAEs includes those reported by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug or for which 
causality was missing. 
b:  If a subject had more than one TEAE, the subject is only counted once at the maximum grade. 
c:  There are 2 more fatal AEs than there are CTCAE Grade 5 TEAEs for Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set because in Study 101 2 
subjects  each had a fatal AE for which severity was recorded by the investigator as being CTCAE Grade 2. 
d:  A subject may be counted in both categories if the subject had both a fatal and a nonfatal SAE. 
e:  A subject may be counted in both categories if the subject had TEAEs leading to both dose interruption and dose reduction.

Table includes those AEs that occurred in 5% or more of subjects provided there was a between-treatment difference 
of at least 5% for All CTCAE Grades or at least 2% for Grades 3 and 4.  Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported for the 
same preferred term were counted only once using the highest CTCAE grade.   
Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant treatment arm. 
AE = adverse event, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, 
MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, PPE = palmer-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, TEAE = 
treatment-emergent adverse event, TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone.  
TEAEs adjusted by treatment duration 
There was a large difference in duration of exposure between treatment arms in the DTC Randomized 
Safety Set, where the lenvatinib arm had a median duration of exposure 4 times that of the placebo arm 
(see patient exposure). The rate of TEAEs was also adjusted by treatment duration.   
Treatment  duration  was  defined  as  time  of  last  dose  minus  first  dose  plus  1,  and  included  treatment 
interruptions, unlike exposure duration, which did not include treatment interruptions.  Depending on the 
pattern  of  occurrence  over  time  and  whether  the  AEs  occurred  spontaneously  or  were  derived  from 
scheduled  assessments,  it  was  determined  whether  the  incidence  or  treatment  duration-adjusted 
analysis was more appropriate for evaluating a specific AE. 
Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred at a duration-adjusted rate of greater than 0.20 episodes per SY 
in the lenvatinib arm of the DTC Randomized Safety Set are presented in table below.  The frequency 
order  of  TEAE  episodes  based  on  AE  rate  was  similar  to  that  observed  for  subject  incidence  in  the 
lenvatinib treatment arm in Table 45, although vomiting occurred at a higher rate and weight decrease 
occurred at a lower rate than would have been predicted by the subject incidence.

Preferred terms are sorted based on the AE rate in the lenvatinib treatment arm.  In the event of a tie, they are sorted 
alphabetically.  The 0.20 cut-off is based on the AE rate in the lenvatinib treatment arm. 
AE = adverse event, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SY 
= subject-years, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.  
a:  Total Treatment Subject-years = sum of treatment time (in years) for all subjects in the respective treatment 
group (including dose interruptions). 
b:  AE Rate (episodes/subject-year)  =  total occurrence of AE episode (n) divided by total subject-years for the 
respective treatment group.  
c:  TEAE episode is based on MedDRA lower level term.  A single episode is defined from onset through resolution or, 
if ongoing, to the end of the reporting period.

Regarding Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs that occurred at a duration-adjusted rate of 0.02 episodes per SY or higher 
in the lenvatinib arm of the DTC Randomized Safety Set, the frequency order of Grade 3 or 4 TEAE 
episodes based on AE rate was similar to that observed for subject incidence in the lenvatinib treatment 
arm in table 45.  The episodes per SY for lenvatinib-treated subjects were approximately twice that for the 
placebo-treated subjects. 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events (CSEs) 
CSEs are briefly summarized below and important findings noted.  
Hypertension and proteinuria 
The 2 most frequently reported CSEs observed with lenvatinib were hypertension and proteinuria, both of 
which tended to occur early during treatment. Hypertension and proteinuria were both frequently 
reported as Grade 3 events.  
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial, hypertension (including hypertension, hypertensive crisis, blood 
pressure diastolic increased, and blood pressure increased) was reported in 72.8% of lenvatinib-treated 
patients and 16.0% of patients in the placebo-treated group.  The median time to onset in 
lenvatinib-treated patients was 16 days.  Reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including 1 reaction of Grade 4) 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 127/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred in 44.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 3.8% of placebo-treated patients.  The 
majority of cases recovered or resolved following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 13.0% 
and 13.4% of patients, respectively.  In 1.1% of patients, hypertension led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation.  
Proteinuria was reported in 33.7% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 3.1% of patients in the 
placebo-treated group.  The median time to onset was 6.7 weeks.  Grade 3 reactions occurred in 10.7% 
of lenvatinib-treated patients and none in placebo-treated patients.  The majority of cases had an 
outcome of recovered or resolved following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 16.9% and 
10.7% of patients, respectively.  Proteinuria led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.8% of 
patients.  
The incidence of hypertension, including Grade 3-4 events, was higher in female, Japanese, and elderly 
subjects. Grade 3 or 4 hypertension was also reported more frequently in subjects with baseline hepatic 
or renal function impairment. 
In study 303, the presence of hypertension at Baseline correlated with the development of renal events 
during treatment with lenvatinib with an odds ratio of 3.26 (95% CI: 1.43, 7.4.3) compared with subjects 
who did not have hypertension at Baseline. The development of hypertension during lenvatinib treatment 
appeared to be correlated with the development of proteinuria with an odds ratio of 3.00 (95% CI: 1.51, 
5.96) compared with subjects who did not develop hypertension. 
The evolution of the average number of days a subject reported an AE per treatment cycle was defined as 
the total number of days with the specific AE (e.g., hypertension) for all subjects who were treated at each 
cycle (4 weeks) divided by the number of subjects at risk. The evolution of the average number of days 
with hypertension started with 6 days for the first cycle, reached its maximum of 10.5 days at cycle 2 and 
then slowly declined to a plateau of about 4.5 days hypertension per cycle between cycle 15 and cycle 24. 
The evolution of the average number of days with proteinuria started with 0.8 days for the first cycle, 
reached a maximum of 4.5 days of proteinuria at cycle 6 and then declined slowly to a plateau of about 
2 days of proteinuria between cycles 17 and 24. Both these patterns suggested that the protocol of dose 
reduction / discontinuation was successful at controlling the adverse reactions of, respectively, 
hypertension and proteinuria. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a rare event known to be linked to hypertension (Chen 
and Cleck, 2009). Three confirmed cases of PRES occurred, all within the first 6 months of exposure to 
lenvatinib.  
Thromboembolic events 
Certain thromboembolic events are known to occur with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies. For purposes of 
analysis, these were separated into arterial and venous thromboembolic events, based on literature 
reports that the 2 have different risk factors and that venous thromboembolism is not linked to 
VEGFR-targeting agents, but rather to the patients’ hypercoagulable state secondary to the ongoing 
malignancy.  
Venous thromboembolism per sponsor-generated query (SGQ) analysis occurred at similar rates with 
lenvatinib across safety sets, and occurred at a similar rate to that for placebo in the DTC Randomized 
Safety Set on a duration-adjusted basis (lenvatinib, 0.05; placebo, 0.09 episodes/SY). There were four 
Grade 5 venous thromboembolic events in lenvatinib-treated subjects (2 DTC, 2 non-DTC) and none in 
placebo-treated subjects. 
Arterial thromboembolic events per SGQ analysis were also uncommon, but occurred at a slightly higher 
rate with lenvatinib than with placebo on a duration-adjusted basis (0.07 vs. 0.04 episodes/SY) in the 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 128/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
DTC Randomized Safety Set. Arterial thromboembolic events were distributed throughout the duration of 
treatment. A total of 7 (1.5%) lenvatinib-treated DTC subjects prematurely discontinued treatment for 
the event.Serious arterial thromboembolic events were reported for 1.5% and 3.8% of subjects, 
respectively, in the placebo and lenvatinib arms of the DTC Randomized Safety Set, and in 3.8% of 
subjects in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set. Across all safety sets, there were five Grade 5 arterial 
thromboembolic events in lenvatinib-treated subjects (2 DTC, 3 Non-DTC). While other factors may well 
have contributed to these events, based on similar occurrences with other VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents, 
it is not possible to exclude lenvatinib as a causal agent.  
Renal impairment/failure 
Although renal events per SMQ analysis occurred more frequently with lenvatinib than with placebo on a 
duration-adjusted basis, almost all subjects who developed renal failure/impairment had 1 or more 
contributory factors. The majority of renal events were mild to moderate, with Grade 3-4 events occurring 
at a very low rate (0.02 episodes per SY in lenvatinib-treated DTC subjects). In the DTC Randomized 
Safety Set, most renal events were reversible and resolved with hydration, and did not lead to premature 
discontinuation. 
There were 5 renal events associated with a fatal outcome in lenvatinib-treated subjects (1 DTC, 4 
Non-DTC) and none in placebo-treated subjects. All of the reported renal-related deaths occurred in the 
setting of progression of the underlying malignancy.  
Liver injury/failure 
In the SELECT trial, the most commonly reported liver-related adverse reactions were hypoalbuminaemia 
(9.6% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% placebo) and elevations of liver enzyme levels, including increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (7.7% lenvatinib vs. 0 placebo), aspartate aminotransferase (6.9% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% 
placebo), and blood bilirubin (1.9% lenvatinib vs. 0 placebo).  The median time to onset of liver reactions 
in lenvatinib-treated patients was 12.1 weeks.  Liver-related reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including 1 
Grade 5 case of hepatic failure) occurred in 5.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 0.8% in 
placebo-treated patients.  Liver-related reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 4.6% and 
2.7% of patients, respectively, and to permanent discontinuation in 0.4%. 
Across safety sets, hepatic events per SGQ analysis were reported at higher rates with lenvatinib than 
with placebo, adjusted for treatment duration. Most hepatic events were related to liver enzyme 
elevations or hypoalbuminemia, and were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3-4 hepatic events occurred in 5% or fewer 
of lenvatinib-treated DTC subjects. Four subjects met the laboratory screening criteria for potential Hy’s 
Law cases. However, upon thorough evaluation, these subjects had medical conditions that accounted for 
the laboratory findings; therefore, they did not represent true Hy’s Law cases. Hepatic events were 
controlled with dose interruptions and reductions, and only 1 DTC subject discontinued lenvatinib 
treatment due to a hepatic TEAE. There were 4 deaths due to a hepatic-related TEAE in lenvatinib–treated 
subjects (1 subject in the DTC Randomized Safety Set and 3 subjects in the Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety 
Set).  
Amongst 1108 patients treated with lenvatinib, there were 3 cases (0.3%) of hepatic failure, all with a 
fatal outcome.  One occurred in a patient with no liver metastases.  There was also a case of acute 
hepatitis in a patient without liver metastases. 
A higher incidence of liver events occurred in Asian subjects (primarily Japanese) compared with white 
subjects.  
GI perforation and fistula formation events 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 129/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Across the DTC safety sets, GI perforation and fistula formation (per SGQ analysis) occurred at similar 
rates for lenvatinib and placebo, adjusted for treatment duration. The incidence of dose modifications was 
low, and only 2 DTC subjects discontinued lenvatinib treatment due to the event. 
Hypocalcemia 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial, hypocalcaemia was reported in 12.6% of lenvatinib-treated patients 
vs. no cases in the placebo arm.  The median time to first onset in lenvatinib-treated patients was 11.1 
weeks.  Reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurred in 5.0% of lenvatinib-treated vs 0 placebo-treated 
patients.  Most reactions resolved following supportive treatment, without dose interruption or reduction, 
which occurred in 1.5% and 1.1% of patients, respectively; 1 patient with Grade 4 hypocalcaemia 
discontinued treatment permanently.   
Across DTC safety sets, hypocalcemia per SGQ analysis occurred at higher rates with lenvatinib compared 
with placebo, adjusted for treatment duration. Hypocalcemia events tended to be mild to moderate, 
although 7 lenvatinib-treated subjects (5 DTC, 2 Non-DTC) had a nonfatal serious AE (SAE) versus none 
for placebo.  
Similar findings were observed based on laboratory data, with Grade 3-4 low calcium values reported in 
8.8% of lenvatinib-treated subjects and 1.5% of placebo-treated subjects (all Grade 3) in the DTC 
Randomized Safety Set, 7.2% of those in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set, and 1.9% of those in the 
Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set. The underlying mechanism is unknown, although an increase in the 
incidence of hypocalcemia has been reported with another TKI, sorafenib (Brose, et al., 2014). 
Hypocalcemia was manageable with the use of concomitant medication and dose modifications.  
Hemorrhage 
The risk of bleeding has been reported to be increased in patients treated with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted 
therapies.  
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial, haemorrhage was reported in 34.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients 
versus 18.3% of placebo-treated patients. Reactions that occurred at an incidence of ≥0.75% above 
placebo were: epistaxis (11.9%), haematuria (6.5%), contusion (4.6%), gingival bleeding (2.3%), 
haematochezia (2.3%), rectal haemorrhage (1.5%), haematoma (1.1%), haemorrhoidal haemorrhage 
(1.1%), laryngeal haemorrhage (1.1%), petechiae (1.1%), and intracranial tumour haemorrhage 
(0.8%).  When adjusted to account for the 4-fold greater duration of exposure in the lenvatinib versus the 
placebo arm, the following reactions occurred less frequently on lenvatinib than placebo: haemoptysis 
(0.05 episodes/subject-year on lenvatinib vs. 0.21 episodes/subject-year on placebo) and pulmonary 
haemorrhage (0.02 episodes/subject-year on lenvatinib vs. 0.09 episodes/subject-year on placebo). 
The median time to first onset in lenvatinib-treated patients was 10.1 weeks versus 3.9 weeks in the 
placebo arm.  No differences between lenvatinib- and placebo-treated patients were observed in the 
incidences of serious reactions (3.4% vs. 3.8%), reactions leading to premature discontinuation (1.1% 
vs. 1.5%), or reactions leading to dose interruption (3.4% vs. 3.8%) or reduction (0.4% vs. 0).   
Across the DTC safety sets, haemorrhage occurred at similar rates for lenvatinib and placebo when 
adjusted for treatment duration; the majority of events were Grade 1. 
In the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the incidence of dose modifications was low, and only 1.3% of 
subjects discontinued treatment for hemorrhage. The most frequently reported serious bleeding event 
was intracranial tumour haemorrhage. The SAE rate for hemorrhage per SMQ was similar between 
lenvatinib- (2.7% to 4.0%) and placebo-treated (3.8%) subjects. Grade 5 hemorrhagic events occurred 
in 5 lenvatinib treated subjects (3 DTC and 2 Non-DTC), and in 1 placebo-treated subject.  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 130/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Overall, amongst 1108 patients treated with lenvatinib, 3 patients (0.3%) had a Grade 4 haemorrhage 
and 5 patients (0.5%) had a Grade 5 reaction including arterial haemorrhage, haemorrhagic stroke, 
intracranial tumour haemorrhage, haemoptysis and tumour haemorrhage. 
Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome is characteristic of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents (Brose, et 
al., 2014). The incidence (32.2%) in Study 303 was lower than that reported for sorafenib, and the 
majority of events were mild or moderate. The incidence of PPE was higher among females, Japanese, 
and subjects with baseline hepatic function impairment treated with lenvatinib. The incidence of PPE in 
Japanese subjects (74.2% vs. 27.4% for non-Japanese in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set) was 
consistent in Study 303 and the Japan-only study, Study 208, suggesting an underlying mechanism that 
makes Japanese individuals more susceptible to this effect of lenvatinib. However, PPE did not appear to 
be dose-limiting for lenvatinib, and no subjects discontinued treatment because of it.  
QTc prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies. The evaluation of QTc 
prolongation in lenvatinib clinical studies included both an analysis of QTc prolongation based on AE 
reports (per SMQ) and an analysis of actual QT measurements from electrocardiograms. Collectively, 
electrocardiogram data and AE reports of QTc prolongation indicated that, in patients with advanced 
malignancy and associated complications (many of which result in electrolyte imbalance), there appears 
to be a numerically higher incidence of QTc-prolongation events with lenvatinib.  
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, a higher incidence of TEAEs for QTc prolongation per standardized 
MedDRA query (SMQ) was reported in the lenvatinib arm (8.8%) than the placebo arm (1.5%). 
Additionally, a higher incidence of QTc prolongation was reported in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set 
(7.5%) than in the Non DTC Monotherapy Safety Set (1.5%). However, there were no deaths, serious 
adverse events (SAEs), or Grade 4 occurrences of QTc prolongation in any of the Safety Sets and only one 
subject in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set discontinued treatment due to QTc prolongation among all the 
Safety Sets.   
Based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data, 10.0% of lenvatinib-treated subjects and 3.1% of 
placebo-treated subjects in the DTC Randomized Safety Set had a maximum increase from baseline 
Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) of >60 ms.  The maximum postbaseline QTcF value was >500 ms 
in 2.7% and 0.8% of subjects, respectively.   
There were no reported episodes of ventricular tachycardia or Torsades de Pointes or deaths due to QT 
prolongation. Most events for QTc prolongation per SMQ were sporadic and resolved; there was no 
recurrence when the lenvatinib dose was reduced and no other intervention was required.   
Many subjects had electrolyte alterations (e.g., hypocalcaemia and hypokalemia) at the time of the QTc 
prolongation event.  In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, hypokalemia occurred in 36 subjects (13.8%, 
any grade) in the lenvatinib arm. Of these, 9 (3.4%) Grade 3 events, no Grade 4 events, 1 (0.4%) serious 
adverse event of hypokalemia, and no deaths due to hypokalemia were reported in the lenvatinib arm.  
No subjects discontinued treatment due to hypokalemia in the DTC Randomized Safety Set. 
Across the entire lenvatinib-treated subject safety set (N = 1108 subjects), the TEAE of hypokalemia was 
reported in 92 subjects (8.3%) with the following frequencies: Grade 1 = 55 (59.8%), Grade 2= 15 
(16.3%), Grade 3 = 17 (18.5%), Grade 4 = 5 (5.4%). There were 5 SAEs of hypokalemia reported and 
no outcome of death due to hypokalemia was reported.  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 131/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Among these 92 subjects with a TEAE of hypokalemia as described above, 66 subjects (71.7%) had 
concurrent TEAE of diarrhea; 13 subjects (14.1%) also reported a TEAE of QTc prolongation;  and 10 
subjects (10.9%) reported combined and concurrent TEAEs of hypokalemia, diarrhea and QTc 
prolongation.  There were 3 SAEs of hypokalemia (n=66) in subjects with hypokalemia and diarrhea and 
no SAEs or deaths were reported in the 10 subjects with combined TEAEs of hypokalemia, diarrhea and 
QTc prolongation.  
With regards to the use of thiazides as a concomitant medication, 26 of 92 subjects (28.3%) with a TEAE 
of hypokalemia; 18 of 66 subjects (27.3%) with combined TEAEs of hypokalemia and diarrhea; 5 of the 
13 (38.5%) subjects with combined TEAEs of hypokalemia and QTc prolongation; and 3 of the 10 (30%) 
subjects with combined TEAEs of hypokalemia, diarrhea and QTc prolongation, respectively had a 
concomitant medication of thiazides. 
With regards to other GI toxicities such as vomiting, 42 of 92 subjects (45.7%) with a TEAE of 
hypokalemia also had a TEAE of vomiting.  Among these, 6 subjects (6.5%) had a combined TEAE of 
hypokalemia, vomiting and QTc prolongation and only 2 (2.2%) of these subjects had a concomitant 
medication of thiazides. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction decrease and cardiac failure events 
Cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (CHF) have been reported with the use of VEGF/VEGFR 
targeted therapies, including sunitinib (Di Lorenzo et al., 2009; Richards, et al., 2011); however, 
refractory CHF with a fatal outcome has rarely been reported. In a retrospective study, Klein Hesselink et 
al. (2013) showed that the risk of cardiovascular mortality was increased 3.3-fold in individuals with DTC 
compared with controls, independent of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors, and that lower TSH 
levels were independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. The authors 
suggested that the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in individuals with DTC may be due to 
long-term exposure to thyroid hormone suppression therapy rather than to the underlying cancer. 
A report of echocardiographic parameters in Study E7080-G000-204 (Study 204) showed that changes in 
LVEF were small and the results did not suggest a direct cardiotoxic effect of lenvatinib. In Study 303, 
median percentage changes in LVEF from baseline to postbaseline nadir values were small (-5.0% and 
-1.5% for lenvatinib and placebo, respectively). No placebo-treated subjects had a significantly 
decreased LVEF value. In the lenvatinib arm, however, 2.3% and 1.5% of subjects had either a decrease 
of more than 20% from Baseline or a postbaseline nadir value below 40%, respectively. None of these 
subjects had cardiac failure clinically. In the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set, 2 subjects with decreased LVEF 
per echocardiogram had a reported TEAE of cardiac failure; both recovered after a dose interruption and 
continued lenvatinib treatment at a reduced dose. 
The preferred term “ejection fraction (EF) decreased” was captured in the analysis of cardiac failure per 
SMQ. In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, “ejection fraction decreased” was the most common TEAE 
reported for cardiac failure per SMQ (14/17 subjects) and was mostly Grade 1 or 2. This finding indicated 
that most reports of cardiac failure AEs per SMQ were, in fact, decreased EF events. None of the subjects 
who experienced a TEAE of “ejection fraction decreased” had any other AE associated with cardiac failure 
per SMQ. Adjusted for treatment duration, the incidence of decreased EF per SGQ was similar for 
lenvatinib-treated subjects across all safety sets (0.03 to 0.05 episodes/SY), but slightly higher than that 
for placebo-treated subjects (0.01 episodes/SY). 
Overall, these results suggest that lenvatinib has a small effect on LVEF.  
Weight decrease  
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 132/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Weight loss has been reported as an AE with other VEGF/VEGFR targeted therapies, including sorafenib 
and motesanib (Haraldsdottir and Shah, 2014). A population PK/PD analysis showed that lenvatinib 
exposure significantly increased the probability of experiencing weight loss. Weight loss and decreased 
appetite were frequently reported TEAEs with lenvatinib in clinical studies. In the DTC Randomized Safety 
Set, weight loss was cumulative over time for lenvatinib-treated subjects. At the end of treatment, 
median weight loss was greater in the lenvatinib arm compared with placebo (lenvatinib, -5.3 kg; 
placebo, -1.0 kg). However, weight loss primarily occurred in subjects with higher BMI (i.e., the 
overweight and obese BMI categories) Weight loss in the lowest BMI quartile was minimal.  
Cytopenia 
Bone marrow hypoplasia was observed in nonclinical studies of lenvatinib, and is a known effect of VEGF 
inhibition. In the lenvatinib clinical studies, however, the incidence of cytopenias (anemia, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) reported as TEAEs was low and similar in the All DTC Lenvatinib and 
Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Sets. Grade 3-4 cytopenias were reported infrequently with lenvatinib in 
Study 303 (<2% of subjects). However, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in female and 
Japanese subjects. 
Blood thyroid stimulating hormone changes 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial, 88% of all patients had a baseline TSH level less than or equal to 0.5 
mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level above 0.5 mU/L was 
observed post baseline in 57% of lenvatinib-treated patients as compared with 14% of placebo-treated 
patients. 
Hypothyroidism manifesting as changes in hormone levels is a known AE of anti-angiogenic agents and 
was observed in patients with intact thyroid and in thyroidectomised patients. In the Study 303 all 
patients had prior anti-thyroid cancer surgery and a TEAE of blood TSH increased was reported in 17 
(6.5%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm and no subjects in the placebo arm. Consistently, hypothyroidism 
was reported as a TEAE in 14 (5.4%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm and no subjects in the placebo arm 
and in 6 (5.5%) of subjects in the overall OOL group. There were no Grade ≥3 events of blood thyroid 
stimulating hormone increased or hypothyroidism. 
Interstitial lung disease-like events (ILD) 
The incidence of ILD-like events reported with lenvatinib was low: in the DTC randomised set with 
lenvatinib 2 (0.8%) for pneumonitis and 1 (0.4%) for lung infiltration; no cases have been reported with 
placebo. Incidences in the All DTC lenvatinib and the non-DTC monotherapy set were similar. In the DTC 
indication events were of grade 1 or 2; 1 grade 3 event was reported with lenvatinib in a non-DTC 
indication.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The methodology used to characterise an AE as related to lenvatinib is described below. The comparative 
incidence of events on lenvatinib compared with placebo in the DTC Randomized Safety Set was reviewed 
and: 
• AEs with an incidence greater than or equal to 5% higher than placebo (any CTC grade) were included. 
• A lower threshold was used for Clinically Significant Events (CSEs) and events were assigned as ADRs if 
the reported incidence was greater than placebo by at least 0.75% (i.e. a minimum 2 subject difference). 
• Additional ADRs (e.g. PRES) were identified from a manual review of all other events which occurred 
more frequently on lenvatinib than placebo, and for which it was concluded there was a reasonable 
EMA/250082/2015  
Page 133/169 
 
 
  
 
 
 
possibility of a causal relationship taking into account factors such as the medical importance of the event 
and biological plausibility. 
Subsequently synonymous terms were combined, and other groups of terms were grouped together and 
the frequency of the grouped term computed. Examples of such terms are “haemorrhagic events”, “renal 
failure events”, “Gastrointestinal and abdominal pain”.  
In  most  cases  (except  lymphopenia,  cerebrovascular  accident,  monoparesis,  myocardial  infarction, 
cardiac failure, hypotension, and hepatocellular damage), the final frequency category for the All DTC 
Safety Set was the same as that for the DTC Randomized Safety Set. 
Based on this the following are considered adverse drug reactions: 
Very  common:  Urinary  tract  infection,  Thrombocytopeniaa,  Hypocalcaemia,  Hypokalaemia,  Weight 
decreased,  Decreased  appetite, 
Insomnia,  Dizziness,  Headache,  Dysgeusia,  Haemorrhaged, 
Hypertensione,  Hypotension,  Dysphonia,  Diarrhoea,  Gastrointestinal  and  abdominal  pains,  Vomiting, 
Nausea,  Oral 
inflammation,  Oral  pain,  Constipation,  Dyspepsia,  Dry  mouth,  Palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome,  Rash,  Alopecia,  Back  pain,  Arthralgia,  Myalgia,  Pain  in  extremity, 
Musculoskeletal pain, Proteinuria, Fatigue, Asthenia, Oedema peripheral. 
Common:  Lymphopenia,  Hypothyroidism,  Blood  thyroid  stimulating  hormone  increased,  Dehydration, 
Hypomagnesaemia,  Hypercholesterolaemia,  Cerebrovascular  accident,  Myocardial  infarctionc,  Cardiac

Monoparesis, Transient ischaemic attack, hepatocellular damage/hepatitis. 
Overdose 
The highest tested doses of lenvatinib in clinical studies were 32 mg QD and 20 mg BID. Accidental 
medication errors resulting in single doses of 40 to 48 mg have also occurred in clinical trials. The most 
frequently observed adverse drug reactions at these doses were hypertension, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, 
stomatitis, proteinuria, headache, and aggravation of PPE.   
There have also been reports of overdose with lenvatinib involving single administrations of 6 to 10 times 
the recommended daily dose. These cases were associated with adverse reactions consistent with the 
known safety profile of lenvatinib (i.e., renal and cardiac failure), or were without adverse reactions.   
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lenvatinib.  In case of suspected overdose, lenvatinib 
should be withheld and appropriate supportive care given as required (see SmPC section 4.9).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events  
Across safety sets, nonfatal SAEs occurred in 44.1% to 52.1% of subjects in the lenvatinib groups across 
all safety sets and 22.9% of subjects in the placebo group in DTC Randomized safety set.  For the DTC 
Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of SAEs, adjusted for treatment duration, was slightly higher for 
the lenvatinib arm (0.93 episodes/SY) compared with the placebo arm (0.78 episodes/SY).

Deaths  
As of the safety cut-off date of 15 March 2014, 82 (31.4%) and 53 (40.5%) subjects in the lenvatinib and 
placebo arms of Study 303, respectively, had died.  Deaths associated with a fatal AE or an unknown 
reason occurred in 20 subjects (7.7%) in the lenvatinib arm and 6 subjects (4.6%) in the placebo arm.  
Adjusted by treatment duration, the incidence of fatal AEs was similar between treatment arms (0.07 vs 
0.10 events/SY for lenvatinib and placebo, respectively).  There was no pattern for any of the fatal AEs.   
A total of 32 subjects had a fatal AE in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set.     
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) and Grade 5 AEs associated with the CSEs are provided in Table 49 by subject 
incidence. The ranking of AEs when incidences were adjusted for duration remained the same. The same 
low value for “GI perforation and fistula formation events” was observed in placebo and lenvatinib groups.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the relevant Safety Set or treatment arm.  Preferred terms are 
included if the incidence was 1% or higher in any Safety Set or treatment arm.  Preferred terms are sorted based on 
the AE rate in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set.  In the event of a tie, they are sorted alphabetically.   
AE = adverse event, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, TEAE 
= treatment-emergent adverse event. 
a:  Treatment-related TEAEs includes those reported by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study 
drug or for which causality was missing. 
b:  Fatal AEs include any AE leading to death during treatment or within 30 days after last dose. 
Asthenia, Cerebrovascular accident, Diarrhoea, Haematemesis, Hepatic failure, Melaena, Renal failure, Sepsis, 
Tachycardia, Tumour haemorrhage accounted each for one subject in the Non-DTC Monotherapy safety set. 
Laboratory findings 
Lenvatinib treatment was primarily associated with reductions in platelet counts, decreases in albumin 
and calcium levels, and increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, 
amylase, and lipase concentrations.The incidence of Grade 3-4 abnormalities during treatment with 
lenvatinib was low.   
Haematology 
The comparison between treatment arms for the DTC Randomized Safety Set focused on the first 
12 cycles of treatment because the number of subjects in the placebo arm was small after that.   
Haemoglobin 
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, the median haemoglobin concentration increased during the first 
cycle in the lenvatinib arm and remained elevated through Cycle 12, whereas the median haemoglobin 
concentration did not change from Baseline in the placebo arm. The results for subjects in other Safety 
Sets were similar to those for lenvatinib-treated subjects in the DTC Randomized Safety Set.   
Platelets 
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, median platelet counts decreased from Baseline and remained 
decreased throughout treatment, though stayed within the normal range, in the lenvatinib arm but 
remained near the baseline level over time in the placebo arm.  The results for subjects in the other Safety 
Sets were similar to those for lenvatinib-treated subjects in the DTC Randomized Safety Set.   
White blood cells 
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, the pattern of change over time in median values for leukocytes and 
neutrophils was similar in the 2 treatment arms. In the other analysis sets, there were no consistent 
upward or downward trends over time.

Lymphopenia has been seen in 6.5% of patients treated with lenvatinib. The numbers of patients with 
lymphopenia was small but a third of these had concomitant infection at the time of lymphopenia.

Liver and Renal Tests 
The comparison between treatment arms for the DTC Randomized Safety Set focused on the first 
12 cycles of treatment. 
ALT and AST 
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, there were small increases from Baseline in median values for both 
ALT and AST in the lenvatinib arm during Cycle 1, and the median values remained higher than the 
baseline level through Cycle 12.  For placebo, the median values remained close to Baseline level through 
Cycle 12.  The results for subjects in the other Safety Sets were similar to those for lenvatinib-treated 
subjects in the DTC Randomized Safety Set.   
Alkaline phosphatase 
In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, there was a transient increase from Baseline in median value for 
alkaline phosphatase early in treatment with lenvatinib, which then decreased and remained at or below 
the baseline level through Cycle 12. For placebo, median values were similar at Baseline through Cycle 
12.  The results for subjects in the other Safety Sets were similar to those for lenvatinib-treated subjects 
in the DTC Randomized Safety Set. 
Bilirubin and creatinine 
There were no consistent patterns of change over time in either treatment arm in the DTC Randomized 
Safety Set, or in any of the other Safety Sets.

Hypocalcaemia was identified as a clinically significant event (see section on CSE).  Majority of the 
subjects with hypocalcaemia had a history of hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesaemia, 
or hypocalcaemia, and more than 50% of subjects had thyroid carcinoma. 
The comparison between treatment arms for the DTC Randomized Safety Set focused on the first 
12 cycles of treatment.  In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, median values for calcium were similar in the 
lenvatinib and placebo arms throughout the study. There was no consistent upward or downward trend 
over time in either group. There were no consistent upward or downward trends over time in any of the 
other Safety Sets.

Safety in special populations 
The safety of lenvatinib was explored for a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including age, sex, 
race, baseline hepatic or renal impairment, and baseline status of hypertension, proteinuria and diabetes, 
among others.   
Clinically significant events and severe TEAEs in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set are summarised below.  
The numbers of subjects in many of the subgroups were small and therefore caution is required in the 
interpretation of results.

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, MedDRA = Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
a:  If a subject had more than one TEAE, the subject is only counted once at the maximum grade. Percentages are based 
on total number of subjects in the subgroups. 
b:  A subject may be counted in multiple categories. 
c:  A subject may be counted in both categories if the subject had TEAEs leading to both dose interruption and dose 
reduction. 
d:  Subjects with at least one AE in the category of the Preferred Terms. 
e:  Although not evident from the all grade events, Grade 3 and 4 hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, and 
dehydration occurred more frequently in older age groups.  
f:  For each row category, a subject with two or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. Percentages 
are based on total number of subjects in the subgroups. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs or Grade 3-4 TEAEs were similar in the elderly subjects (≥65 years) and 
the <65 years age group.  However, subjects 75 years or older had a higher incidence of fatal AEs.  
Compared with subjects younger than 65, subjects who were 75 years or older were also more likely to 
experience (in descending order of frequency) Grade 3-4 hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, 
and dehydration.   
Sex 
The incidence of Grade 3-4 hypertension, fatigue and weight decreased was higher in females.  Female 
subjects had a higher incidence of hypertension (including Grade 3 or 4 hypertension), proteinuria, and 
PPE (analyses per SGQ or SMQ), while males had a higher incidence of decreased EF and GI perforation 
and fistula formation per SGQ. 
Race 
Compared with white subjects, the overall AE profile for Asian subjects was not worse than that for white 
subjects.  However, Asian subjects had a higher incidence of oedema peripheral and VEGF-related events 
such as hypertension, fatigue, PPE, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and blood TSH increased.  These data 
were driven primarily by results in Japanese subjects, who comprised approximately 66% of the Asian 
subgroup, except for thrombocytopenia, whose occurrence was completely accounted for by Japanese 
subjects.  Japanese subjects had a higher incidence (in descending order of frequency) of Grade 3-4 
hypertension, decreased appetite, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia compared with non-Japanese subjects.  
Japanese subjects also had a higher incidence of liver events per SGQ.  Arterial and venous 
thromboembolic events per SGQ occurred at very low rates in Japanese subjects, and GI perforation and 
fistula formation per SGQ did not occur at all in Japanese subjects.  Such low rates for these events in 
Japanese subjects have not been reported in the literature.  The basis for these findings is unclear and 
these results should be interpreted with caution, given the smaller number of Asian and Japanese 
subjects enrolled in the lenvatinib clinical trials. 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 143/169 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The population PK/PD model showed that Japanese subjects had a higher probability of experiencing 
hypertension, proteinuria, and fatigue; however, the occurrence of these events did not appear to be 
correlated with PK parameters (see section on clinical pharmacokinetic).  
Baseline body weight 
Subjects in the <60 kg weight group had a higher incidence of fatal AEs compared with subjects in the 
≥60 kg weight group.  Patients with low body weight (<60 kg) had a higher incidence of PPE, proteinuria, 
of grade 3-4 hypocalcaemia and hyponatraemia, and a trend towards a higher incidence of grade 3-4 
decreased appetite. 
Prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy 
Lenvatinib-treated subjects in the DTC Randomized Safety Set who had received a prior 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy had a slightly higher incidence of SAEs compared with 
VEGF-treatment-naïve subjects. This pattern was not observed in the placebo arm.  With regard to CSEs, 
subjects in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set who had received a prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy had 
a higher incidence of renal events per SMQ and a trend towards a higher incidence of liver events per SGQ 
compared with VEGF-naïve subjects. 
Baseline renal impairment 
The numbers of subjects with renal impairment in the lenvatinib clinical studies was small; all had either 
mild or moderate impairment. In the DTC Randomized Safety Set, subjects with renal impairment at 
Baseline had a higher overall incidence of Grade 3-4 TEAEs and Grade 5 (fatal) AEs.  Patients with 
baseline renal impairment had a higher incidence of Grade 3 to 4 hypertension, proteinuria, fatigue, 
stomatitis, oedema peripheral, thrombocytopenia, dehydration, prolonged electrocardiogram QT, 
hypothyroidism, hyponatraemia, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, pneumonia compared 
with subjects with normal renal function.  These patients also had a higher incidence of renal reactions 
and a trend towards a higher incidence of liver reactions.  These observations were consistent with results 
of the population PK/PD analysis (see clinical pharmacology).   
Baseline hepatic impairment 
Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, asthenia, fatigue, and hypocalcaemia were reported more frequently in 
subjects with baseline hepatic function impairment. With regard to CSEs, subjects with baseline hepatic 
impairment had a higher incidence of hypertension per SMQ and PPE per SGQ. 
Baseline hypertension 
Subjects with hypertension at Baseline had a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 TEAEs and SAEs.  In 
particular, subjects with baseline hypertension had a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 hypertension, 
proteinuria, diarrhoea, and dehydration during treatment than did subjects with normal blood pressure at 
Baseline. The following SAEs were also reported more frequently among subjects with baseline 
hypertension (in descending order of frequency):  dehydration, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, 
malignant pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, and GI symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting).  
With regard to CSEs, subjects with baseline hypertension had a higher incidence of proteinuria, renal 
events and arterial thromboembolic events per SMQ or SGQ. 
Baseline diabetes 
Subjects with baseline diabetes had a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 proteinuria, decreased appetite, 
hypotension and stomatitis, and a trend towards a higher incidence of asthenia and dehydration. With 
regard to CSEs, subjects with baseline diabetes had a higher incidence of haemorrhage per SMQ and 
proteinuria per SGQ.

Baseline ECOG Performance status > 0 
No analysis was provided in these patients on the ground that the number of patients of PS > 1 was too 
low. A short analysis of the patients with a baseline ECOG PS =0 vs PS >0 has shown that ECOG PS >0 
patients stands less well any treatment, including placebo, than ECOG = 0 patients. Of note ECOG PS > 
0 patients treated with lenvatinib showed lower incidences of AEs than ECOG = 0 patients, but for 
proteinuria. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on a review of data for SAEs, premature discontinuations, and deaths, there did not appear to be 
any interactions between lenvatinib and the concomitant treatments administered in the monotherapy 
studies. 
Doses reductions, Doses interruption and Discontinuation due to AEs 
Dose reductions and interruptions 
In phase 2 studies 201 and 208, TEAEs led to dose reduction in 65.5% and in 100% of patients, 
respectively, and to dose interruption in 74.1% and 36.4% of patients, respectively. The numbers of 
patients with AEs leading to dose reduction or interruption of study drug in the phase 3 Study 303 are 
presented in Table 44. One or more dose reductions occurred in 78.5% of subjects taking lenvatinib 
versus 8.4% of subjects taking placebo. 
In the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set, a higher percentage of Japanese subjects vs. non-Japanese subjects 
had dose reductions (95.2% vs. 57.9%) while a lower percentage had dose interruptions (66.1% vs. 
77.9%)  
Most of dose reductions and interruptions were due to AEs following the dose adjustment algorithm 
mandated in the protocol. The reasons for dose interruptions or reductions were not collected on the Drug 
Administration CRF page. Hypertension and proteinuria were events that appeared to be the most 
frequent causes for dose reductions, but infrequently led to permanent treatment discontinuation (in 3 
subjects and 2 subjects, respectively) (see section on adverse events).  
As off data cutoff of 15 Nov 2013, the median time-to-first dose reduction (24 to 20 mg/day) or 
discontinuation was 12 weeks (CI: 8.3 -12, 223 patients), the median time from first to second dose 
reduction or discontinuation was 8.3 weeks ( CI: 7.1 – 11; 166 subjects) and the median time from the 
second to the third dose reduction / discontinuation was 8.3 weeks (CI: 6.4 – 10; 85 subjects). 
Kaplan-Meier plots of time-to-first dose reduction stratified by lenvatinib AUC based on the starting dose 
of 24 mg showed that a higher lenvatinib AUC resulted in an earlier dose reduction.  The median time to 
first dose reduction for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles of exposure were 24.3 weeks (90% CI: 18.3 - 
36.3), 16.1 weeks (90% CI: 12.1 - 20.1), 11.4 weeks (90% CI: 7.29 - 12.7), and 4.86 weeks (90 % CI: 
4.14 - 9) respectively.

A substantial part of the premature discontinuations (11.4%) in the non-DTC set and 4.7% of patients in 
non-DTC set had ‘other’ as reasons for discontinuation, which were satisfactorily explained.  
In the OOL part study 303, when adjusted by exposure, the rate of discontinuation for AEs was higher in 
the 24 mg (0.45 per SY) than in the 20 mg regimen (0.22 per SY). 
TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation that led to discontinuation of treatment in 1% or 
more of subjects are presented below.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Discussion on starting dose 
Although the results from the study 303 at present provide support for the starting dose of 24 mg QD for 
RR-DTC patients, overall, 89.7% of lenvatinib-treated patients had dose modifications (dose reduction 
and/or  interruption).  Lenvatinib  exposure  based  on  starting  dose  was  a  significant  predictor  for  the 
occurrence  of  any  grade  proteinuria,  nausea,  and  vomiting,  and  for  Grade  3  or  higher  hypertension.  
Increased  lenvatinib  exposure  based  on  dose  intensity  was  a  statistically  significant  predictor  for  any 
grade hypertension, proteinuria, nausea, and vomiting, and for Grade 3 or higher proteinuria. As such 
there was a link between the daily dose of the drug and the incidence of TEAEs of grade 3 or 4 and thus 
the number of interruptions. This is expected as the relationship between the dose of lenvatinib and the 
emergence and severity of AEs is a cornerstone of the algorithm of posology and dose reduction. However 
all quartiles of exposure to drug  (“AUC dose intensity”) had similar PFS even the last one once corrected 
for early drop-outs, suggesting that lower doses, with better safety profile might result in similar efficacy 
(see clinical pharmacodynamic).

In the OOL phase, efficacy between the starting doses of 24 mg and 20 mg was compared. Similar results 
in terms of PFS and ORR were observed for the starting doses of 24 mg and 20 mg. However, the findings 
may be confounded by a number of factors:  1) the much shorter time that the 20 mg dose was used 
compared with the 24 mg dose, 2) a much shorter follow-up period (median 8.3 months for the 20-mg 
dose vs. 17.0 months for the 24 mg dose), 3) the nonrandomized design and open-label nature of that 
phase, 4) the fact that enrolled subjects were further along in the course of their disease upon entry, and 
5) the observation that the majority of subjects who received the 20 mg starting dose had a better ECOG 
PS (score of 0) at the start of the OOL Period than did those who received the 24-mg dose (PS score of 1).  
Taking dose reductions into account, 24 mg was the dose most frequently given (42.5%), and the number 
of subject-years of exposure to 24 mg (89.7 SY) was greater than for any lower dose.  70.4% (119 out of 
169)  of  subjects  with  an  objective  response  (CR/PR)  to  lenvatinib  developed  that  response  during  or 
within 30 days of receiving the 24 mg dose (i.e., before or shortly after first dose reduction). The median 
time to response (2 months) coincided with the first tumour assessment and was shorter than the median 
time to dose reduction (3 months). The applicant also argued that since tumour shrinkage occurs for a 
prolonged period, any response at the 20 mg dose could be due to a carry-over effect of the 24-mg dose, 
confounding the results. Furthermore, treatment-emergent hypertension occurred more frequently at the 
24-mg  dose  in  Study  303  and  there  was  a  correlation  between  increasing  number  of  responses  and 
increasing  dose,  up  to  24  mg  in  dose-escalation  studies.  Therefore,  at  present  it  is  not  possible  to 
dissociate the 24 mg starting dose from the observed efficacy of lenvatinib in this study.  In  addition, 
available  data  with  the  20  mg  dose  are  limited,  as  is  the  duration  of  follow-up  to  draw  meaningful 
conclusions.  
Overall, the current body of evidence is largely with the starting dose of 24 mg and it is currently not 
known whether a lower dose may be as effective with an improved safety profile. There is a need to 
further study an optimal starting dose for the overall target population, to better inform a choice of 
starting dose in subpopulations of patients and ultimaly to guide treatment in individual patients. Data on 
safety and activity of lower starting doses will be provided through a randomised dose-finding trial 
E7080-G000-211 (Study 211) looking at safety and activity of three starting doses (24 mg, 20 mg and 14 
mg once daily) (see RMP). Primary endpoints will pertain to safety (rate of TEAE with CTCAE grades of 3 
or higher within 6 months after randomization), but also to efficacy (Objective response rate (ORR) at 6 
months (ORR6M) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1). An assessment of efficacy 
(including PFS, PFS2 and OS data) will inform whether lower starting doses result in similar efficacy. One 
of the study objectives will be to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship between 
exposure and efficacy/safety. Further characterisation and use of appropriate biomarkers and PK/PD 
models is also expected (see discussion on clinical pharmacology and RMP). No interim analysis is planned 
for this randomized study in which study subjects, investigator site personnel and the sponsor will be 
blinded to treatment assignment. Interim analyses for safety by Independent Monitoring Committee are 
advised to closer monitor patients and to obtain additional data in the course of the study. 
The final results of the study 303 will also be submitted as reflected in the RMP in order to provide further 
information on the safety profile at long term for the 20-mg dose versus the 24 mg. Similarly, final results 
of the ongoing study 201 in patients with thyroid cancer will be submitted to better inform on long-term 
safety profile of lenvatinib with the starting dose of 24 mg (see RMP). 
EMA/250082/2015

In the context of relatively long-term treatment of patients, the lack of quality of life data is of particular 
concern. Quality of life data were not collected in the randomized part of the study but will be assessed in 
30 patients from the open-label part of the study. Study of association between quality of life and safety 
profile will be informative and provide an insight from patient perspective. Studying of adherence at long 
treatment for an oral anti-cancer drug is of particular importance for long-term outcomes and disease 
control. These initial data in relatively small number of patients will be supportive and allow an optimized 
assessment in planned clinical trials. The MAH is also recommended to provide quality of life data from the 
Real World Observational QoL Study in 30 patients. QoL data will also be collected as part of study 211 in 
approximately 210 subjects. 
Safety profile 
Hypertension and proteinuria were the most common dose-limiting toxicities observed with lenvatinib in 
clinical  studies.  Hypertension  was  also  associated  with  the  rare  occurrence  of  posterior  reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). 
Hypertension and proteinuria tend to occur early during lenvatinib treatment (see section 4.8 Description 
of selected adverse reactions).    
It was recognized that the early detection and effective management of hypertension are important to 
minimise the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reductions, which could potentially impact the 
efficacy of lenvatinib.  Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to treatment with lenvatinib and, if 
patients are known to be hypertensive, they should be on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at 
least 1 week prior to treatment with lenvatinib. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as 
elevated BP is confirmed. Blood pressure should be monitored after 1 week of treatment with lenvatinib, 
then  every  2 weeks  for  the  first  2 months,  and  monthly  thereafter.  The  choice  of  antihypertensive 
treatment  should be  individualized  to  the  patient’s  clinical  circumstances  and  follow  standard  medical 
practice. For previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy with one of the classes of antihypertensives 
should  be  started  when  elevated  BP  is  observed.  For  those  patients  already  on  antihypertensive 
medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a 
different  class  of  antihypertensive  should  be  added.  For  patients  with  hypertension  and  proteinuria, 
treatment  with  an  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitor  or  angiotensin-II  receptor  antagonist  is 
preferred.    
Safety  results  for  Study  303  suggest  that  the  precautions  taken,  as  well  as  appropriate  dose 
modifications, were reasonably successful in managing hypertensive events when they occurred. When 
necesary, hypertension should be managed as recommended below.

hypertensive crisis) 
The development of proteinuria can also be managed by the dose/toxicity management plan.  The close 
monitoring  of  proteinuria,  in  combination  with  the  dose/toxicity  management  plan,  resulted  in  a 
treatment discontinuation rate of only 1.3% in the All DTC Safety Set.  Therefore, urine protein should be 
monitored regularly.  If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥ 2+ is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or 
discontinuation may be necessary. Lenvima should be discontinued in the event of nephrotic syndrome 
(see SmPC section 4.4). 
Proteinuria typically occurred early in treatment while other renal events occurred at varying times.  
Moreover, proteinuria was reported at a substantially higher rate than other renal events. If some 
association does exist between proteinuria and renal events, proteinuria does not appear to be an 
indicator for the occurrence of acute kidney injury. 
Other common AEs, occurring in 30% or more of subjects in the lenvatinib arm of Study 303, were 
diarrhoea, decreased appetite, weight decreased, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, dysphonia, 
headache, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE). The majority of Grade 3 to 4 
adverse reactions occurred during the first 6 months of treatment except for diarrhoea, which occurred 
throughout treatment, and weight loss, which tended to be cumulative over time. 
These major effects of lenvatinib appear to be consistent with its pharmacologic activity based on 
published reports of other VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies (Chen and Cleck, 2009).  These data were 
consistent with the events reported in the Phase 2 studies, and all were reported more frequently with 
lenvatinib than with placebo.  The large majority of such AEs were reversible upon treatment modification 
or discontinuation. Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally do not warrant 
interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management.  Severe (e.g., 
Grade 3) or intolerable adverse reactions require interruption of lenvatinib until resolution or 
improvement of the reaction, after which treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose as suggested 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  Treatment should be discontinued in case of life-threatening reactions (e.g., 
Grade 4) with the exception of laboratory abnormality judged to be non-life-threatening, in which case 
they should be managed as severe reaction (e.g., Grade 3). 
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose reductions (in ≥ 5% of patients) were hypertension, 
proteinuria, diarrhoea, fatigue, PPE, weight decreased, and decreased appetite.  Adverse reactions that 
most commonly led to discontinuation of lenvatinib were proteinuria, asthenia, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular accident, diarrhoea, and pulmonary embolism (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Optimal medical management for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea should be initiated prior to any 
interruption or dose reduction of lenvatinib.   
Across all safety sets, the most frequently reported non-fatal SAEs were pneumonia, dehydration, 
hypertension, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. 
Based on the available safety data, the most important serious adverse reactions are renal failure and 
impairment, cardiac failure, intracranial tumor haemorrhage, PRES / RPLS, hepatic failure, and arterial 
thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and myocardial infarction (see 
SmPC section 4.8). 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 150/169 
 
 
  
  
 
The majority of renal events were mild to moderate, with Grade 3-4 events occurring at a very low rate, 
most renal events were reversible and resolved with hydration and did not lead to premature 
discontinuation.  The primary risk factor identified was dehydration and/or hypovolemia due to 
gastrointestinal toxicity.  Gastrointestinal toxicity should be actively managed in order to reduce the risk 
of development of renal impairment or renal failure.  Dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation 
may be necessary (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). If patients have severe renal impairment, the initial 
dose of lenvatinib should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Cardiac failure (<1%) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported in patients 
treated with lenvatinib.  Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac 
decompensation, as dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, also known as RPLS), has been reported in patients 
treated with lenvatinib (<1%; see section 4.8).  PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with 
headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or 
neurological disturbances.  Mild to severe hypertension may be present.  Magnetic resonance imaging is 
necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.  Appropriate measures should be taken to control blood 
pressure (see SmPC section 4.4 Hypertension).  In patients with signs or symptoms of PRES, dose 
interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Most hepatic events were related to liver enzyme elevations or hypoalbuminemia, and were Grade 1 or 2. 
Grade 3-4 hepatic events occurred in 5% or fewer of lenvatinib-treated DTC subjects. No true Hy’s Law’s 
case was found. Hepatic events were controlled with dose modification and 1 DTC subject discontinued 
lenvatinib. There was 1 death among DTC patients. Overall, liver-related adverse reactions most 
commonly reported in patients treated with lenvatinib included increases in alanine aminotransferase, 
increases in aspartate aminotransferase, and increases in blood bilirubin.  Hepatic failure and acute 
hepatitis (<1%) have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib.  The hepatic failure cases were 
generally reported in patients with progressive liver metastases.  Liver function tests should be monitored 
before initiation of treatment, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during 
treatment.  In the case of hepatotoxicity, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be 
necessary (see section 4.2). If patients have severe hepatic impairment, the initial dose of lenvatinib 
should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Although the risk of bleeding has been linked with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies, the incidence of 
mucocutaneous bleeding was similar in the two arms of study 303 and 1.3% of subjects discontinued on 
this ground. Serious cases of haemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see 
SmPC section 4.8).  Cases of fatal intracranial haemorrhage have been reported in some patients with 
brain metastases.  In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be 
necessary (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Arterial thromboembolism events reported included cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, 
and myocardial infarction (see section 4.8).  Lenvatinib has not been studied in patients who have had an 
arterial thromboembolism within the previous 6 months, and therefore should be used with caution in 
such patients.  A treatment decision should be made based upon an assessment of the individual patient's 
benefit/risk. Lenvima should be discontinued following an arterial thrombotic event (see SmPC section 
4.4). 
It is currently unknown if lenvatinib increases the risk of thromboembolic events when combined with oral 
contraceptives (see SmPC 4.4). 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 151/169 
 
 
  
  
With regards to gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae, in most cases, these events occurred in patients 
with risk factors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy.  In the case of a gastrointestinal perforation or 
fistula, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Although a thorough QT study (Study 002) concluded that lenvatinib did not have a significant effect on 
the QT interval, in DTC patients, there appears to be a numerically higher incidence of QTc-prolongation 
events with lenvatinib. There were no reports of ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Based on 
the available data it is considered that electrocardiograms should be monitored in all patients with a 
special attention for those with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, 
and those taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III 
antiarrhythmics (see SmPC section 4.4).  In addition, the association of hypokalemia with QTc 
prolongation has been shown. Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or 
hypomagnesaemia increase the risk of QT prolongation, therefore electrolyte abnormalities should be 
monitored and corrected in all patients before starting treatment. Periodic monitoring of ECG and 
electrolytes (magnesium, potassium and calcium) should be considered during treatment (see SmPC 
section 4.4). Considering that electrolyte imbalances will be duly monitored (and corrected) before and 
after the treatment, it is accepted that the use of thiazide diuretics do not need to be restricted in patients 
treated with lenvatinib. 
As serious hypocalcaemia may induce musculoskeletal issues, but also major cardiac issues, it has been 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk. 
Post-treatment changes in serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are of interest in patients 
already  at  risk  of  biochemical  hypothyroidism.  Considering  that  lenvatinib  impairs  exogenous  thyroid 
suppression (see SmPC section 4.8), thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels should be monitored on a 
regular basis and thyroid hormone administration should be adjusted to reach appropriate TSH levels, 
according to the patient’s therapeutic target (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Considering that no ILD-like events have been reported in the placebo group and that the ILD-like events 
reported with lenvatinib included one grade 3 event, ILD-like events was included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP.  
One class effect (Wound healing) was reported with low frequency (7 out of 452 patients) and low severity 
grade (grade 1 or 2; 1 event was grade 3). However, since patients with major surgery within 3 to 4 
weeks prior to study entry were excluded from clinical trials, the risk of impaired wound healing in clinical 
trials may not be representative of the risk in clinical practice. Impaired wound healing is included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
Overall, the methodology used to characterize an AE as related to lenvatinib, and included it in section 4.8 
of the SmPC was clarified and is considered acceptable. It should be noted that the lenvatinib arm of the 
pivotal study had a median duration of exposure about 4 times that of the placebo arm and that this was 
taken into account for the assessment of causality of adverse reactions. Time-adjusted event rates were 
compared between lenvatinib arm and placebo arm. From the safety database all the adverse reactions 
reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Special population 
A  relatively  short  duration  of  exposure  in  some  patient  subpopulations  is  of  concern  and  has  been 
addressed in the RMP.  
Patients of age ≥ 75 years, of Asian race, with comorbidities (such as hypertension, and hepatic or renal 
impairment), or body weight below 60 kg appear to have reduced tolerability to lenvatinib.  All patients 
other than those with severe hepatic or renal impairment should initiate treatment at the recommended 
24 mg dose, following which the dose should be further adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability. 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 152/169 
 
 
  
  
Dose adjustements are recommended for patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe 
(Child-Pugh C)  hepatic impairment (see Clinical pharmacokinetics). Further dose adjustments may be 
necessary on the basis of individual tolerability. This approach will be studied in the future in the elderly 
aged more than 75 years old as reflected in the RMP. 
AEs in Japanese subjects were well managed with the use of concomitant medications and the planned 
dose modification schema, and premature discontinuations due to AEs were low. Numbers of 
non-Japanese Asian patients in the pivotal study were small. The Study 208 is still ongoing and relatively 
short follow-up did not allow adequate assessment of long-term safety profile in this patients. Therefore, 
final results of the study 208 will be submitted when available (see RMP). Pharmacokinetic data showed 
that patients weighing less than 60 kg had a 36% higher exposure than subjects weighing 60 kg or more, 
but that this had no effect on efficacy. However, this cannot be extrapolated to safety and further 
collection of data in subjects with lower body weight in study 211 could inform whether a lower starting 
dose is more appropriate (see RMP).  
Overall, the results for the subgroup analyses did not indicate any new safety concern for any of the 
tested populations of subjects.  Although higher rates of some TEAEs were observed for subjects who had 
certain baseline risk factors than for those without the comorbidities, the specific events observed were 
not unexpected in the disease population.  Subjects should be monitored and AEs should be managed on 
an individual basis, following the algorithm for management of toxicity using early detection, the use of 
concomitant medication for TEAEs, and dose interruptions or dose reductions, if needed. Since limited 
data are available for patients of ethnic origin other than Caucasian or Asian, and in patients aged ≥ 75 
years, lenvatinib should be used with caution in such patients, given the reduced tolerability of lenvatinib 
in Asian and elderly patients (see SmPC section 4.4 and RMP). 
Clinical data are not yet available in the paediatric population (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
It is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns or infants cannot be 
excluded and, therefore, lenvatinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see SmPC sections 4.3 and 
RMP).  
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib in pregnant women.  Lenvatinib was embryotoxic and 
teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits (see section non-clinical aspects and SmPC sections 
4.6 and 5.3).  Lenvatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful 
consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus.  Abnormal pregnancy outcome is 
covered in the RMP. 
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib immediately following sorafenib or other anticancer treatments 
and  there  may  be  a  potential  risk  for  additive  toxicities  unless  there  is  an  adequate  washout  period 
between treatments.  The minimal washout period in clinical trials was of 4 weeks (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is a contraindication (see SmPC 
section 4.3). 
Lenvatinib has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, due to undesirable effects such 
as fatigue and dizziness.  Patients who experience these symptoms should use caution when driving or 
operating machines. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of lenvatinib was consistent across studies in patients with thyroid cancer and 
is in line with safety profile of other multiple kinase inhibitors targeting VEGFRs and other receptor 
tyrosine kinases. The toxicity was considered acceptable and manageable with the starting dose of daily 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 153/169 
 
 
  
  
24 mg and prospectively studied algorithm of dose reductions/interruptions and discontinuation of the 
drug depending on grade of observed toxicity. This supported long duration of exposure to lenvatinib, in 
comparison to placebo. 
Dose reductions/interruptions were needed in the majority of patients and about one fifth of patients 
discontinued treatment due to toxicity across the studies. Therefore, there is a need to further study an 
optimal starting dose for the overall target population. Data on safety and activity of lower starting doses 
will be provided through a randomised dose-finding trial E7080-G000-211 (see RMP). Overall safety 
profile and tolerability of the three starting doses will be studied in trial and concomitant collection of 
quality of life data will further inform on an optimal starting dose in intended population of patients with 
progressive RR-DTC. 
The adverse event profile of the drug has been fairly well documented. Further analyses of long-term 
safety profile of lenvatinib from currently ongoing studies 201 and 303 will make part of 
pharmacovigilance activities. Considering the pattern of toxicity in Japanese patients, its evaluation 
based on the final results of the ongoing study 208 will be provided (see RMP). Further collection of data 
in other subgroups of patients (such as patients aged ≥ 75 years or patients with lower body weight) will 
be ensured by the planned study 211.

readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling of the outer carton as per Art.63.1 of Directive 
2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for 
the following reasons: 
The justification was not considered strong enough and, on the other hand, the product was meant to be 
handled directly by patients. Multilingual packs could be an option provided readability is not 
compromised. 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling of the blister as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The QRD Group was in agreement to have an English only blister that includes the pharmaceutical form. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefit 
The pivotal Phase 3 Study 303 showed a significant improvement of 14.7 months (HR 0.21 (99% CI: 
0.14, 0.31), p<0.0001) in progression free survival in RR-DTC patients treated with lenvatinib compared 
to those patients treated with placebo.  
The PFS results were shown to be robust, using multiple sensitivity and based on the secondary efficacy 
analyses, all of which were highly significant (P<0.0001) in favour of lenvatinib.   
An effect on PFS of this magnitude is considered to be clinically relevant and should be associated with a 
delay in onset or worsening of symptoms. 
The PFS results were supported by a high response rate (64.8% ORR with lenvatinib compared to 1.5% 
with placebo).  4 subjects attained a complete response.  Responses were durable and the median 
duration of response was not reached, but the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeded 16 months 
and 75% of the responses lasted longer than 9 months.   
Tumour shrinkage was initially rapid and continued throughout the treatment period.  The observed nadir 
in tumour size continued to decrease over time and additional partial responses were detected even after 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 163/169 
 
 
  
  
 
6 months of lenvatinib treatment.  In particular, for the subset of subjects treated for at least 1 year, 
continued tumour shrinkage was observed throughout the treatment period.   
Response and PFS data from Phase 2 Study 201 were consistent with, and fully support, the results of the 
Phase 3 study. 
Lenvatinib showed efficacy in all subgroups tested, including subjects who had received prior 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy.  The majority of these subjects had received prior sorafenib, suggesting 
that lenvatinib can induce responses in subjects who have failed sorafenib treatment.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The results from the Study 303 are based mainly on, and provide support for, the starting dose of 24 mg 
QD  for  RR-DTC.  However,  in  the  DTC  Randomized  Safety  Set  of  Study  303,  83.1%  and  68.2%  of 
lenvatinib-treated subjects had dose interruptions or reductions, respectively. Results for 30 subjects in 
the optional open labelled phase of the Study 303, that received lenvatinib at a starting dose of 20 mg, 
showed efficacy results similar to that obtained with a starting dose of 24 mg, though there are possible 
confounding  factors  which  may  affect  the  results  favourably  in  the  subjects  who  received  the  lower 
starting  dose.  Considering  the  small  number  of  patients,  and  possible  confounding  factors,  firm 
conclusions could not be reached. Data on lower doses (20 mg and 14 mg) will be provided from study 
211 in order to optimise the benefit/ risk profile of the product. 
Another uncertainty is whether lenvatinib significantly improves overall survival. Median OS for lenvatinib 
in Study 303 was not reached as of the cutoff date for the primary analysis of PFS.  Furthermore, the OS 
analysis in Study 303 is confounded by the crossover design and the use of subsequent anticancer 
therapy post study.  As of the most recent cutoff date of 15 June 2014, with a median follow-up period of 
23.6 months in the lenvatinib arm the median OS was still not reached while in the placebo arm with a 
median follow-up time of 24.1 months, the median OS was 19.1 months (95% CI: 14.3, NE). The analysis 
of OS, although not statistically significant, showed a numerical superiority for lenvatinib with an HR of 
0.80 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.12; P=0.1993).  Analyses of OS to correct for cross-over did not reveal any 
concerns in terms of a possible detriment in terms of OS. 
Quality of life data from Study 303 (30 subjects in the Study 303 OOL treatment phase) may provide 
further  understanding  about  the  benefits  (and  risks)  of  lenvatinib  (see  RMP).  In  addition,  PROs  and 
symptomology in relation to adherence, safety and efficacy outcomes in patients that will receive different 
starting doses in the planned Study 211 will contribute to benefit/risk assessment of different starting 
doses (see RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of single-agent lenvatinib has been examined in 1108 cancer patients including  452 subjects 
with RR-DTC in Phase 2 and 3 studies (423 of whom received the recommended dose of 24 mg) and 656 
subjects with other cancer types, including MTC and ATC.  Almost all subjects had at least 1 TEAE.   
The  most  common  AEs  are  hypertension  (69%),  diarrhoea  (67%),  decreased  appetite  (54%),  weight 
decrease (51%) among which hypertension, proteinuria, liver events and hypocalcaemia were the most 
frequent  grade  3  and  grade  4  clinically  significant  adverse  effects,  and  haemorrhages,  arterial 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 164/169 
 
 
  
  
 
thromboembolisms  (including  myocardial  infarction),  liver  and  renal  events  were  possible  causes  of 
deaths. 
Hypertension and proteinuria were the most common dose-limiting toxicities observed with lenvatinib in 
clinical studies.    
Risks of hypertension, proteinuria and thromboembolic events commonly associated with VEGFi 
treatment were higher in lenvatinib-treated patients. About 2/3 of the patients had a worsening of their 
blood pressure, 56% reached grade 3 or 4 and about 3.4% discontinued. Hypertension has also likely an 
influence on other AEs such as hemorrhages, proteinuria, pulmonary embolism, together linked to the 
discontinuation of about 4% of the patients and at least 1/10th of the fatal events. Hypertension was also 
associated with the rare occurrence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).  
Based on the expected adverse effects, early detection and effective management of hypertension are 
important to minimize the need for dose interruptions and reductions. Effective management includes use 
of antihypertensive treatment individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and following standard 
medical practice.  For subjects with hypertension and proteinuria, treatment with an 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist is preferred.  Safety 
results for Study 303 show that these precautions, as well as appropriate dose modifications, were 
successful in managing hypertensive events when they occurred. 
The development of proteinuria can also be managed by the dose/toxicity management plan as reflected 
in the SmPC. In the Phase 3 clinical study, the risk of developing proteinuria was routinely monitored via 
dipstick testing.  The close monitoring of proteinuria, in combination with the dose/toxicity management 
plan, resulted in a treatment discontinuation rate of only 1.3% in the All DTC Safety Set.    
Other common AEs, occurring in 30% or more of subjects in the lenvatinib arm of Study 303, were weight 
decrease, GI symptoms, fatigue, headache, PPE, and dysphonia.  The large majority of such AEs were 
reversible  upon  treatment  modification  or  discontinuation.  Across  all  safety  sets,  the  most  frequently 
reported nonfatal serious adverse events were pneumonia, dehydration, hypertension, hypotension, and 
pulmonary embolism. 
The GI track is the most frequently affected. Diarrhoea has a similar incidence than hypertension and 
even exceeds it when the duration of the AEs is taken into account. Nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, all are 
concerns for more than 1/3 of the patients and constipation for more than ¼.  All together about 20% of 
the patients suffered from AEs grade 3 or 4.  
Hypocalcaemia was observed during clinical development at a higher rate with lenvatinib than with 
placebo and 23 cases of grade 3/4 hypocalcaemia have been reported with lenvatinib vs 2 with placebo. 
Electrolyte abnormalities should be monitored as reflected in the SmPC. 
Overall, adverse events were well managed using the dose reduction and interruption schemes used in 
the studies. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  chosen  dose  of  24  mg  is  associated  with  frequent  and  important  levels  of  dose  reductions  and 
interruptions. Lower starting doses, at least in some patients, might result in similar efficacy and provide 
more  favourable  safety  profile.  However,  currently  available  data  are  inadequate  to  support 
recommendations for a starting dose lower than 24 mg QD. In view of important toxicities of lenvatinib 
and frequently asymptomatic course of disease in patients, a choice of an adequate dose with the aim of 
optimizing benefit/risk balance is of importance, in particular considering the relatively long survival of 
EMA/250082/2015 
Page 165/169 
 
 
  
  
patients with DTC. Study 211 will provide relevant data to compare the 24 mg starting dose with lower 
starting doses.  
Safety profiles in patients aged ≥ 75 years old, patients from ethnic origins other than Caucasian or Asian 
are poorly characterised. Therefore these populations are covered in the Risk Management Plan. 
The higher incidence of adverse events in Japanese subjects and subjects less than 60 kg body weight is 
noted, with earlier dose reduction. The Applicant will evaluate the suitability of a lower starting dose in all 
patients with particular attention to these populations in study 211 (see RMP). 
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib in paediatric population. Lenvatinib must not be used in children 
younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns identified in animal studies.  Lenvatinib has been 
shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses below the recommended human 
dose (based on body surface area). Bone and teeth abnormalities in the paediatric population are 
adequately addressed in the Risk Management Plan. 
There are no studies in pregnant women, and the effects of lenvatinib on human foetal development or in 
breastfeeding infants are unknown.  Lenvatinib should not be used during pregnancy (see SmPC).  
In  addition,  it  is  not  known  if  lenvatinib  is  excreted  in  milk.  A  risk  to  newborns  or  infants  cannot  be 
excluded and, therefore, lenvatinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
RR-DTC patients may be asymptomatic at the time of progression and symptoms generally appear in 
more advanced stages of the disease when tumour burden is important and prognosis is very poor. In this 
context, an important objective of treatment is to delay progression and delay symptomatic disease.  
The clinical benefit of lenvatinib has been demonstrated in the pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
randomized  Phase  3  trial,  Study  303.    The  results  of  this  study  provide  clear  evidence  of  a  clinically 
meaningful improvement in PFS in subjects with RR-DTC.  
The magnitude of PFS improvement is of clear clinical relevance and is consistently associated with an 
ORR of about 50%. The median PFS gain of about 14.7 months is undoubtedly beneficial. 
Another important objective of treatment is to prolong survival. Although no detriment in overall survival 
has been observed, differences in duration of overall survival between treatment groups are difficult to 
observe  in  the  context  of  the  pivotal  trial  because  of  the  cross-over  design.  Exploratory  analyses 
adjusting for cross-over showed a significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups 
at  the  data  cutoff  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  However,  such  analyses  are  exploratory  and  the 
methods used rely on assumptions that cannot be easily verified.  Thus, whether lenvatinib is associated 
with a significant effect on overall survival remains to be established.  
Hypertension  and  proteinuria  were  the  most  clinically  relevant  dose-limiting  toxicities  observed  with 
lenvatinib  in  clinical  studies.  About  2/3  of  the  patients  had  a  worsening  of  their  blood  pressure,  56% 
reached grade 3 or 4 and about 3.4% discontinued. Hypertension has also likely an incidence on other AEs 
such as hemorrhages, proteinuria, pulmonary embolism, together linked to the discontinuation of about 
4% of the patients and at least 1/10th of the fatal events). Hypertension was also associated with the rare 
occurrence  of  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES).  Liver  and  renal  events  were 
possible causes of deaths.

Despite the high incidence of TEAEs and SAEs observed, safety analyses showed that lenvatinib had 
predominantly a predictable and manageable safety profile. Although lenvatinib 24 mg QD was associated 
with significant toxicity, in general, the toxicities were expected, consistent with those associated with 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents, and could be managed with the planned dose/toxicity management plan.

Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of lenvatinib in the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally advanced 
or metastatic, differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory to 
radioactive iodine (RAI) is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The pivotal Study 303 met its primary endpoint and demonstrated a robust and statistically significant 
improvement in median PFS associated to treatment with lenvatinib comparing to placebo. The observed

PFS  gain  of  14.7  months  is  of  clinical  relevance  in  patients  with  progressive  locally  advanced  and 
metastatic disease. There is a positive initial signal in terms of OS improvement but more mature data is 
needed. 
Overall, available evidence-based data are associated with a dose of 24 mg used in the pivotal Phase 3 
study and data on lower starting doses are limited precluding current recommendation to an alternative 
dose or schedule. Nevertheless lower doses will be evaluated post-marketing in Study E7080-G000-211. 
Study E7080-G000-211 is conducted with primary objective to determine whether a starting dose of 
lenvatinib 20 mg or 14 mg QD will provide comparable efficacy (based on ORR at 6 months) with an 
improved safety profile to 24 mg QD (based on TEAE Grade 3 or higher in the first 6 months after 
randomization). The results of exposure-biomarkers-clinical endpoint relationship analyses will be 
informative for efficacy and safety of different dose levels. 
Based on indirect comparison, lenvatinib is associated with a similar overall safety profile to sorafenib, 
although lenvatinib seems to be associated with higher rates of hypertension, proteinuria and GI events 
such as nausea and vomiting while sorafenib is associated with higher rates of PPE, rash, alopecia, and 
blood TSH increased. Despite the higher proportion of lenvatinib-treated subjects having SAEs, the dose 
reduction and the discontinuation rates due to AEs in the active treatment arms (lenvatinib and sorafenib) 
were similar, indicating that the majority of TEAEs experienced with lenvatinib can be adequately 
managed to avoid premature discontinuations. With regard to efficacy, in Study 303 and DECISION, the 
active treatments (lenvatinib and sorafenib respectively) highly significantly improved PFS (p<0.0001) 
compared with placebo. The difference in median PFS between the active treatment and placebo arms 
was 14.7 months with lenvatinib in Study 303 and 5.0 months with sorafenib in the DECISION study. The 
differences in populations might have contributed to the differences observed between the placebo arms 
of the two studies (median PFS of 3.6 months with placebo in the study 303 vs median PFS of 5.8 months 
with placebo in the DECISION study).   
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lenvima is not similar to Nexavar within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Lenvima in the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally advanced 
or metastatic differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory to 
radioactive iodine (RAI) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

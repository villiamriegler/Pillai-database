Introduction 
On  16  June  2022,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Fycompa  oral  suspension,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Perampanel is a highly selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. In the EU, 
Fycompa  (perampanel), 
following  the  extension  of 
indication 
in  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047), is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
Perampanel has also been approved as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients with 
POS aged 4  years and older in the US as of September 2018. The International Birth Date is 23 July 
2012  in  the  EU  (via  the  centralized  procedure).  Perampanel  is  marketed  under  the  trade  name 
Fycompa and is available as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
EISAI  is  hereby  submitting  final  study  results  and  report  related  to  paediatric  population  for  Study 
E2007-G000-338  (referred  to  as  Study  338).  This  study  338  was  a  multicenter,  double-blind, 
randomized,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  (Core  Study)  followed  by  an  Extension  Phase 
(Extension  A  and  Extension  B)  of  perampanel  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  2  years  of  age  and 
older  with  inadequately  controlled  seizures  associated  with  Lennox-Gastaut  Syndrome  (LGS).  The 
study  enrolled  70  subjects  (planned  142  subjects,  (71  placebo,  71  perampanel))  of  which  34  were 
treated  with  perampanel  in  the  study,  22  of  whom  were  less  than  18  years  of  age.  A  total  of  61 
subjects completed the Core Study (29 perampanel, of whom 20 were less than 18 years of age), and 
58 of them entered Extension A (40 were less than 18 years of age). A total of 32 subjects completed 
Extension  A,  (23  were  less  than  18  years  of  age);  and  13  of  them  entered  Extension  B  (9  were  less 
than 18 years of age). 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-
epileptic treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of drop seizures during 18 weeks of 
treatment in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. 
The  submission  of  these  final  data  is  being  made  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  to  fulfil  the 
obligation to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a paediatric population.  
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  study  338,  Multicenter,  Double-Blind,  Randomized,  Placebo-
Controlled  Trial  With  an  Open-Label  Extension  Phase  of  Perampanel  as  Adjunctive  Treatment  in 
Subjects at Least 2 Years of Age With Inadequately Controlled Seizures Associated With LGS. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The  study  was  a  phase  3,  Multicenter,  Double-Blind,  Randomized,  Placebo-Controlled  Trial  With  an 
Open-Label  Extension  Phase  of  Perampanel  as  Adjunctive  Treatment  in  Subjects  at  Least  2  Years  of 
Age  With  Inadequately  Controlled Seizures  Associated  With  LGS.  A  total  of  74  sites  were  selected,  of 
which 40 sites enrolled subjects as follows: US (16), India (6), Japan (7), Belgium (5), Australia (3), 
South Korea (2), and Czech Republic (1). 
The  study  consisted  of  3  phases:  Prerandomization,  Randomization,  and  Extension.  The  Core  Study 
consisted of the Prerandomization and Randomization Phases. 
  Core Study 
• Prerandomization Phase (Screening and Baseline Periods): 4 to 8 weeks 
The  Prerandomization  Phase  will  consist  of  a  4-  to  8-week  Screening/Baseline  Period  during  which 
subjects  were  assessed  for  overall  eligibility  to  participate  in  the  study,  including  seizure  activity. 
Baseline  seizure  count  were  assessed  using  all  diary  data  before  randomization  (at  least  4  weeks 
prospectively).  Following  successful  completion  of  this  period,  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive 
perampanel or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
• Randomization Phase: Titration Period = 6 weeks, Maintenance Period = 12 weeks (for a total of 18 
weeks) followed by a 4-week Follow-up Period (for those subjects not entering into Extension A) 
  Extension phases 
Extension A: Conversion Period = 6 weeks (subjects who received perampanel during the Core Study 
continued  to  receive  perampanel  in  a  blinded  manner  at  the  same  dose  received  during  the  Core 
Maintenance  Period.  Subjects  who  received  placebo  during  the  Core  Study  began  treatment  with 
perampanel  in  a  blinded  manner),  Maintenance  Period  =  46  weeks  (for  a  total  of  52  weeks)  followed 
by  a  4-week  Follow-up  Period  (for  those  not  entering  into  Extension  B).  During  the  Extension  A 
Maintenance Period, subjects could be titrated up to 12 mg/day (except in Japan, where the maximum 
allowed dose remained at 8 mg/day), in 2-week intervals as per the investigator’s discretion. Addition, 
deletion, and dose changes to the concomitant AEDs were then allowed. 
Extension  B:  Until  perampanel  is  available  commercially  for  the  treatment  of  LGS,  or  accessible  via 
extended access program (if activated in the country in which a subject resides), or until the study was 
terminated by the sponsor. 
An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 1: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023  
Page 5/40 
 
 
 
R = randomization. 
a: Subjects who do not continue in Extension A or those who prematurely discontinue from the study will return to 
the study site for Follow-up visits 1 week and 4 weeks after the last study drug administration. 
b: Subjects will be up-titrated to optimize efficacy while maintaining good tolerability, up to a maximum dose of 8 
mg/day. Once titrated, all subjects will be kept at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks (to reach steady-state) before 
the  start  of  the  Maintenance  Period.  The  dose  of  study  drug  during  the  Maintenance  Period  will  be  the  last  dose 
achieved at the end of the Titration Period. 
c:  After  the  double-blind  Conversion  Period  of  Extension  A,  subjects  can  be  titrated  (except  in  Japan,  where  the 
maximum  allowed  dose  remains  at  8  mg/day)  up  to  12  mg/day  in  2-week  intervals,  as  per  the  investigator’s 
discretion. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Subjects who completed all scheduled visits of the 18-week Core Study were eligible to participate in 
the  52-week  open  label  Extension  A  (6-week  Double-blind  Conversion  Period  followed  by  a  46-week 
Open-label  Maintenance  Period).  The  total  treatment  duration  in  Extension  A  was  52  weeks  aimed  at 
assessing long-term safety and efficacy of perampanel treatment in LGS subjects. Subjects who lived 
in  Japan  or  another  country  where  an  extended  access  program  was  not  implemented  and  who 
completed Extension A, were eligible to continue perampanel treatment in Extension B. Participation in 
Extension B continued as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgment of the investigator or 
until an extended access program was activated or perampanel was commercially available. 
This  study  was  terminated  by  the  sponsor  before  completion  due  to  challenges  with  subject 
recruitment  that  was  further  impacted  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Study  discontinuation  was  not 
related to any safety concern. The submission of the results of this study are more than 6 months after 
the end of this study due to some delays in finalising the data sets for the EEG report, which delayed 
the subsequent data analysis.

Methods 
Study participants 
  Core Study 
The  Core  Study  enrolled  male  or  female  subjects  who  were  at  least  2  years  old  at  the  time  of 
consent/assent and had a minimum body weight of 8 kg. Subjects were to be less than 11 years old at 
the onset of LGS. 
Subjects were to have a diagnosis of LGS as evidenced by more than one type of generalized seizures, 
including  drop  seizures  (atonic,  tonic,  or  myoclonic)  for  at  least  6  months  before  screening  and  an 
electroencephalogram  (EEG)  reporting  diagnostic  criteria  for  LGS  at  some  point  in  their  history 
(abnormal background activity accompanied by slow, spike and wave pattern <2.5 Hz).  
Subjects  were  to  be  receiving  1  to  4  concomitant  AEDs  at  a  stable  dose  for  at  least  30  days  before 
screening, and subjects must have experienced an average of at least 2 drop seizures per week in the 
4-week Baseline Period preceding randomization. 
  Extension Phases 
Extension  A:  Subjects  who  were  considered  reliable,  available  for  the  study  duration,  and  willing  to 
comply  with  study  procedures,  and  who  completed  all  scheduled  visits  up  to  and  including  Week  19 
(Visit 7) of the Core Study were eligible to participate in Extension A. 
Extension B: To be eligible for Extension B, a subject was to reside in Japan or in a country where an 
extended access program could not be implemented or had not yet been implemented. Subjects must 
have  completed  Extension  A,  and  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would  continue  to  benefit  from 
treatment with perampanel. 
Treatments 
The investigational medicinal product tested in Study 338 was Fycompa as 2-mg oral tablets and 0.5 
mg/ml  oral  suspension.  Perampanel  was  orally  administered  once  daily  before  bedtime.  Oral  tablets 
were recommended for dosing subjects ≥12 years of age and oral suspension for subjects <12 years of 
age.  However,  the  most  appropriate  formulation  was  to  be  selected  based  on  the  subject’s  condition 
and at the discretion of the investigator and was to be used for a given subject throughout the course 
of the study. 
Objective(s) 
  Primary objective 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-
epileptic treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of drop seizures during 18 weeks of 
treatment in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. 
  Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives were: 
1.  To  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-epileptic  treatment  was  superior  to 
placebo  in  reducing  the  incidence  of  all  seizures  during  18  weeks  of  treatment  in  subjects  with 
inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS

2.  To  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-epileptic  treatment  was  superior  to 
placebo  in  the  50%,  75%,  and  100%  responder  rates  for  drop  seizures  during  12  weeks  of  the 
Maintenance Period in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS 
3.  To  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-epileptic  treatment  was  superior  to 
placebo  in  the  50%,  75%,  and  100%  responder  rates  for  total  seizures  during  12  weeks  of  the 
Maintenance Period in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS 
4.  To  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-epileptic  treatment  was  superior  to 
placebo in reducing the incidence of non-drop seizures during 18 weeks of treatment in subjects with 
inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS 
5.  To  evaluate  the  50%,  75%,  and  100%  responder  rates  in  non-drop  seizure  frequency  during  12 
weeks of the Maintenance Period in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS 
6. To evaluate physicians’ global evaluation of subjects’ overall changes in symptoms 
7.  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  perampanel  relative  to  placebo  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  with 
inadequately  controlled  seizures  associated  with  LGS  during  both  the  Core  Study  and  the  Extension 
Phase 
8.  To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  the  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  (PK/PD) 
relationships  of  perampanel  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  seizures 
associated with LGS. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-
epileptic treatment was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of drop seizures during 18 weeks 
of treatment in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. The key secondary 
objectives  (objectives  1,  2  and  3)  were  to  demonstrate  that  perampanel  was  superior  to  placebo  in 
reducing total seizure frequency and in achieving a 50% or greater reduction in drop and total seizure 
frequency. 
The  primary  and  some  of  the  secondary  objectives  are  commonly  used  and  relevant  objectives  in 
phase 3 studies aimed at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of an antiepileptic drug versus placebo, 
as described in the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic 
disorders  (26  July  2018  CHMP/EWP/566/98  Rev.3).  Some  further  exploratory  objectives  were 
anticipated. These are however not described in detail in this report as regards to their relevance, all 
the more that the study was terminated earlier. 
The Applicant pointed out that due to the early termination of the study resulting in a reduced sample 
size,  and  given  the  variability  in  treatment  response,  population  PK  analysis  and  population  PK/PD 
modelling planned for this study were not conducted. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
  Primary Endpoint 
The primary  efficacy endpoint was the  median percent change in drop seizure frequency  per 28 days 
during  double-blind 
treatment  (Titration  Period  and  Maintenance  Period)  relative 
to 
the 
Prerandomization Phase. 
  Key Secondary Endpoints

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023  
Page 8/40 
 
 
 
1. Median percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days during double-blind treatment relative 
to the Prerandomization Phase 
2.  The  50%  responder  rate  in  the  Maintenance  Period  of  the  double-blind  treatment  relative  to  the 
Prerandomization Phase for drop seizures 
3.  The  50%  responder  rate  in  the  Maintenance  Period  of  the  double-blind  treatment  relative  to  the 
Prerandomization Phase for total seizures. 
  Other Secondary Endpoints: 
4.  Median  percent  change  in  non-drop  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  during  double-blind  treatment 
(Titration Period and Maintenance Period) relative to the Prerandomization Phase 
5. Proportion of subjects with 75%, and 100% responder rates for drop, non-drop, and total seizures 
in the Maintenance Period relative to the Prerandomization Phase 
6.  Proportion  of  subjects  with  50%  responder  rate  in  the  Maintenance  Period  of  the  double-blind 
treatment relative to the Prerandomization Phase for non-drop seizures 
7.  Physicians’  global  evaluation  of  the  subject’s  overall  changes  in  symptoms  (using  a  7-point  Likert 
scale with 1=very much improved and 7=very much worse) at the end of the double-blind treatment 
8. Incidence of AEs and SAEs, changes in clinical laboratory values, and vital signs 
9. Model-derived average perampanel concentrations at steady state (Cav,ss) during the Maintenance 
Period of the Core Study. (Due to the early termination of the study resulting in a reduced sample size, 
and given the variability in treatment response, population PK analysis and population PK/PD modeling 
planned for this study were not conducted). 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are  commonly  used  and  relevant  endpoints  in  phase  3  studies 
aimed at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of an antiepileptic drug versus placebo, as described in 
the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders (26 
July  2018  CHMP/EWP/566/98  Rev.3).  The  50%  responder  rate  is  usually  the  primary  endpoint  in  the 
EU procedures and the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days the secondary endpoint. This 
is the opposite in the US. Therefore, for studies intended to be conducted in both areas (US and EU), 
the most important is that both criteria develop similarly and match together. 
Some exploratory endpoints were anticipated. These are however not described in detail in this report 
as regards to their relevance, all the more that the study was terminated earlier. 
Sample size / Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The  sample  size  determination  was  based  on  the  primary  endpoint  percent  change  from  baseline  in 
drop seizures as follows: 
Placebo rates in drop seizures in the rufinamide and clobazam clinical trials were +1.4%, and -12.1%, 
respectively. In the active treatment arm, rufinamide had a median decrease of 42.5% in drop seizures 
and clobazam had mean decreases of 41.2%, 49.4%, and 68.3% for the low, medium, and high doses, 
respectively.  A  standard  deviation  of  ~63%  was  observed  for  both  rufinamide  and  for  the  medium 
dose of clobazam for drop seizures. It is assumed that comparable results will be seen in this trial for 
the placebo and perampanel treatment arms for drop seizures.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023  
Page 9/40 
 
 
 
A  sample  size  of  71  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm  in  the  FAS  will  have  94%  power  to  detect  a 
treatment  difference  in  median  percentage  seizure  frequency  change  in  drop  seizures  per  28  days  of 
40%  (common  SD  of  63%)  between  placebo  and  perampanel  based  on  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  at 
the 0.05 two-sided significance level. 
Study drugs were administered on a double-blind basis. During the Randomization Phase, subjects and 
all  personnel  involved  with  the  conduct  and  interpretation  of  the  study,  including  investigators,  site 
personnel,  and  sponsor  staff  were  blinded  to  the  treatment  codes.  Randomization  data  were  kept 
strictly  confidential,  filed  securely  by  an  appropriate  group  with  the  sponsor  or  contract  research 
organization (CRO) and accessible only to authorized persons (eg, Eisai Global Safety) until the time of 
unblinding, per standard operating procedure (SOP). 
CHMP’s comment: 
Approximately 142 subjects were planned to be randomized (71 placebo, 71 perampanel). The sample 
size  calculation  was  described  in  the  protocol  with  the  primary  endpoint  of  median  percent  change 
from  baseline  tested  at  a  0.05  significance  level.  Since  the  study  ended  earlier  with  a  resulting 
reduction  in  sample  size,  the  study  had  lower  power  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  difference 
between treatment groups. This prevented from drawing any robust conclusion of the conducted study. 
In these circumstances, the sample size determination is not more valid. 
The  randomization  and  blinding  procedure  are  well  described  in  the  protocol  as  well  as  the  urgent 
unblinding procedure when mandatory for safety reasons. 
Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were performed after the study was completed and the database was locked. 
The analysis sets are defined as follows: 
  Core Study 
The  Safety  Analysis  Set  was  the  group  of  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  and 
had at least one post dose safety assessment.  
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was  the  group  of  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
study drug and had at least one post-dose seizure measurement.  
The  Per  Protocol  (PP)  Analysis  Set  was  the  group  of  subjects  who  sufficiently  complied  with  the 
protocol. 
The Intention to Treat Set (ITT) was the group of randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study drug. 
  Extension Phase 
In  general,  the  scope  of  endpoints  and  analyses  included  the  entirety  of  perampanel  exposure  (Core 
and Extension [Extension refers Extension A and Extension B, as applicable]). 
The Safety Analysis Set was the group of subjects who entered into Extension A and received at least 
one  dose  of  perampanel  and  had  at  least  one  post-perampanel  safety  assessment.  Subjects  who 
continued  into  Extension  B  were  included  in  this  Safety  Analysis  Set.  There  was  no  separate  Safety 
Analysis Set for Extension B alone. 
The  FAS  was  the  group  of  subjects  who  entered  into  Extension  A  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
perampanel and had at least one post-perampanel seizure measurement.

Results 
Participant flow / Recruitment 
  Core Study 
The subject disposition from the core study is displayed in Table 1 below: 
A total of 101 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these 101 subjects, there were 30 
screening failures and 70 subjects were randomized: 34 subjects were randomized to perampanel and 
36 subjects were randomized to placebo. One subject passed screening but was not randomized due to 
the termination of the study by the sponsor. 
By  age  subgroup,  35  subjects  were  children  (16  perampanel,  19  placebo),  13  subjects  were 
adolescents (6 perampanel, 7 placebo) and 22 subjects were adults (12 perampanel, 10 placebo). 
A total of 29 (85.3%) subjects in the perampanel group (including 16 children and 4 adolescents) and 
32  (88.9%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (including  16  children  and  6  adolescents)  completed  the 
Core Study. 
A  total  of  5  (14.7%)  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  4  (11.1%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group 
discontinued from the Core Study. The number (%) of subjects who discontinued from the Core Study 
and reasons for discontinuation by age subgroup was as follows: 
-  Children: No subjects in the perampanel group, and 3 (15.8%) subjects in the placebo group 
discontinued  from  the  Core  Study  due  to  lost  to  follow-up,  inadequate  therapeutic  effect,  or 
withdrawal of consent (1 [5.3%] subject each). 
-  Adolescents:  2  (33.3%)  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  discontinued  from  the  Core  Study 
due  to  adverse  event  and  withdrawal  of  consent  (1  [16.7%]  subject  each),  and  1  (14.3%) 
subject in the placebo group discontinued from the Core Study due to subject choice.

-  Adults: 3 (25.0%) subjects in the perampanel group discontinued from the Core Study due to 
adverse event (2 [16.7%] subjects) and study terminated by sponsor (1 [8.3%] subject), and 
no subjects in the placebo group discontinued from the Core Study. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Nearly 70% (48 subjects) of the population in the core study are children or adolescents. Twenty two 
adults  were  also  included  in  the  study,  although  this  is  a  P46  paediatric  procedure.  This  fact  has 
already  been  observed  previously  for  other  P46  procedures  with  perampanel.  It  is  considered 
preferable to focus only on paediatric population within the framework of P46 procedures in order not 
to dilute the information and collect more accurate and specific data. 
  Extension Phase 
Extension  A:  A  total  of  61  subjects  (29  in  the  perampanel  group  and  32  in  the  placebo  group) 
completed  the  Core  Study.  And  58  subjects  (including  30  children  and  10  adolescents)  entered  into 
Extension  A.  Of  these,  32  (55.2%)  subjects  (including  18  children  and  5  adolescents)  completed 
Extension A. Overall 26 (44.8%) subjects (including 12 children and 5 adolescents) discontinued from 
Extension  A.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  study  termination  by  the  sponsor  (3 
[10.0%] children and 2 [20.0%] adolescents). 
Extension  B:  Of  the  32  subjects  who  completed  Extension  A,  13  subjects  (including  5  children  and  4 
adolescents)  entered  into  Extension  B.  Of  these,  1  subject  (in  the  children  subgroup)  completed 
Extension B. Four (80.0%) children and 4 (100%) adolescents discontinued from Extension B, mostly 
due to study termination by the sponsor (3 [60.0%] children and 3 [75.0%] adolescents). Additionally, 
1 (7.7%) subject each discontinued due to AE, subject choice, inadequate therapeutic effect, or other 
reasons. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Apart from the high discontinuation rate after extension A (for a duration of 52 weeks), with a rate of 
44.8%,  depicting  that  nearly  1  in  2  patients  discontinue  the  study,  the  earlier  than  anticipated  study 
termination by the Sponsor led to the fact that only 1 subject actually completed the extension B. 
Baseline data 
  Core Study 
The demographic and other baseline characteristics in the core study from the Safety Analysis Set are 
displayed in Table 2 below: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023  
Page 12/40 
 
 
 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  perampanel  and  placebo  groups  were  comparable  in  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics. 
Overall, the mean (SD) age was 14.0 (9.10) years (ranging from 2 to 39 years). A total of 35 (50.0%) 
subjects were children, 13 (18.6%) subjects were adolescents, and 22 (31.4%) subjects were adults. 
There were no elderly subjects enrolled in this study.  
Most  subjects  were  white  (44.3%)  or  Japanese  (27.1%).  Most  subjects  were  not  Hispanic  or  Latino 
(87.1%). Slightly more males (40 [57.1%] subjects) than females (30 [42.9%] subjects) were in the 
study. 
The  epilepsy-specific  medical  history  in  the  core  study  from  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  are  displayed  in 
Table 3 below:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023  
Page 13/40 
 
 
 
 
CHMP’s comment: 
The perampanel and placebo groups were comparable with regard to epilepsy-specific medical history. 
The overall median (minimum, maximum) time since diagnosis of epilepsy was 7.34 (0.0, 33.1) years. 
The  suspected  localization  of  the  epileptogenic  region  was  symptomatic  in  37  (52.9%)  subjects  and 
idiopathic in 17 (24.3%) subjects. The most common seizure types (based on epilepsy-specific medical 
history) were tonic and/or atonic seizures (68 [97.1%] subjects), myoclonic seizures with and without 
fall  (21  [30.0%]  and  30  [42.9%]  subjects,  respectively),  primary  generalized  tonic  clonic  (PGTC) 
seizures (32 [45.7%] subjects), and atypical absence seizures (30 [42.9%] subjects). 
By  age  subgroup,  the  median  (minimum,  maximum)  time  since  diagnosis  of  epilepsy  was  shortest  in 
children  (4.25  [0.0,  11.4]  years)  compared  with  adolescents  (8.77  [0.1,  17.0]  years)  and  adults 
(16.70 [0.3, 33.1] years).  
In  all  age  subgroups,  the  most  commonly  reported  seizure  types  were  tonic  and/or  atonic  seizures 
(97.1% for children, 92.3% for adolescents and 100% for adults).

Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AED) at Baseline: 
Overall,  all  but  1  subject  (69  [98.6%]  subjects)  were  reported  to  be  receiving  at  least  one  AED  at 
baseline. For the 1 subject (an adolescent) without a reported AED at baseline, the subject was in fact 
receiving  an  AED,  but  the  start  date  of  AED  was  recorded  incorrectly  in  the  database.  Most  subjects 
received 2 or 3 AEDs at baseline (19 [27.1%] or 40 [57.1%] subjects, respectively), whatever the age 
groups.  Nearly  all  subjects  in  this  study  were  taking  only  non-inducer  type  AEDs  (68  [97.1%] 
subjects).  The  most  common  baseline  AEDs  were  clobazam  (35  [50.0%]  subjects),  lamotrigine  (22 
[31.4%]  subjects),  rufinamide  (20  [28.6%]  subjects),  topiramate  (18  [25.7%]  subjects),  valproate 
sodium (17 [24.3%] subjects), and levetiracetam (16 [22.9%] subjects). 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  subjects  received  the  recommended  and  authorized  treatments  for  the  treatment  of  seizures  in 
LGS. Inducer type AED are usually not recommended in that case since it could promote or aggravate 
the occurrence of some seizures. In all age subgroups, nearly all subjects were taking only non-inducer 
type  AEDs  (100%  for  children,  92.3%  for  adolescents  and  95.5%  for  and  adults).  Overall,  the  most 
common baseline AEDs were similar across age groups. 
  Extension phase 
A summary of the demographic and baseline characteristics and the baseline epilepsy-specific medical 
history of subjects who entered into the Extension is provided in the following tables:

CHMP’s comment:  
The  baseline  and  disease  characteristics  were  similar  between  subjects  of  the  core  study  and  those 
entering in Extension A once the core study completed. The accurate proportion slightly varied for each 
parameter, since only a proportion of subjects (83%, 58/70 subjects) entered in Extension A. 
Number analysed / Extent of exposure 
  Core Study 
The  overall  mean  (SD)  cumulative  duration  of  exposure  in  the  Core  Study  was  comparable  between 
the perampanel group (17.0 [3.49] weeks) and the placebo group (17.3 [2.60] weeks).  
The  mean  (SD)  daily  dose  received  was  6.2  (1.34)  mg.  The  mean  (SD)  modal  (the  most  frequent) 
daily dose was 6.8 (1.77) mg, with a majority of subjects (61.8%) receiving a modal  daily dose of  8 
mg. 
By  age  subgroup,  the  mean  (SD)  cumulative  duration  of  exposure  to  perampanel  was  18.2  (0.70) 
weeks for children, 14.3 (5.85) weeks for adolescents, and 16.7 (3.73) weeks for the adults.  
The  mean  (SD)  daily  dose  was  5.8  (1.55)  mg  for  children,  6.2  (1.53)  mg  for  adolescents,  and  6.6 
(0.85)  mg  for  adults.  The  modal  dose  was  8  mg  for  50.0%  of  children,  66.7%  of  adolescents,  and 
75.0% of adults.

  Extension Phase 
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase  of  the  study,  the  overall  mean  (SD)  cumulative 
duration  of  exposure  to  perampanel  was  56.4  (38.20)  weeks.  The  mean  (SD)  daily  dose  received 
during the Entire Treatment Period was 6.7 (1.96) mg, and the mean (SD) modal dose was 7.0 (2.41) 
mg. 
By  age  subgroup,  the  mean  (SD)  cumulative  duration  of  exposure  to  perampanel  was  53.4  (28.83) 
weeks for children, 65.3 (59.65) weeks for adolescents, and 56.4 (39.09) weeks for adults. The mean 
(SD) daily dose by age subgroups was 6.4 (2.33) mg for children, 6.5 (1.45) mg for adolescents, and 
7.1  (1.50)  mg  for  adults. In  all  age  subgroups,  the  modal  dose  was  8  to  <12  mg  for  the  majority  of 
subjects. 
Efficacy results 
Due  to  the  termination  of  the  study  by  the  sponsor  and  the  resulting  reduction  in  sample  size,  the 
study had lower power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.  
The  primary  efficacy  results  (median  percent  change  in  drop  seizure  frequency)  and  key  secondary 
efficacy results (median percent change in total seizure frequency and 50% responder rate in drop and 
total seizures) are summarized below. 
The  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  results  are  also  presented  by  age  subgroups,  but  the  small 
sample  sizes  for  children  (N=16  perampanel  and  19  placebo),  adolescents  (N=6  perampanel  and  7 
placebo), and adults (N=12 perampanel and 10 placebo) limits the interpretability of these results by 
age.  
Of the 58 subjects in the Extension Phase, 30 were children, 10 were adolescents, and 18 were adults. 
•  Primary efficacy endpoint: Percent Change in Drop Seizure Frequency (per 28 days) 
  Core Study 
Subjects  treated  with  perampanel  in  the  Core  Study  showed  a  numerically  greater  decrease  from 
baseline  in  median  drop  seizure  frequency  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  which  did  not  reach 
statistical  significance.  In  the  perampanel  group,  the  median  frequency  per  28  days  in  drop  seizures 
decreased from 46.56 to 32.14, compared with a decrease from 77.65 to 62.31 in the placebo group. 
The median percent change from baseline was -23.07% for perampanel group compared with -4.51% 
for  placebo  group,  with  a  median  difference  (95%  CI)  for  perampanel  versus  placebo  of  -19.3%  (-
49.2%, 4.8%), P=0.107 as shown in the following table:

CHMP’s comment: 
Due  to  the  lack  of  statistical  significance  on  this  primary  endpoint  (median  difference  (95%  CI)  for 
perampanel  versus  placebo  of  -19.3%  (-49.2%,  4.8%),  P=0.107),  all  subsequent  efficacy  results  are 
descriptive. 
Further analysis were conducted by age subgroup where the median percent change from baseline in 
drop seizure frequency per 28 days was as follows: 
- Children: -54.25% for the perampanel group, -8.04% for the placebo group 
- Adolescents: -3.51% for the perampanel group, +10.67% for the placebo group 
- Adults: -17.48% for the perampanel group, -1.79% for the placebo group  
Even if the results seem better numerically in children than in adolescents, no relevant conclusion can 
be drawn from these results which are only descriptive. 
  Extension Phase 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase of the study, the overall median percent change 
from  baseline  in  drop  seizure  frequency  during  perampanel  treatment  was  -29.49%.  And  the  overall 
median  percent  change  from  baseline  in  drop  seizure  frequency  during  perampanel  treatment  was  -
35.67% in children, -12.00% in adolescents and -35.42% in adults.  
•  Secondary efficacy endpoint: Percent Change in Total Seizure Frequency (per 28 days) 
  Core Study 
Subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  showed  a  numerically  greater  decrease  from  baseline  in  median 
total  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  with  the  median  total  seizure 
frequency decreasing from 142.55 to 99.33 in the perampanel group, compared with an increase from 
110.76 to 124.56 in the placebo group.  
The median percent change from baseline was -18.23% for perampanel group compared with -6.53% 
for  placebo  group,  with  a  median  difference  (95%  CI)  for  perampanel  versus  placebo  of  -17.6%  (-

•  Overview of Adverse Events 
  Core Study 
The AEs are presented Table 4 below for subjects in the core study Safety Analysis Set: 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  in  the  Core  Study  was  higher  in  the  perampanel  group  (85.3%)  than  the 
placebo group (72.2%). The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was also higher in the perampanel 
group  (64.7%)  than  the  placebo  group  (22.2%).  No  deaths  occurred  during  the  Core  Study.  SAEs 
occurred  in  6  (17.6%)  subjects  in  perampanel  group  and  1  (2.8%)  subject  in  placebo  group  (See 
Section  on  Serious  Adverse  Events),  and  3  (8.8%)  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  experienced  a 
TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal compared to no subjects in the placebo group. 
  Extension Phase 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase of the study, the overall incidence of TEAEs during 
perampanel  treatment  was  86.2%.  Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  reported  by  62.1%  of  subjects. 
SAEs were reported by 11 (19.0%) subjects, 2 of which resulted in death (See Section on Deaths and 
Serious  Adverse  Events).  A  total  of  8  (13.8%)  subjects  experienced  a  TEAE  leading  to  study  drug 
withdrawal.

TEAEs that occurred in 5% or more subjects in either treatment group reported during the Core Study 
are summarized by MedDRA (Version 21.0) SOC and PT in Table 5 below.  
The following TEAEs were the most common in the perampanel group, occurring with an incidence of at 
least 10% in the perampanel group and with a greater incidence than in the placebo group: 
-  Somnolence: perampanel: 8 (23.5%) subjects vs placebo: 2 (5.6%) subjects 
- 
Irritability: perampanel: 5 (14.7%) subjects vs placebo: 1 (2.8%) subject 
-  Upper respiratory infection: perampanel: 4 (11.8%) subjects vs placebo: 1 (2.8%) subject 
-  Decreased appetite: perampanel: 4 (11.8%) subjects vs placebo: no subjects 
CHMP’s comment: 
The most common TEAE with an incidence of at least 10% in the perampanel group and with a greater 
incidence than in the placebo group are either well-known AE and stated in  the SmPC of perampanel 
(somnolence, irritability, decreased appetite) or unspecific (upper respiratory infection). 
By age subgroup, the most common TEAEs (occurring in >2 subjects in the perampanel group and with 
a greater incidence than in the placebo group) were as follows as shown in Table 1:

-  Children (N=16 perampanel and 19 placebo): upper respiratory tract infection (25.0% vs 0%), 
and gait disturbance (18.8% vs 0%) 
-  Adolescents (N=6 perampanel and 7 placebo): none occurred in >2 subjects 
-  Adults  (N=12  perampanel  and  10  placebo):  irritability  (33.3%  vs  10.0%)  and  somnolence 
(33.3% vs 0%) 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (occurring  in  >2  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  with  a  greater

(gait disturbance, irritability) or unspecific (upper respiratory infection). 
  Extension Phase 
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase  of  the  study,  the  most  common  (≥10%)  TEAEs 
during perampanel treatment were somnolence (11 [19.0%] subjects), pyrexia (8 [13.8%] subjects), 
decreased  appetite,  irritability,  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (7  [12.1%]  subjects

By age subgroup, the most common TEAEs (occurring in >2 subjects) for those subjects who entered 
the Extension Phase were as follows: 
-  Children  (N=30):  pyrexia  (6  [20.0%]  subjects),  nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (5 [16.7%] subjects each), somnolence, decreased appetite, drooling, and seizure (4 
[13.3%]  subjects  each),  and  constipation,  aggression,  gait  disturbance,  influenza,  vomiting, 
bronchitis, and pneumonia (3 [10.0%] subjects)

appetite, constipation, and agitation (3 [16.7%] subjects each) 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (occurring  in  >2  subjects)  for  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension 
Phase  are  mainly  well-known  AE  and  stated  in  the  SmPC  of  perampanel  (somnolence,  decreased 
appetite,  gait  disturbance,  irritability,  aggression)  or  unspecific  (constipation,  nasopharyngitis,  upper 
respiratory infection, influenza, vomiting, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Drooling and seizure may either 
be  study  drug  related  or  symptoms  of  the  uncontrolled  disease  and/or  lack  of  therapeutic  effect 
(treatment ineffective). 
•  Analysis of Adverse Events 
Adverse Events by Maximum Severity 
Overall, most TEAEs were mild or moderate. A total of 3 (8.8%) subjects in the perampanel group and 
no  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  severe  TEAEs.  Severe  TEAEs  in  perampanel-treated  subjects 
included cardiac arrest, vertigo, respiratory syncytial virus infection, somnolence, atrophic pharyngitis, 
and respiratory distress (1 [2.9%] subject each).

One  of  the  severe  TEAE  related  to  the  cardiac  arrest  in  the  perampanel  group  was  thoroughly 
assessed:  The  narrative    of  the  cardiac  arrest  is  referred  to  for  more  details  regarding  the  cardiac 
arrest in a 12-year-old that occurred on 2017 (Study Day 41). The following statement extracted from 
the  narrative  means  that  the  cardiac  arrest  is  not  related  to  perampanel:  “events  of  respiratory 
distress,  hypernatraemia,  cardiac  arrest,  sinus  tachycardia  and  pneumonia  resolved  on  2017  (Study 
Day 48) and the subject was discharged from the hospital on the same day (Study Day 48). The cause 
of respiratory distress could have been due to a mucous plug. As per the investigator, the respiratory 
arrest  might  have  led  to  all  other  complications  including  hypoinflated  lungs,  cardiac  arrest,  and 
pneumonia. The subject had no adverse events ongoing at the time of respiratory distress”. 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
  Core Study 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug was higher in 
the  perampanel  group  (64.7%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (22.2%).  Treatment-related  events 
occurring  in  ≥10%  of  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  greater  than  placebo  group  included 
somnolence (14.7% vs 5.6%), irritability (14.7% vs 2.8%), and decreased appetite (11.8% vs 0%). 
By  age  subgroup,  the  incidence  of  treatment-related  TEAEs  in  the  Core  Study  was  higher  in  the 
perampanel group compared with the placebo group in all age subgroups (children: 50.0% vs 21.1%, 
adolescents:  50.0%  vs  14.3%,  and  adults:  91.7%  vs  30.0%).  The  most  common  treatment-related 
TEAEs  (occurring  in  >2  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  with  a  greater  incidence  than  the 
placebo group) by age subgroup were as follows 
-  Children (N=16 perampanel and 19 placebo): gait disturbance (18.8% vs 0%) 
-  Adolescents (N=6 perampanel and 7 placebo): none occurred in >2 subjects 
-  Adults  (N=12  perampanel  and  10  placebo):  irritability  (33.3%  vs  10.0%)  and  somnolence 
(25.0% vs 0%)

CHMP’s comment:  
The  treatment  related  AE  are  well-known  AE  and  stated  in  the  SmPC  (somnolence,  irritability, 
decreased appetite, gait disturbance, somnolence). 
  Extension Phase 
Treatment-related  TEAEs  for  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase  are  summarized  by 
MedDRA  SOC  and  PT  in  Table  14.3.1.5.1.Ext.  Overall,  36  (62.1%)  subjects  had  TEAEs  considered  by 
the investigator to be related to study drug. For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase of the 
study,  the  most  common  ( ≥ 10%)  treatment-related  TEAEs  during  perampanel  treatment  were 
somnolence (7 [12.1%] subjects) and irritability (6 [10.3%] subjects. 
By  age  subgroup,  the  most  common  treatment-related  TEAEs  (occurring  in  >2  subjects)  for  those 
subjects who entered the Extension Phase were as follows: 
-  Children (N=30): gait disturbance and drooling (3 [10.0%] subjects each) 
-  Adolescents (N=10): none occurred in >2 subjects 
-  Adults (N=18): irritability (5 [27.8%] subjects), somnolence, decreased appetite, and agitation 
(3 [16.7%] subjects each) 
CHMP’s comment:  
The  treatment  related  AE  are  well-known  AE  and  stated  in  the  SmPC  (somnolence,  irritability, 
decreased  appetite,  gait  disturbance,  somnolence).  The  Applicant  should  discuss  the  relevance  to 
include in the PI agitation considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. (RSI). 
Deaths: 
No subjects died during the Core Study.  
In  the  Extension  Phase,  1  adult  subject  (23  years  old)  died  due  to  cytogenetic  abnormality 
(complications due to chromosomal abnormality [trisomy 4p plus monosomy 18p]), and 1 adolescent 
subject (17 years old) died due to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Neither event was 
considered related to the study drug. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Both narratives of the deaths during the Extension were checked and neither of these fatal events were 
drug-related. 
The  narrative  of  the  death  is  referred  to  for  more  details  regarding  the  death  in  a  23-year-old  that 
occurred  on  2020  (Study  Day  610,  Extension  Day  491).  The  following  statement  extracted  from  the 
narrative means that the death is not related to perampanel: “On 2019 (Study Day 516; Extension Day 
390), it was reported that the subject had fever and found unresponsive and lying face down in bed. 
On  the  same  day  (Study Day  516,  Extension  Day  390),  the  subject  died  due  to  complications  due  to 
chromosomal  abnormality  [trisomy  4P  plus  monosomy  18P]).  The  event  was  classified  as  severe  in 
severity  and  serious  (fatal).  No  autopsy  was  performed.  Ongoing  events  at  the  time  of  cytogenetic 
abnormality  included:  gait  disturbance  (since  2018),  constipation  (since  2019),  and  pyrexia  (2019- 
2019).  The  investigator  classified  the  events  of  pneumatosis  intestinalis,  cough,  and  cytogenetic 
abnormality  to  be  not  related  to  study  drug.  The  investigator  classified  the  event  of  irritability  to  be 
related to study drug”. 
The  narrative    of  the  death  is  referred  to  for  more  details  regarding  the  death  in  a  17-year-old  that 
occurred  on  2019  (Study  Day  516,  Extension  Day  390).  The  following  statement  extracted  from  the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

narrative means that the death is not related to perampanel: “On 2020 (Study Day 609, Extension Day 
490), during Extension B Phase 2 mg, the subject went out for a walk and later slept. No seizure was 
noted. On the next day (Study Day 610; Extension Day 491), in the morning, the woke up and found 
that the subject was not breathing. The subject was transported to an emergency hospital, but was in 
a  state  of  cardiorespiratory  arrest.  The  subject’s  death  was  confirmed,  and  a  systemic  computerized 
tomogram scan revealed no abnormalities, based on which a diagnosis of sudden death was made. The 
event of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy was classified as severe in severity and serious. It was 
unknown  if  an  autopsy  was  performed.  Other  ongoing  event  at  the  time  of  death  included:  dizziness 
(2019  –2020).  The  subject  discontinued  from  the  Extension  study  early  due  to  sudden  unexplained 
death in epilepsy and had the last dose of study drug on 2020 (Study Day 609; Extension Day 490). 
The investigator classified the events of fall, dental caries, and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy to 
be not related to study drug”. 
Serious Adverse Events: 
  Core Study 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  the  perampanel  group  (6  [17.6%]  subjects)  compared  with  the 
placebo group (1 [2.8%] subject).  
In the perampanel group, 3 of the subjects with SAEs were in children (decreased appetite, respiratory 
syncytial  virus  infection,  seizure,  mental  status  changes,  and  vomiting),  1  subject  was  an  adolescent 
(respiratory distress), and 2 subjects were adults (dehydration and epilepsy).  
In  the  placebo  group,  SAEs  occurred  in  1  child  (gastrointestinal  hemorrhage,  pneumonia  aspiration, 
and  pneumonia).  Each  treatment-emergent  SAE  was  experienced  by  no  more  than  1  subject  in  each 
treatment group as shown in Table 6:

For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase  of  the  study,  a  total  of  11  (19.0%)  subjects 
experienced  a  SAE  during  perampanel  treatment.  Four  of  these  subjects  had  SAEs  in  both  the 
Extension Phase as well as the Core Study (3 randomized to perampanel and 1 randomized to placebo 
in the Core Study). The remaining 7 subjects experienced SAEs in the Extension Phase only. 
Of the 11 subjects who had an SAE, 8 subjects were children, 1 was an adolescent, and 2 were adults. 
SAEs that occurred in 2 or more subjects included pneumonia (in 3 children), and influenza and seizure 
in 2 children each. SAEs by age subgroup were as follows: 
-  Children  (N=30):  pneumonia  (3  [10.0%]  subjects),  influenza  and  seizure  2  [6.7%]  subjects 
each),  and  asthma,  bronchitis,  decreased  appetite,  hematemesis,  lethargy,  lower  respiratory 
tract  infection  viral,  mental  status  change,  microcytic  anemia,  quadriplegia,  respiratory 
syncytial  virus  infection,  seizure  cluster,  sepsis,  sleep  apnea  syndrome,  and  vomiting  (1 
[3.3%] subject each) 
-  Adolescents (N=10): dental caries and SUDEP (1 [10.0%] subject) 
-  Adults  (N=18):  cough,  crytogenetic  abnormality,  infected  skin  ulcer,  and  pneumatosis 
intestinalis (1 [5.6%] subjects each) 
CHMP’s comment 
The Applicant is requested to comment the outcome of each of the 6 SAE during the core study and 11 
SAE during the Extension Phase (RSI). 
TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation of Study Drug: 
  Core Study 
In  the  Core  Study,  few  subjects  discontinued  from  study  drug  due  to  TEAEs,  including  3  (8.8%) 
subjects (1 adolescent and 2 adults) in perampanel group and no subjects in placebo group. The TEAEs 
leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  were  angioedema  and  drooling  in  1  adolescent  subject, 
dehydration and abnormal loss of weight in 1 adult subject, and epilepsy in another adult subject.  
  Extension Phase 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase of the study, a total of 8 (13.8%) subjects had a 
TEAE  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  Of  the  8  subjects  who  discontinued  study  drug  due  to  a 
TEAE, 3 subjects were children (aggression [2 subjects] and seizure), 2 were adolescents (fatigue and 
SUDEP), and 3 were adults (agitation [2 subjects], insomnia, and sedation).  
TEAEs Related to Abuse Potential 
No subjects had a TEAE suggestive of abuse potential in the Core Study or in the Extension Phase. 
TEAEs Related to Suicidality 
No  subjects  had  a  positive  score  ( ≥ 1)  in  suicidal  behavior  or  suicidal  ideation  based  on  C-SSRS 
assessment  at  baseline  (lifetime  or  within  6  months  before  screening)  or  on-treatment  in  either  the 
Core  Study  or  the  Extension  Phase  and  no  TEAEs  related  to  suicidality  occurred  in  the  Core  Study  or 
Extension Phase. 
TEAEs Related to Alertness or Cognition 
TEAEs related to alertness or cognition were reported in 13 (38.2%) subjects in the perampanel group 
and 4 (11.1%) subjects in the placebo group in the Core Study. The most common TEAE (reported in ≥

10%  of  subjects)  in  this  category  was  somnolence  (perampanel:  8  [23.5%]  subjects,  placebo:  2 
[5.6%] subjects)  
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase,  19  (32.8%)  subjects  had  TEAEs  related  to 
Alertness  or  Cognition.  The  most  common  TEAE  (reported  in  ≥10%  of  subjects)  in  this  category  was 
somnolence (11 [19.0%] subjects). 
TEAEs Related to Hostility/Aggression 
TEAEs related to hostility/aggression were reported in 1 (2.9%) subject in the perampanel group and 
no  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  TEAEs  related  to  hostility/aggression  occurred  with  a  higher 
incidence in the perampanel group (8 [23.5%] subjects) compared with the placebo group (4 [11.1%] 
subjects). None of these events were considered serious and none led to discontinuation of study drug. 
The most common TEAE (reported in ≥10% of subjects) in this category was irritability (perampanel: 5 
[14.7%] subjects, placebo: 1 [2.8%] subject). 
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase,  4  (6.9%)  subjects  had  TEAEs  of 
hostility/aggression. 
TEAEs Related to Psychosis and Psychotic Disorders 
TEAEs  related  to  psychosis  and  psychotic  disorders  were  reported  in  1  (2.9%)  subject  in  the 
perampanel group and no subjects in the placebo group. None of these events (affective disorder and 
hallucinations) were considered serious and none led to discontinuation of study drug. 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase, no subjects had a TEAE related to psychosis and 
psychotic disorders. 
TEAEs Related to Status Epilepticus/Convulsions 
TEAEs  related  to  status  epilepticus/convulsions  were  reported  with  a  similar  incidence  in  the 
perampanel group (4 [11.8%] subjects) and the placebo group (3 [8.3%] subjects). 
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase,  11  (19.0%)  subjects  had  TEAEs  in  the  SMQ  of 
convulsions. 
CHMP’s comment: 
These  TEAE  related  to  status  epilepticus/convulsions  are  followed  in  the  PSUR  and  the  PI  may  be 
updated if relevant. 
TEAEs of Drug-Related Hepatic Disorder Abnormalities 
TEAEs  of  hepatic  related  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  in  no  subjects  in  the  perampanel 
group and 1 (2.8%) subject in the placebo group. 
For  those  subjects  who  entered  the  Extension  Phase,  3  (5.2%)  subjects  had  TEAEs  of  drug-related 
hepatic disorders. 
CHMP’s comment: 
As  stated  in  the  PI,  cases  of  hepatotoxicity  (mainly  hepatic  enzyme  increased)  with  perampanel  in 
combination  with  other  antiepileptic  drugs  have  been  reported.  If  hepatic  enzymes  elevation  is 
observed, monitoring of liver function should be considered. 
TEAEs Related to Cardiac and ECG Abnormalities

TEAEs related to cardiac and ECG abnormalities were reported in 3 (8.8%) subjects in the perampanel 
group and no subjects in the placebo group. 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase, 4 (6.9%) subjects had TEAEs related to cardiac 
and ECG abnormalities. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  Applicant  is  requested  to  provide  an  assessment  of  the  TEAEs  related  to  cardiac  and  ECG 
abnormalities that occurred in the core study and in the Extension phase (RSI). 
TEAEs Related to Rash 
TEAEs  related  to  rash  were  reported  in  6  (17.6%)  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  3  (8.3%) 
subjects in the placebo group. 
For those subjects who entered the Extension Phase, 11 (19.0%) subjects had TEAEs related to rash. 
TEAEs Related to Falls 
TEAEs  of  fall  occurred  in  1  subject  in  the  perampanel  group  and  no  subjects  in  the  placebo  group. 
Events  identified  using  SMQ  of  accident/injury  occurred  in  6  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  and  4 
subjects in the placebo group during the Randomization Phase. The rate of accident/injury events per 
subject-month was similar in the perampanel group (0.045) and placebo group (0.041). 
•  Other safety findings 
Laboratory results 
Overall, and by age subgroup, there were no changes of clinical importance in mean laboratory values 
over  time  in  either  the  perampanel  group  or  the  placebo  group  in  the  Core  Study.  A  shift  analysis 
revealed  no  shifts  of  clinical  concern  for  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  or  urinalysis  parameters, 
overall  and  by  age  subgroup.  The  patterns  of  shifts  were  similar  in  the  placebo  and  perampanel 
groups.  Treatment-emergent  markedly  abnormal  laboratory  results  occurred  infrequently,  overall  and 
by age subgroup. 
Vital signs 
Overall, no changes of clinical importance were observed in mean vital signs over time (systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and temperature). 
The  incidence  of  clinically  notably  weight  increase  (increase  of  >7%)  was  greater  in  the  perampanel 
group  (16  [47.1%]  subjects)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (5  [13.9%]  subjects),  and  fewer 
subjects in the perampanel group had clinically notable weight decreases (1 [2.9%] subject) compared 
with the placebo group (3 [8.3%] subjects). 
By  age  subgroup,  a  greater  mean  increase  in  weight  in  the  perampanel  group  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  was  most  apparent  in  the  adolescents.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  end  of 
treatment by age subgroups were as follows: 
-  Children: similar weight increase in perampanel (1.34 kg) and placebo (1.06 kg) 
-  Adolescent: greater weight increase in perampanel (2.78 kg) versus placebo (0.37 kg) 
-  Adult: similar weight increase in perampanel (1.27 kg) and placebo (1.56 kg)

CHMP’s overall Conclusion on study 338 
From  an  efficacy  aspect,  subjects  treated  with  perampanel  showed  a  numerically  greater  decrease  in 
median  drop  seizure  frequency  (primary  endpoint)  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  which  did  not 
reach  statistical  significance.  The  same  trend  of  some  improvement  in  the  perampanel  groups 
compared to placebo is overall observed for the key secondary endpoints during the core study. These 
data are however only descriptive and no robust / relevant conclusion can be drawn from these results. 
The Applicant considers that the treatment difference for the primary endpoint did not reach statistical 
significance  given  the  reduced  sample  size  due  to  early  study  termination  and  lower  power  to  detect 
treatment  effects.  Although  not  requested,  conducting  a  similar  study  in  more  favourable  conditions 
would allow to confirm this assumption. 
From  a  safety  aspect,  the  overall  TEAEs  reported  during  treatment  with  perampanel  were  consistent 
with the known safety profile for perampanel. The most common (≥10% in the perampanel group and 
greater incidence than in the placebo group) TEAEs during the core Study were somnolence, irritability, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  decreased  appetite.  Few  subjects  discontinued  due  to  TEAEs  (3 
[8.8%]  subjects  in  the  perampanel  group  versus  0  subjects  in  the  placebo  group).  There  were  no 
deaths  during  the  core  study,  but  2  deaths  both  unrelated  occurred  during  the  Extension  Phase.  No 
TEAEs  of  suicidal  ideation/behavior  were  reported,  and  no  subjects  had  a  positive  score  based  on  C-
SSRS assessment. No clinically notable effects were observed on laboratory assessments or vital signs. 
Some clarifications are requested regarding the outcome of the SAE, the TEAEs related to cardiac and 
ECG  abnormalities  and  the  relevance  to  include  in  the  PI  the  AE  agitation  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  The  TEAE  related  to  status  epilepticus/convulsions  are 
followed in the PSUR and the PI may be updated if relevant. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
EISAI submitted final study results and report related to paediatric population for Study E2007-G000-
338 (referred to as Study 338). This study 338 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled,  parallel-group  study  (Core  Study)  followed  by  an  Extension  Phase  (Extension  A  and 
Extension  B)  of  perampanel  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  2  years  of  age  and  older  with 
inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The study enrolled 
70  subjects  (planned  142  subjects,  (71  placebo,  71  perampanel))  of  which  34  were  treated  with 
perampanel in the study, 22 of whom were less than 18 years of age. A total of 61 subjects completed 
the Core Study (29 perampanel, of whom 20 were less than 18 years of age), and 58 of them entered 
Extension  A  (40  were  less  than  18  years  of  age).  A  total  of  32  subjects  completed  Extension  A,  (23 
were  less  than  18  years  of  age);  and  13  of  them  entered  Extension  B  (9  were  less  than  18  years  of 
age). 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  perampanel  given  as  adjunctive  anti-
epileptic treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of drop seizures during 18 weeks of 
treatment in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. 
The results of Study 338 showed that perampanel as adjunctive treatment was generally well tolerated 
and safe in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. Perampanel treatment 
resulted  in  a  numerically  greater  decrease  from  baseline  in  median  drop  seizure  frequency  and  total 
seizure frequency compared with placebo, and resulted in a numerically greater percentage of subjects 
with a 50% reduction in drop and total seizures. 
Due  to  the  termination  of  the  study  by  the  sponsor  and  the  resulting  reduction  in  sample  size,  the 
study  had  lower  power  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  groups.  To

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

confirm  this  assumption,  the  Applicant  is  invited  to  conduct  the  same  trial  in  more  favourable 
conditions. 
The  adverse  events  (AEs)  described  in  Study  338  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  for 
perampanel in the population studied (children, adolescent, and adult subjects). A review of these AEs 
does not suggest new or unexpected information. The most common (≥10% in the perampanel group 
and  greater  incidence  than  in  the  placebo  group)  TEAEs  during  the  core  Study  were  somnolence, 
irritability, upper respiratory tract infection, and decreased appetite. There were no deaths during the 
core  study,  but  2  deaths  both  unrelated  occurred  during  the  Extension  Phase.  No  TEAEs  of  suicidal 
ideation/behavior were reported, and no subjects had a positive score based on C-SSRS assessment. 
No clinically notable effects were observed on laboratory assessments or vital signs. Some clarifications 
are requested regarding the outcome of the SAE, the TEAEs related to cardiac and ECG abnormalities 
and the relevance to include in the PI the AE agitation considered by the investigator to be related to 
study  drug.  The  TEAE  related  to  status  epilepticus/convulsions  are  followed  in  the  PSUR  and  the  PI 
may be updated if relevant. 
On the basis of a review of the AEs and TEAEs in Study 338, no additional changes to the Summary of 
Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  or  regional  product  labelling  safety  information  are  requested  by  the 
Applicant.  The  data  submitted  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  perampanel.  Perampanel 
continues to possess a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of indicated seizure types.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1/The  Applicant  should  discuss  the  relevance  to  include  in  the  PI  agitation  considered  by 
the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Applicant’s Response 
Eisai does not believe that agitation needs to be included in the product label considering the following:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/79794/2023

1.  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  is  a  severe  epileptic  encephalopathy  where  intellectual 
development is often delayed and behavioral problems (including agitation and aggression) are 
common.  
Given the disease background and comorbidities, there may be a natural tendency of a higher 
reporting  rate  of  agitation  as  an  adverse  event  (AE)  in  this  patient  population,  regardless  of 
whether the patient was receiving perampanel or not.  
During the blinded randomization phase in Study 338, the incidence of agitation was higher in 
placebo  group  relative  to  perampanel  treatment  group.  Specifically,  there  were  2  subjects 
(2/36  [5.6%])  who  experienced  agitation  while  receiving  placebo,  but  only  1  subject  (1/34 
[2.9%])  who  experienced  agitation  while  receiving  perampanel.  In  the  overall  study  (Core 
Study  and  Extension  Phase),  the  overall  incidence  of  agitation  remained  low  with  agitation 
reported by 3 subjects (3/58 [5.2%]) while receiving perampanel treatment. 
2.  Due to the small sample size, the occurrence of an event even in a single subject will result in 
an incidence rate of approximately 2.9% that falls within the definition of “common (≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10)” category even though the true incidence may be low. 
3.  In  a  Phase  3  clinical  study  (Study  E2007-G000-332)  of  similar  sample  size  in  patients  with 
primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  of  idiopathic  generalized  epilepsy,  agitation  was 
reported in 2 subjects (2/82 [2.4%]) in the placebo group, but 1 subject (1/81 [1.2%]) in the 
perampanel treatment group during the blinded randomization phase.  
The incidence of agitation remained low with agitation reported by 3 subjects (3/114 [2.6%]) 
during Extension Phase where all subjects received perampanel treatment.  
The  safety  evaluation  in  Study  332,  which  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  LGS  Study  338, 
was found acceptable to the EMA without agitation being listed in the SmPC. 
The  SmPC  has  warnings  for  aggression  and  notes  that  significant  changes  in  mood  or  patterns  of 
behavior  have  been  observed  with  perampanel  therapy  (Section  4.4).  Considering  the  language  is 
already  included  in  the  product  label,  this  review  based  on  cases  of  agitation  does  not  support  an 
update to the product information at this time. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The  provided  Applicant’s  arguments  (epileptic  encephalopathy  showing  per  se  behavioral  problems 
including agitation and aggression; during the blinded randomization phase in Study 338, incidence of 
agitation  higher  in  placebo  group  relative  to  perampanel  treatment  group;  safety  evaluation  in  this 
study 338 similar to that of study 332 in PGTCS of IGE, without the addition of the AE agitation in the 
SmPC; incidence of this AE remaining low in the extension phase of study) are considered acceptable 
and therefore the addition of the AE agitation in the PI is not considered relevant.  
Issue solved. 
2/The Applicant is requested to comment the outcome of each of the 6 SAE during the core 
study and 11 SAE during the Extension Phase. 
Applicant’s Response 
During the core study, there were 6 subjects (3 children, 1 adolescent, and 2 adults) who experienced 
8  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  while  receiving  or  following  perampanel  treatment.  The  events  are 
summarized below in Table 1 and case narratives are attached in Appendix 1. 
The  outcomes  of  the  8  SAEs  were  as  follow:  7  resolved  and  1  not  resolved  at  the  time  of  the  study 
report.  Of  the  7  events  which  resolved,  there  were  5  events  which  resolved  without  changes  to 
perampanel dose or treatment interruption, indicative of a negative dechallenge. 
One event resolved after perampanel was discontinued, and the other resolved after perampanel dose 
was reduced (positive dechallenge).

During the Extension Phase, there were a total of 11 subjects (8 children, 1 adolescent, and 2 adults) 
who developed a total of 22 SAEs (18 events during the extension treatment period and 4 during the 
no-treatment follow-up period). The events are summarized below in Table 2 and case narratives are 
attached in Appendix 2. 
During  the  extension  treatment  period,  the  outcomes  of  the  18  SAEs  were  as  follow:  17  resolved 
without  changes  to  perampanel  dose  or  treatment  interruption  and  1  not  resolved  at  the  time  of  the 
study report. 
During the extension follow-up period, the outcomes of the 4 SAEs were as follows: 2 events resolved 
with medical treatment and 2 with a fatal outcome (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy [SUDEP] in 
one  subject  and  complications  due  to  chromosomal  abnormality  [trisomy  4p  plus  monosomy  18p]  in 
another subject; both events were deemed unrelated to perampanel).

CHMP’s comment: 
During  the  core  study,  6  subjects  experienced  8  SAE  while  receiving  or  following  perampanel 
treatment.  7  SAE  resolved  and  1  SAE  was  not  resolved.  This  last  SAE  was  a  worsening  of  epileptic 
seizure in an, 34 years of age considered related to the study drug by the investigator and of moderate 
severity. The subject discontinued the study due to this SAE.  
During  the  extension  study,  11  subjects  (mostly  children)  developed  a  total  of  22  SAEs  (of  whom  4 
during  the  no-treatment  follow-up  period).  17  SAE  resolved  without  changes  to  perampanel  dose  or 
treatment  interruption  and  1  SAE  was  not  resolved  (sleep  apnea  syndrome  related  to  study  drug  in 
patient    an,  2  years  of  age,  who  discontinued  the  treatment  and  the  study  which  was  terminated). 
During  the  extension  follow-up,  among  the  4  SAE,  2  events  resolved  and  2  SAE  showed  a  fatal 
outcome  (1  SUDEP,  1  complications  due  to  chromosomal  abnormality  [trisomy  4p  plus  monosomy 
18p]. Both deaths were considered unrelated to perampanel, which is acceptable since these patients 
did not more receive the study treatment. Moreover, SUDEP events may occur even under treatment 
and  details  of  the  death  due  to  chromosomal  abnormality  complications  were  not  available  since  no 
autopsy was performed.   
The  Applicant  commented  the  outcome  of  each  of the  SAE  during  the  core study  and  SAE  during  the 
Extension  Phase  without  any  specific  signal  or  the  need  of  an  additional  statement  in  the  PI  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Issue solved. 
3/The Applicant is requested to provide an assessment of the TEAEs related to cardiac and 
ECG abnormalities that occurred in the core study and in the Extension phase. 
Applicant’s Response 
Throughout  the  study,  TEAEs  related  to  cardiac  and  ECG  abnormalities  were  reported  in  a  total  of  5 
subjects  (1  child,  1  adolescent,  and  3  adults)  who  experienced  7  adverse  events  while  receiving 
perampanel.  Of  these,  3  subjects  experienced  5  events  (peripheral  swelling  [2],  cardiac  arrest  [1], 
mental  status  changes  [1],  and  sinus  tachycardia  [1])  during  the  Core  Study.  Two  subjects 
experienced  2  events  (orthostatic  hypotension  [1]  and  tachycardia  [1])  during  the  Extension  Phase. 
Note  that  the  summary  table  for  the  Extension  Phase  was  generated  based  on  cumulative  data  (i.e., 
Core Study and Extension Phase) collected from those subjects who completed Core Study and entered 
Extension Phase. That is, a subject with TEAE(s) of interest occurring during Core Study (even though 
there was no events during Extension Phase) would appear under both the Core Study summary table 
and  the  Extension  Phase  summary  table  in  the  Clinical  Study  Report.  The  events  are  summarized 
below in Table 3 and Table 4 with case narratives attached in Appendix 3. 
A review of the cases noted that the reports of cardiac and ECG abnormalities do not suggest a causal 
relationship  of  the  event  to  perampanel,  either  due  to  insufficient  information  to  provide  an 
assessment, or due to the presence of confounders including prior history of that could be contributory. 
All  the  events  were  considered  not  related  to  perampanel  by  the  investigator.  Additionally,  all  the 
events  resolved  with  no  interruption  nor  changes  to  perampanel  dose,  suggestive  of  a  negative 
dechallenge.

CHMP’s comment: 
The Applicant provided a review of the TEAEs related to cardiac and ECG abnormalities that occurred in 
the core study and in the extension phase. 
The  reports  of  cardiac  and  ECG  abnormalities  do  not  suggest  a  causal  relationship  of  the  event  to 
perampanel,  in  some  cases  due  to  insufficient  information  to  allow  a  thorough  assessment,  in  other 
cases  due  to  the  presence  of  confounders/comorbidities  (prior  history).The  events  were  overall 
considered not related to perampanel by the investigator. Additionally, all the events resolved with no 
interruption nor changes to perampanel dose. 
Regarding the event of cardiac arrest at Day 63 in a 12 years old female during the core study while 
receiving  4  mg  perampanel,  the  subject  experienced  respiratory  distress,  which  required 
hospitalization considered life threatening by the investigator. The subject was intubated and placed on

a ventilator and developed endotracheal intubation complication of atrophic pharyngitis, cardiac arrest, 
and sinus tachycardia. Perampanel was continued and the events recovered. The events, cardiac arrest 
and  sinus  tachycardia  were  considered  to  be  not  related  to  perampanel.  It  was  considered  that  the 
respiratory arrest might have led to all other complications including cardiac arrest by the investigator.

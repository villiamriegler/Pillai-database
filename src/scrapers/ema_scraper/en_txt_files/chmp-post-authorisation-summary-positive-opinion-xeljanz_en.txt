in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).” 
For information, the full indications for Xeljanz will be as follows2:

Xeljanz in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to 
severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or 
who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Xeljanz can be given 
as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5).

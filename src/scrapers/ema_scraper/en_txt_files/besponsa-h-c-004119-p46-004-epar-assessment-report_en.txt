1.  Introduction 
On March 17th, the MAH submitted the CSR for a paediatric study for inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
No updates of the product information or the RMP are proposed within the current procedure.  
A variation is planned to be submitted in Q3 2023, to update the SmPC with safety information from 
the study (see further information below).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study ITCC-059 is an ongoing multi-cohort study. The MAH is currently submitting the Clinical study 
report (CSR) under Article 46, to fulfil the requirement to report paediatric data within 6 months of 
primary completion date (PCD).  
Study ITCC-059 is part of the PIP for inotuzumab ozogamicin (Study 1; see Table 1). The MAH 
considers that this PIP measure is completed with the current submission of the interim ITCC-059 CSR 
dated 21 Feb 2023.  
The last subject last dose (LSLV) for Study ITCC-059 is estimated to be 11 April 2025. The MAH, 
however, would like to clarify that is an estimate that may be subjected to re-evaluation.   
There will be a CSR amendment for the final stratum 1B to add additional safety information that are 
not available at the time of this Article 46 submission due to monitoring/COVID site restrictions. The 
amended CSR will support an update to the paediatric section of the SmPC for patients with CD22-
positive relapsed/refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). A variation is therefore planned to 
be submitted in Q3 2023, to update the SmPC with the updated safety information from the study. 
Thus, no updates of the product information or the RMP are proposed within the current PAM/PAC 
procedure.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin (BESPONSA) is an ADC, with CD22-directed humanized immunoglobulin type 
G, subtype 4 antibody covalently linked to N-Ac-γ-calichaemicin dimethylhydrazide, a potent cytotoxic 
antitumor antibiotic, approved for adult patients with R/R BCP-ALL.  
InO causes cell death by inducing double-strand DNA breaks.2,3 CD22 is a B-cell adhesion molecule 
that is expressed on both normal cells of the mature B-lymphocyte lineage and on the malignant cells 
of the majority of B-cell cancers. It is highly expressed in more than 90% cases of childhood BCP-ALL.  
To date, approvals of InO for treatment for adults with R/R ALL have been granted in the US (on 17 
August 2017, the EU (on 29 June 2017), Switzerland (10 July 2017), and Japan (19 January 2018).  
The approved indication in the EU is:  
BESPONSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-
positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Adult patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome positive (Ph+ ) relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment 
with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
Currently, the SmPC includes the following information regarding the paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of BESPONSA in children aged 0 to <18 years have not been established. No 
data are available. 
With the current submission, in accordance with Art 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, 
the MAH submitted an interim report for: 
• 
Study ITCC-059: A Phase I/II Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin as a Single Agent and in 
Combination With Chemotherapy for Paediatric CD22-Positive Relapsed/Refractory Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukaemia 
Study ITCC-059 (PIP Study 1) is one of the 2 studies that are part of EU PIP (Table 1) to determine the 
optimal dose of InO as a single agent as well as in combination with a standard combination 
chemotherapy regimen in paediatric patients with R/R ALL.  
Study B1931036 (PIP Study 2) was initially planned to be a Phase 2, randomized open-label superiority 
trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of InO (based on the dose determined in PIP Study 1) added to 
a modified UKALL-R3 regimen in children and adolescents with early first relapse of CD22-positive B 
cell precursor ALL. Based on the data from Study ITCC-059, PIP Study 2 B1931036 was modified and 
will evaluate InO monotherapy as induction compared to the UKALL-R3 induction regimen (2:1 
randomization) in children and adolescents with high risk first relapse of CD22 positive BCP-ALL. 
As described in Section 2.1 above, no updates to the SmPC are proposed within the current procedure. 
The MAH will submit at type II variation, once an updated CSR for Study ITCC-059 is available 
(planned in Q3 2023).

Table 3- Study objectives and endpoints (cont. ) 
Study ITCC-059 is part of an approved EU PIP (EMEA-001429-PIP01-13-M06).  
The objectives of this study were to identify the recommended dose of InO administered IV either as 
monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B) for paediatric patients 
with R/R CD22-positive ALL, and to estimate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the selected 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of monotherapy InO, and to evaluate PK and PD in this patient 
population.

Methods 
Study participants 
Paediatric participants (≥1 and <18 years) with relapsed (2nd or greater relapse or first relapse after 
transplant)/refractory CD22-positive BCP-ALL were enrolled in this study. 
A total of 85 participants were assigned to treatment and 83 participants were treated.  
Treatments 
Stratum 1A:  
Dose escalation: 25 participants were treated; 12 received InO 1.4 mg/m2/cycle (dose level [DL]1) and 
13 received InO 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (DL2). 
Phase 2 Cohort: 28 participants received InO 1.8 mg/m2/cycle. 
A cycle of therapy is defined as 3 doses of InO administered on Days 1, 8 and 15. Cycle 1 lasted 22 
days (with possible delays allowed up to 42 days, depending on response and recovery from toxicity); 
subsequent cycles lasted 28 days, again with possible delays up to 42 days. Following Cycle 1, in 
patients who had achieved a CR/CRi/CRp, the Day 1 dose of InO was decreased slightly due to no 
loading dose requirement. 
For these single agent InO cohorts, a maximum of 6 cycles of InO was allowed for patients not 
proceeding to HSCT. For patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of study treatment 
was 2 cycles, with a maximum of 3 cycles for any patient who was not MRD-negative after 2 cycles.  
Stratum 1B: 30 participants were treated. 
A cycle of therapy was defined as 3 doses of InO administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with the 
UKALL-R3 modified regimen (mR3; dexamethasone and vincristine) with InO replacing mitoxantrone. 
All cycles lasted 28 days, with delays allowed up to 42 days to allow recovery from toxicity 
• 
InO was given at an initial starting dose of 1.1 mg/m2/cycle, combined with UKALL- R3 
modified regimen 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 3, 10, 17 and 24; oral dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day on 
Days 1-5 and 15-19, divided in 2 daily doses, and IT methotrexate prophylaxis on Days 1 and 
8.  
•  Due to 2 out of 4 participants at this 1.1 mg/m2/cycle dose level experienced DLTs, the dose of 
InO was de-escalated to 0.8 mg/m2/cycle while awaiting approval of Study ITCC-059 Appendix 
16.1.1, Protocol Amendment 4 which supported re-escalation of InO to 1.1 mg/m2 during C1; 6 
participants received InO combined with a reduced dose of dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2/day 
(amended mR3). Next, 3 participants received InO 1.4 mg/m2/cycle + amended mR3. Finally, 
10 participants received InO 1.8 mg/m2/cycle + amended mR3. A total of 19 participants were 
treated with the reduced dose of dexamethasone.

Sample size 
A total of 85 participants were assigned to treatment and 83 participants were treated.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Pharmacokinetics 
Serum samples were collected for InO and unconjugated calicheamicin. 
A specific and sensitive bioanalytical method using LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated at 
PPD laboratories (Richmond, VA, USA) to measure InO and unconjugated calicheamicin. 
Statistical Methods 
See Table 3.  
The binary endpoints (response rates) will be presented as a proportion with exact 2-sided 95% and 
90% confidence intervals. 
Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Unless otherwise specified, the 
calculation of proportions will include the missing category. Therefore, counts of missing observations 
will be included in the denominator and presented as a separate category. 
Time-to-event endpoints (EFS, OS, DOR) will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method or the 
competing risks method for cumulative incidence functions if time to disease transformation is included 
as an endpoint. The cumulative incidence and its standard error will be estimated using Gray’s method. 
When applying the Kaplan Meier method, median times and quartiles with associated 2-sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) based on the Brookmeyer-Crowley linear transformation method will be 
provided, assuming no ties among observed survival times. If median times will not be reached at the 
time of the analysis, survival rates at the specific time point will be provided together with the 
associated 2-sided 95% CI based on Greenwood’s formula. 
Methods to Manage Missing Data: The baseline value will be defined as the last non-missing value prior 
to first dose, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Partial dates are handled in the following way: if the month and year are present but day is missing, 
date is set to 15th of the month. If month is missing, it is set to June. No other imputation of missing 
data will be performed. 
No formal interim analysis was planned for Stratum 1A, phase 2 or Stratum 1B. As this was an open-
label study, the SAP specified that the sponsor may conduct unblinded review of the data during the 
course of study for the purpose of dose confirmation and safety assessment. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 85 participants were enrolled at 22 centers in 11 countries, and 83 participants were treated. 
The total dose of InO per cycle mentioned hereafter refers to Cycle 1 mainly.

The Full Analysis Set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study therapy 
and was used for the efficacy analysis and the safety analysis (Stratum 1A: 25 participants, Phase 2 
Cohort: 28, Stratum 1B: 30). 
The Dose Escalation Analysis Set for Stratum 1B (to establish the RP2D for combination therapy) 
included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of InO in combination with 
dexamethasone and vincristine and were evaluable for the dose escalation phase (26 participants). 
The Response Evaluable Analysis Set (for primary analysis in the Phase 2 Cohort) included all 
participants who received at least 1 dose of InO and have completed a baseline disease assessment 
and at least 1 post-baseline disease assessment (28 participants). Therefore, the Response Evaluable 
Analysis Set is equal to the Full Analysis Set for Phase 2.  
The PD Analysis Set included participants who were treated and had at least 1 of the PD parameters 
available (Stratum 1A: 25 participants, Phase 2 Cohort: 28, Stratum 1B: 30).  
The PK Analysis Set includes all Full Analysis Set participants who provided at least 1 PK sample of 
interest (Stratum 1A: 25 participants, Phase 2 Cohort: 28). This report doesn’t include PK results for 
Stratum 1B, as data are not available yet and will be included in the supplemental CSR. 
Pharmacokinetics 
After a single dose (C1D1), InO mean maximum serum concentrations in Stratum 1A DL1 (1.4 
mg/m2), DL2 (1.8 mg/m2) and the Phase 2 Cohort (1.8 mg/m2) were 157.7 ng/mL, 163.2 ng/mL, and 
173.2 ng/mL, respectively. In adults the mean concentration was measured to 161 ng/mL. After 
multiple doses (C3D1), the mean maximum serum concentrations in Stratum 1A DL1, DL2 and the 
Phase 2 Cohort were 277.0 ng/mL, 293.0 ng/mL, and 296.4 ng/mL, respectively. At C3D15, the mean 
pre-dose (trough) concentrations at Stratum 1A DL1, DL2 and the Phase 2 Cohort were 112.5 ng/mL, 
135.0 ng/mL and 121.2 ng/mL, respectively. At C1D15 and C2D8 at 0 hours post dose, the exposure 
for children given 1.8 mg/m2 was 28 88 ng/mL and 88 ng/mL and 29 ng/mL and 77 ng/mL in stratum 
1A and Phase 2 respectively. In adults it was measured to 24 ng/mL and 63 ng/mL, respectively. 
Overall, the Ino exposures in paediatric patients were relatively similar to those previously reported in 
adult patients.  
N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin DMH concentrations were not summarized since the concentrations for 
all the tested samples were BLQ.

Immunogenicity 
In InO single agent treated participants, 1 (2.0%) participant in Stratum 1A was positive for ADA at 
pre-dose. No participant had treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA. 
Dose Modification and/or Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
Stratum 1A  
One (8.3%) participant in DL1 had InO interruption due to headache (not treatment-related). Eight 
(32.0%) participants permanently discontinued InO due to TEAEs, of which 7 (28.0%) participants 
permanently discontinued InO due to treatment-related TEAEs. The all-causality TEAEs associated with 
permanent discontinuation in ≥2 participants included increased ALT and decreased platelet count 
Phase 2 Cohort 
Five (17.9%) participants had study drug interruption/reduction/delay due to AEs of increased ALT (4), 
increased AST (2) and febrile neutropenia (1), all of which were considered by the investigator to be 
treatment-related. 
Four (14.3%) participants permanently discontinued InO due to TEAEs of increased ALT/AST, VOD, 
disease progression and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The increased ALT/AST and VOD 
reported in 2 participants were treatment-related.

multiple causalities. 
Stratum 1A:  
VOD was reported in 2 (8.0%) participants; neither participant reported an allo HSCT before or after 
InO. 
• 
• 
In DL1, 1 participant developed G3 VOD (59 days after the last dose of InO, which was 
ongoing at the time of death. 
In DL2, 1 participant developed G4 VOD 44 days after the last dose of InO, which was ongoing 
at the time of death. 
Phase 2 Cohort:  
VOD was reported in 6 (21.4%) participants, 5 of which occurred after follow-up allo HSCT. The post-
HSCT VOD rate was 5/18 (27.8% [95% CI: 47.8176-100.0]).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In order to fulfil the requirement to report paediatric data within 6 months of primary completion date 
(PCD), the MAH has submitted a preliminary Clinical study report (CSR) for Study ITCC-059.  
Study ITCC-059 is an ongoing Phase I/II study. It is the first of two clinical studies included in the 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO). The primary evaluation of the 
study has been finalised and includes the following:  
- 
The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the study was to determine the recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for InO as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with 
chemotherapy (modified UKALL-R3-based re-induction regimen; Stratum 1B) in paediatric 
patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL.  
- 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study was to determine efficacy (ORR) for 
InO monotherapy at the RP2D in paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL.  
Secondary endpoints included safety evaluations. The MAH, however, informs that the safety 
evaluation has not yet been finalised and an updated CSR is expected later this year. Therefore, the 
MAH does not propose any updates of the paediatric safety information in the SmPC at present time 
but is planning to submit a type II variation when the updated CSR is available. The assessment of any 
paediatric safety claims from the MAH will therefore have to await the Type II variation submission. 
Recommended Phase 2 dose 
In the Phase I portion of the study, the RP2D of InO as monotherapy as well as in combination with 
chemotherapy in paediatric patients was 1.8 mg/m2 during Cycle 1.  
This is the same dose as recommended for adult patients, in the approved SmPC: “For the first cycle, 
the recommended total dose of BESPONSA for all patients is 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle, given as 3 divided 
doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2).” 
InO exposure was similar between paediatric patients in stratum 1A and adult patients with R/R ALL. 
Efficacy 
In the Phase II portion of the study, the ORR after InO monotherapy was 78.6% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7). 
The MAH makes no efficacy claims based on the current submission, and efficacy claims are not 
expected with the submission of the final safety report, later this year.  
Safety profile 
The safety database consists of 25 (Phase I) + 28 (Phase II), i.e. 53 paediatric patients treated with 
InO monotherapy and 30 patients treated with InO in combination with chemotherapy.  
The median number of cycles administered was two (2) for InO monotherapy and one (1) for InO + 
chemotherapy.  
The MAH suggests that the safety profile for InO in paediatric patients was acceptable and generally 
manageable. In monotherapy, the most frequently reported TEAEs were pyrexia, vomiting, anaemia 
and decreased platelet count. In combination therapy, the most frequently reported TEAEs were 
anaemia, decreased platelet count, increased ALT/AST and decreased WBC count.  
Thus, as previously reported in adults, TEAEs were most commonly reported within SOCs Blood and 
lymphatic disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. Haemorrhage, likely 
secondary to thrombocytopenia, and infections appeared to be less severe and slightly less commonly

reported in the paediatric patients compared with what was observed in the pivotal registration study 
in adults. However, as further described below, the safety data from the study are still preliminary. 
Deaths 
A total of 47 patients (56.6%) died during the study, the majority (n=28) due to disease progression. 
For 17 patients, the cause of death was described as Other, which included e.g. sepsis and transplant-
related events. For the remaining 2 patients the cause of death was described as Toxicity, however, 
the MAH suggests the toxicity was not due to InO: One case of cardiac arrest was suggested due to 
cumulative neurotoxicity and one case of bilateral pneumonitis started after follow-up ALL therapy. The 
pattern of deaths in the study do not give raise to immediate concern. However, as mentioned above, 
the safety data from the study are still preliminary.  
Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) 
An increased risk for VOD/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), above the risk of standard 
chemotherapy, has been observed in adult patients treated with InO. This risk is most marked in 
patients who undergoes subsequent HSCT, and in particular patients who receive a conditioning 
regimen containing two alkylating agents. The risk is also increased in patients ≥65 years of age and 
patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN prior to HSCT. In the pivotal registration study in adults, 
VOD/SOS was reported in 14% of the patients. In 3% of the patients, the event was not associated 
with HSCT.  
In study ITCC-059, VODs were reported in 8/53 patients (15.1%) in Stratum 1A, after InO 
monotherapy. Three of these events (5.7%) were not associated with HSCT. In stratum 1B, after InO 
+ chemo, VOD was reported in 5/30 patients (16.7%). One of these (3.3%) was not associated with 
HSCT.  All 13 cases of VOD were of severity Grade 3 or Grade 4, and all were SAEs.  
Thus, the VOD rate in this study was in the same range as that reported in adults. However, in the 
registration study in adults, patients with considerably increased risk for VOD (up to 50%), such as 
conditioning regimens including one or two alkylating agents or high age, were included. Therefore, the 
rate of VOD in paediatric patients, without some of these risk factors, appears high. Again, however, it 
is noted that the safety data from the study are still preliminary. 
With the submission of the final study results, the MAH should provide a thorough discussion of the 
observed VOD cases in this study, and whether data might indicate a higher rate of such events in 
paediatric patients, e.g. due to differences in the presence of risk factors in the adult and paediatric 
populations.  
Dose-limiting toxicity, dose modifications and treatment discontinuations 
Dose-limiting toxicity as evaluated in Cycle 1 of the dose-finding portions of the study included ALT 
increased, decreased platelet count, decreased neutrophil count, and veno-occlusive liver disease 
(VOD; the latter in combination with chemotherapy).  
The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs leading to study drug interruption or dose 
reduction were increased ALT and increased AST. Other events included blood bilirubin increased, 
neutrophil count decreased, Escherichia infection, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, urticaria and 
febrile neutropenia.  
A total of 11 patients permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs that were considered treatment 
related. The AEs leading to permanent discontinuation in ≥2 patients were increased ALT (n=4), 
increased AST (n=2), platelet count decreased (n=2) and VOD (n=2).

The pattern of dose modifications and treatment discontinuations in the paediatric patients, thus, 
mirrors the known safety profile from adults.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a variation prior to any 
conclusion on product information amendments. The MAH intends to submit a variation application by 
Q3 2023. In the variation application the following issue should be addressed:  
1.  The VOD rate in Study ITCC-059 was in the same range as that reported in adults. However, in 
the registration study in adults, patients with considerably increased risk for VOD (up to 50%), 
such as conditioning regimens including one or two alkylating agents or high age, were 
included. With the submission of the final study results, the MAH should provide a thorough 
discussion of the observed VOD cases in Study ITCC-059, and whether data might indicate a 
higher rate of such events in paediatric patients, e.g. due to differences in the presence of risk 
factors in the adult and paediatric populations.

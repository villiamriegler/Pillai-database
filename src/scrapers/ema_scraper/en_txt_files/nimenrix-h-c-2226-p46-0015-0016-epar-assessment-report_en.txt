INTRODUCTION 
On 3rd September, the MAH submitted study reports for two completed paediatric studies for 
Nimenrix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on 
medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
Nimenrix and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
III. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
III.1 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Nimenrix was 
authorised on the 20th of April 2012 for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 
months and above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis 
group A, C, W-135 and Y. A 0.5 ml dose of the reconstituted vaccine is used at all ages. 
III.2  Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The  study  MenACWY-TT-059  EXT052  Y3  is  a  year  3  follow-up  study  of  the  primary  study 
MenACWY-TT-052.  
The study MenACWY-TT-062 EXT055 Y3 is a year 3 follow-up study of the primary study 
MenACWY-TT-055.  
The primary phase studies, as well as the follow-up studies after 1 year, were submitted as part 
of the initial MAA for Nimenrix. Further follow-up of the subjects is planned up to 5 years 
following primary vaccination. 
A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies 
to update the labelling with available persistence data across all age groups) is expected to be 
submitted by the beginning of 2013. 
2. Clinical studies 
GSK study report number: 111670 
Study title: A phase II, open, controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term antibody 
persistence at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the administration of one dose of

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, V-tetanus toxoid 
conjugate (MenACWY-TT) vaccine versus one dose of sanofi-pasteur's meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (Menactra) in healthy 
adolescents/adults aged 10-25 years and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 
booster response to MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 5 years post-primary vaccination 
with MenACWY-TT or Menactra and of a primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT in a newly 
enrolled group aged 15-<31 years. 
Note: This annex report (Annex 1) to the 111670 (MenACWYTT-059) study report presents the 
persistence results of serum bactericidal assays at three years after vaccination. 
Study MenACWY-TT-059 was conducted in the United States. This study evaluated the 
immunogenicity induced by Nimenrix as compared to Menactra at 11-25 years of age in terms of 
the percentage of subjects with N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W -135 and Y titers ≥ 1:8 as 
measured by hSBA (using GSK hSBA assays). 
The study included 3 groups: 
• ACWY-TT: MenACWY-TT (11-25 years of age) 
• ACWY-DT: Menactra (11-25 years of age) 
• ACWY<11: MenACWY-TT (10-<11 years of age) 
Of the 873 subjects who were enrolled and vaccinated in study MenACWY-TT-052, 487 subjects 
returned for the Year 3 visit (345 subjects in the in the ACWY-TT group, 86 in the ACWY-DT 
group and 56 in the ACWY<11 group). In the majority of cases, the reasons for subjects not 
returning for the Year 3 persistence study were: the subjects had been revaccinated with a 
meningococcal vaccine or the subjects were lost to follow-up. Other reasons fell under the 
categories of withdrawal of consent or migration to another area. 
The according-to-protocol immunogenicity analysis contained 473 subjects (335 in the ACWY-
TT group, 84 in the ACWY-DT group and 54 in the ACWY<11 group). 
The summary of demographic characteristics for the ATP cohort is presented below. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:4 and 1:8 
and GMTs (ATP cohort for persistence at Year 3) are presented in the following table.

vaccination are shown in the tables below. 
No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered 
related to study participation were reported from the last visit in the MenACWY-TT-052 study up 
to 3 years after vaccination. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The GMTs for MenC, MenW-135 and MenY at the Year 3 persistence time point remained 
above pre-vaccination titers. The MenA GMTs had decreased markedly to almost baseline 
levels at Year 1 persistence time point and remained at a similar level at Year 3 persistence time 
point. 
Exploratory evaluations suggested that the ACWY-TT group had statistically significantly higher 
hSBA MenC, MenW-135 and MenY titers ≥1:8 compared to the ACWY-DT group. Exploratory 
evaluations of the ratio of the GMTs suggested that the ACWY-DT group had statistically 
significantly higher hSBA MenA GMTs compared to the ACWYTT-group and that the ACWY-TT 
group had statistically significantly higher hSBA MenC, Men W-135 and MenY GMTs compared 
to the ACWY-DT group. 
In the current approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Nimenrix, results from 
the 1 year persistence of study MenACWY -TT -059 are presented. There is also a statement 
that “Studies with Nimenrix have shown a rapid waning (as measured at 12 months post-dose 
onwards) of serum bactericidal antibody titres against MenA when using human complement in 
the assay (hSBA). The clinical relevance of the rapid waning of hSBA MenA antibody titres is 
unknown.”

GSK study report number: 112021 
Study title: A phase II, open, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence 
at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the administration of one or two doses of GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK) Biologicals' meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y-tetanus toxoid conjugate 
(MenACWY-TT) vaccine in healthy toddlers at 9-12 months of age, and to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT administered 5 years post-primary 
vaccination and of a primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT in a newly enrolled group, aged 5-6 
years, as a naive control. 
Note: This annex report (Annex 1) to the 112021 (MenACWYTT-062) study report presents the 
persistence results of serum bactericidal assays at three years after vaccination. 
Study MenACWY-TT-062 was conducted in the United States. This study evaluated antibody 
persistence at 3 years after vaccination with either one dose of Nimenrix at 12 months of age 
(ACWY-l group) or two doses of Nimenrix at 9 and 12 months of age (ACWY-2 group). Samples 
collected 3 years after vaccination in this study were tested using GSK hSBA and rSBA assay 
performed at the Health Protection Agency, UK (HPA). 
Of the 347 subjects vaccinated in study MenACWY-TT-055, 202 subjects returned for the Year 3 
visit (98 in the ACWY-1 group and 104 in the ACWY-2 group). In the majority of cases, the 
reasons for subjects not returning for the Year 3 persistence study were: the subjects were not 
willing to participate in the study or the subjects were lost to follow-up. Other reasons fell under 
the categories of withdrawal of consent, migration to another area or non-participation of the 
study site. 
The ATP cohort for persistence Year 3 analysis contained 186 subjects, including 86 subjects in 
the ACWY-1 group and 100 subjects in the ACWY-2 group. 
The summary of demographic characteristics for the ATP cohort is presented below.

No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered 
related to study participation were reported from the last visit in MenACWY-TT-055 up to 3 years 
after vaccination. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Three years after vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-055, the percentages of subjects with 
persistent hSBA MenA, MenC and Men Y titers ≥ 1:8 were comparable in both groups. 
However, the percentage of subjects with persistent hSBA MenW-135 titers ≥ 1:8 was higher in 
subjects that received two doses (84.5%) as compared with only one dose (62.8%). 
In both groups, the GMTs decreased three years after vaccination compared to one year after 
vaccination and were comparable between the two groups (overlapping CIs); however, an 
exploratory analysis showed a ratio of 2.2 (with a 95%CI that did not contain 1) for the hSBA 
MenW-135 titers in favour of the two-dose regimen. The hSBA MenA GMTs were below the 
assay cut-off at both Year 1 and 3 persistence timepoints (ranged between 3.3 and 3.8 across 
groups and Year 1 and 3 persistence timepoints) for both groups, indicating that the majority of 
subjects did not retain hSBA MenA antibodies. 
Three years after vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-055, the percentages of subjects with 
persistent HPA rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 for all serogroups were comparable in both study 
groups. 
The HPA rSBA GMTs were comparable in both groups for the four meningococcal serogroups 
(ranged between 10.6 and 19.6 across study groups and the four serogroups). Since the rSBA 
titers during the vaccination and Year 1 persistence phases were tested with the GSK rSBA 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

assay, antibody kinetics and decay from the Year 1 to the Year 3 timepoints could not be directly 
assessed. 
In conclusion, the difference between the two groups regarding hSBA MenW-135 titers observed 
at Year 1 persisted at Year 3 but was not supported by the rSBA titers results. Likewise, the 
discrepancy between GSK hSBA and rSBA MenA titers observed at year 1 was also observed at 
Year 3 with the HPA rSBA assay. 
IV. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The MAH has provided updated (Year 3) persistence data from two studies showing progressive 
GMTs decrease over time. There is no unexpected information compared to the results reported 
at Year 1 but these should be updated in the SmPC. The MAH intends to submit a variation 
beginning of 2013 when all 3-year persistence data are available across all age groups. This 
position is supported. 
  Recommendation 
  Fulfilled  
No further action required

On 26 June 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Eliquis. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers 
Squibb/Pfizer EEIG. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify

DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients).” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indication(s) for Eliquis will be as follows2:  
“Prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip 
or knee replacement surgery.”

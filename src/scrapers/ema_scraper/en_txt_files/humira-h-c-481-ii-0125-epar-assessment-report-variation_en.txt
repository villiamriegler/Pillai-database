Adalimumab (Humira) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that 
neutralizes the biological function of TNF. Humira is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active and progressive psoriatic arthritis (PsA), severe active 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, severe active 
Crohn’s disease (CD), moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) and moderate to severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis (Ps). In the EU, adalimumab was approved for children 13 to 17 years of age on 25 
August 2008, for children 4 to 12 years of age on 18 March 2011, and for children 2 to 4 years of age 
on 25 February 2013.

As part of Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) requirement of the European Medicines Agency, AbbVie 
conducted Study M10-144 to collect safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data in up to 30 
subjects 2 to < 4 years of age and subjects ≥ 4 years of age that weigh < 15 kg with moderately to 
severely active polyarticular or polyarticular course JIA. The interim CSR Clinical Study Report was 
submitted as part of the variation (EMEA/H/C/481/II/102 approved on 25/02/201325/02/2013) to 
extend the indication for adalimumab as a treatment for paediatric subjects with moderately to 
severely active polyarticular JIA from 4 to 17 years to 2 to 17 years. As part of the response to the 
CHMP's Request for Supplementary Information received during review of this variation, further safety 
and efficacy data up to Week 60 were submitted in November 2012.  
The final clinical study report for this study has now been provided presenting data from up to 120 
weeks treatment. This AR will discuss the safety aspects of this study.  Since the interim report from 
60 Weeks treatment was thoroughly reviewed within the approval process of variation 102, focus will 
be on the final part of the study. 
2.2.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The primary objective of the phase 3b, open-label (OL), multicenter study M10-444 'Compassionate 
Use Study of Adalimumab in Children 2 to < 4 Years Old or Age 4 and Above Weighing Less Than 15 
kg with Active Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)' was to evaluate the safety of adalimumab, specifically 
the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs). The secondary objectives of 
the study were to collect pharmacokinetic (PK) data (including anti-adalimumab antibody analysis 
[AAA] for analysis) and to evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in these paediatric subjects. 
A total of 32 subjects were enrolled at 14 study sites in the United States, France, the Czech Republic, 
and Germany. The first subject first visit was 24 March 2009 and the last subject last visit was 21 
March 2013. All subjects had study visits at Screening, Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 
24. Visits beyond Week 24 occurred every 12 weeks until subjects reached 4 years of age and attained 
a body weight ≥ 15 kg (US) or for a maximum of 1 additional year after subjects reached 4 years of 
age and attained a body weight ≥ 15 kg to allow transition to an appropriate treatment (EU). 
Eligible subjects were aged 2 to < 4 years old at Screening with moderately to severely active 
polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA or age ≥ 4 and weighing < 15 kg with moderately to 
severely active polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA. A total of 29 subjects (90.6%) were in the 
active joint count for 73 joints (AJC73) ≥ 5 category, with a mean Baseline AJC73 of 10.0 ± 7.47. 
Thirty-one subjects (96.9%) were RF negative (rheumatoid factor < 12 IU/mL) with a Baseline mean 
of 10.2 ± 1.24. The majority of subjects (19 subjects [61.3%]) had a Baseline C reactive protein (CRP) 
value within the normal range (i.e., < 0.9 mg/dL) with a mean value of 1.6 ± 2.43. Subjects were 
judged by the investigator to be in generally good health, had normal cardiopulmonary and normal 
neurological examination results, and had a negative purified protein derivative test (PPD) at 
Screening. Subjects in the EU were also to have previously failed, had an insufficient response to, or 
been intolerant to 1 or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drug. 
2.2.2.  Results 
All subjects received ≥ 1 dose of adalimumab (ITT). A total of 26 subjects (81.3%) completed the 
study and 6 subjects (18.8%) prematurely discontinued from the study (1 subject before Week 24 and 
5 subjects after Week 24). Two subjects discontinued study drug because of an AE.

The minimum intended treatment period for all enrolled subjects was 24 weeks. Mean duration of 
exposure to adalimumab was 515.3 ± 245.33 days (median = 575.0 days). All subjects received at 
least 57 days of adalimumab treatment, with a maximum exposure to adalimumab of 910 days.

a. Relationship to study drug, as assessed by investigator, Note: A TEAE is any AE with onset on or after first  
dose of study drug and up to 70 days after last day of study drug. An AE with unknown severity is counted  
as severe. An AE with unknown relationship to study drug is counted as drug-related. E/100PY = events per 100 
patient years 
More than 90% of subjects reported at least 1 TEAE (217 events, 481.2 events per 100 patient-years 
[E/100PYs]) and 2 subjects (6.3%) reported a TEAE that led to discontinuation from the study. The 
majority of subjects reported TEAEs that were nonserious and considered by the investigator to be 
mild or moderate in severity and not related or probably not related to study drug.

The majority of subjects reported TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be not related or 
probably not related to study drug. A total of 11 subjects (34.4%) had events that were considered by 
the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. Six subjects reported events that were 
considered by the investigator to be probably related to study drug (injection site reaction, injection 
site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site rash, injection site swelling, cystitis, and juvenile 
arthritis). Rash was the most frequently reported TEAE that was considered by the investigator to be at 
least possibly related to study drug (2 subjects, 6.3%).

Serious adverse events 
Five subjects (15.6%) reported an SAE during the study. The SAEs that were reported were dental 
caries, gastroenteritis rotavirus, juvenile arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and varicella. These SAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be not related or probably not related to study drug. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during the study. 
AEs of special interest 
Of all AEs of special interest, events were seen in the following categories: treatment emergent 
infections, injection site reaction related events, allergic reactions, and hematologic disorders. 
Treatment emergent infections 
Twenty-five subjects (78.1%) reported at least 1 treatment emergent infection during the study. Three 
subjects had serious infections (1 report each of dental caries, gastroenteritis rotavirus, and varicella). 
These events were considered by the investigator to be mild to moderate in severity and not related to 
study drug. The most frequently reported infections were nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory 
tract infection, otitis media, gastroenteritis, and rhinitis. All other infections were reported by < 10% of 
subjects (not more than 3 subjects). No subjects prematurely discontinued from study drug as a result 
of an infection 
Injection Site Reaction-Related TEAEs 
A total of 4 subjects (1 subject reported 2 events) reported treatment-emergent injection site reaction-
related events. These events were considered by the investigator to be mild in severity and probably 
related to study drug. The events resolved and the subjects continued in the study.

Allergic Reaction, Including Angioedema/Anaphylaxis 
Two subjects (6.3%) reported an allergic reaction-related TEAE. 
•  One was a 2-year-old female from North Africa who experienced an event of intermittent 
urticaria on Day 631 that lasted for 17 days. The event was considered by the investigator to 
be mild in severity and not related to study drug.  
• 
The second case was a 3-year- old white male who experienced an event of rash on his trunk, 
back, abdomen, and face on Day 12 that lasted 11 days. The event was considered by the 
investigator to be mild in severity and possibly related to study drug. 
Hematologic Disorders, Including Pancytopenia 
Two subjects (6.3%) reported a treatment-emergent hematologic disorder during the study. 
•  One subject was a 2-year-old white female who experienced an event of microcytic anemia on 
Day 253 that was ongoing as of Day 757. The event was considered by the investigator to be 
mild in severity and not related to study drug. 
• 
The second subject was a 2-year-old Asian female who experienced an event of decreased 
platelet count on Day 506. The event was considered by the investigator to be severe and not 
related to study drug. The reported event was considered resolved after a repeat test was 
performed by a local hospital laboratory and the results for platelet count were within normal 
range.

Questionnaire [DICHAQ], Parent's Global Assessment of subject's overall disease activity, Parent's 
Assessment of Pain, Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, joint assessments, CRP, and 
the Child's Health Questionnaire [CHQ-PF50]) and the proportion of subjects with Paediatric American 
College of Rheumatology (PedACR) 30/50/70/90 responses. 
Approximately 6 to 20 subjects in the US (including Puerto Rico) and EU were to be assessed for PK 
from blood draws at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. PK blood draws were obtained only from those 
who consented to this procedure. Week 24 PK data collected from 15 study subjects indicated that 
mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations achieved a steady-state of 6 to 8 μg/mL at Week 12 
and Week 24. Steady state serum adalimumab concentrations were comparable to subjects who were 
> 4years old.

(ITT) 
No shifts in total bilirubin, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, albumin/globulin ratio, BUN/creatinine ratio, 
carbon dioxide, globulin, or RF laboratory values were observed. No subjects who had a high or normal 
chemistry laboratory value experienced a shift to a low value.  
Two subjects had at least 1 clinical significant abnormality in their chemistry laboratory values. These 
subjects developed a CTC toxicity grade ≥ 3 chemistry value for a single laboratory measurement 
during the OL period that resolved before the end of the study. One subject had hypernatremia and 1 
subject had hyperglycemia. Neither subject discontinued because of abnormal chemistry laboratory 
values.  
Two subjects had potentially clinically significant abnormalities in their liver function tests. Neither 
subject discontinued early from the study because of their abnormal liver function test. One resolved 
during the study, the second was ongoing as of Day 336. 
A small shift in ALT and AST values from < 1.5 × ULN to ≥ 1.5 – < 3.0 × ULN was observed for 1 
subject each. 
ANA and Anti-dsDNA 
No shifts were observed in final ANA or anti-dsDNA values. 
Anti adalimumab antibodies (AAA)

A single subject out of 15 tested was found to be anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) positive; therefore, 
it was not possible to evaluate the effect of AAA on safety and efficacy or to compare AAA+ rates with 
other studies. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings 
The mean change from Baseline in heart rate and body temperature was within normal range for 
children 2 to 4 years of age. There was a 5.6 ± 1.55 kg mean change from Baseline in weight, 
indicating the subjects were growing. No subjects discontinued from study drug because of abnormal 
vital signs. 
Summary of MAH´s discussion and conclusion 
Safety results from this study demonstrated that adalimumab administered subcutaneously eow is 
generally safe and well-tolerated for up to 120 weeks of treatment in subjects 2 to < 4 years of age 
and subjects ≥ 4 years of age weighing < 15 kg, with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA or 
polyarticular course JIA. No deaths occurred during this study. More than 90% of subjects (217 events, 
481.2 E/100PYs) reported at least 1 TEAE and the majority of subjects reported TEAEs that were 
considered by the investigator to be mild to moderate in severity and not related or probably not 
related tostudy drug. Five subjects (15.6%) reported an SAE during the study and these SAEs were 
considered by the investigator to be not related or probably not related to study drug. The TEAEs of 
special interest that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug 
were injection site reaction and allergic reaction (rash). 
Results of the efficacy endpoints demonstrated that adalimumab administered subcutaneously eow 
over 120 weeks reduced JIA disease activity in this population. A PedACR30/50 response was achieved 
by at least 80% of subjects, the majority of subjects achieved a PedACR70 response, and at least one-
third of subjects achieved a PedACR90 response. A decrease was observed for all joint assessments, 
including TJC75, SJC66, POM75, LOM69, and AJC73, and the greatest change occurred from Week 60 
through at least Week 84, although the number of subjects decreased to nearly 50% during those 
weeks. A decrease was also observed for CRP and CRP levels decreased to within the normal range at 
Weeks 72 and 84.  
The primary and secondary objectives for this study were met. The data presented in this clinical study 
report demonstrate that adalimumab therapy up to 120 weeks was effective for treatment of 
moderately to severely active polyarticular or polyarcticular course JIA in subjects 2 to < 4 years of 
age or age ≥ 4 weighing < 15 kg. Adalimumab was generally safe and well-tolerated in these 
populations and the safety profile throughout the study was consistent with profiles in older paediatric 
patients with JIA from previous adalimumab clinical trials. No new safety signals were observed. In 
addition, adalimumab dosing, based on the height and weight of young children, was feasible and 
appropriate for this population. 
2.2.3.  Discussion 
The final report from the Study M10-144 has been submitted. The primary study endpoint, measured 
over the course of the study, was the incidence of SAEs and AEs in polyarticular JIA subjects 2 to < 4 
years old and subjects ≥ 4 years weighing < 15 kg.  
In total 32 patients have been enrolled and received Humira, representing a cumulative exposure to 
Humira of 45.1 patient years (PYs). All subjects received at least 57 days of adalimumab treatment, 
with a maximum exposure to adalimumab of 910 days. 26 patients completed the study. Six subjects 
(18.8%) prematurely discontinued from the study (1 subject before Week 24 and 5 subjects after 
Assessment report  
EMA/472438/2014 
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
Week 24). Two subjects discontinued study drug because of an AE, in both cases nonserious flare of 
juvenile arthritis. 
No deaths were reported in the study. Five subjects (15.6%) reported an SAE during the study. The 
SAEs that were reported were dental caries, gastroenteritis rotavirus, juvenile arthritis, type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, and varicella. These SAEs were considered by the investigator to be not related or probably 
not related to study drug. They were all presented and evaluated within the 60 weeks interim analysis 
reviewed within the variation II/102 procedure. No additional SAEs have been reported during the last 
60 weeks of the study.  
By the time of the 60 Weeks interim analysis 22 subjects (68.8%) had reported at least 1 treatment 
emergent infection. At the end of the study 3 additional subjects had experienced this. This is not 
unexpected. No additional cases of serious infections have emerged since the Week 60 report. 
Nine subjects reported 11 other TEAEs of special interest. The TEAEs of special interest that were 
reported were oral candidiasis (1), allergic reaction (2), hematologic disorders (2), and injection site 
reaction (4). These reports are not unexpected and are in line with the known safety profile of Humira. 
PK-data were collected through week 24. The results were provided and assessed within the variation 
102 procedure. 
Overall, no new safety signal has been identified from the data submitted. Results were in line with the 
known safety profile of Humira and did not warrant a change to the product information. 
2.3.  Risk management plan 
No updated Risk Management Plan was submitted within this variation procedure. The CHMP, having 
considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance activities in addition 
to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the product. No additional risk 
minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.  
2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed no changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed.  
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
No new safety concerns have been raised within this study. The safety profile observed up to Week 
120 was in line with the known safety profile of adalimumab and the safety in older paediatric patients 
with JIA from previous adalimumab clinical trials. No update of the SmPC was warranted. The CHMP 
concluded that the presented results do not impact the positive benefit/risk balance of adalimumab in 
the approved indications when used in accordance with the recommendations of the Product 
Information.  
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the

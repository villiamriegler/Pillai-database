Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Idacio 
adalimumab 
On 31 January 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Idacio, intended 
for the treatment of certain inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The applicant for this medicinal 
product is Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH. 
Idacio will be available as a solution for injection (40 mg in pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen and 
40 mg/0.8 ml for paediatric use). The active substance of Idacio is adalimumab, a tumour necrosis factor 
alpha (TNFα) inhibitor (ATC code: L04AB04). Adalimumab binds to TNF and blocks its interaction with the 
p55 and p75 cell-surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced 
or regulated by TNFα, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leucocyte 
migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1). 
Idacio is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Humira (adalimumab), 
which was authorised in the EU on 8 September 2003. Data show that Idacio has comparable quality, safety 
and efficacy to Humira (adalimumab). More information on biosimilar medicines can be found here. 
The full indication for Idacio 40 mg solution for injection is:  
“Rheumatoid arthritis 
Idacio in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
• 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been 
inadequate. 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate. 
Idacio can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.

from adoption of the opinion

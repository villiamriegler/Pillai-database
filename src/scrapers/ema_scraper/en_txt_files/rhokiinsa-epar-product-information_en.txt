4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with 
primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Rhokiinsa should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional 
qualified in ophthalmology. 
Posology 
Use in adults, including the elderly  
The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Patients should 
not instill more than one drop in the affected eye(s) each day. 
If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose in the evening.   
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Rhokiinsa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
For ocular use.

No data on potential interactions specific to netarsudil is currently available (see section 4.5). If 
netarsudil is to be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic medicinal products, each 
medicinal product should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Due to netarsudil’s 
vasodilating properties, other eye drops should be administered before. Eye ointments should be 
administered last. 
Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of netarsudil and may be reinserted 15 minutes 
following its administration (see section 4.4).  
The tip of the dispensing container should avoid contacting the eye, surrounding structures, fingers, or 
any other surface in order to avoid contamination of the solution. Serious damage to the eye and 
subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Ocular effects 
Twice a day dosing is not well tolerated and is not recommended. Netarsudil dosed twice daily 
provided slightly larger IOP reductions, but had a less favorable safety profile as reflected in a higher 
rate and increased severity of ocular adverse reactions. Twice a day dosing was also associated with a 
higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions (53.8%) during a 12-month study. It is therefore 
recommended to dose netarsudil once daily.  
Benzalkonium chloride content 
This medicinal product contains benzalkonium chloride. 
Benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation, symptoms of dry eyes and may affect 
the tear film and corneal surface and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. It should be used with 
caution in dry eye patients and in patients where the cornea may be compromised.  
Patients should be monitored in case of prolonged use. 
The efficacy of netarsudil has not been studied beyond 12 months. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of netarsudil in pregnant women. No effects 
during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). 
Animal studies with intravenous administration do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (see section 5.3). Rhokiinsa should not 
be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
netarsudil. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether netarsudil/metabolites are excreted in human milk. However, while no effects 
on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding women 
to netarsudil is expected to be negligible, no relevant clinical data are available (see section 5.2). A 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Rhokiinsa 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility. However, no effects are 
anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rhokiinsa has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
If transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before 
driving or using machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Conjunctival Hyperaemia 
Conjunctival hyperaemia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction associated with netarsudil 
treatment in clinical trials and it is attributed to the vasodilation effect of the Rho kinase inhibitor drug 
class. Conjunctival hyperaemia was typically mild in severity and sporadic. However, there was a 
relatively small proportion of subjects with moderate or severe hyperaemia who discontinued 
treatment because of this adverse reaction (6.0% in Phase 3 clinical studies). 
Cornea Verticillata 
Cornea verticillata occurred in approximately 20% of the patients in controlled Phase 3 clinical 
studies. The cornea verticillata seen in netarsudil-treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of daily 
dosing. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. The majority 
of cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of cornea verticillata 
was higher in certain subpopulations: elderly (≥65 years) versus non-elderly (24.8 vs. 15.9%); males 
versus females (24.4 vs. 18.4%) and in white versus other races (25.6 vs. 7.0%). 
Special populations 
Elderly subjects 
With the exception of cornea verticillata (see above), no difference in the safety profile for Rhokiinsa 
has been observed between subjects aged <65 or ≥65 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Systemic exposure to netarsudil following topical ocular administration has been shown to be 
negligible. If topical overdose of netarsudil should occur, the eye(s) may be flushed with tap water. 
Treatment of an overdose would include supportive and symptomatic therapy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC 
code: S01EX05 
Mechanism of action 
Netarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, is believed to reduce IOP by increasing outflow of aqueous humor. 
Studies in animal and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased trabecular outflow. 
These studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by reducing episcleral venous pressure.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of 
netarsudil once daily with that of timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily in reducing IOP in a total of 708 
patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The median age of study participants was 
65.5 years (range 18 to 91 years).  
6 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study was designed to show non-inferiority of netarsudil when dosed once daily in the evening to 
timolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with a baseline IOP of >20 mmHg and <25 mmHg. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was mean IOP at each of 9 timepoints measured at 08:00, 
10:00 and 16:00 on day 15, day 43 and day 90. The non-inferiority margin applied was a difference in 
mean IOP ≤1.5 mmHg for all time points over all visits through 3 months and ≤1.0 mmHg at a 
majority of these time points. The IOP reduction with netarsudil dosed once daily was non-inferior to 
the effect of timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with baseline IOP of <25 mmHg (Table 1).  
Efficacy was also investigated in patients with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and <30 mmHg. Netarsudil 
demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in IOP at all timepoints, however non-inferiority to timolol 
was not demonstrated in this population with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and <30 mmHg (Table 2).

The safety of netarsudil has been evaluated in clinical studies, including four well-controlled Phase 3 
studies.   
Approximately 75% of subjects included in the netarsudil treatment groups of Phase 3 studies were 
Caucasian and 24% Black or African American.  Over half were aged ≥ 65 years.  With the exception 
of the incidence of cornea verticillata, no other difference in safety profile was observed between races 
or age groups (see section 4.8). 
Completion rates in Phase 3 studies were lower in the netarsudil treatment group when compared with 
the timolol maleate group. Subjects with known contraindications or hypersensitivity to timolol were 
7 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
excluded from the studies. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 19.3% for the 
netarsudil treatment group versus 1.7% for the timolol maleate group. The majority of 
discontinuations in the netarsudil group were associated with ocular adverse reactions, whereas the 
majority of discontinuations in the timolol group were associated with non-ocular adverse reactions. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in the Rhokiinsa 
groups were conjunctival hyperemia (5.8%), cornea verticillata (3.7%) and vision blurred (1.4%). The 
incidences of hyperemia and vision blurred were sporadic in nature.  
The efficacy and safety of netarsudil in subjects with compromised corneal epithelium or co-existing 
ocular pathologies e.g. pseudoexfoliation and dispersion pigment syndrome has not been established. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rhokiinsa in all subsets of the paediatric population for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure 
in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite, AR-13503, were evaluated in 18 
healthy subjects after topical ocular administration of netarsudil once daily (one drop bilaterally in the 
morning) for 8 days. There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of netarsudil (lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) 0.100 ng/ml) post dose on day 1 and day 8. Only one plasma concentration at 
0.11 ng/ml for the active metabolite was observed for one subject on day 8 at 8 hours post-dose. 
Biotransformation 
After topical ocular dosing, netarsudil is metabolised by esterases in the eye to an active metabolite, 
AR-13503. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to development.  
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Intravenous administration of netarsudil mesylate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis 
did not produce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures. In pregnant rats, 
0.3 mg/kg/day (1000 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed increased post-
implantation loss and reduced foetal viability.  In pregnant rabbits, 3 mg/kg/day (10000 times the 
recommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed an increase in post-implantation loss and a 
decrease in foetal weight. 
Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of 
netarsudil. 
Netarsudil was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay, in a mouse lymphoma assay, or in a rat 
micronucleus test. 
Netarsudil and its active metabolite AR-13503 was found to have a possible phototoxic potential in a 
modified 3T3 NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB light.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rhokiinsa is and what it is used for 
Rhokiinsa contains an active substance called netarsudil. Netarsudil belongs to a group of medicines 
called “Rho kinase inhibitors”, which work to reduce the amount of fluid inside the eye and so lower 
its pressure.  
Rhokiinsa is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adults who have an eye condition known as 
glaucoma or who have raised pressure in their eyes. If the pressure in the eye is too high, it can 
damage your sight. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rhokiinsa  
Do not use Rhokiinsa: 
- 
if you are allergic to netarsudil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).  
Warnings and precautions  
  Do not use Rhokiinsa more than once a day, as you may experience more side effects. 
Children and adolescents 
Rhokiinsa should not be used in children and teenagers under 18 years of age as it has only been 
studied in adults.  
Other medicines and Rhokiinsa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Rhokiinsa if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor still recommends it. 
Driving and using machines 
You may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal just after using Rhokiinsa. Do not drive or use 
machines until the symptoms are cleared. 
Rhokiinsa contains benzalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains approximately 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each ml of solution.   
Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the 
contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15 
minutes afterwards.   
Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of 
the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain 
in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. 
3. 
How to use Rhokiinsa 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
Only use Rhokiinsa for your eyes (ocular use). Do not swallow or inject.  
The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes once a day in the evening. Use the 
medicine at around the same time each day. 
How to use 
  Wash your hands before you start. 
 
Do not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could infect 
the drops. 
Twist off the bottle cap, and lie the cap on a clean surface on its side. Continue to hold the 
bottle, ensuring that the tip doesn’t come into contact with anything.  
Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. 
Tilt your head back. 
Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger to form a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your 
eye. The drop will go in here (Picture 1). 
Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. 
Do not touch your eye, eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could 
infect the drops. 
Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of Rhokiinsa into your eye. 
Only put one drop into your eye each time. If a drop misses your eye, try again.

 
If you need to use the drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye while you have 
the bottle open. 
Put back the bottle cap to close the bottle. 
If you are using other eye drops, wait at least five minutes after using them and then use Rhokiinsa. If 
you are using eye ointments, these should be used last. 
If you use more Rhokiinsa than you should  
Rinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose.  
If you forget to use Rhokiinsa 
Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  
Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) once a day.  
If you stop using Rhokiinsa 
Do not stop using Rhokiinsa without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using Rhokiinsa the 
pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  Introduction 
On 20 july 2017 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study number 201832 in accordance with 
Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  The  study  has  not  been  conducted  in 
accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan and will not result in an update to the Product 
Information. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures specific obligations. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided but it does not discuss information concerning 
the paediatric population.  
The MAH states that the submitted study does not influence the benefit risk for Relvar Ellipta and that 
no consequential regulatory action is required.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Relvar  Ellipta  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  13th  November  2013  and  the  duplicate  licence,  Revinty 
Ellipta, approved in the EU on 2nd May 2014 for the following indication: 
“regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  and  adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older  where  use  of  a 
combination  medicinal  product  (long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  inhaled  corticosteroid)  is  appropriate: 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  ‘as  needed’  inhaled  short-acting 
beta2-agonists”. 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  as  amended,  the  application  included  a  EMA 
Decision on the granting of a class waiver for the condition COPD (EMA/825560/2009). A EMA Decision 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan, which included a waiver in children under 5 years 
of  age  and  a  deferral  in  children  aged  5-11  years  (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M04;  P/0049/2012),  was 
also submitted in the application.  
The last EMA Decision was issued by August 2013 (P/0216/2013) corresponding to the Modification 06. 
The agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP), which is expected to be completed by November 2019, 
established six clinical measures for adolescents (12 to less than 18 years)  and adults. Four of these 
measures were agreed to assay FF/VI in combination.  
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to 
the EMA the final study report for 201832 which achieved Last Subject Last Visit on 3 february 2017. 
Study  number  201832  was  a  stand  alone  study  and  not  part  of  a  paediatric  investigation  plan  and  I 
hereby confirm that these data do not require an update of the product information, in line with Article 
46 regulations. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  hereby  submitted  study  “A  Randomised,  Double-Blind,  Double-Dummy,

Propionate  250  mcg  Twice-Daily  in  Adolescent  and  Adult  Subjects  with  Asthma  and  Exercise-Induced 
Bronchoconstriction” study number: 201832 is not part of a PIP.   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  formulations  of  FF/VI  used  in  the  study  were  the  same  as  the  products  approved  in  the  EU  (i.e. 
FF/VI  100/25  mcg  equivalent  to  a  delivered  dose  of  92/22  mcg)  delivered  via  the  Ellipta  dry  powder 
inhaler to treat adults and adolescents with asthma. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
For  many  patients  with  symptomatic  asthma,  physical  exertion  can  be  a  precipitating  factor  for 
bronchoconstriction. Although varying in methodology and criteria, early studies showed that as many 
as  90%  of  individuals  with  asthma  have  bronchoconstriction  after  exercise.  This  is  termed  exercise-
induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and is defined as a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1)  post-exercise  challenge  of  ≥20%.  In  patients  with  symptoms  of  persistent  asthma,  exercise 
and  other  forms  of  physical  activity  represent  one  of  many  triggers  that  can  lead  to  worsening 
symptoms. 
Chronic treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been shown to reduce the severity of asthma 
associated  with  exercise.  However,  some  patients  continue  to  demonstrate  asthma  symptoms  and  a 
decrease  in  lung  function  during  exercise  even  whilst  receiving  ICS.  The  addition  of  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (LABA) to ICS has been considered as a possible treatment in these cases. International 
guidelines such as those issued by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the National Heart Lung 
and  Blood  Institute  (NIH)  advocate  the  use  of  inhaled  LABA  in  combination  with  ICS  as  maintenance 
therapy in asthma for participants who remain symptomatic on low-to-mid-dose ICS.  
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  study  number:  201832.  This  was  a  randomised,  double-blind, 
double-dummy,  crossover  study  in  adults  and  adolescents  (aged  12-50)  with  persistent  asthma  and 
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The objective of the study was to evaluate the protective 
effect of FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily (OD) compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 mcg twice-
daily  (BD)  against  EIB.  The  study  used  standard  exercise  challenge  and  spirometry  techniques  to 
assess the primary and secondary endpoints as well as using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 
to assess changes in asthma control.

Description 
Inhaled  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  (FF/VI)  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older, and for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)  in  adults.  Inhaled  FF/VI  has  been  approved  for  marketing  in  the  EU  through  the  Centralised 
procedure. 
Study  201832  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  crossover  study  in  adults  and 
adolescents (aged 12-50) with persistent asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The 
objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  protective  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  once-daily  (OD) 
compared  with  fluticasone  propionate  (FP)  250  mcg  twice-daily  (BD)  against  EIB.  The  study  used 
standard exercise challenge and spirometry techniques to assess the primary and secondary endpoints 
as well as using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) to assess changes in asthma control. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of FF/VI 100/25 OD compared 
with FP 250 BD against EIB in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma. 
Study design 
Eligible  subjects  who  were  currently  on  a  low-to-moderate  dose  inhaled  corticosteroid  (ICS) 
(equivalent  to  FP  100-500mcg/day),  with  a  forced  expiratory  flow  in  1  second  (FEV1)  of  ≥70%,  and 
self-reported  EIB,  completed  a  four-week  run-in  period  on  FP  250mcg  BD.  At  the  end  of  the  run-in 
period  those  patients  who  showed  physiological  evidence  of  EIB  i.e.  ≥20%  drop  in  FEV1  within  30 
minutes post-exercise challenge were randomised to receive one of two treatments: FF/VI 100/25 mcg 
OD + placebo FP or FP 250mcg BD + placebo FF/VI in the first two-week treatment period. This was 
followed  by  a  two-week  wash-out  period  on  FP  250mcg  BD,  after  which  subjects  crossed  over  to  a 
second two-week treatment period during which they received the alternate treatment.  
Endpoints were measured at the start and end of each treatment period, and after one day of dosing. 
The primary endpoint was measured 12- hours after the evening dose of study treatment on Day 14 of 
each treatment period, whilst secondary endpoints were measured 12 and 23- hours after the evening 
dose of study treatment on Day 14 of each treatment period as well as 23- hours after the first dose of 
each treatment period.  
The  formulations  of  FF/VI  used  in  the  study  were  the  same  as  the  products  approved  in  the  EU  (i.e. 
FF/VI  100/25  mcg  equivalent  to  a  delivered  dose  of  92/22  mcg)  delivered  via  the  Ellipta  dry  powder 
inhaler to treat adults and adolescents with asthma.

Study population /Sample size 
Key inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed at the Screening visit (Visit 1) (Day -26 to Day -30) as 
follows. Full details are provided in Section 6.1.1 and Section 6.1.2 of the protocol. 
Key Inclusion Criteria 
Consenting  males  and  non-pregnant  females  aged 12  to  50  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  asthma,  a  pre-
bronchodilator  FEV1  of 
7 0 % ,   a n d   s y m p t o m s   s u g g e s t iv e   o f  EI B.
  Eligible  participants  were  to  have 
been  taking  a  stable  low-to-moderate  dose  of  ICS,  and  were  physically  able  to  perform  the  exercise 
challenges after withholding bronchodilators. 
Key Exclusion Criteria 
Participants  were  unable  to  participate  in  the  study  if  they  had  one  or  more  of  the  following: 
intermittent or seasonal asthma or only exercise-induced asthma, a history of life-threatening asthma, 
any additional significant respiratory condition or any uncontrolled conditions/diseases which may have 
put the participant or study findings at risk, SAR not resolvable with a 4-week treatment of intranasal 
corticosteroids, or any report of: an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids (12 weeks prior

Treatment Assignment 
Participants  were  assigned  to  IP  at  Visit  2  in  accordance  with  the  randomisation  schedule.  The 
randomisation  schedule  was  generated  by  Clinical  Statistics  prior  to  the  start  of  the  study,  using 
validated  internal  software  (GSK  RandAll  NG).  Centralised  randomisation  was  used.  Participants  were 
randomised  to  a  treatment  sequence  using  GSK  RAMOSNG  software.  At  Visit  2,  eligible  participants 
were randomised 1:1 to one of the treatment sequences shown in Table 2. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Assessment 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  following 
exercise challenge at 12 hr post-dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was assessed using an exercise challenge and spirometry measurements. 
Exercise Challenge

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/619161/2017

The exercise challenge test was a stepped challenge on a treadmill at a speed and incline required for 
participants  to  reach  80%  to  95%  of  their  maximum  heart  rate  within  4  min  and  maintain  this  heart 
rate  with  exercise  for  an  additional  6  min  for  a  total  of  10  min  of  exercise.  During  the  exercise 
challenge, participants inhaled medical grade dry air at ambient temperature from a reservoir using a 
two-way non-rebreathing valve. 
Spirometry 
The spirometry assessments were performed at a time relative to the prior evening dose of the IP: 
For  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  spirometry  assessments  were  performed  12  hr  after  the  prior 
evening dose of the IP. 
For  the  secondary  and  other  efficacy  endpoints  spirometry  was  performed  either  12  hr  or  23  hr 
following the prior evening dose of the IP depending on the endpoint. 
Full  spirometry  (FEV1  and  forced  vital  capacity  [FVC])  was  performed  prior  to  exercise  challenges  to 
serve as a within-visit baseline. Immediately following the exercise challenges serial spirometry FEV1 
measurements were performed at 6 time intervals over 60 min (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min) post-
exercise.  Challenge  FEV1  wasmeasured  using  standard  spirometry  procedures,  equipment,  and 
software  that  met  or    exceeded  the  minimal  recommendations  of  the  ATS/European  Respiratory 
Society  (ERS),  provided  by  CompleWare.  The  degree  of  EIB  was  determined  by  comparing  the 
decrease  in  FEV1  post-exercise  challenge  to  the  pre-exercise  FEV1.  Spirometry  efforts  had  to  meet 
specific  quality  measures  to  be  used  for  eligibility  and  to  be  included  in  the  analysis.  Acceptable 
spirometry efforts had measurements with a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e., a plateau in 
the volume-time curve) and were free from artefacts caused by cough, early termination, poor effort, 
obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons. In addition, time points had specific 
criteria applied as follows: 
•  Visits  1  and  2  (spirometry  prior  to  the  exercise  challenge):  at  least  two  valid  and  two 
repeatable efforts had to be obtained. 
•  Visits  3,  4,  6,  and  7  (spirometry  prior  to  the  exercise  challenge)  and  Visit  5  (no  exercise 
challenge conducted): at least two valid efforts had to be obtained. 
•  Visits 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 (post-exercise challenge serial spirometry): at least one valid effort had 
to be obtained. 
No more than 8 efforts were performed for any time point. 
The  investigators  were  responsible  for  initial  assessment  of  the  quality  of  the  spirometry  efforts. 
CompleWare  performed  an  additional  overread  of  all  spirometry  efforts  and  detected  any  spirometry 
effects  that  were  not  considered  of  sufficient  quality.  Upon  consultation  of  this  finding  with  the 
investigator, CompleWare then deleted the non-satisfactory spirometry efforts. At each time point, the 
largest FEV1, and FVC values, where required, were recorded even when they did not come from the 
same effort. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Other Efficacy Endpoints were also analised.

Adverse  events  and  concomitant  medications  were  collected  at  each  visit  including  the  Follow-Up 
phone call and the EW visit. Vital signs were recorded from Visit 1 to Visit 7 and at the EW visit. 
Adverse Events 
The  investigator  or  study  centre  staff  detected,  documented,  and  reported  events  that  met  the 
definition of an AE or SAE (protocol Section 8.4.1). AE information was volunteered by the participant, 
discovered by investigator questioning, or detected by other means. AEs and SAEs were collected from 
the start of study treatment (the start of the Run-In period) until the Follow-Up phone call. Any SAEs 
assessed  as  related  to  study  participation  (e.g.,  protocol-mandated  procedures,  invasive  tests,  or 
change  in  existing  therapy),  or  related  to  a  GSK  product  were  recorded  from  the  time  a  participant 
consented to participate in the study up to and including the Follow-Up phone call. 
For all AEs, the following information was collected: onset and outcome/end date, frequency, intensity, 
the  clinical  action  taken  with  the  study  treatment  in  response  to  the  AE,  details  of  participant 
withdrawal (if applicable), and relationship to study treatment. 
 Asthma Exacerbations 
Severe asthma exacerbations were recorded on the exacerbation log in the eCRF from Randomisation 
(Visit 2) to the Follow-Up phone call, along with treatment details. Severe asthma exacerbations were 
not recorded as AEs unless determined to be an SAE (resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted 
in hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulted in disability/incapacity, could have 
jeopardised the participant, or required medical or surgical intervention). 
Physical Exams 
Physical examinations including, but not limited to an evaluation of the lungs and cardiovascular (CV) 
system, were conducted at Visit 1 by a licensed practitioner listed on FDA Form 1572. 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs were obtained at each clinic visit including the EW visit. At each visit, heart rate and systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure were measured after approximately 5 min of rest in a semi-supine position 
and  prior  to  spirometry.  At  visits  where  an  exercise  challenge  was  performed,  vital  signs  were 
measured  prior  to  the  pre-exercise  challenge  spirometry  and  immediately  following  the  end  of  the 
exercise challenge. Any clinically significant abnormalities in the vital signs were further examined until 
the abnormality was resolved. 
Electrocardiogram 
A  12-lead  ECG  was  performed  after  5  min  rest,  after  vital  signs,  and  prior  to  performing  spirometry. 
ECG readers were interpreted by the investigator at Visit 1. 
Statistical Methods 
All data analysis methods for this CSR were described in a Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) dated 15 
December 2016. All programming was performed in a HARP environment  using SAS Version 9.4 or a 
later version.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
An overview of participant disposition is shown in Figure 2. A total of 75 participants were randomised 
into the study. 
Randomized Subjects 
A total of 75 participants were randomly assigned to treatment and 74 participants received treatment 
(one participant [Participant 952] was randomised but did not receive treatment, with the participant 
withdrawing  from  the  study  for  the  reason  ‘Participant  not  interested  in  continuing  in  study’)  (Figure 
2). 
Participants were randomly assigned to  IP at a total of 14  centres in two countries (Table 1.7). More 
participants were randomised at centres in the USA than Canada (USA: 72 participants [97%],  anada:

2  participants  [3%])  (Table  1.7).  The  majority  of  participants  (93%)  completed  the  study.  Five 
participants  (7%)  withdrew  over  the  course  of  the  study  (Listing  1):  one  participant  withdrew  whilst 
taking  FF/VI  100/25  OD,  two  participants  withdrew  whilst  taking  FP  250  BD,  and  two  participants 
withdrew during the Wash-Out period. The only reason for study withdrawal reported for more than 1 
participant (3%) was AE. Of the two participants with AEs that led to study withdrawal, one participant 
had been receiving treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD and one participant had been receiving treatment 
with FP 250 BD at the time of withdrawal.  
Populations Analyzed 
In this study, 163 participants were screened and 74 participants received at least one dose of blinded 
IP and were included in the ITT Population (Table 6). The majority of participants were included in the 
PP  Population  (88%)  and  the  ITT  (15  years  or  older)  Population  (85%).  There  were  17  participants 
(23%) who were less than 18 years old and comprised the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Demographic characteristics of the ITT Population are summarised in Table 7. This study randomised a 
similar  number  of  females  (58%)  and  males  (42%).  Participants  were  predominately  over  the  age  of 
18  (77%),  with  a  mean  age  of  27.8  years,  and  non-Hispanic/Latino  (93%),  with  the  majority  of 
participants being of White/Caucasian/European Heritage (57%). There was a notably large proportion 
of participants of African American/African Heritage (38%).

Asthma, Exacerbation, and Tobacco Use History 
At  Screening,  the  majority  of  participants  (84%)  had  never  smoked  (Table  1.19).  In  the  16%  of 
participants who were former smokers, the mean smoking history was 0.8 pack-years The majority of 
participants  reported  a  duration  of  asthma  at  Screening  of  ≥10  years  (76%)  (Table  8),  and  most 
participants had not experienced an asthma exacerbation in the last 12 months (91%). The majority of 
participants  who  experienced  an  exacerbation  in  the  last  12  months  experienced  a  Type  2 
exacerbation, which required oral/systemic corticosteroids but did not involve hospitalisation (5 of the 
7  participants).  The  remaining  two  participants  experienced  Type  1  exacerbation(s)  in  the  last  12 
months, which was managed without oral/systemic corticosteroids. 
Screening and Baseline Lung Function 
At Screening, the mean pre-bronchodilator lung function was an FEV1 of 3.040 L (91.59% predicted) 
and  an  FVC  of  4.137  L  (Table  9).  The  Study  Baseline  lung  function  was  determined  at  Visit  2, 
Randomisation,  following  a  4-week  Run-In  period  with  FP  250  BD.  Study  Baseline  lung  function  was 
similar to that at Screening, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 3.025 L and 91.28% predicted FEV1.

Efficacy results 
Maximal Decrease from Pre-Exercise Challenge FEV1 
The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  was  the  maximal  percent  FEV1  decrease  from  pre-exercise  FEV1 
following  exercise  challenge  12  hr  post-dose  with  FF/VI  100/25  OD  or  FP  250  BD  on  Day  14  of 
treatment.  The  secondary  endpoints  of  this  study  included  the  maximal  percent  FEV1  decrease  from 
pre-exercise FEV1 23 hr post-dose with FF/VI 100/25 OD or FP 250 BD on Day 14 of treatment. 
The  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  from  pre-exercise  FEV1  at  12  hr  post-dose  on  Day  14  was 
similar for FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD treatment (15.02% and 16.71%, respectively) (Table 14). 
The treatment difference was -1.69% points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.76, 0.39). The analysis 
for the PP Population and the ITT (15 years or older) Population and a summary produced for the ITT 
(12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 2.6) were consistent with the ITT Population. 
As  the  outcome  of  the  primary  endpoint  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  and  based  on  the 
statistical  hierarchy,  no  further  statistical  inference  could  be  made  on  the  secondary  or  other 
endpoints.

The  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  and  the  maximal  absolute  decrease  in  FEV1  (L)  from  pre-
exercise FEV1 were also similar between the two treatments at 23 hr post-dose on Day 1 of treatment 
(Table  15).  The  analysis  for  the  ITT  (15  years  or  older)  Population  and  a  summary  produced  for  the 
ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 2.11) were consistent with the ITT Population.

The  maximal  percent  decrease  from  pre-exercise  FEV1  following  an  exercise  challenge  at  study 
baseline (Visit 2) (28.55%) was numerically attenuated at all time points (23 hr post-dose on Day 1, 
and  12  hr  post-dose  on  Day  14,  and  23  hr  post-dose  of  Day  14  of  treatment)  (Table  15).  The  study 
baseline exercise challenge was performed in the evening, as was the 23 hr Day 1 and 23 hr Day 14 
time point exercise challenges. The 12 hr Day 14 time point was performed in the morning.

Assessor’s comments on efficacy results 
The primary endpoint was not met. There was no significant difference in maximal percent decrease 
in FEV1 from pre-exercise FEV1 at 12 hours post-dose on Day 14 between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 
250  BD  treatment  (15.02%  and  16.71%,  respectively,  treatment  difference:  -1.69%  points,  95% 
confidence  interval  [CI]:  -3.76,  0.39).  The  results  did  not  show  a  difference  between  FF/VI  100/25 
OD and FP 250 BD in protection against EIB. 
Data of ITT [12-17 Years Old] Population (a total of 17 subjects (23%) of the total population were 
12  to  17  years  of  age)  has  been  provided  separately  in  the  study  report;  The  results  for  this 
population  were  consistent  with  the  ITT  population.  The  MAH  has  not  presented  any  separate 
statistical  analysis  for  the  adolescent’s  subgroup,  which  is  endorsed  by  the  Rapporteur  due  to  the 
very small size of this subgroup. 
Nevertheless,  results  obtained  in  the  study  201832  performed  in  asthmatic  subjects  aged  12  years 
and  older  are  consistent  to  the  EU  summary  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  not  alter  the 
risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory is action required. 
Safety results 
Adverse Events 
Summary of All Adverse Events 
Table  21  presents  an  overview  of  all  on-treatment  AEs  that  occurred  in  this  study.  The  proportion  of 
participants  who  experienced  AEs  was  similar  during  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  OD  (16%)  and  FP 
250 BD (15%). One drug-related AE was reported in a participant whilst treated with FF/VI 100/25 OD. 
Two AEs (one during each of FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD treatments) led to withdrawal from the 
study. There was 1 SAE reported during treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD, which was not related to the 
study treatment. There were no fatal Aes in this study. 
The incidence of participants who experienced any post-treatment AEs was low and similar in the two 
treatments.  Of  the  post-treatment  AEs,  none  of  these  occurred  in  ≥2  participants,  none  were 
considered to be related to study treatment, and none were SAEs. 
Common On-treatment Adverse Events

There was a low number  of on-treatment AEs reported in this study, and AE incidence was similar in 
participants  receiving  FF/VI  100/25  or  FP  250  BD  treatment.  During  either  treatment,  the  Medical 
Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  system  organ  class  (SOC)  with  the  most  frequently 
reported  on-treatment  AEs  was  Infections  and  Infestations  (Table  22).  The  only  AEs  that  occurred  in 
≥2  participants  during  either  treatment,  as  preferred  terms,  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(URTI)  (7%  in  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  6%  in  FP  250  BD)  and  gastroenteritis  (3%  in  FF/VI  100/25  OD 
and 1% in FP 250 BD) (Table 23). All reports of URTI were mild in intensity and determined to be not 
related to the study drug by the investigator. During the FF/VI 100/25 treatment there was one report 
of  gastroenteritis  that  was  severe  in  intensity  and  reported  as  an  SAE.  The  other  incidences  of 
gastroenteritis  in  both  treatments  were  moderate  in  intensity.  All  reports  of  gastroenteritis  were 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  not  related  to  the  study  drug.  The  pattern  of  on-treatment  AEs 
was comparable in the ITT (15 years or older). The ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population had fewer on-
treatment  AEs,  with  two  reported  during  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  and  one  during  FP  250  BD 
treatment (Table 3.4).

Drug-related Adverse Events 
One  drug-related  AE,  reported  as  increased  tendency  to  bruise,  occurred  during  FF/VI  100/25  OD 
treatment.  This  AE  was  mild  in  intensity  and  did  not  lead  to  study  withdrawal.  There  were  no  drug-
related SAEs reported in this study. 
Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Deaths 
No participants died during the conduct of this study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
One participant (1%) experienced an SAE whilst taking FF/VI 100/25 OD. There were no SAEs reported 
during FP 250 BD treatment. No drug-related AEs and no post-treatment SAEs were reported. 
Participant 758 experienced a severe SAE of gastroenteritis that resolved within 11 days. 
The  event  occurred  13  days  after  the  commencement  of  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  was 
considered by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. The event did not lead to changes 
in treatment dose or withdrawal from the study. This participant was withdrawn from the study due to 
two other AEs. 
Adverse  Events  Leading  to  Permanent  Discontinuation  of  Study  Medication  or  Withdrawal  from  the 
Study 
Two participants experienced an on-treatment AE leading to withdrawal from the study (Table 24): 
One participant (1%) whilst receiving FF/VI 100/25 OD treatment and one participant (1%) whilst 
receiving FP 250 BD treatment. Neither of these events were SAEs nor considered related to study 
treatment. 
One participant (Participant 758) experienced two non-serious AEs of moderate worsening of asthma 
and sinusitis, whilst receiving treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD, which led to study withdrawal. This 
participant also experienced an on-treatment SAE of severe gastroenteritis, two non-serious pre-

treatment AEs of mild tooth abscess and moderate bronchitis, none of which contributed to participant 
withdrawal from the study. 
One participant (Participant 114) experienced a non-serious AE of cough while receiving treatment with 
FP 250 BD, which led to study withdrawal. 
This participant also experienced a non-serious on-treatment AEs of mild URTI whilst also receiving FP 
250 BD. 
Additionally, one participant (Participant 504) was withdrawn from the study due to a severe asthma 
exacerbation which was a stopping criteria in the protocol. Asthma exacerbations were not reported as 
AEs in this study unless they met the definition of an SAE. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
On-treatment  and  post-treatment  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  were  recorded  for  this  study.  AESIs 
are  AEs  associated  with  the  known  pharmacological  action  of  ICS  and  LABA  therapy.  AESIs  were 
identified using either standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs) or GSK-defined special interest terms. 
The  incidence  of  AESIs  was  low  in  this  study,  and  similar  rates  of  incidence  were  reported  during 
treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD (4%) or FP 250 BD (1%) (Table 25). No individual AESI occurred in 
>1 participant when receiving FF/VI 100/25 OD or FP 250 BD. The participant who experienced cardiac 
arrhythmia  (preferred  term:  syncope)  was  not  the  same  participant  that  reported  a  past  medical 
history  of  arrhythmia  at  Screening.  The  incidence  of  on-treatment  and  post-treatment  AESIs  was 
comparable with the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 3.18).

There were no reports of serious AESIs in this study. There were no reports of on-treatment or post-
treatment pneumonia in this study. 
Asthma Exacerbations 
Safety assessments in this study included monitoring for severe asthma exacerbations. Severe asthma 
exacerbations were not recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation met the definition of an SAE. 
No  participants  in  either  treatment  group  experienced  an  on-treatment  severe  asthma  exacerbation 
(Table 3.24). 
One  participant  (Participant  504),  a  12  year  old  male,  experienced  a  post-treatment  severe  asthma 
exacerbation  during  the  Wash-Out  period  following  the  completion  of  Treatment  Period  1  with  FF/VI 
100/25  OD  (Table  3.24).  This  participant  required  systemic/oral  corticosteroids  and  was  withdrawn 
from the study as a result of this event. The exacerbation did not meet the definition of an SAE. The

exacerbation  was  resolved  within  28  days  of  onset.  This  study  withdrawal  was  recorded  as  a  lack  of 
efficacy (worsening of asthma requiring additional asthma medication) (Table 4). 
This  participant  was  included  in  the  ITT  (12  to  17  years  old)  Population  (Table  3.26).  There  were  no 
reports of on-treatment or post-treatment severe asthma exacerbations in the ITT (15 years or older) 
Population. There were no reports of on-treatment severe asthma exacerbations in the  ITT (12 to 17 
years old) Population (Table 3.26). 
One  participant  (Participant  758)  experienced  an  AE  and  AESI  of  worsening  of  asthma,  that  led  to 
withdrawal from the study, though this was not considered an asthma exacerbation.

Assessor’s comments on safety data 
Safety  results obtained in the study 201832 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years 
and older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and not alter 
the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory action is required. 
The safety data for  (ITT [12-17 Years Old] Population) has been provided separately in the 
study report and were consistent withe the ITT poplulation.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  FF/VI  100/25  OD  compared  with  FP  250  BD  in 
protection against EIB in adolescent and adult participants aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma with 
EIB. 
A  total  of  75  subjects  were  randomized,  of  whom  74  were  included  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT) 
Population,  and  66  were  included  in  the  Per  Protocol  (PP)  Population.  The  primary  endpoint  was  not 
met. There was no significant difference in maximal percent decrease in FEV1 from pre-exercise FEV1 
at  12  hours  post-dose  on  Day  14  between  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  FP  250  BD  treatment  (15.02%  and 
16.71%,  respectively,  treatment  difference:  -1.69%  points,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  -3.76, 
0.39).  As  this  study  used  a  hierarchical  design  and  the  primary  endpoint  did  not  reach  statistical 
significance no further statistical inference could be made on the secondary or other endpoints of this 
study. 
In conclusion, the results  did not show a  significant difference between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 
BD in protection against EIB. Both products had an acceptable safety profile. 
GlaxoSmithKline has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that they are in line with the 
approved  product  information  in  the  EU.  Therefore,  no  changes  to  the  Product  Information  are 
considered necessary. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Relvar  Ellipta/  Relvinty  Ellipta  have  been  authorised  for  use  as  once  daily  treatment  of  persistent 
asthma  in  adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older.  In  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of the study number 201832.  
Study  201832  was  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  FF/VI  100/25  OD  compared  with  FP  250  BD  in 
protection against EIB in adolescent and adult participants aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma with 
EIB. The primary endpoint was not met. 
17  subjects  (23%)  from  ITT  Population  which  aged  less  than  18  years  were  also  randomized  to  the 
treatment groups. Disaggregated demographic, efficacy or safety data have been provided in the study 
report and were consistent with the ITT population. The MAH has not presented any separate statistical 
analysis for the adolescents subgroup, which is endorsed by the Rapporteur due to the very small size 
of this subgroup. 
Nevertheless, results obtained in the study 201832 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and 
older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and  not alter the risk/benefit 
profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory action is required.

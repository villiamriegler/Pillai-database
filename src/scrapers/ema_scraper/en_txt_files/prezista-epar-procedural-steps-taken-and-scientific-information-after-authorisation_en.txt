PREZISTA/REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA: Corticosteroids primarily 
metabolised by CYP3A (including betamethasone, 
budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, 
triamcinolone). 
REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA: Based on theoretical considerations 
DRV/COBI is expected to increase these corticosteroid 
plasma concentrations. (CYP3A inhibition) 
Concomitant use of boosted 
PREZISTA/REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA and corticosteroids (all 
routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A 
may increase the risk of development of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and 
adrenal suppression. 
Co-administration with CYP3A-metabolised corticosteroids 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the 
patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be 
monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. 
Alternative corticosteroids which are less dependent on 
CYP3A metabolism e.g. beclomethasone should be 
considered, particularly for long term use.

Moreover, as per the revised Annex to the European 
Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labelling 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use’, the Package Leaflets of Prezista, Rezolsta and 
Symtuza have been updated to include information

version 10.0. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
with medicinal products primarily metabolized by CYP3A 
and/or transported by P-gp may result in increased 
systemic exposure to the co administered medicinal 
product.  Therefore, concomitant treatment with such 
medicinal products for which elevated plasma 
concentrations are associated with serious and/or life 
threatening events is contraindicated.   
Based on these sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the 
Product Information for darunavir, darunavir/cobicistat 
fixed-dose combination, and 
darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide

further guidance for use in combination with ivabradine, 
naloxegol, dapoxetine, irinotecan, fesoterodine, solifenacin, 
and domperidone, each of which are metabolized by 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6, and/or transported by P-gp. This 
guidance is aligned with the recommendations in the 
Product Information of those respective products 
considering the mechanistic basis of these interactions.

dabigatran is contraindicated. 
Edoxaban is a substrate of P glycoprotein, which can be 
inhibited by darunavir when used in combination with low-

~90% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy 
as compared to postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin 
concentrations of 168-184 ng/ml for DRV/COBI during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy were below the 
previously targeted 550 ng/ml (EPAR Prezista) and 
considerably lower than the mean darunavir Cmin 
concentrations of 1100-1200 ng/ml for the DRV/RTV arm of 
study TMC114HIV3015. 
Exposure of cobicistat was 63% and 49% lower during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, respectively, 
compared with 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. As the exposure 
of cobicistat is reduced in pregnant women, probably the 
boosting by cobicistat is no longer maximal. 
In view of the observed low exposure values of 
darunavir/cobicistat during pregnancy, the CHMP agreed to 
strongly recommend against the use of darunavir/cobicistat 
during pregnancy. This should apply to pregnant women 
who are already on a DRV/COBI containing regimen, as 
well as to those who are naïve to DRV/COBI.

indication to use darunavir once daily in children 
aged 3 to 12 years ≥ 15 kg who are treatment-naïve 
or treatment-experienced with no darunavir 
resistance-associated mutations (DRV RAMs).  This 
proposed change is based on the data from a 2 week 
once daily substudy of the Phase 2 study TMC114 
C228 and results from model-based pharmacokinetic 
simulations. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one 
of the indication to:  
“Darunavir administered once daily in combination with 
low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, in paediatric 
subjects aged 3 to <12 years and weighing ≥15 kg who are 
1) treatment-naive or 2) treatment experienced with no 
DRV RAMs, plasma HIV-I RNA <100,000 copies/ml, and 
CD4+ cell count >100x106 cells/l.” 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development 
of medicinal products for the treatment of HIVinfection 
(Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable 
pharmacokinetic data support robust dose 
recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  
Exposures with the once daily dose of 600/100 mg DRV/rtv 
as recommended for treatment-naïve children weighing 
≥15kg and <30kg are similar to the once daily regimen of 
800/100 mg DRV/rtv in adults and comparable to 
exposures with twice daily dosing as recommended in 
paediatric and adult patients. As such, safety and efficacy 
can be extrapolated. There seems no indication that higher 
exposures (i.e.  ≥10,000 to <15,000 ng/mL, or ≥15,000 
ng/mL) would result in an increase in adverse events, 
increased toxicity.  
The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not 
give rise to any new clinically relevant findings compared 
with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 infected

and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the 
presence of darunavir/ritonavir; this was attributed to the 
presence of low-dose ritonavir. Co-administration of 
darunavir/ritonavir and medicinal products which are 
primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 may result in increased 
plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which 
could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and 
adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and 
ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 may result in decreased systemic 
exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease

Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in

that darunavir pharmacokinetics are not significantly 
affected when darunavir/ritonavir is combined with

the darunavir levels were not affected indicating that the 
boosting effect of ritonavir was still maintained.  Darunavir

levels of carbamazepine which may lead to an increase in 
carbamazepine-related adverse events.  
Therefore, it was recommended that patients should be

exposure in rats aged 5-11 days is higher than in adult 
rats. After 23 days of age, it is comparable to adult rats. 
The high exposure at young age and the subsequent 
decrease in exposure from postnatal day 8 onwards is 
probably related to the maturation of the liver metabolising 
enzymes and the blood brain barrier. Data show further 
that it cannot be excluded that toxicity was higher in 
animals aged 5-11 days than in adult animals. In animals 
aged 23-50 days, toxicity was not higher than in adult 
animals. The presented preclinical results suggest that

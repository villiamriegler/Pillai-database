CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Eurartesim is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more. 
Consideration  should  be  given  to  official  guidance  on  the  appropriate  use  of  antimalarial  medicinal 
products,  including  information  on  the  prevalence  of  resistance  to  artenimol/piperaquine  in  the 
geographical region where the infection was acquired (see section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Eurartesim should be administered over three consecutive days for a total of three doses taken at the 
same time each day.

Tablet strength and number of tablets per dose 
½ x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet 
1 x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet 
1 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablet 
2 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets 
3 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets 
4 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets 
If a patient vomits within 30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose should be re-administered; 
if a patient vomits within 30-60 minutes, half the dose should be re-administered. Re-dosing with 
Eurartesim should not be attempted more than once. If the second dose is vomited, alternative 
antimalarial therapy should be instituted. 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen 
continued until the full course of treatment has been completed. 
There is no data on a second course of treatment. 
No more than two courses of Eurartesim may be given within a 12 month period (see sections 4.4 and 
5.3). 
A second course of Eurartesim should not be given within 2 months after the first course due to the 
long elimination half-life of piperaquine (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of Eurartesim did not include patients aged 65 years and over, therefore no dosing 
recommendation can be made. Considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in hepatic and 
renal function, as well as a potential for heart disorders (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), caution should be 
exercised when administering the product to the elderly. 
Hepatic and renal impairment  
Eurartesim has not been evaluated in subjects with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
Therefore, caution is advised when administering Eurartesim to these patients (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eurartesim in infants aged less than 6 months and in children weighing less 
than 5 kg has not been established. No data are available for these paediatric subsets. 
Method of administration 
Eurartesim should be taken orally with water and without food. 
Each dose should be taken no less than 3 hours after the last food intake. 
No food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose. 
For patients unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and young children, Eurartesim may be 
crushed and mixed with water. The mixture should be used immediately after preparation.

Recent treatment with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval that may still be 
circulating at the time that Eurartesim is commenced (e.g. mefloquine, halofantrine, 
lumefantrine, chloroquine, quinine and other antimalarial medicinal products) taking into 
account their elimination half-life. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Eurartesim should not be used to treat severe falciparum malaria (see section 4.3) and, due to 
insufficient data, should not be used to treat malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae 
or Plasmodium ovale. 
The long half-life of piperaquine (about 22 days) should be kept in mind in the event that another anti-
malarial agent is started due to treatment failure or a new malaria infection (see below and sections 4.3 
and 4.5). 
Piperaquine is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Caution is recommended when co-administering 
Eurartesim with medicinal products exhibiting variable patterns of inhibition, induction or competition 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for CYP3A4 as the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of some co-administered medicinal products could 
be altered.  
Piperaquine is also a substrate of CYP3A4. A moderate increase of piperaquine plasma concentrations 
(<2-fold) was observed when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in a potential 
exacerbation of the effect on QTc prolongation (see section 4.5).  
Exposure to piperaquine may also be increased when co-administered with mild or moderate 
CYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g. oral contraceptives). Therefore, caution should be applied when co-
administering Eurartesim with any CYP3A4-inhibitor and ECG monitoring should be considered. 
Due to the lack of multiple dose PK data for piperaquine, administration of any strong 
CYP3A4-inhibitors should be discouraged after initiation (i.e. the first dose) of Eurartesim (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable 
and effective antimalarials are available (see section 4.6). 
In the absence of carcinogenicity study data, and due to lack of clinical experience with repeated 
courses of treatment in humans, no more than two courses of Eurartesim should be given in a 
12-month period (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). 
Effects on cardiac repolarization 
In clinical trials with Eurartesim limited ECGs were obtained during treatment. These showed that 
QTc prolongation occurred more frequently and to a larger extent in association with Eurartesim 
therapy than with the comparators (see section 5.1 for details of the comparators). Analysis of cardiac 
adverse events in clinical trials showed that these were reported more frequently in Eurartesim treated 
patients than in those treated with comparator antimalarial (see section 4.8). Before the third dose of 
Eurartesim, in one of the two Phase III studies 3/767 patients (0.4%) were reported to have a QTcF 
value of  >500 ms versus none in the comparator group. 
The potential for Eurartesim to prolong the QTc interval was investigated in parallel groups of healthy 
volunteers who took each dose with high (~1000 Kcal) or low (~400 Kcal) fat/calorie meals or in 
fasting conditions. Compared to placebo, the maximum mean increases in QTcF on Day 3 of dosing 
with Eurartesim were 45.2, 35.5 and 21.0 msec under respective dosing conditions. The QTcF 
prolongation observed under fasting conditions lasted between 4 and 11 hours after the last dose was 
administered on Day 3. The mean QTcF prolongation compared to placebo decreased to 11.8 msec at 
24 hours and to 7.5 msec at 48 hours. No healthy subject dosed in fasting conditions showed a QTcF 
greater than 480 msec or an increase over baseline greater than 60 msec. The number of subjects with 
QTcF greater than 480 msec after dosing with low fat meals was 3/64, while 10/64 had QTcF values 
over this threshold after dosing with high fat meals. No subject had a QTcF value greater than 
500 msec in any of the dosing conditions. 
An ECG should be obtained as early as possible during treatment with Eurartesim and ECG 
monitoring should be applied in patients who may have a higher risk of developing arrhythmia in 
association with QTc prolongation (see below). 
When clinically appropriate, consideration should be given to obtaining an ECG from all patients 
before the last of the three daily doses is taken and approximately 4-6 hours after the last dose, since 
the risk of QTc interval prolongation may be greatest during this period (see section 5.2).  QTc 
intervals of more than 500 ms are associated with a pronounced risk for potentially life-threatening 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, ECG monitoring during the following 24-48 hours should be 
applied for patients found to have a prolongation to this extent. These patients should not receive 
another dose of Eurartesim and alternative antimalarial therapy should be instituted. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared to adult males, female patients and elderly patients have longer QTc intervals. Therefore, 
they may be more sensitive to the effects of QTc-prolonging medications such as Eurartesim so that 
special caution is required. 
Delayed Haemolytic Anaemia 
Delayed haemolytic anaemia has been observed up to one month following use of IV artesunate and 
oral artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) including reports involving Eurartesim. Risk 
factors may include young age (children under 5 years old) and previous treatment with IV artesunate. 
Patients and caregivers should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of post-treatment 
haemolysis such as pallor, jaundice, dark-coloured urine, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness 
and confusion. 
Paediatric population 
Special precaution is advised in young children when vomiting, as they are likely to develop 
electrolyte disturbances. These may increase the QTc-prolonging effect of Eurartesim (see 
section 4.3). 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Eurartesim has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency 
(see section 4.2). Due to the potential for higher plasma concentrations of piperaquine to occur, 
caution is advised if Eurartesim is administered to patients with jaundice and/or with moderate or 
severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, and ECG and blood potassium monitoring are advised. 
Geographical drug resistance 
Drug resistance patterns of P. falciparum may vary geographically. Increased resistance in 
P. falciparum against artemisinins and/or piperaquine has been reported, predominantly in South-East 
Asia. In the event of proven or suspected recrudescent malaria infections after treatment with 
artenimol/piperaquine patients should be treated with a different antimalarial. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Eurartesim is contraindicated in patients already taking other medicinal products that are known to 
prolong the QTc interval due to the risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction leading to an additive effect 
on the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
A limited number of drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction studies with Eurartesim have been 
performed in healthy adult subjects. Therefore the assessment of the potential for drug-drug 
interactions to occur is based on either in vivo or in vitro studies. 
Effect of Eurartesim on co-administered medicinal products 
Piperaquine is metabolised by, and is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. The concurrent administration of oral 
Eurartesim with 7.5 mg oral midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe substrate, led to a modest increase (≤2-fold) 
in midazolam and its metabolites exposures in healthy adult subjects. This inhibitory effect was no 
longer evident one week after last administration of Eurartesim. Therefore, particular attention should 
be paid when medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. antiretroviral medicinal 
products and cyclosporine) are co-administered with Eurartesim.  
From in vitro data, piperaquine undergoes a low level of metabolism by CYP2C19, and is also an 
inhibitor of this enzyme. There is the potential for reducing the rate of metabolism of other substrates 
of this enzyme, such as omeprazole, with consequent increase of their plasma concentration, and 
therefore, of their toxicity. 
Piperaquine has the potential to increase the rate of metabolism for CYP2E1 substrates resulting in a 
decrease in the plasma concentrations of substrates such as paracetamol or theophylline, and the 
anaesthetic gases enflurane, halothane and isoflurane. The main consequence of this interaction could 
be a reduction of efficacy of the co-administered medicinal products. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Artenimol administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, 
advised when Eurartesim is administered concomitantly with medicinal products metabolised by this 
enzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist 
beyond 24 hours after the last intake of artenimol.  
Effect of co-administered medicinal products on Eurartesim  
Piperaquine is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. The concurrent administration of a single dose of oral 
clarithromycin, (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor probe) with a single dose of oral Eurartesim led to a 
modest increase (≤2-fold) in piperaquine exposure in healthy adult subjects. This increase in exposure 
to the antimalarial combination may result in an exacerbation of the effect on QTc (see section 4.4). 
Therefore, particular caution is required if Eurartesim is administered to patients taking potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. some HIV-protease inhibitors atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, 
ritonavir], or verapamil and ECG monitoring should be considered due to the risk of higher plasma 
concentrations of piperaquine (see section 4.4). 
Enzyme inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to lead to reduced piperaquine plasma 
concentrations. The concentration of artenimol may also be reduced.  
When co-administered with efavirenz, the plasma concentration of piperaquine was decreased by 43%. 
Reduced plasma concentrations of piperaquine and/or artenimol may lead to therapeutic failure. 
Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
Drug-drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The extent of interactions in the 
paediatric population is not known. The above mentioned interactions for adults and the warnings in 
section 4.4 should be taken into account for the paediatric population. 
Oral contraceptives 
When co-administered to healthy women, Eurartesim exerted only a minimum  effect on an 
estrogen/progestinic combination oral contraceptive treatment increasing the ethynilestradiol rate of 
absorption (expressed by geometric mean Cmax) of about 28% but not significantly changing the 
exposure to ethynilestradiol and levonorgestrel and not influencing contraception activity as 
demonstrated by the similar plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing 
hormone (LH) and progesterone observed after oral contraceptive treatment with or without 
concomitant Eurartesim administration. 
Food interaction 
Absorption of piperaquine is increased in the presence of fatty food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) which 
may increase its effect on QTc interval. Therefore, Eurartesim should be taken with water only as 
described in section 4.2. Eurartesim should not be taken with grapefruit juice as it is likely to lead to 
increased piperaquine plasma concentrations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There  are  only  limited  (n=3)  amount  of  data  from  the  use  of  artenimol/piperaquine  during  the  1st 
trimester of pregnancy. 
Based on animal data, Eurartesim is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during 
the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.3).  Reproductive  studies  with  artemisinin 
derivatives have demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk during early gestation (see 
section 5.3). Piperaquine was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit.  
Therefore Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other 
suitable and effective anti-malarials are available (see section 4.4). 
A  large  amount  of  data  (more  than  3000  exposed  outcomes)  from  the  use  of  artenimol/piperaquine 
during  the  2nd  and  3rd  trimester  indicate  no  fetotoxicity.  In  perinatal  and  postnatal  studies  in  rats, 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
piperaquine  was  associated  with  delivery  complications.  However,  there  was  no  delay  in  neonatal 
development following exposure in utero or via milk (see section 5.3). 
Consequently,  if  Eurartesim  is  more  suitable  for  a  pregnant  woman  than  other  artemisinin-based 
combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3 trimester. 
Breast-feeding 
Animal data suggest excretion of piperaquine into breast milk but no data are available in humans. 
Women taking Eurartesim should not breast-feed during their treatment. 
Fertility 
There are no specific data relating to the effects of piperaquine on fertility, however, to date no 
adverse events have been reported during clinical use. Moreover, data obtained in animal studies show 
that fertility is unaffected by artenimol in both females and males. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse event data collected in clinical trials suggest that Eurartesim has no influence on the ability to 
drive and operate machines once the patient has recovered from the acute infection. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Eurartesim has been evaluated in two phase III open-label studies involving 
1,239 paediatric patients up to 18 years and 566 adult patients >18 years treated with Eurartesim. 
In a randomised trial in which 767 adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were 
exposed to Eurartesim, 25% of subjects were judged to have experienced an adverse drug reaction 
(ADR). No single type of ADR occurred at an incidence of ≥5%. The most frequent ADRs observed at 
an incidence ≥1.0% were: Headache (3.9%), Electrocardiogram QTc Prolonged (3.4%), P. falciparum 
infection (3.0%), Anaemia (2.8%), Eosinophilia (1.7%), Haemoglobin decreased (1.7%), Sinus 
tachycardia (1.7%), Asthenia (1.6%), Haematocrit [decreased] (1.6%), Pyrexia (1.5%), Red Blood 
Cell Count decreased (1.4%). A total of 6 (0.8%) subjects had serious ADRs in the study. 
In a second randomised trial, 1,038 children, aged between 6 months and 5 years, were exposed to 
Eurartesim and 71% were judged to have experienced an ADR. The following ADRs were observed at 
an incidence of ≥5.0%: Cough (32%), Pyrexia (22.4%), Influenza (16.0%), P. falciparum infection 
(14.1%), Diarrhoea (9.4%), Vomiting (5.5%) and Anorexia (5.2%). A total of 15 (1.5%) subjects had 
serious ADRs in the study. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the tables below, ADRs are listed under system organ class (SOC), and ranked by headings of 
frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness, using the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). The table in this section is for adult patients only. A 
corresponding table for paediatric patients is presented in the specific section below.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
The ADRs noted for Eurartesim were generally mild in severity, and the majority were non-serious. 
Reactions such as cough, pyrexia, headache, P. falciparum infection, anaemia, asthenia, anorexia and 
the observed changes in blood cell parameters are consistent with those expected in patients with acute 
malaria. The effect on prolongation of the QTc interval was observed on Day 2, and had resolved by 
Day 7 (the next time point at which ECGs were performed). 
Paediatric population 
A tabular overview of the frequency of the ADRs in paediatric patients is given below.  The majority

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical trials, nine patients received double the cumulative intended dose of Eurartesim. The safety 
profile of these patients did not differ from that of patients receiving the recommended dose, with no 
patient reporting SAEs. 
In cases of suspected overdose, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate, 
including ECG monitoring because of the possibility of QTc interval prolongation (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiprotozoals, antimalarials, artemisinin and derivatives, combinations, 
ATC code: P01BF05 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Artenimol is able to reach high concentrations within the parasitized erythrocytes. Its endoperoxide 
bridge is thought to be essential for its antimalarial activity, causing free-radical damage to parasite 
membrane systems including:  
• 
• 
• 
Inhibition of falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, 
Interference with mitochondrial electron transport 
Interference with parasite transport proteins 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Disruption of parasite mitochondrial function 
The exact mechanism of action of piperaquine is unknown, but it likely mirrors that of chloroquine, a 
close structural analogue. Chloroquine binds to toxic haeme (derived from the patient’s haemoglobin) 
within the malaria parasite, preventing its detoxification via a polymerisation step.  
Piperaquine is a bisquinoline, and this class has shown good antimalarial activity against chloroquine-
resistant Plasmodium strains in vitro. The bulky bisquinolone structure may be important for activity 
against chloroquine-resistant strains, and may act through the following mechanisms: 
• 
• 
Inhibition of the transporters that efflux chloroquine from the parasite food vacuole  
Inhibition of haem-digestion pathway in the parasite food vacuole. 
Resistance to piperaquine (when used as monotherapy) has been reported.  
The efficacy and safety of Eurartesim have been assessed in two large randomised, open-label clinical 
trials: 
Study DM040010 was conducted in Asian adult and paediatric patients with uncomplicated 
P. falciparum malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artesunate + Mefloquine (AS + MQ). 
The primary end-point was the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 63. 
Study DM040011 was conducted in African paediatric patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum 
malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artemether + Lumefantrine (A + L). The primary 
end-point was PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 28. 
The results for the primary endpoint in the modified intent to treat (m-ITT) populations (defined as all 
randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, with the exclusion of those 
patients lost to follow up for unknown reasons) were as follows:

In the European Safety Registry 25 patients weighing ≥ 100 kg (range 100 -121 kg) were treated with 4 
tablets 320/40 mg PQP/artenimol for 3 days. Twenty-two of these patients were shown to be parasitic 
free at the last microscopic analysis of the blood sample; three patients did not complete parasitological 
blood analysis. All patients were clinically cured. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic profiles of artenimol and piperaquine have been investigated in animal models and in 
different human populations (healthy volunteers, adult patients and paediatric patients). 
Absorption 
Artenimol is very rapidly absorbed, Tmax being approximately 1-2 hrs after single and multiple dosing. 
In patients, mean Cmax (CV %) and AUCINF of artenimol (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) 
were 752 (47%) ng/ml and 2,002 (45%) ng/ml*h, respectively. 
Artenimol bioavailability appears to be higher in malaria patients than in healthy volunteers, possibly 
because malaria per se has an effect on artenimol disposition. This may reflect malaria-associated 
impairment of hepatic function, causing an increase in artenimol bioavailability (reduction of first 
hepatic effect) without affecting its apparent elimination half-life, which is absorption rate limited. In 
healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions, mean Cmax and AUCINF of artenimol ranged between 
180-252 ng/ml and 516-684 ng/ml*h, respectively. 
The systemic exposure to artenimol was slightly lower following the last dose of Eurartesim (lower 
than after the first dose by up to 15%). Artenimol pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be 
similar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. artenimol systemic exposure on the last 
day of treatment was higher in females than in males, the difference being within 30%. 
In healthy volunteers, artenimol exposure was increased by 43% when administered with a high 
fat/high calorie meal.  
Piperaquine, a highly lipophilic compound, is slowly absorbed. In humans, piperaquine has a Tmax of 
approximately 5 hours following a single and repeated dose. In patients mean (CV %) Cmax and  
AUC0-24 (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) were 179 (62%) ng/ml and 1,679 (47%) ng/ml*h, 
respectively. Due to its slow elimination, piperaquine accumulates in plasma after multiple doses with 
an accumulation factor of approximately 3. Piperaquine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be 
similar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. On the other hand, on the last day of 
Eurtartesim treatment, the piperaquine maximum plasma concentration was higher in female than in 
male healthy volunteers, the difference being in the order of 30 to 50%. 
In healthy volunteers, piperaquine exposure is increased approximately 3-fold when administered with 
a high fat/high calorie meal. This pharmacokinetic effect is accompanied by an increased effect on 
prolongation of the QT interval. Accordingly, Eurartesim should be administered with water no less 
than 3 hours after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose  
(see section 4.2).

Distribution 
Both piperaquine and artenimol are highly bound to human plasma proteins: the protein binding 
observed in in vitro studies was 44-93% for artenimol and >99% for piperaquine. Moreover, from in 
vitro and in vivo data in animals, piperaquine and artenimol tend to accumulate in RBC. 
Artenimolwas observed to have a small volume of distribution in humans (0.8 l/kg; CV 35.5%).  
Pharmacokinetic parameters observed for piperaquine in humans indicate that this active substance has 
a large volume of distribution (730 l/kg; CV 37.5%). 
Biotransformation 
Artenimol is principally converted to α-artenimol-β-glucuronide (α-artenimol-G). Studies in human 
liver microsomes showed that artenimol was metabolised by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT1A9 and UGT2B7) to α-artenimol-G with no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. In vitro 
drug-drug interaction studies revealed that artenimol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, there is the 
potential for artenimol to increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (see section 4.5). 
In vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that piperaquine is metabolised by human hepatocytes 
(approximately 85% of piperaquine remained after 2 hours incubation at 37°C). Piperaquine was 
mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Piperaquine was 
found to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (also in a time-dependent way) and to a lesser extent of 
CYP2C19, while it stimulated the activity of CYP2E1.  
No effect on the metabolite profile of piperaquine in human hepatocytes was observed when 
piperaquine was co-incubated with artenimol. The piperaquine major metabolites were a carboxyl 
acid cleavage product, and a mono-N-oxidated product. 
In  human  studies,  piperaquine  was  found  to  be  a  mild  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme  while  potent 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity caused mild inhibition of piperaquine metabolism (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of artenimol is approximately 1 hour. The mean oral clearance for adult 
patients with malaria was 1.34 l/h/kg. The mean oral clearance was slightly higher for paediatric 
patients, however the differences were minor in magnitude (<20%). Artenimol is eliminated by 
metabolism (mainly glucuroconjugation). Its clearance was found to be slightly lower in female than 
in male healthy volunteers. Data regarding artenimol excretion in humans are scarce. However, it is 
reported in the literature that the excretion of unchanged active substance in human urine and faeces is 
negligible for artemisinin derivatives. 
The elimination half-life of piperaquine is around 22 days for adult patients and around 20 days for 
paediatric patients. The mean oral clearance for adult patients with malaria was 2.09 l/h/kg, while in 
paediatric patients was 2.43 l/h/kg. Due to its long elimination half-life, piperaquine accumulates after 
multiple dosing. 
Animal studies showed that radiolabelled piperaquine is excreted by the biliary route, while urinary 
excretion is negligible. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with hepatic or renal 
insufficiency, or in elderly people. 
In a paediatric pharmacokinetic study, and based on very limited sampling, minor differences were 
observed for artenimol pharmacokinetics between the paediatric and adult populations. The mean 
clearance (1.45 l/h/kg) was slightly faster in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients 
(1.34 l/h/kg), while the mean volume of distribution in the paediatric patients (0.705 l/kg) was lower 
than in the adults (0.801 l/kg). 
The same comparison showed that piperaquine absorption rate constant and terminal half-life in 
children were predominantly similar to those seen in adults. However, the apparent clearance was 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
faster (1.30 versus 1.14 l/h/kg) and the apparent total volume of distribution was lower in the 
paediatric population (623 versus 730 l/kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
General toxicity 
Literature data concerning chronic toxicity of piperaquine in dogs and monkeys indicate some 
hepatotoxicity and mild reversible depression of total white cell and neutrophil counts. 
The most important nonclinical safety findings after repeated dosing were the infiltration of 
macrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic granular material consistent with phospholipidosis and 
degenerative lesions in numerous organs and tissues. These adverse reactions were seen in animals at 
exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels, and with possible relevance to clinical use. It is not 
known whether these toxic effects are reversible. 
Artenimol and piperaquine were not genotoxic/clastogenic based on in vitro and in vivo testing. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. 
Artenimol causes embryolethality and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
Piperaquine did not induce malformation in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal and postnatal development 
study (segment III) in female rats treated with 80 mg/kg, some animals had a delay of delivery 
inducing mortality of the neonates. In females delivering normally the development, behaviour and 
growth of the surviving progeny was normal following exposure in utero or via milk. 
No reproduction toxicity studies have been performed with the combination of artenimol and 
piperaquine. 
Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity 
There is potential for neurotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in man and animals, which is strongly 
related to the dose, route and formulations of the different artenimol pro-drugs. In humans, the 
potential neurotoxicity of orally administered artenimol can be considered highly unlikely, given the 
rapid clearance ofartenimol, and its short exposure (3 days of treatment for malaria patients). There 
was no evidence of artenimol-induced lesions in the specific nuclei in rats or dogs, even at lethal dose. 
Cardiovascular toxicity 
Effects on blood pressure and on PR and QRS duration were observed at high piperaquine doses. The 
most important potential cardiac effect was related to cardiac conduction. 
In the hERG test, the IC50 was 0.15 µmol for piperaquine and 7.7 µmol forartenimol. The association 
of artenimol and piperaquine does not produce hERG inhibition greater than that of the single 
compounds. 
Phototoxicity  
There are no phototoxicity concerns with artenimol, as it does not absorb in the range of 290-700 nm.  
Piperaquine has an absorption maximum at 352 nm. Since piperaquine is present in the skin (about 9% 
in the non-pigmented rat and only 3% in the pigmented rat), slight phototoxic reactions (swelling and 
erythema) were observed 24 hours after oral treatment in mice exposed to UV radiation.

If a patient vomits within 30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose should be re-administered; 
if a patient vomits within 30-60 minutes, half the dose should be re-administered. Re-dosing with 
Eurartesim should not be attempted more than once. If the second dose is vomited, alternative 
antimalarial therapy should be instituted. 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen 
continued until the full course of treatment has been completed. 
There is no data on a second course of treatment. 
No more than two courses of Eurartesim may be given within a 12 month period (see sections 4.4 and 
5.3). 
A second course of Eurartesim should not be given within 2 months after the first course due to the 
long elimination half-life of piperaquine (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Special populations 
Elderly  
Clinical studies of Eurartesim did not include patients aged 65 years and over, therefore no dosing 
recommendation can be made. Considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in hepatic and 
renal function, as well as a potential for heart disorders (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), caution should be 
exercised when administering the product to the elderly. 
Hepatic and renal impairment  
Eurartesim has not been evaluated in subjects with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
Therefore, caution is advised when administering Eurartesim to these patients (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eurartesim in infants aged less than 6 months and in children weighing less 
than 5 kg has not been established. No data are available for these paediatric subsets. 
Method of administration 
Eurartesim should be taken orally with water and without food. 
Each dose should be taken no less than 3 hours after the last food intake. 
No food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and young children, Eurartesim may be 
crushed and mixed with water. The mixture should be used immediately after preparation.

circulating at the time that Eurartesim is commenced (e.g. mefloquine, halofantrine, 
lumefantrine, chloroquine, quinine and other antimalarial medicinal products) taking into 
account their elimination half-life. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Eurartesim should not be used to treat severe falciparum malaria (see section 4.3) and, due to 
insufficient data, should not be used to treat malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae 
or Plasmodium ovale. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The long half-life of piperaquine (about 22 days) should be kept in mind in the event that another anti-
malarial agent is started due to treatment failure or a new malaria infection (see below and sections 4.3 
and 4.5). 
Piperaquine is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Caution is recommended when co-administering 
Eurartesim with medicinal products exhibiting variable patterns of inhibition, induction or competition 
for CYP3A4 as the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of some co-administered medicinal products could 
be altered.  
Piperaquine is also a substrate of CYP3A4. A moderate increase of piperaquine plasma concentrations 
(<2-fold) was observed when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in a potential 
exacerbation of the effect on QTc prolongation (see section 4.5).  
Exposure to piperaquine may also be increased when co-administered with mild or moderate 
CYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g. oral contraceptives). Therefore, caution should be applied when 
co-administering Eurartesim with any CYP3A4-inhibitor and ECG monitoring should be considered. 
Due to the lack of multiple dose PK data for piperaquine, administration of any strong 
CYP3A4-inhibitors should be discouraged after initiation (i.e. the first dose) of Eurartesim (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable 
and effective antimalarials are available (see section 4.6). 
In the absence of carcinogenicity study data, and due to lack of clinical experience with repeated 
courses of treatment in humans, no more than two courses of Eurartesim should be given in a 
12-month period (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). 
Effects on cardiac repolarization 
In clinical trials with Eurartesim limited ECGs were obtained during treatment. These showed that 
QTc prolongation occurred more frequently and to a larger extent in association with Eurartesim 
therapy than with the comparators (see section 5.1 for details of the comparators). Analysis of cardiac 
adverse events in clinical trials showed that these were reported more frequently in Eurartesim treated 
patients than in those treated with comparator antimalarial (see section 4.8). Before the third dose of 
Eurartesim, in one of the two Phase III studies 3/767 patients (0.4%) were reported to have a QTcF 
value of >500 ms versus none in the comparator group. 
The potential for Eurartesim to prolong the QTc interval was investigated in parallel groups of healthy 
volunteers who took each dose with high (~1000 Kcal) or low (~400 Kcal) fat/calorie meals or in 
fasting conditions. Compared to placebo, the maximum mean increases in QTcF on Day 3 of dosing 
with Eurartesim were 45.2, 35.5 and 21.0 msec under respective dosing conditions. The QTcF 
prolongation observed under fasting conditions lasted between 4 and 11 hours after the last dose was 
administered on Day 3. The mean QTcF prolongation compared to placebo decreased to 11.8 msec at 
24 hours and to 7.5 msec at 48 hours. No healthy subject dosed in fasting conditions showed a QTcF 
greater than 480 msec or an increase over baseline greater than 60 msec. The number of subjects with 
QTcF greater than 480 msec after dosing with low fat meals was 3/64, while 10/64 had QTcF values 
over this threshold after dosing with high fat meals. No subject had a QTcF value greater than 
500 msec in any of the dosing conditions. 
An ECG should be obtained as early as possible during treatment with Eurartesim and ECG 
monitoring should be applied in patients who may have a higher risk of developing arrhythmia in 
association with QTc prolongation (see below).  
When clinically appropriate, consideration should be given to obtaining an ECG from all patients 
before the last of the three daily doses is taken and approximately 4-6 hours after the last dose, since 
the risk of QTc interval prolongation may be greatest during this period (see section 5.2).  QTc 
intervals of more than 500 ms are associated with a pronounced risk for potentially life-threatening 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, ECG monitoring during the following 24-48 hours should be 
applied for patients found to have a prolongation to this extent. These patients should not receive 
another dose of Eurartesim and alternative antimalarial therapy should be instituted.  
Compared to adult males, female patients and elderly patients have longer QTc intervals. Therefore, 
they may be more sensitive to the effects of QTc-prolonging medications such as Eurartesim so that 
special caution is required. 
Delayed Haemolytic Anaemia 
Delayed haemolytic anaemia has been observed up to one month following use of IV artesunate and 
oral artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) including reports involving Eurartesim. Risk 
factors may include young age (children under 5 years old) and previous treatment with IV artesunate. 
Patients and caregivers should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of post-treatment 
haemolysis such as pallor, jaundice, dark-coloured urine, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness 
and confusion. 
Paediatric population 
Special precaution is advised in young children when vomiting, as they are likely to develop 
electrolyte disturbances. These may increase the QTc-prolonging effect of Eurartesim (see section 
4.3). 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Eurartesim has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency 
(see section 4.2). Due to the potential for higher plasma concentrations of piperaquine to occur, 
caution is advised if Eurartesim is administered to patients with jaundice and/or with moderate or 
severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, and ECG and blood potassium monitoring are advised. 
Geographical drug resistance 
Drug resistance patterns of P. falciparum may vary geographically. Increased resistance in 
P. falciparum against artemisinins and/or piperaquine has been reported, predominantly in South-East 
Asia. In the event of proven or suspected recrudescent malaria infections after treatment with 
artenimol/piperaquine patients should be treated with a different antimalarial. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Eurartesim is contraindicated in patients already taking other medicinal products that are known to 
prolong the QTc interval due to the risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction leading to an additive effect 
on the QTc interval (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
A limited number of drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction studies with Eurartesim have been 
performed in healthy adult subjects. Therefore the assessment of the potential for drug-drug 
interactions to occur is based on either in vivo or in vitro studies. 
Effect of Eurartesim on co-administered medicinal products 
Piperaquine is metabolised by, and is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. The concurrent administration of oral 
Eurartesim with 7.5 mg oral midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe substrate, led to a modest increase (≤2-fold) 
in midazolam and its metabolites exposures in healthy adult subjects. This inhibitory effect was no 
longer evident one week after last administration of Eurartesim. Therefore, particular attention should 
be paid when medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. antiretroviral medicinal 
products and cyclosporine) are co-administered with Eurartesim.  
From in vitro data, piperaquine undergoes a low level of metabolism by CYP2C19, and is also an 
inhibitor of this enzyme. There is the potential for reducing the rate of metabolism of other substrates 
of this enzyme, such as omeprazole, with consequent increase of their plasma concentration, and 
therefore, of their toxicity. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Piperaquine has the potential to increase the rate of metabolism for CYP2E1 substrates resulting in a 
decrease in the plasma concentrations of substrates such as paracetamol or theophylline, and the 
anaesthetic gases enflurane, halothane and isoflurane. The main consequence of this interaction could 
be a reduction of efficacy of the co-administered medicinal products. 
Artenimol administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, 
advised when Eurartesim is administered concomitantly with medicinal products metabolised by this 
enzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist 
beyond 24 hours after the last intake of artenimol. 
Effect of co-administered medicinal products on Eurartesim  
Piperaquine is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. The concurrent administration of a single dose of oral 
clarithromycin, (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor probe) with a single dose of oral Eurartesim led to a 
modest increase (≤2-fold) in piperaquine exposure in healthy adult subjects. This increase in exposure 
to the antimalarial combination may result in an exacerbation of the effect on QTc (see section 4.4). 
Therefore, particular caution is required if Eurartesim is administered to patients taking potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. some HIV-protease inhibitors atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, 
ritonavir], or verapamil and ECG monitoring should be considered due to the risk of higher plasma 
concentrations of piperaquine (see section 4.4).  
Enzyme inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to lead to reduced piperaquine plasma 
concentrations. The concentration of artenimol may also be reduced.  
When co-administered with efavirenz, the plasma concentration of piperaquine was decreased by 43%. 
Reduced plasma concentrations of piperaquine and/or artenimol may lead to therapeutic failure. 
Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products is not recommended.  
Paediatric population 
Drug-drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The extent of interactions in the 
paediatric population is not known. The above mentioned interactions for adults and the warnings in 
section 4.4 should be taken into account for the paediatric population. 
Oral contraceptives 
When  co-administered  to  healthy  women,  Eurartesim  exerted  only  a  minimum  effect  on  an 
estrogen/progestinic  combination  oral  contraceptive  treatment  increasing  the  ethynilestradiol  rate  of 
absorption  (expressed  by  geometric  mean  Cmax)  of  about  28%  but  not  significantly  changing  the 
exposure  to  ethynilestradiol  and  levonorgestrel  and  not  influencing  contraception  activity  as 
demonstrated by the similar plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing 
hormone (LH) and progesterone observed after oral contraceptive treatment with or without concomitant 
Eurartesim administration. 
Food interaction 
Absorption of piperaquine is increased in the presence of fatty food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) which 
may increase its effect on QTc interval. Therefore, Eurartesim should be taken with water only as 
described in section 4.2. Eurartesim should not be taken with grapefruit juice as it is likely to lead to 
increased piperaquine plasma concentrations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There  are  only  limited  (n=3)  amount  of  data  from  the  use  of  artenimol/piperaquine  during  the  1st 
trimester of pregnancy. 
Based on animal data, Eurartesim is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during 
the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.3).  Reproductive  studies  with  artemisinin 
derivatives have demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk during early gestation (see 
section 5.3). Piperaquine was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit.  
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other 
suitable and effective anti-malarials are available (see section 4.4). 
A  large  amount  of  data  (more  than  3000  exposed  outcomes)  from  the  use  of  artenimol/piperaquine 
during  the  2nd  and  3rd  trimester  indicate  no  fetotoxicity.  In  perinatal  and  postnatal  studies  in  rats, 
piperaquine  was  associated  with  delivery  complications.  However,  there  was  no  delay  in  neonatal 
development following exposure in utero or via milk (see section 5.3). 
Consequently,  if  Eurartesim  is  more  suitable  for  a  pregnant  woman  than  other  artemisinin-based 
combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. 
Breast-feeding 
Animal data suggest excretion of piperaquine into breast milk but no data are available in humans. 
Women taking Eurartesim should not breast-feed during their treatment. 
Fertility 
There are no specific data relating to the effects of piperaquine on fertility, however, to date no 
adverse events have been reported during clinical use. Moreover, data obtained in animal studies show 
that fertility is unaffected by artenimol in both females and males. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse event data collected in clinical trials suggest that Eurartesim has no influence on the ability to 
drive and operate machines once the patient has recovered from the acute infection. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Eurartesim has been evaluated in two phase III open-label studies involving 
1,239 paediatric patients up to 18 years and 566 adult patients >18 years treated with Eurartesim. 
In a randomised trial in which 767 adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were 
exposed to Eurartesim, 25% of subjects were judged to have experienced an adverse drug reaction 
(ADR). No single type of ADR occurred at an incidence of ≥5%. The most frequent ADRs observed at 
an incidence ≥1.0% were: Headache (3.9%), Electrocardiogram QTc Prolonged (3.4%), P.  falciparum 
infection (3.0%), Anaemia (2.8%), Eosinophilia (1.7%), Haemoglobin decreased (1.7%), Sinus 
tachycardia (1.7%), Asthenia (1.6%), Haematocrit [decreased] (1.6%), Pyrexia (1.5%), Red Blood 
Cell Count decreased (1.4%). A total of 6 (0.8%) subjects had serious ADRs in the study. 
In a second randomised trial, 1,038 children, aged between 6 months and 5 years, were exposed to 
Eurartesim and 71% were judged to have experienced an ADR. The following ADRs were observed at 
an incidence of ≥5.0%: Cough (32%), Pyrexia (22.4%), Influenza (16.0%), P. falciparum infection 
(14.1%), Diarrhoea (9.4%), Vomiting (5.5%) and Anorexia (5.2%). A total of 15 (1.5%) subjects had 
serious ADRs in the study. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the tables below, ADRs are listed under system organ class (SOC), and ranked by headings of 
frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness, using the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). The table in this section is for adult patients only. A 
corresponding table for paediatric patients is presented in the specific section below.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
The ADRs noted for Eurartesim were generally mild in severity, and the majority were non-serious. 
Reactions such as cough, pyrexia, headache, P. falciparum infection, anaemia, asthenia, anorexia and 
the observed changes in blood cell parameters are consistent with those expected in patients with acute 
malaria. The effect on prolongation of the QTc interval was observed on Day 2, and had resolved by 
Day 7 (the next time point at which ECGs were performed).  
Paediatric population 
A tabular overview of the frequency of the ADRs in paediatric patients is given below.  The majority

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical trials, nine patients received double the cumulative intended dose of Eurartesim. The safety 
profile of these patients did not differ from that of patients receiving the recommended dose, with no 
patient reporting SAEs.  
In cases of suspected overdose, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate, 
including ECG monitoring because of the possibility of QTc interval prolongation (see section 4.4)

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiprotozoals, antimalarials, Artemisinin and derivatives, combinations, 
ATC code: P01BF05. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Artenimol is able to reach high concentrations within the parasitized erythrocytes. Its endoperoxide 
bridge is thought to be essential for its antimalarial activity, causing free-radical damage to parasite 
membrane systems including:  
• 
• 
• 
Inhibition of falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, 
Interference with mitochondrial electron transport 
Interference with parasite transport proteins 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Disruption of parasite mitochondrial function 
The exact mechanism of action of piperaquine is unknown, but it likely mirrors that of chloroquine, a 
close structural analogue. Chloroquine binds to toxic haeme (derived from the patient’s haemoglobin) 
within the malaria parasite, preventing its detoxification via a polymerisation step.  
Piperaquine is a bisquinoline, and this class has shown good antimalarial activity against chloroquine-
resistant Plasmodium strains in vitro. The bulky bisquinolone structure may be important for activity 
against chloroquine- resistant strains, and may act through the following mechanisms: 
• 
• 
Inhibition of the transporters that efflux chloroquine from the parasite food vacuole  
Inhibition of haem-digestion pathway in the parasite food vacuole. 
Resistance to piperaquine (when used as monotherapy) has been reported.  
The efficacy and safety of Eurartesim have been assessed in two large randomised, open-label clinical 
trials: 
Study DM040010 was conducted in Asian adult and paediatric patients with uncomplicated 
P. falciparum malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artesunate + Mefloquine (AS + MQ). 
The primary end-point was the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 63. 
Study DM040011 was conducted in African paediatric patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum 
malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artemether + Lumefantrine (A + L). The primary 
end-point was PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 28. 
The results for the primary endpoint in the modified intent to treat (m-ITT) populations (defined as all 
randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, with the exclusion of those 
patients lost to follow up for unknown reasons) were as follows:

In the European Safety Registry 25 patients weighing ≥ 100 kg (range 100 -121 kg) were treated with 4 
tablets 320/40 mg PQP/artenimol for 3 days. Twenty-two of these patients were shown to be parasitic 
free at the last microscopic analysis of the blood sample; three patients did not complete parasitological 
blood analysis. All patients were clinically cured. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Pharmacokinetic profiles of artenimol and piperaquine have been investigated in animal models and in 
different human populations (healthy volunteers, adult patients and paediatric patients). 
Absorption 
Artenimol is very rapidly absorbed, Tmax being approximately 1-2 hrs after single and multiple dosing. 
In patients, mean Cmax (CV%) and AUCINF of artenimol (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) 
were 752 (47%) ng/ml and 2,002 (45 %) ng/ml*h, respectively. 
Artenimol bioavailability appears to be higher in malaria patients than in healthy volunteers, possibly 
because malaria per se has an effect on artenimol disposition. This may reflect malaria-associated 
impairment of hepatic function, causing an increase in artenimol bioavailability (reduction of first 
hepatic effect) without affecting its apparent elimination half-life, which is absorption rate limited. In 
healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions, mean Cmax and AUCINF of artenimol ranged between 
180-252 ng/ml and 516-684 ng/ml*h, respectively. 
The systemic exposure to artenimol was slightly lower following the last dose of Eurartesim (lower 
than after the first dose by up to 15%). Artenimol pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be 
similar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. artenimol systemic exposure on the last 
day of treatment was higher in females than in males, the difference being within 30%. 
In healthy volunteers, artenimol exposure was increased by 43% when administered with a high 
fat/high calorie meal.  
Piperaquine, a highly lipophilic compound, is slowly absorbed. In humans, piperaquine has a Tmax of 
approximately 5 hours following a single and repeated dose. In patients mean (CV%) Cmax and  
AUC0-24 (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) were 179 (62%) ng/ml and 1,679 (47%) ng/ml*h, 
respectively. Due to its slow elimination, piperaquine accumulates in plasma after multiple doses with 
an accumulation factor of approximately 3. Piperaquine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be 
similar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. On the other hand, on the last day of 
Eurtartesim treatment, the piperaquine maximum plasma concentration was higher in female than in 
male healthy volunteers, the difference being in the order of 30 to 50%. 
In healthy volunteers, piperaquine exposure is increased approximately 3-fold when administered with 
a high fat/high calorie meal. This pharmacokinetic effect is accompanied by an increased effect on 
prolongation of the QT interval. Accordingly, Eurartesim should be administered with water no less 
than 3 hours after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose  
(see section 4.2). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Both piperaquine and artenimol are highly bound to human plasma proteins: the protein binding 
observed in in vitro studies was 44-93% for artenimol and >99% for piperaquine. Moreover, from 
in vitro and in vivo data in animals, piperaquine and artenimol tend to accumulate in RBC. 
Artenimol was observed to have a small volume of distribution in humans (0.8 l/kg; CV 35.5%).  
Pharmacokinetic parameters observed for piperaquine in humans indicate that this active substance has 
a large volume of distribution (730 l/kg; CV 37.5%). 
Biotransformation 
Artenimol is principally converted to α- artenimol-β-glucuronide (α- artenimol-G). Studies in human 
liver microsomes showed that artenimol was metabolised by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT1A9 and UGT2B7) to α- artenimol-G with no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. In vitro 
drug-drug interaction studies revealed that artenimol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, there is the 
potential for artenimol to increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (see section 4.5). 
In vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that piperaquine is metabolised by human hepatocytes 
(approximately 85% of piperaquine remained after 2 hours incubation at 37°C). Piperaquine was 
mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Piperaquine was 
found to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (also in a time-dependent way) and to a lesser extent of 
CYP2C19, while it stimulated the activity of CYP2E1.  
No effect on the metabolite profile of piperaquine in human hepatocytes was observed when 
piperaquine was co-incubated with artenimol. The piperaquine major metabolites were a carboxyl 
acid cleavage product, and a mono-N-oxidated product. 
In  human  studies,  piperaquine  was  found  to  be  a  mild  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme  while  potent 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity caused mild inhibition of piperaquine metabolism (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of artenimol is approximately 1 hour. The mean oral clearance for adult 
patients with malaria was 1.34 l/h/kg. The mean oral clearance was slightly higher for paediatric 
patients, however the differences were minor in magnitude (<20%). artenimol is eliminated by 
metabolism (mainly glucuroconjugation). Its clearance was found to be slightly lower in female than 
in male healthy volunteers. Data regarding artenimol excretion in humans are scarce. However, it is 
reported in the literature that the excretion of unchanged active substance in human urine and faeces is 
negligible for artemisinin derivatives.  
The elimination half-life of piperaquine is around 22 days for adult patients and around 20 days for 
paediatric patients. The mean oral clearance for adult patients with malaria was 2.09 l/h/kg, while in 
paediatric patients was 2.43 l/h/kg. Due to its long elimination half-life, piperaquine accumulates after 
multiple dosing. 
Animal studies showed that radiolabelled piperaquine is excreted by the biliary route, while urinary 
excretion is negligible.  
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with hepatic or renal 
insufficiency, or in elderly people.  
In a paediatric pharmacokinetic study, and based on very limited sampling, minor differences were 
observed for artenimol pharmacokinetics between the paediatric and adult populations. The mean 
clearance (1.45 l/h/kg) was slightly faster in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients 
(1.34 l/h/kg), while the mean volume of distribution in the paediatric patients (0.705 l/kg) was lower 
than in the adults (0.801 l/kg).   
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The same comparison showed that piperaquine absorption rate constant and terminal half-life in 
children were predominantly similar to those seen in adults. However, the apparent clearance was 
faster (1.30 versus 1.14 l/h/kg) and the apparent total volume of distribution was lower in the 
paediatric population (623 versus 730 l/kg).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
General toxicity 
Literature data concerning chronic toxicity of piperaquine in dogs and monkeys indicate some 
hepatotoxicity and mild reversible depression of total white cell and neutrophil counts. 
The most important nonclinical safety findings after repeated dosing were the infiltration of 
macrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic granular material consistent with phospholipidosis and 
degenerative lesions in numerous organs and tissues. These adverse reactions were seen in animals at 
exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels, and with possible relevance to clinical use. It is not 
known whether these toxic effects are reversible. 
Artenimol and piperaquine were not genotoxic/clastogenic based on in vitro and in vivo testing. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. 
Artenimol causes embryolethality and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
Piperaquine did not induce malformation in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal and postnatal development 
study (segment III) in female rats treated with 80 mg/kg, some animals had a delay of delivery 
inducing mortality of the neonates. In females delivering normally the development, behaviour and 
growth of the surviving progeny was normal following exposure in utero or via milk. 
No reproduction toxicity studies have been performed with the combination of artenimol and 
piperaquine. 
Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity 
There is potential for neurotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in man and animals, which is strongly 
related to the dose, route and formulations of the different artenimol pro-drugs. In humans, the 
potential neurotoxicity of orally administered artenimol can be considered highly unlikely, given the 
rapid clearance ofartenimol, and its short exposure (3 days of treatment for malaria patients). There 
was no evidence of artenimol-induced lesions in the specific nuclei in rats or dogs, even at lethal dose. 
Cardiovascular toxicity 
Effects on blood pressure and on PR and QRS duration were observed at high piperaquine doses. The 
most important potential cardiac effect was related to cardiac conduction. 
In the hERG test, the IC50 was 0.15 µmol for piperaquine and 7.7 µmol forartenimol. The association 
of artenimol and piperaquine does not produce hERG inhibition greater than that of the single 
compounds. 
Phototoxicity  
There are no phototoxicity concerns withartenimol, as it does not absorb in the range of 290-700 nm.  
Piperaquine has an absorption maximum at 352 nm. Since piperaquine is present in the skin (about 9% 
in the non-pigmented rat and only 3% in the pigmented rat), slight phototoxic reactions (swelling and 
erythema) were observed 24 hours after oral treatment in mice exposed to UV radiation.

updates of the RMP. 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
− 
−  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to prescribe or 
use Eurartesim are provided with a healthcare profession educational pack containing the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
The Patient Information Leaflet 
The  Physician  Leaflet  including  the  Contraindicated  Conditions  of  Use  and  Contraindicated 
Concomitant Medication checklist 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The Physician Leaflet should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
That Eurartesim has a potential to prolong the QTc interval that may lead to potentially lethal 
arrhythmias.  
That piperaquine absorption is increased in the presence of food, therefore to reduce this risk of 
QTc interval prolongation, the patients should be advised to take the tablets with water, without 
food, no less than three hours after the last food intake.  No food should be taken within 3 hours 
after each dose. 
That Eurartesim is contraindicated in patients with severe malaria according to WHO definition 
and in patients with a history of clinical conditions that may lead to QTc interval prolongation, 
and in patients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. 
The ECG monitoring recommendations. 
The scope and use of the Contraindicated Conditions of Use and Contraindicated Concomitant 
Medication checklist 
That there is a potential risk of teratogenicity and so Eurartesim should not be used in the 1st 
trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable and effective anti-malarials are 
available. 
The need to counsel patients on important risks associated with Eurartesim therapy and 
appropriate precautions when using the medicine.  
That patients should be advised to contact their doctor about adverse events and that 
physicians/pharmacists should report suspected adverse reactions to Eurartesim, and in 
particular, those associated with a QT prolongation.

Eurartesim with food and drink 
You should take the Eurartesim tablets with water only. 
You should not take Eurartesim with grapefruit juice due to possible interactions. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, think you may be pregnant or become 
pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. Based on animal data Eurartesim is suspected to harm the 
unborn child when used during the first three months of pregnancy. Therefore Eurartesim must not be 
used in the 1st trimester of pregnancy if your doctor can give you an alternative medicine. If you find 
out that you are pregnant within one month from taking Eurartesim, please inform your doctor. The 
exposure of pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimester was not associated with any harm of the 
unborn child. If Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-based 
combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. 
You should not breast-feed your baby while taking this medicine because the medicine may pass 
through breast milk to your baby. 
If you are taking folate supplements to prevent possible neural tube birth defects, you can continue 
taking them at the same time as Eurartesim. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine during pregnancy or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
You can drive or use machines after taking Eurartesim once you have recovered from your illness. 
3.  How to take Eurartesim 
Always take Eurartesim exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
You or your child should take this medicine on an empty stomach. You or your child should take each 
dose no less than 3 hours after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 hours after 
each dose of Eurartesim. You or your child can drink water at any time. 
If the tablets are difficult to swallow, you can crush  and mix them with water; drink the mixture 
immediately. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
A course of Eurartesim lasts 3 consecutive days. Take one dose on each day. You should try to take 
the dose at about the same time on each of the three days. 
The daily dose depends on the patient’s body weight. Your doctor should have prescribed a dose that 
is appropriate for your weight or your child’s weight as follows: 
Body weight 
(kg) 
Daily dose (mg) 
Total number of tablets for 
treatment  
5 to less than 7 
Half 160 mg/20 mg  tablet a day 
7 to less than 13

3 tablets 
3 tablets 
6 tablets 
9 tablets 
12 tablets 
Vomiting when taking this medicine 
If this happens within: 
• 
• 
If you or your child vomit also the second dose, do not take or give your child another dose. Contact 
your doctor urgently to obtain an alternative treatment for malaria. 
30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose must be taken again. 
31-60 minutes, half the dose must be taken again. 
Taking this medicine, if the malaria infection returns  
• 
If you or your child gets another attack of malaria, you may take a second course of Eurartesim 
within one year if your doctor thinks this is a suitable treatment. You or your child must not take 
more than two courses within one year. If this happens, talk to your doctor. You or your child 
should not take a second course of Eurartesim within 2 months of the first course. 
If you or your child is infected more than twice in a year, your doctor will prescribe an 
alternative treatment. 
• 
If you or your child takes more Eurartesim tablets than you should 
If you or your child takes more than the recommended dose, tell your doctor. Your doctor may suggest 
special monitoring for you or your child because doses higher than those recommended may have an 
unwanted, severe effect on the heart (see also section 4). 
If you or your child forgets to take Eurartesim 
If you or your child forgets to take the second dose of Eurartesim at the right time, take it as soon as 
you remember. Then take the third (last) dose approximately 24 hours after the second dose. 
If you or your child forgets to take the third (last) dose at the right time, take it as soon as you 
remember. Never take more than one dose on the same day to make up for a missed dose. 
Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
If you or your child stops taking Eurartesim 
For the medicine to work effectively, you or your child should take the tablets as instructed and should 
complete the 3 days course of treatment.  If you or your child is not able to do this, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of 
the side effects are not severe and normally disappear within a few days or weeks after treatment.  
If you or your child gets a rash, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat with difficulty in 
swallowing or breathing, these may be signs of an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor immediately, or 
go immediately to the emergency department of your nearest hospital, taking this leaflet with you. 
A heart problem, called QT prolongation, can occur while taking Eurartesim and for some days after 
taking the last dose. This can cause a life-threatening abnormality of the heart rhythm. 
Your doctor may take electrical recordings of the heart (electrocardiogram, ECG) while you or 
your child is being treated and after the last dose is given. Your doctor will advise you when 
these readings will be taken.  
If you notice anything different about your or your child’s heart rhythm or have symptoms 
(such as palpitations or irregular heart beat) you should contact your doctor as soon as possible 
and before the next dose is due.  
Sometimes a problem with your red blood cells, called haemolytic anaemia can occur after receiving 
malaria treatment. Contact your doctor immediately if you or your child develops one or more of the 
following symptoms after treatment with Eurartesim: pale skin, general weakness, headache, shortness 
of breath and rapid heartbeat; particularly with exercise, confusion, dizziness, or dark-coloured urine.

Eurartesim with food and drink 
You should take the Eurartesim tablets with water only. 
You should not take Eurartesim with grapefruit juice due to possible interactions. 
Pregnancy and  breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, think you may be pregnant or become 
pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. Based on animal data Eurartesim is suspected to harm the 
unborn child when used during the first three months of pregnancy. Therefore Eurartesim must not be 
used in the 1st trimester of pregnancy if your doctor can give you an alternative medicine. If you find 
out that you are pregnant within one month from taking Eurartesim, please inform your doctor. The 
exposure of pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimester was not associated with any harm of the 
unborn child. If Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-based 
combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. 
You should not breast-feed your baby while taking this medicine because the medicine may pass 
through breast milk to your baby. 
If you are taking folate supplements to prevent possible neural tube birth defects, you can continue 
taking them at the same time as Eurartesim. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine during pregnancy or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
You can drive or use machines after taking Eurartesim once you have recovered from your illness.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) 
ANNEX IV

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for artenimol / piperaquine 
tetraphosphate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on hepatocellular injury from spontaneous reports in adults including in 
some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate and hepatocellular injury is at least a 
reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing artenimol / 
piperaquine tetraphosphate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

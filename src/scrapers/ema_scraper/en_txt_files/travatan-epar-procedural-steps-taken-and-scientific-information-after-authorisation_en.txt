(EMEA/H/C/390/II/06),  Alcon committed 
to complete a long-term clinical study (C-
02-20, of a 5-year duration). The Report 
for this study was completed and 
submitted in December 2009 (FUM 023). 
The CHMP assessment of the Report was 
completed in March 2010, and concluded 
that no safety issues of concern resulted 
from this study.  
In the light of the new available data on 
safety, the MAH reviewed the SPC  to 
update section 4.8 with the informa tion 
emerging from the completion and 
assessment of study C-02-20. As result 
of this update, the occurrence of the 
term 'iris hyperpigmentation' was 
changed to the 'very  common' range. 
Several new Adverse Drug Reactions 
were added to the SPC  with frequency 
categorised as uncommon. 
The PL text was also updated to be in line 
with the SPC.

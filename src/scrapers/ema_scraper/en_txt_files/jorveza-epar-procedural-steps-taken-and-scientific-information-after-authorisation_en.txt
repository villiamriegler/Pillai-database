are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
The applicant has submitted the final study report of study 
the list of adverse reactions based on final results 
from the long-term maintenance study BUL-2/EER; 
this is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, phase III study on the efficacy and 
tolerability of a 48-week treatment with two different 
doses of budesonide effervescent tablets vs. placebo 
for maintenance of clinico-pathological remission in 
adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of 
local representatives in the Package Leaflet. The RMP 
version 3.0 has also been submitted. The MAH also 
submitted the final report of study BUL-6/BIO, which 
was previously assessed within the scope of 
extension EMEA/H/C/004655/X/0007/G as 
applicant’s response to CHMP Day 120 List of 
Questions. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
BUL-2/EER and evaluated the safety of the different phases 
of the trial separately. 
Overall, the conclusions of the applicant that the nature 
and frequency of AEs over time, during the overall 3-year 
observation period is consistent with the known safety 
profile of the previous data submitted (mainly the OLI and 
DB phases of the trial) has been demonstrated in adequate 
manner. As already previously demonstrated, the main 
safety concern with the compound relates to the occurrence 
of local fungal infections in the oral cavity, the laryngeal 
and pharyngeal regions, as well as the oesophagus. Most of 
the other events observed relate to known events for the 
substance budesonide, which, however, do not seem to 
occur at increased frequency or severity in the patients 
with EoE with the formulation under evaluation. 
The applicant has, however, identified a couple of adverse 
effects/adverse drug reactions, which are – based on the 
results of the final study report of study BUL-2/EER – 
proposed to be included into the prescribing information for 
the product in addition, or with a higher frequency than 
previously assigned. 
The conclusion to add several identified ADRs into the 
prescribing information is overall supported, and adequate 
frequency of these events has been assigned. 
Overall, it can be concluded that the treatment with 
Jorveza at daily doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg has been 
Page 2/6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
demonstrated to have an acceptable safety profile also in 
long-term treatment beyond one year, and that this safety 
profile is not relevantly differing from the safety profile 
identified in short-term treatment or long-term treatment 
up to one year. 
The risk-benefit ratio of the compound remains positive.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Jorveza in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Only editorial changes to the Product Information are 
requested at the time of renewal.

of remission for Jorveza (0.5 mg and 1 mg 
orodispersible tablets); as a consequence, sections 
4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to 
reflect the recommended daily dose and duration of 
treatment of Jorveza for the maintenance of 
remission, to update the list of adverse reactions and 
the clinical efficacy and safety information based on 
the results of the phase III clinical study BUL-2/EER. 
The relevant sections of the package leaflet are 
updated accordingly. In addition, a revised RMP 
(version 2.1) has been submitted to reflect the 
results of this study and to align with the GVP 
Module V (rev 2) template. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to bring the product information in line 
with the latest QRD template (version 10.1).

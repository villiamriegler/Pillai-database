1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Takeda Pharma A/S submitted on 7 March 2019 extensions of the marketing authorisation. 
Extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection), associated with a 
new strength (108 mg) and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use).  
The MAH applied for the following indications for Entyvio to be treated with the new strength 
associated with the new pharmaceutical form and route of administration:  
Ulcerative colitis 
Entyvio  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  moderately  to  severely  active  ulcerative 
colitis  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  with,  lost  response  to,  or  were  intolerant  to  either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. 
Crohn’s disease 
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease 
who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (2) points (c) (d) (e) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0109/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
Crohn’s disease (CD) (EMEA-000645-PIP01-09).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (EMEA-000645-PIP01-09) was not yet completed 
as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects 1.4 million of people in the United States and 2.2 million of 
people in Europe, and its peak onset is in persons 15 to 30 years of age. IBD is comprised of 2 major 
disorders: UC and CD. These disorders have both distinct and overlapping pathologic and clinical 
characteristics. UC is characterized by relapsing and remitting episodes of inflammation limited to the 
mucosal layer of the colon. CD can involve any component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the 
oral cavity to the anus and is characterized by transmural inflammation.  
UC affects approximately 50 to 100 of every 100,000 people, corresponding to a prevalence of 
150,000 to 300,000 people. The prevalence of CD is approximately 150/100,000 of the US population, 
approximately 125/100,000 of the population in Western Europe, and 21.2/100,000 of the population 
in Japan. Most patients with UC or CD are diagnosed in their teens or in young adulthood. Morbidity is 
significant in both UC and CD and has a debilitating impact on the quality of life of this relatively young 
patient population. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features / Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a set of chronic, relapsing inflammatory diseases of the intestine. 
IBDs comprise two types of intestinal disorders:  ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), 
which are clinically distinguished by intestinal localization, local features of inflammation, profile of 
complications and familial aggregation. Both UC and CD are considered urbanized Western lifestyle 
associated diseases of unknown aetiology, despite the accumulating evidences suggest that these 
pathologies result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors that ultimately promote an 
excessive and poorly controlled mucosal immune response that is directed against a component of the 
normal flora. 
Intestinal immune system has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Both Innate and adaptive 
immune system are implicated in the development of the aberrant immune response that lead to the 
intestinal tissue damaging. In healthy subjects the immune response to the vast number of dietary and 
microbial antigens present in the lumen, is typically non-inflammatory, favouring a state of immune 
hypo-responsiveness. This adaptation is crucial for the maintenance of health. In mammals, intestinal 
homeostasis is controlled by the interplay between the epithelial cells and immune cells and this 
adjusts the host response to the daily charge of antigens derived from the microbiota and food 
proteins. Otherwise when an infection mediated by pathogen occurs, the immune response become 
inflammatory.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
UC involves the rectum and may affect part of the colon or the entire colon in an uninterrupted pattern 
(pancolitis) while CD generally involves the ileum and the colon, but it can affect any region of the 
intestine, often discontinuously. Since IBD are chronic diseases, patients will go through periods in 
which the disease flares up and causes symptoms. These periods may be followed by remission, in 
which symptoms disappear or decrease. Patients are often afflicted by abdominal cramps and pain, 
bloody diarrhea, severe urgency to have a bowel movement, lack of appetite, weight loss and anaemia 
due to the intestinal bleeding. Moreover, patients with IBD could develop some extra-intestinal 
manifestation such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. Further 
clinical complications in CD may include the development of fistulae and perianal diseases or the 
formation of strictures and obstructions, whereas the most serious complication of UC is an acute non-
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 9/93 
 
  
 
 
obstructive dilatation of the colon called “toxic mega-colon”. Moreover, both UC and CD patients have 
increased risk of developing colon cancer. 
The recognition of luminal antigens is particularly mediated by dendritic cells (DCs), a specialized class 
of antigen presenting cells (APCs) that orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs 
migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present antigen to T cells, 
leading to the activation of T cells. These latter express T cell receptor (TCR), and can be divided into 
two major sub-groups, T helper (Th) expressing CD4, and T cytotoxic (Tc) expressing CD8. CD4+ T 
cells become activated when they encounter DC that express antigen bound to MHC class II. Once 
activated, they divide rapidly and secrete cytokines that regulate the active immune response. 
Activated CD4+ T cells can differentiate into one of several subtypes, including Th1, Th2, Th17, T 
regulatory (Treg) or T follicular helper (TFH), which secrete different cytokines to facilitate a different 
type of immune response. CD8+ T cells recognize antigen in the context of MHC CLASS i and normally 
have a major role in the destruction of tumour and viral-infected cells and have been implicated as 
pathogenic cell type in autoimmune diseases.  
In IBD CD4+ T cells play a major role in the activation/regulation of the inflammatory response. For 
many years, it has been assumed that CD is mainly mediated by Th1 cells, while UC is a Th2-like type 
of inflammation. This has been supported by increased levels of Th1 cytokines such as Interferon (IFN) 
alpha and interleukin (IL-) 12 in CD and increased expression of Th2 related cytokines such as IL-13 
and IL-4 in UC. Th1 cells have a major role in the protection against intracellular microbes, while Th2 
cells are involved in the allergic responses and in the protection against extracellular parasites. 
Development of both Th1 and Th2 cells subsets are controlled by certain transcription factors such as T 
box expressed in T cells (T-bet) and signal transducer and activator transcription factor (STAT) 4 in 
Th1 cells, and GATA-binding protein (GATA-) 3 and STAT6 for Th2 cells. Th1 differentiation is driven by 
IL-12 and IFN-alpha secreted by DCs after the binding/identification of the specific antigen, while IL-4 
(in the absence of IL-12) drives Th2 differentiation. However, more recently, emerging evidences have 
contributed to show that the inflamed gut of patients with CD and with UC is also massively infiltrated 
with another subset of Th cells, namely Th17 and characterized by the production of high levels of 
cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22.   
Once activated, antigen-primed T cells relocate to peripheral sites and exert effector activities upon 
renewed antigen challenge. To achieve this, lymphocytes must travel between lymphoid and non-
lymphoid organs via the blood and then exit the circulation to enter antigen-containing tissues. An 
essential step in this migration process is the adhesion of circulating lymphocytes to the endothelium 
of post capillary venules, which is a multistep process. In the first step, which is mediated by selectins, 
T cells are captured (“tethering”) and weakly interact with the endothelial cells (“rolling”). Once they 
are rolling, they can undergo “activation,” which is usually mediated by chemokines presented on the 
venular endothelium. Chemokines bind to specific G-protein-coupled receptors and trigger intracellular 
signals that lead to activation of integrins and the lymphocytes arrest (“sticking”) on the endothelial 
surface. Only when all steps are completed lymphocytes can transmigrate into a tissue.  
2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
The goal of therapy for both UC and CD is to induce and maintain clinical remission, with the optimal 
outcome of maintaining steroid-free remission, induction and maintenance of mucosal healing, and 
reduction of complications and the need for hospitalizations and surgery. The standard approach to 
therapy for UC and CD is generally step-wise and directed, based on disease activity and the extent 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 10/93 
 
  
 
 
and location of disease. Treatment of mild disease includes anti-inflammatory agents, progressing to 
more potent therapies for patients who have more severe disease. 
Pharmacological treatments for UC and/or CD vary depending upon the anatomic location of disease, 
the severity of disease, and whether the treatment goal is to induce remission or maintain remission. 
Conventional therapies that are used for IBD include oral 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs; 
eg, sulfasalazine, mesalamine), glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone, budesonide), and immunomodulators 
(eg, azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], and methotrexate). Recently, an orally 
administered Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (tofacitinib) has been approved for the treatment of UC. 
Biologic treatments approved for IBD include TNF-α antagonists (eg, infliximab, 
adalimumab, certolizumab), interleukin antagonists (eg, ustekinumab), and integrin antagonists (eg, 
natalizumab, vedolizumab). 
Vedolizumab IV has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant effectiveness in 
multiple clinical trials in subjects with moderately to severely active UC or CD with clinically important 
endpoints of durable clinical response, durable clinical remission, mucosal healing, and 
corticosteroid-free remission, including subjects who have failed previous therapies such as 
corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or TNF-α antagonists. Pharmacological treatments with SC routes 
of administration provide convenience for patients, HCPs, and caregivers by removing the time, 
logistics, and burden to the health care system required for IV infusion and allows for patient 
preference. As a result, the sponsor has pursued development of vedolizumab SC to allow patients and 
HCPs the option to choose between IV infusion or SC injection for long-term maintenance therapy for 
UC or CD. 
Vedolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against 
the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7.  
Vedolizumab specifically inhibits the activity of the α4β7 integrin by selectively antagonizing binding 
and adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and to the extracellular 
matrix glycoprotein fibronectin but does not antagonize binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. 
By antagonizing both the α4β7 MAdCAM-1 interaction and the associated migration of leukocytes into 
GI mucosa, vedolizumab reduces inflammation.  Vedolizumab does not bind to, nor inhibit the function 
of, the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins. 
In clinical studies, vedolizumab IV did not elevate neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes, total memory T helper lymphocytes, monocytes or natural killer cells in the peripheral 
blood of healthy subjects or subjects with UC or CD. 
Vedolizumab did not affect immune surveillance and inflammation of the central nervous system in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in nonhuman primates, a model of multiple sclerosis. 
Consistent with these results, vedolizumab IV did not alter the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ cells or the 
number of T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy subjects. Vedolizumab IV did not inhibit the 
adaptive immune response to intramuscular antigen challenge with hepatitis B vaccine in healthy 
subjects but did inhibit an adaptive immune response to oral antigen challenge with killed cholera toxin 
vaccine due to the fact that cholera is localised to the GI. These results support the conclusion that 
vedolizumab selectively inhibits a gut mucosal immune response, but not the systemic adaptive 
immune response in humans.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development program for vedolizumab SC was discussed with regulatory authorities 
including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EU regulatory authorities. Takeda 
incorporated advice from these regulatory interactions into the clinical development program.  
The clinical development program of vedolizumab SC in UC and CD was discussed with the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Takeda proposed a 
program including a phase 1 single dose pharmacokinetics (PK)/bioavailability study, a phase 3 
placebo-controlled study in UC and a long-term OLE study. Given that vedolizumab has the same 
mechanism of action in the treatment of UC and CD, Takeda proposed that positive efficacy results 
from the planned phase 3 study in UC, together with similar PK and safety profiles compared with the 
vedolizumab IV program, are sufficient to support the registration of vedolizumab SC for maintenance 
treatment in both the UC and CD indications. The Agency recommended inclusion of an active 
vedolizumab IV arm in the study, to prospectively contextualize the comparative efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab IV and SC (but not requiring a formal non-inferiority analysis), as well as several other 
changes, including the design of the OLE study. With regard to this vedolizumab SC program in UC 
supporting registration in CD, the Agency acknowledged that patients with UC and CD share a common 
pathway in the pathogenesis of the diseases and that, based on the results of the vedolizumab IV 
phase 3 studies, vedolizumab has a clinically relevant effect in induction and maintenance of remission 
in both conditions, but also noted a few differences to be taken into account, such as strength of 
evidence of PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation in UC versus CD patients and possible differences in 
length of induction of remission. Overall, the Agency agreed that provided the efficacy and safety of SC 
vedolizumab are convincingly shown in the treatment of UC patients in the proposed study, the results 
may also support an indication for CD; noting however, that the efficacy and safety of SC vedolizumab 
in CD may need to be studied further in the post-approval setting. In addition, the Agency concurred 
that, provided vedolizumab SC dosing resulted in exposures comparable to those from vedolizumab IV, 
safety data from the vedolizumab IV safety data base could be supportive for vedolizumab SC, with the 
exception of potential adverse events (AEs) concerning administration-site reactions.  
During Takeda interactions with the US FDA, agreement was reached on the overall registration 
strategy for vedolizumab SC. The development program includes 2 well-controlled, randomized phase 
3 studies (1 each for the UC and CD indications, with inclusion of a vedolizumab IV reference arm in 
the UC study) to characterize the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC as maintenance therapy.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Vedolizumab IV, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 300 mg/vial (or MLN0002 IV) is a 
lyophilised formulation of vedolizumab intended for intravenous infusion (IV) which has been granted 
marketing authorisation in 2014. 
The scope of this line extension application is the addition of a new pharmaceutical form (solution for 
injection), associated with a new strength (108 mg) and a new route of administration (subcutaneous 
use) intended for administration via a single-use prefilled syringe with a needle safety device (PFS + 
NSD) or a prefilled syringe in an autoinjector/pen (PFS + AI). 
Vedolizumab in these new presentations, also referred to as Vedolizumab SC (MLN0002 SC), is 
formulated with citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L histidine, L histidine 
monohydrochloride, L arginine hydrochloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Vedolizumab (MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
directed against the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7. It is composed of two light chains of the kappa 
subclass and two heavy chains linked together by two disulfide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule 
that is typical of IgG1 immunoglobulins as shown below in Figure 1. Each molecule contains 2 heavy 
chains and 2 light chains, 12 homologous domains, 12 intra-chain and 4 inter-chain disulfide bonds, 
and an asparagine-linked glycosylation site on each heavy chain at residue 301. 
The stylized domain structure of MLN0002 is depicted in Figure 1.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) active substance (AS) is manufactured at AbbVie Bioresearch Center 
(ABC), and at Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Lonza) in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Vedolizumab active substance is manufactured using recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
that secrete the antibody into the surrounding culture medium. 
The manufacturing process for Vedolizumab IV (Process C-IV) and Vedolizumab SC (Process C-SC) are 
identical up to the penultimate process step. Information regarding the manufacturing process and 
process controls for the shared portions of the Vedolizumab manufacturing process are presented in 
the approved Entyvio (vedolizumab) IV assessment report.  
The operating parameters for Process C-IV and Process C-SC have been adequately discussed and 
justified. The two processes are almost identical, apart from some differences that have been 
adequately discussed and justified. 
The cell culture process including the inoculum expansion, the production phase, the media and 
supplemental feeds as well as all associated process parameters and in-process controls are shared 
with vedolizumab IV and information for these process steps was presented. 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 13/93 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The two new raw materials, citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate monohydrate used in the SC 
formulation, are of Ph. Eur. grade and adequately justified. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
Adequate process controls are used to monitor the vedolizumab SC active substance (AS) commercial 
manufacturing process. Critical process controls have been identified for process parameters that have 
a direct and significant influence on the product quality attributes.  
In-process testing and monitoring of process parameters are used to ensure the safety and quality of 
the vedolizumab SC AS commercial manufacturing process. Results from process characterisation 
studies, combined with clinical and commercial manufacturing-scale experience, were used to establish 
the critical steps, critical process parameters or critical in-process controls, and their associated normal 
operating ranges (NORs) or in-process control limits. 
Process validation  
The process validation performed at ABC is considered adequate. Results from operations to 
concentrate, formulate, bottle and store vedolizumab SC AS produced from consecutive batches at ABC 
executed per the process performance qualification (PPQ) protocols met the protocol’s acceptance 
criteria, providing evidence of the reproducibility and robust nature of the vedolizumab SC purification 
operations and associated equipment.  
Systematic controls were performed to ensure that none of the process parameters had a negative 
impact on the product quality and overall ensure that a robust process is in place which yields a 
product of consistent quality. 
Additionally, the downstream unit operations were validated for their impact to product related 
impurities through the inclusion of testing in the validation protocols.  
The process validation performed at Lonza is overall considered adequate. The validation results for 
the unit operations shared with vedolizumab IV were provided in the approved Entyvio (vedolizumab 
IV) dossier. 
An extractables and leachables assessment, validation of active substance transport, and control of in-
process hold times have been provided and did not raise any concern. 
Comparability exercise 
The Applicant has performed the comparability exercise on a limited number of batches. Extended 
characterisation has also been performed. 
Characterisation of the molecule was performed previously on Vedolizumab intended for IV 
administration. An extended characterisation of vedolizumab SC has been performed to evaluate the 
impact of the new formulation. No differences have been reported and this is acceptable. 
The approach and comparability acceptance criteria are considered sufficient for the comparability 
demonstration. Nonetheless, in order to have a full representativeness of batches used to this purpose, 
the Applicant was recommended to further investigate on this point.    
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The specification for the active substance includes appearance, identity, potency, purity, bacterial 
endotoxins, bioburden. 
The specifications for active substance, analytical methods, method validation and batch analysis have 
been provided.  
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 14/93 
 
  
 
 
Upon request some specifications were revised and are considered acceptable. The proposed tests and 
acceptance criteria for routine active substance release and stability are acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Adequate descriptions of analytical methods, including their system suitability criteria and evaluation 
have been provided. All analytical methods are considered suitable for the control of the active 
substance. 
Batch analysis 
Results from several batches of active substance from each manufacturing site were provided. The 
proposed specifications were met. Batch-to-batch consistency is also demonstrated across all batches.  
Reference standards 
The Applicant has submitted the qualification protocol for future primary and working reference 
standards and these are acceptable. Extensive characterization of the reference standard was 
performed. The use of this reference standard in the release of both vedolizumab IV and SC is 
considered acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for active substance has been described in detail and the choice of 
materials appropriately justified in terms of suitability, compatibility with active substance, and 
shipping conditions. The container closure system has been properly evaluated as part of stability 
studies and together with the filling, storage and shipment operations, provides adequate protection 
against microbial contamination. 
Stability 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for Vedolizumab active substance. 
Relevant parameters were selected to study the stability profile of the active substance. The 
analytical methods were validated and are described in the relevant sections of the dossier. 
The data from primary stability and supporting stability studies support the proposed shelf life at 
the designated storage condition in the proposed container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Vedolizumab SC finished product is a sterile finished product containing 108 mg of vedolizumab as 
active substance with citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-histidine 
monohydrochloride, L-arginine hydrochloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI). 
The excipients have been justified based on formulation development studies and are in compliance 
with the Ph. Eur. and USP.  
Vedolizumab injection, for subcutaneous use (vedolizumab SC) finished product (FP) is presented as a 
sterile, liquid formulation in a single use pre-filled syringe (PFS) intended for subcutaneous injection. 
The commercial presentation is assembled into a Needle Safety Device (PFS+NSD) or Autoinjector 
(PFS+AI) format with 108 mg Vedolizumab and both are intended for subcutaneous injection. 
Vedolizumab SC is intended for administration via a single-use, prefilled syringe with a needle safety 
device (PFS + NSD) or a prefilled syringe in an autoinjector/pen (PFS + AI). 
The finished product solution does not come into direct contact with any of the device components.  
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 15/93 
 
  
 
 
Formulation development 
Formulation knowledge gained from the development of vedolizumab IV active substance and finished 
product was utilised in the development of the vedolizumab SC finished product formulation.  
Comparison of vedolizumab IV active substance and finished product and vedolizumab SC active 
substance and finished product formulations has been provided. A comparability assessment of the 
vedolizumab IV and SC formulations was conducted which showed that they are comparable. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process of active substance has been adequately described.  
Sufficient information and assembly process development for NSD (PFS+NSD) or AI (PFS+AI) has 
been provided.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process is a standard process and also includes aseptic filling and 
stoppering. The stoppered pre-filled syringes (PFS) are visually inspected, bulk packaged, and shipped 
for assembly with the needle safety device (PFS+NSD) or with the autoinjector (PFS+AI).  
Adequate in-process controls (IPC) are monitored during manufacturing.  
The container closure system for finished product is accurately described both for the primary closure 
system, which is the pre-filled syringe (PFS), and for the autoinjector (AI) and needle safety devise 
(NSD). 
The choice of the container/closure is adequate.  
The long-term stability studies and the container closure integrity studies demonstrated the primary 
container closure compatibility with the finished product solution and the ability of the container 
closure system to protect the finished product solution from microbial contamination.  
The container closure systems for finished product are adequate for its intended use. 
Process validation  
A description of the process validation strategy has been provided, and in-process testing results and 
final product release testing results have also been provided. Overall the data demonstrate that for all 
validation batches the predefined parameters were met and confirmed that the process is capable of 
producing bulk finished product in prefilled syringes in a robust manner and providing a sterile product 
in a reproducible manner.  
Process validation of the PFS+NSD and PFS+AI assembly process demonstrates that the assembly 
process is reproducible and consistent for commercial production.  
The impact of transport on product quality and integrity was adequately assessed.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Vedolizumab SC finished product is not described in a pharmacopoeia monograph and is controlled 
using in-house established specifications. The panel of release tests are in line with ICH Q6B and it 
covers appearance, identity, purity and impurities, potency, quantity, and microbial quality.  
Analytical procedures 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 16/93 
 
  
 
 
Summaries of method descriptions specific for the finished product have been provided. Methods also 
used for active substance are described in the active substance section. Validation of all compendial 
methods were performed to demonstrate suitability of use. 
Batch analysis 
The proposed specifications were met on the batches analysed. Batch-to-batch consistency has been 
also demonstrated across all batches.  
Reference standards 
The same reference standard is used as for the analysis of the active substance. This is acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 18 months for the finished product PFS assembled into either PFS+NSD or PFS+AI is 
claimed when stored at 2°C-8°C. The assignment of shelf life for the PFS + NSD and PFS + AI has 
been based on the PFS manufacturing date and is limited by the PFS shelf life period. 
Based on the stability results provided a shelf life of 18 months for the finished product PFS assembled 
into either PFS+NSD or PFS+AI when stored at 2 °C-8 °C is acceptable. 
Stability data supports the storage the PFS+NSD (prefilled syringe) and PFS+AI (prefilled pen) left out 
of the refrigerator in its original carton at room temperature (up to 25 °C) for up to 7 days. The prefilled 
syringe or prefilled pen should not be used if left out of the refrigerator for more than 7 days.  
Adventitious agents 
The active substance manufacturing process for vedolizumab injection for subcutaneous use (MLN0002 
SC) is essentially the same manufacturing process as the active substance manufacturing process for 
vedolizumab for intravenous infusion (MLN0002 IV). Two steps have been modified for the 
manufacturing of MLN0002 SC, neither of the two modified steps is considered to contribute to viral 
clearance or inactivation. As a result, the viral clearance studies performed with MLN0002 IV are also 
applicable for MLN0002 SC. All information pertaining to the adventitious agents safety evaluation for 
the process steps shared between MLN0002 SC and MLN0002 IV can be found in the approved Entyvio 
(vedolizumab) IV dossier and this is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In relation to the PFS Functional Test Results in the Design Verification Study, reporting data from 
accelerated aging, needle clogging was reported in several aged samples. 
The supporting stability study data for Vedolizumab SC finished product did not show any out-of-
specification for the syringe functional parameters results when tested beyond the proposed shelf-life.  
Moreover, the reported clogging is specifically related to higher storage temperature of the accelerated 
aging study and thus not relevant for the product stored at the recommended storage conditions, even 
if for longer time. Finally, the proposed shelf life of the PFS assembled into either PFS+NSD or PFS+AI 
is 18 months when stored at 2─8°C, further reassuring on the maintenance of the quality of the 
product during storage. 
Thus, the aspect of clogging was not considered critical during the assessment. The Applicant was 
requested to provide a list of all the reported clogging events, specifying the context in which they 
were observed and discussing the impact of these events on the quality and safety of the product. The 
Applicant provided the requested information, where it was clear that that the clogging everts were 
observed very rarely.  
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 17/93 
 
  
 
 
It is emphasized that the clogging events registered up to date do not pose any concern, since they 
were very rare and occurred mainly during storage in accelerated conditions that are much different 
from the claimed storage conditions in terms of time and temperature.  
The overall quality documentation provided for Entyvio in this line extension application is of adequate 
quality. No major objections were identified during the assessment. There is a good control strategy in 
place to guarantee consistent quality of the finished product. The overall quality of Entyvio SC is 
considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, this line extension application for Entyvio is 
considered approvable from a quality point of view.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended some points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new studies were submitted with the current application. The vedolizumab primary structure is the 
same in SC and IV drug products and no changes were made that would impact the primary structure 
of the protein. Moreover, comparable biochemical properties and in vitro functional activity between the 
two  formulations  have  been  demonstrated  (please  refer  to  quality  part  of  this  assessment  report). 
Therefore, the nonclinical pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity studies conducted in support 
of the vedolizumab IV development program are considered applicable to the proposed vedolizumab SC 
formulation.  A previously submitted GLP local tolerance study with vedolizumab SC in rabbits was cross 
referred in this application and showed that the formulation was well tolerated. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  justification  for not performing  a  formal  ERA  was  submitted  by  the  Applicant,  in  line  with  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev.1. The drug substance is a protein that will be catabolized into naturally 
occurring amino acids and is not expected to result in any significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
This application is approvable from a non-clinical viewpoint. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  aim  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  vedolizumab  SC  was  to  describe  the  PK  and 
immunogenicity of single-dose SC vedolizumab in healthy subjects and repeat-dose SC vedolizumab in 
UC patients. Factors that affect any of these parameters were also assessed by population modelling of 
PK data from the phase 3 studies Population PK approaches using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling and 
graphical analyses were used on data from the phase 3 studies to understand the effects of demographics 
or  baseline  covariates  on  PK  of  vedolizumab.  The  characterization  of  the  exposure-response  (E-R) 
relationship  for  UC  patients  was  also  an  aim  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  program  to  support  dose 
recommendation for marketing applications and to assess the impact of vedolizumab serum Ctrough and 
Cavg on efficacy endpoints. Finally, characterization of long-term immunogenicity from vedolizumab IV 
program was also presented. 
In SC clinical studies, plasma concentrations of vedolizumab were determined using a validated direct 
capture PK assay. Two versions of the assay were used which had different lower limits of quantitation 
(LOQ). The assay with the higher LOQ was used for the SC phase 3 studies and the majority of the phase 
1 studies. A concentration-dependent effect on the accuracy of measuring vedolizumab in lipemic serum 
has been found. Lipemia in serum pharmacokinetic samples was not monitored in studies MLN0002SC- 
3027,  MLN0002SC-3031,  Vedolizumab  SC-1017,  Vedolizumab  SC-1018,  Vedolizumab  SC-1019, 
vedolizumab SC-1022. Therefore, the MAH was not able to provide data to support the percentage of 
samples analysed in the lipemic matrix condition. During validation, testing for the effect of lipemia on 
the ability to measure vedolizumab concentrations in serum was conducted at various concentrations of 
vedolizumab and triglycerides.   
The MAH’s conclusion that serum lipemia may be a problem only at vedolizumab concentrations below 3 
μg/mL can be supported; although batches were not spiked with vedolizumab concentration above 3.00 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 22/93 
 
  
 
 
 
μg/mL. However, the issue is considered minor as only 2.72% (range, 2.22% to 4.43% for the individual 
studies) of all samples analysed in the submitted studies had a vedolizumab concentration in the range  
0.200 - 3.00 μg/mL concentration, and only a small percentage (<4%) of serum samples, according to 
MAH’s data, can be expected to have lipid levels high enough to affect the vedolizumab measurement. 
It  can  be  thus  concluded  that,  overall,  lipemia  could  have  had  an  effect  on  the  measurement  of 
vedolizumab  only  in  an  insignificant  number  of  serum  samples,  and  thus  it  is  not  expected  to  have 
affected the overall conclusions of the studies. 
Study  SC-101  showed  that  the  bioavailability  following  a  single  SC  injection  of  vedolizumab  SC  was 
75.1%, independent of the doses evaluated (54, 108, or 160 mg). Vedolizumab reached maximum serum 
concentrations around 1 week after a single SC injection. Vedolizumab was eliminated by both linear and 
nonlinear  pathways 
following  SC 
injection,  with  more  rapid  elimination  with  decreasing 
dose/concentration. Compared with non-Japanese subjects, Japanese subjects generally showed similar 
or  slightly  higher  exposure;  however,  ethnicity  did  not  have  an  impact  on  CLL  or  V2  based  on  the 
population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  likely  since  weight  was  a  covariate  for  various  population 
pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Results from study SC-1017 showed that the two curves, i.e. for PFS+NSD and PFS groups, are very 
similar until approximately 60 days after dosing but then there is a difference between the two curves. 
This could be the reason why the ratios of geometric LSMs for AUClast and AUCinf are below the unity 
and the lower end of the 90% CIs is out of the reference value. Considering that the administration of 
vedolizumab SC should be Q2W, this differences in the last part of the AUC curve could be considered 
not clinically significant.  
Results from Study SC-1021 showed that serum vedolizumab AUCWeek2, AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax 
were  approximately  19%,  29%,  33%,  and  20%  higher,  respectively,  following  PFS+AI  than  following 
PFS.  Results  from  these  two  studies,  i.e.  SC-1017 and  SC-1021,  showed that  the  ratios of  geometric 
LSMs for AUClast and AUCinf are far from the unity and also the 90% CIs are out of the reference value. 
However,  these  studies  are  considered  as  pilot  studies  and  two  more  studies  investigating  the 
bioequivalence among the different formulation have been conducted. 
Study SC-1022 showed that the PK of serum vedolizumab is similar following dosing with PFS+AI and 
PFS: the ratios of geometric LSMs for AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax were close to unity and the 90% CIs 
were  within  80.00%  to  125.00%,    In  Study  SC-1018  the  statistical  comparison  of  Cmax  and  AUC 
parameters  for  all  sites  combined  confirmed  bioequivalence  of  the  2  treatments,  i.e.  PFS+NSD  than 
following PFS,  with GMRs of approximately 100% and 90% CIs within the 80% to 125% limits. Overall, 
PFS+NSD and PFS+AI showed similar PK results to the PFS used in phase 3 trials. 
The  base  population  PK  model  developed  for  vedolizumab  IV  was  updated  to  include  an  absorption 
component for SC administration. The updated base model was fit to IV data from studies C13002 and 
C13009 and IV/SC data from studies C13010 and MLN0002SC_101. Results from this model were used 
in the current analysis as prior information to selectively inform a subset of PK parameters during model 
development. Informative priors were defined for the fixed-effect parameters Vmax, Km, Vp, Q, Ka, and 
F, and for the interindividual random-effect parameter on Ka. The use of informative priors served to 
support estimation of these model parameters and allowed stable estimates to be obtained despite the 
sparse available PK data. 
Given that only trough PK samples were collected following SC administration, there was very limited 
information  to  support  estimating  covariate  effects  on  F.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  for  Ka, 
where injection site was also modelled as a covariate, but this did not result in as much model instability 
and the covariate estimates were plausible. No covariate effects were modelled on F for these reasons.

The objective of popPK and E-R analysis was to evaluate maintenance SC therapy as an alternative to 
IV  maintenance  therapy  for  UC  patients.  Covariate  effects  on  CLL  were  of  primary  interest  given  the 
significant impact of this PK parameter on drug exposure. Body weight was a determinant of variability 
in CLL with an estimated power coefficient (95% CDI) of 0.471 (0.406, 0.531). Serum albumin was also 
a  determinant  of  variability  in  CLL  with  an  estimated  power  coefficient  (95%  CDI)  of  -1.19  (-1.29,  -
1.11). The effects of body weight and albumin on CLL were estimated with reasonable precision and the 
95% CDIs were statistically different from the null effect of zero. There was no clinically important effect 
of IBD diagnosis on CLL; the effect was precisely estimated with a point estimate (95% CDI) indicating 
a decrease in CLL in CD subjects by a factor of 0.968 (0.943, 0.993) compared to UC patients. The 95% 
CDI was statistically different from the null effect of one. The effect of SC injection site was not precisely 
estimated with a point estimate (95% CDI) indicating a decrease in Ka for the thigh and upper arm by 
a factor of 0.510 (0.299, 0.882) and 0.416 (0.201, 0.921), respectively, compared to the abdomen. The 
95% CDIs were statistically different from the null effect of one. 
The presence of AVA was estimated to increase vedolizumab CLL. For a typical AVA-positive subject with 
a titer of 250, the point estimate and 95% CDI for CLL was 0.254 L/day (0.229, 0.281) compared to 
0.169 L/day (0.164, 0.174) for the reference subject with a negative AVA. The 95%CDI for the power 
coefficient of the AVA titer effect was wide (0.0464, 0.104) but was statistically different from the null 
effect of zero. 
Further evaluation of covariate effects on CLL was conducted via simulation given the Bayesian posterior 
distributions (or uncertainty) of the model parameters. Covariate effect sizes of 25% from the typical 
reference  subject  were  used  as  a  limit  for  clinically  meaningful  changes.  Body  weight  and  albumin 
appeared not to have a clinically meaningful impact across the range of values evaluated except at the 
extremes (i.e., observed 5th or 95th percentiles of the covariate). Extreme values of body weight (e.g., 
106 kg) and albumin (e.g., 2.7 g/dL) and a positive AVA titer (>10) were identified as potentially clinically 
important predictors of CLL, as the 95% CDI for the covariate effect partially or completely fell outside 
of the 25% range. 
As result of the population PK analysis, Ctrought,SS and Cavg,SS for subjects on IV Q8W, IV Q4W, SC 
Q2W, SC QW regimens were simulated and the relative values were reported. Comparing the proposed 
dosage  108  mg  Q2W  SC  with  the  approved  one,  300  mg  Q8W  IV,  it  could  be  observed  that  model 
predicted Ctrough,SS for  vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W IV is lower compared to 108 mg Q2W SC, mean 
values of 8.46 µg/mL, 8.39 µg/mL and 11.1 µg/mL for the first and 34.6 µg/mL and 23.1 µg/mL for the 
latter. Predicted Cavg,SS for vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W IV seems to be more close to 108 mg Q2W SC, 
mean values of 28.3 µg/mL, 29.5 µg/mL and 32.2 µg/mL for the first and 39.8 µg/mL and 36.8 µg/mL 
for the latter. 
Given  the  differences  in  the  two  routes  of  administration  the  difference  in  Ctrough,SS  was  expected. 
Considering that, as acknowledged by the MAH, it cannot be assumed that 108 mg Q2W SC would result 
in similar efficacy compared to 300 mg Q4W IV administration, only vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2w and 
Vedolizumab 300 mg IV Q8W should be considered. From a PK point of view, these two curves cannot 
be  considered  overlapping  by  definition.  Indeed,  Cmax  following  administration  of  vedolizumab  SC 
108 mg was substantially lower than observed Cmax following administration of vedolizumab 300 mg 
IV; and SC regimen was associated with a narrow fluctuation compared to both the IV regimens as well 
as Vedolizumab 300 mg IV Q8W.  
The AVA seropositivity rate was 6% during treatment with vedolizumab SC administration to UC subjects. 
The development of AVA decreases vedolizumab trough concentrations. Considering that the AVA rate 
following SC administration was similar to IV administration (6%) the clinical impact is the same.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Main results of the E-R analysis are summarised below. Week 6 results showed that for all the exposure 
parameters considered, quartiles of higher exposure are associated with greater probability of week 6 
clinical remission and week 6 clinical response.  
Steady-state  exposure  metrics  at  week  52  were  calculated  for  the  week  6  responders  who  were 
randomized to the maintenance phase. A positive ER trend for each exposure metric within each arm 
was  observed.  The  amount  of  overlap  of  the  model-predicted  exposures  between  arms  has  been 
analysed,  the  SC  and  IV  presentations  show  better  results  for  model-predicted  Cavgss  compared  to 
model-predicted Ctroughss, however a good overlap has not been observed for neither of them.  
SC treatment, as compared with IV treatment, leads to a higher exposure to vedolizumab. Analysing the 
exposure quartiles within arm and relating them to probability of week 52 clinical remission and mucosal 
healing, it can be observed that in the most of cases the probability of week 52 clinical remission and 
the rate of week 52 mucosal healing are higher for the SC treatment.  
Week  52  clinical  remission.  VPCs  for  the  full  model-predicted  Cavgss  model  (interaction  model)  looks 
good  suggesting  good  ability  of  the  model  to  reproduce  the  observed  data.  Instead  visual  predictive 
checks for the week 52 clinical remission ER model of model-predicted Ctroughss (the full model, the 
same as the interaction model) indicates the model cannot replicate the observed data. 
Week 52 mucosal healing. Baseline albumin was estimated to significantly modify the odds of week 52 
mucosal healing in the full model. Visual predictive checks for the interaction model of model-predicted 
Cavgss  shows  good  ability  to  reproduce  the  observed  data.  VPCs  for  the  interaction  model  of  model-
predicted Ctroughss, however, show that the models is not reliable for its purpose. Predictions from the 
interaction  model  of  model-predicted  Cavgss  at  covariate  settings  of  interest  showed  that  higher 
response  is  predicted  for  patients  who  are  TNF-naive  relative  to  TNF-failures,  but  to  a  degree  that 
decreases in increasing exposure. A small, non-significant increase in response is seen as albumin levels 
increase from 40 g/L to 45 g/L. 
Performing the screening for confounders to a multivariate approach, a propensity score model relating 
probability of low within-arm exposure to TNF- baseline rectal bleeding scores, and baseline endoscopic 
scores was fitted. Patients with prior TNF-failures and patients with more severe disease at baseline were 
identified as having a higher propensity to fall in the lowest exposure quartile. 
Overall it can be concluded that a general trend of increased rate of response for patients with higher 
vedolizumab  exposure  was  observed  and  it  seems  that  the  SC  administration  leads  to  slightly  higher 
exposure  compared  to  IV  administration.  Low  albumin  concentration has  the  potential  to  be  clinically 
relevant.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  the  SC  vedolizumab  formulation  consists  of  many  studies, 
including  bioequivalence  studies  among  the  different  device  delivery  presentations,  population  and 
exposure-response analysis. The claim for the CD indication was initially based on a PK bridging between 
the  approved  Vedolizumab  300 mg  IV  Q8W  maintenance  dosing  and  the  new  108 mg  Q2W  SC 
formulation.  
Comparing 108 mg Q2W SC to Vedolizumab 300 mg IV Q8W, from a PK point of view, the two curves 
cannot be considered overlapping by definition. Indeed Cmax following administration of vedolizumab 
SC  108 mg  was  substantially  lower  than  observed Cmax  following  administration  of  vedolizumab 300 
mg  IV  and  the  SC  regimen  which  was  associated  with  a  narrower  fluctuation  to  that  of  Vedolizumab 
300 mg  IV  Q8W.  Considering  the  very  different  nature  of  the  exposure  curves  after  SC  and  IV 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 25/93 
 
  
 
 
administration the comparison between the two appears to be limited. The applicant was therefore asked 
at D120 to justify further that the available PK data can support the extrapolation of efficacy and safety 
from IV to SC vedolizumab in patients with CD, considering also that a PK/PD correlation was evident in 
UC but not in CD patients, or to provide clinical data from CD patients. As the company provided clinical 
data on CD (study results from study SC-3031) at  D150 of the procedure (see assessment of clinical 
efficacy)  the  extrapolation  based  on  PK  bridging  was  not  further  pursued  and  the  evaluation  of  the 
efficacy profile maintains a pivotal role. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
This Line extension is approvable from a clinical pharmacology viewpoint. The proposed dosage 
regimen is considered acceptable.

Study Participants  
The key inclusion criteria included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
adult patients with diagnosis of UC ≥6 months before screening with confirmatory histology;  
disease activity: moderately to severely active UC (Mayo score of 6-12 with endoscopic subscore ≥
2) within 10 days before the first dose of study drug. Central reading of the endoscopy.  
evidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum (≥15 cm of involved Colon). Subjects with a long-
term history of extensive colitis or pancolitis had to have documentation of surveillance 
colonoscopy within 12 months before the screening visit. 
inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1 of the following therapies: immunomodulators, 
corticosteroids, and/or TNF-α antagonists. 
The exclusion criteria were divided into 3 categories:  
•  GI exclusion criteria (extensive colonic resection, subtotal or total colectomy, abdominal abscess or 
toxic megacolon; extensive colonic resection; the subject had ileostomy, colostomy, or known fixed 
symptomatic stenosis of the intestine); 
• 
Infectious disease (the common infectious diseases considered for biologic agents and for anti-
integrin agents) 
•  General exclusions (Prior exposure to certain nonbiologic therapies (eg, cyclosporine, thalidomide), 
natalizumab, efalizumab, etrolizumab, AMG 181, anti-MAdCAM-1 antibodies, or rituximab; required 
or anticipated surgical intervention during the study; history or evidence of adenomatous colonic 
polyps or colonic mucosal dysplasia; diagnosis of Crohn’s colitis or indeterminate colitis). 
Treatments 
Induction phase: patients received open-label infusions of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 
2 and were assessed for clinical response at Week 6.  
Subjects who achieved a clinical response, as assessed by full Mayo score (endoscopy score 
determined by central reading), were randomized at a 2:1:1 ratio in the double-blind, double-dummy 
maintenance phase in which participants in each treatment arm received both SC injections Q2W 
and IV infusions Q8W, beginning at Week 6 through Week 50, as follows: 
Injections of vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W and placebo IV infusions Q8W 
Infusions of vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W and placebo SC injections Q2W 
Placebo SC injections Q2W and placebo IV infusions Q8W. 
Subjects who did not achieve a clinical response at Week 6 were not randomized into the maintenance 
phase and instead received a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg, while Week 14 responders 
then had the chance to move to the OLE. 
Permitted Medications and Treatments 
Subjects were permitted to receive a therapeutic dose of the following drugs: 
Oral 5-ASAs if stable dose for 2 weeks immediately before the first dose of study drug. 
Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose ≤30 mg/d, budesonide at a stable dose ≤9 
mg/d, or equivalent steroid) provided that the dose has been stable for the 4 weeks immediately 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 28/93 
 
  
 
 
before the first dose of study drug if corticosteroids had just been initiated, or for the 2 weeks 
immediately before the first dose of study drug if corticosteroids were being tapered (according to 
defined guidelines). 
Probiotics (eg, Culturelle, Saccharomyces boulardii) if stable dose for 2 weeks immediately before the 
first dose of study drug. 
Antidiarrheals for control of chronic diarrhea. 
Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, provided the dose had been stable for 8 weeks immediately before 
first dose of study drug. 
For immunosuppressives, oral 5-ASAs, probiotics and antibiotics for UC, dose reduction or 
discontinuation per label was allowed only due to adverse reactions.  
For oral corticosteroids, dose reductions were made per the tapering schedule. For subjects who could 
not tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical symptoms, corticosteroids may 
have been increased up to the original dose at the start of induction therapy (should not have 
exceeded baseline dose). In such cases, the tapering regimen above must have been reinitiated 
within 2 weeks. 
Among Excluded Medications and Treatment: all live vaccines from 30 days before screening to at least 
6 months after the last dose of study drug. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: To assess the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on clinical 
remission at Week 52 in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who 
achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on mucosal healing at Week 
52 in subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of 
vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on durable clinical response 
at Week 52 in subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of 
vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on durable clinical 
remission at Week 52 in subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following 
administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on corticosteroid free 
remission at Week 52 in subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following 
administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
Proportion of subjects with clinical remission, defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no 
individual subscore >1 point, at Week 52. 
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 29/93 
 
  
 
 
 
Secondary Endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with mucosal healing, defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≤1 point, 
at Week 52. 
Proportion of subjects with durable clinical response, defined as clinical response at Weeks 6 
and 52, where clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points 
and ≥30% from baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore 
of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point. 
Proportion of subjects with durable clinical remission, defined as clinical remission at Weeks 6 
and 52. 
Proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free remission, defined as subjects using oral 
corticosteroids at Baseline (Week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in 
clinical remission at Week 52. 
Safety Assessments: 
•  Safety for maintenance therapy as assessed by adverse events (AEs), adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs) (including serious infections and opportunistic infection, such as 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML], liver injury, malignancies, infusion-related 
or injection site reactions or systemic reactions and hypersensitivity), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), vital signs, results of standard laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, urinalysis), and results of 12-lead electrocardiograms. 
Sample size 
Assuming a clinical remission rate of 42% for vedolizumab and 16% for placebo at Week 52, a sample 
size of 94 subjects in the vedolizumab SC group and 47 subjects in the placebo group is chosen, in 
order to provide 90% power at a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. To ensure a randomized sample 
size of 188 subjects, assuming 47% of the subjects entering induction will achieve clinical response at 
Week 6, approximately 400 subjects are planned to be enrolled into the study. Assuming a mucosal 
healing rate of 52% for vedolizumab and 20% for placebo at Week 52, with a sample size of 94 
subjects in the vedolizumab group and 47 subjects in the placebo group, the first secondary endpoint 
of mucosal healing at Week 52 is powered to at least 97% at a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Randomisation 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) system was used to randomly assign subjects with clinical 
response at Week 6 to receive injections of active vedolizumab or placebo.  
Randomization was stratified by: 
- concomitant use of oral corticosteroids,  
- clinical remission status at Week 6,  
- previous TNF-α antagonist failure or concomitant immunomodulator (azathioprine or 6 
mercaptopurine) use.

Blinding (masking) 
All study site personnel other than the investigational pharmacist or pharmacy designee were blinded 
to the treatment assignments for the duration of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Two populations (full analysis set [FAS] and per protocol set [PPS]) were analysed. All statistical testing 
was  performed  at  2-sided  0.05  level  of  significance.  To  control  the  overall  type  I  error  rate  for  the 
comparison between vedolizumab SC and placebo groups for the primary and secondary endpoints, a 
hierarchical  approach  was  applied  to  the  statistical  testing.  Analyses  of  additional  endpoints  were 
performed  without  adjustments  for  multiple  comparisons,  where  nominal  p-values  were  presented.  A 
sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of dropouts for different missing mechanisms by 
using  a  hybrid  approach  in  which  discontinuation  due  to  AE  or  lack  of  efficacy  will  be  imputed  as 
nonresponder and other discontinuation/missing was imputed using multiple imputation for primary and 
all secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The primary statistical comparison of interest for all efficacy endpoints was between vedolizumab SC and 
placebo.  The  comparison  of  vedolizumab  IV  group  vs  placebo  group  was  considered  exploratory  and 
hence  was  not  included  in  the  multiplicity  control  procedure.  The  descriptive  statistics  of  treatment 
effects and corresponding 95% CI for the vedolizumab IV arm versus placebo were presented for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The exact method is planned to be performed if the number 
of  observations  is  too  small  (e.g.,  ≤5).  Any  p-values  presented  for  vedolizumab  IV  versus  placebo 
comparisons were nominal p-values. No statistical comparison was performed between the vedolizumab 
SC and vedolizumab IV treatment groups.

Induction phase  
Table 2:Subject Disposition (All Enrolled Subjects, Induction Phase): VDZ IV 
Maintenance phase  
Subject Disposition: Maintenance Phase (Full Analysis Set) 
216 subjects were randomized into the maintenance phase (placebo: 56 subjects; vedolizumab SC: 106 
subjects; and vedolizumab IV: 54 subjects). 
Completed the study: 37.5% of the placebo subjects at Week 52, compared with 71.7% and 75.9% 
of subjects in the vedolizumab SC and vedolizumab IV treatment groups at Week 52, respectively.  
The most frequent reason for discontinuation across all treatment groups was lack of efficacy, which 
was  highest  in  the  placebo  group  (80%)  compared  with  62.1%  and  46.2%  for  vedolizumab  SC  and 
vedolizumab IV, respectively.  
AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 14.3% of placebo group, 17.2% in the vedolizumab SC group, 
and 15.4% in the vedolizumab IV group. 
Recruitment 
The study enrolled subjects at 105 sites worldwide for the maintenance phase (14 sites in the United 
States [US] and 91 sites ex-US). Date first subject signed informed consent form was on 18 December 
2015. Date of last subject’s last visit/contact was on 21 August 2018.

Conduct of the study 
Through 16 February 2018, there were 5 protocol amendments to the original study protocol (26 
February 2015). These were on adding exploratory objectives and endpoints, inclusion of an inclusion 
of a benefit risk assessment, clarifications on exclusion and inclusion criteria.

Baseline data 
Demographic  
In the overall FAS population, there was a higher proportion of male subjects than female subjects 
(60.2% and 39.8%, respectively). Most (83.8%) subjects were white. The median age was 38.0 years; 
most subjects were ≥35 years of age (58.8%) and few subjects were ≥65 years (6.0%). The median 
body weight was 71.65 kg and the median body mass index was 24.02 kg/m2. With respect to 
geographic distribution, 13.0% were enrolled at sites in North America and 87% were enrolled at sites 
outside of North America.

a Subjects who had failure of multiple therapies were classified by the following hierarchy: TNF-α failure included all 
subjects who had failure of a TNF-α antagonist. Immunomodulator failure included all subjects who had failure of an 
immunomodulator but did not have failure of a TNF-α antagonist. Corticosteroid failure included all subjects who had 
failure of a corticosteroid and who did not have failure of a TNF-α antagonist nor an immunomodulator. 
Each  subject  is  counted  only  once  within  a  medication  class  with  their  worst  outcome  being  counted.  Inadequate 
response is considered worse than loss of response, loss of response is considered worse than intolerance.

Comparison Across SC and IV Vedolizumab Maintenance Therapies (C13006 and SC-3027 
studies) 
Study C13006 was conducted as part of the vedolizumab IV clinical development program, and the CSR 
was submitted in the marketing applications for vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for IV injection. 
Study  SC-3027  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  vedolizumab  SC  clinical  development  program,  and  the 
CSR was submitted in the marketing applications for vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for SC injection. 
Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in both studies and across the treatment groups in 
each study, the percentage of subjects with severe UC disease, as assessed by the complete Mayo score, 
was higher in the Study SC-3027 study population than in the Study C13006 population.

Subjects with missing data for determination of endpoint status were categorized as nonresponders. 
The 95% CIs of the proportion were based on the Clopper-Pearson method. The 95% CI of the adjusted treatment 
difference is based on the normal approximation method, or the exact method if the number of remissions in either 
treatment group is ≤5. 
a For Study SC-3027, the p-values were obtained using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (comparing vedolizumab SC 
versus placebo or vedolizumab IV versus placebo) stratified by randomization strata including concomitant use of 
corticosteroids, clinical remission status at Week 6, and previous TNF-α antagonist failure or concomitant 
immunomodulator use, or using Fisher’s Exact test if the number of responses in either treatment group is ≤5. 
b For Study C13006, the p-values were obtained using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (comparing vedolizumab IV 
versus placebo) stratified by randomization strata including concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, previous 
exposure to TNF-α antagonists or concomitant immunomodulator use, and enrollment in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 in the 
induction phase. 
c Corticosteroid-free remission at Week 52 was analyzed in a subset of the FAS or maintenance ITT subjects with 
baseline concomitant oral corticosteroid use (by interactive voice response system at time of randomization). Study 
SC-3027: PBO: N = 24; VDZ SC: N = 45; VDZ IV: N = 21. Study C13006: PBO: N = 72; VDZ IV Q8W: N = 70; 
VDZ IV Q4W: N = 73. 
d For Study SC-3027, the p-values were obtained using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (comparing vedolizumab SC 
versus placebo or vedolizumab IV versus placebo) stratified by randomization strata including clinical remission 
status at Week 6, previous TNF-α antagonists failure or concomitant immunomodulator use (ignoring strata 
component of concomitant use of corticosteroids), or Fisher's Exact test if the number of responses in either 
treatment group is ≤5. 
e For Study C13006, the p-values were obtained using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (comparing vedolizumab IV 
versus placebo) stratified by randomization strata including previous exposure to TNF-α antagonist or concomitant 
immunomodulator use and enrollment in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 in the induction phase (ignoring strata component of 
concomitant use of oral corticosteroids). 
Supportive studies 
MLN0002SC-3031 
A  phase  3,  multicenter,  multinational,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  52-week  study 
(SC-3031) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab SC as maintenance therapy in subjects 
with CD who responded to vedolizumab intravenous (IV) induction treatment.  
Eligible  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  induction  phase  at  Week  0,  received  open-label  infusions  of 
vedolizumab IV 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, and were assessed for clinical response by Crohn’s Disease 
Activity Index (CDAI) (defined as a ≥70-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline [Week 0]) at Week 
6, as follows: 
•  Subjects who achieved a clinical response at Week 6 were randomized into the maintenance phase.  
Entyvio Assessment Report EMA/220524/2020  
Page 44/93 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  a  clinical  response  at  Week  6  were  not  randomized  into  the 
maintenance phase and instead received a third infusion of open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg at 
Week 6. Subjects who achieved a clinical response at Week 14 (by CDAI) were eligible to enrol into 
the OLE study (SC-3030), while subjects who did not achieve clinical response were discontinued. 
In  the  maintenance  phase,  all  subjects  who  received  open-label  vedolizumab  IV  treatment  in  the 
induction  phase  and  demonstrated  a  clinical  response  at  Week  6  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to 
double-blind  treatment  with  vedolizumab  SC  administered  once  every  2  weeks  (Q2W)  or  placebo  SC 
Q2W (Figure 3below). 
•  Randomization was stratified by 3 factors: 
•  Concomitant use of oral corticosteroids. 
•  Clinical remission status at Week 6. 
• 
Previous treatment failure with or exposure to TNF-α antagonists or concomitant immunomodulator 
(azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) use. 
The last blinded SC injection in the maintenance phase was administered at Week 50 and the primary 
and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  assessed  at  Week  52.  Subjects  who  completed  or  early 
terminated from the maintenance phase were eligible to enter into Study SC-3030 (unless withdrawn 
due to a study drug-related adverse event). Subjects who did not enroll into SC-3030 were to complete 
a final safety visit 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug in Study SC-3031 and a follow-up safety 
survey 6 months after the last dose. 
The design of Study SC-3031 for CD was similar to that of the pivotal phase 3 study in subjects with 
ulcerative colitis (UC) (MLN0002SC-3027; hereafter referred to as SC-3027) with the exception of not 
having an IV reference arm in the double-blinded maintenance phase. The design and target population 
of Study SC-3031 were also similar to those of the maintenance phase of the GEMINI 2 (C13007) study 
[1] to allow cross-study comparison with vedolizumab IV Q8W maintenance treatment.

In Study SC-3031, 644 subjects enrolled in the open-label vedolizumab IV induction period, and 
410 were randomized into the double-blinded maintenance phase of the study.

PRO The recent 2018 revision to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline 
on 
the  Development  of  New  Medicinal  Products 
for 
the  Treatment  of  Crohn’s  Disease 
(CPMP/EWP/2284/99  Rev.  2)  recommends  that  symptomatic  relief  be  evaluated  by  patient  reported 
outcomes (PRO). Until a validated PRO has been developed, the patient reported outcomes derived from 
CDAI diary items may be appropriate. 
In Study SC-3031, an evaluation based on patient-reported items from the CDAI diary (PRO2, a 2-item 
PRO that includes stool frequency and abdominal pain CDAI components and PRO3, a 3-item PRO that 
included stool frequency, abdominal pain and general well-being CDAI components) showed a positive

trend in favour of vedolizumab.  Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed by IBDQ, a disease 
specific  instrument,  and  EQ-5D,  which  is  a  generic  measure.  Subjects  treated  with  vedolizumab  SC 
maintained improvements in IBDQ and EQ-5D scores at Week 52 to a greater extent than subjects who 
received placebo. Work productivity was assessed by WPAI-CD. Subjects treated with vedolizumab SC 
maintained improvements in WPAI-CD scores at Week 52 to a greater extent than patients who received 
placebo.  
UC and CD indication long term 
Study MLN0002SC-3030  
Study MLN0002SC-3030 (hereafter Study SC-3030) is a phase 3b ongoing OLE study to gather long-
term safety and efficacy data for vedolizumab SC, including eligible subjects from Studies SC-3027 (UC 
subject population) and SC-3031 (CD subject population). All enrolled subjects received vedolizumab SC 
108 mg. 
In this study, the duration of vedolizumab SC treatment will vary by subject based on continued benefit 
but could be up to a maximum of 5 years. After the final dose of vedolizumab SC on the study, subjects 
will complete a final safety visit 18-weeks after the last dose received. Additionally, upon completion (or 
withdrawal) of this study, subjects will participate in a 6-month (from their last study drug dose) follow-
up survey. 
An interim clinical study report (CSR) for SC-3030, based on a 31 May 2018 data cutoff date, is provided 
with this submission.

Inclusion criteria 
Subjects previously participating in Study MLN0002SC-3027 or MLN0002SC-3031, and, in the opinion 
of the investigator, tolerated the study drug well. Subjects who withdrew early from Study 
MLN0002SC-3027 or MLN0002SC-3031 must have withdrawn due to treatment failure (ie, as 
determined by disease worsening or need for rescue medications from Week 14 of the respective 
study) during the maintenance phase.

Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were performed. Approximately 692 subjects were expected to enter 
this  study,  including  242 UC  subjects  from  Study  MLN0002SC-3027  and  450 CD  subjects  from  Study 
MLN0002SC-3031. 
Analysis of efficacy variables is conducted in the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all enrolled UC subjects 
(FAS-UC) and all enrolled CD subjects (FAS-CD) of SC-3030. 
Interim Results 
For  subjects  with  UC  (FAS-UC),  results  are  provided  for  3  groups  of  subjects  depending  on  their 
disposition and treatment group in Study SC-3027: randomized completers of the maintenance phase, 
randomized early terminators, and nonrandomized Week 14 responders. 
•  Randomized completer subjects received vedolizumab IV during the induction phase of Study SC-
3027, achieved clinical response at Week 6, were subsequently randomized to the Study SC-3027 
maintenance  phase  to  receive  vedolizumab  SC  108 mg  Q2W,  vedolizumab IV  300  mg  Q8W, or 
placebo, and completed 52 weeks of therapy in Study SC-3027. These subjects then rolled over 
to Study SC-3030, during which they received open-label vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W. If these

subjects  experienced  disease  worsening  during  Study  SC-3030,  they  were  dose  escalated  to 
vedolizumab SC 108 mg QW. 
•  Randomized  early  terminator  subjects  received  vedolizumab  IV  during  the  induction  phase  of 
Study SC-3027, achieved clinical response at Week 6, and were subsequently randomized to the 
maintenance phase of Study SC-3027 to receive vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W, vedolizumab IV 
300 mg Q8W, or placebo, but withdrew between Weeks 6 and 52 because of disease worsening

which they received open-label vedolizumab SC 108 mg QW. 
•  Nonrandomized  Week  14  responder  UC  subjects  received  vedolizumab  IV  during  the  induction 
phase of Study SC-3027, were nonresponders at Week 6, but did achieve a clinical response at 
Week 14 after receiving a third vedolizumab IV infusion at Week 6. These subjects then rolled over 
to Study SC-3030, during which they received open-label vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W. If these 
subjects  experienced  disease  worsening  during  Study  SC-3030,  they  were  dose  escalated  to 
vedolizumab SC QW. 
Clinical remission rates over time in subjects with UC who completed 52 weeks of treatment in Study 
SC-3027 and rolled over to Study SC-3030 (randomized completers) 
Long-term clinical remission rates were calculated for the population of randomized completer subjects 
in Study SC-3027 (ie, those subjects who completed the Week 52 assessment in Study SC-3027 and 
rolled over into Study SC-3030), who had a baseline (Week 0) assessment in Study SC-3030, and an 
assessment at the study visit of interest or had terminated prematurely from Study SC-3030 before 
that study visit.  
The combined longitudinal results for clinical remission rates across Studies SC-3027 and SC-3030 are 
shown by visit up to Week 116 in Figure below. Randomized completer subjects are grouped according 
to their treatment assignment in Study SC-3027 (placebo, vedolizumab SC, or vedolizumab IV), noting 
that all subjects received open-label vedolizumab SC after Week 52 of Study SC-3027, when rolled 
over into the OLE study.

Clinical remission rate over time in nonrandomized Week 14 responder subjects with UC in Study SC-
3027 who rolled over to Study SC-3030 
The nonrandomized Week 14 responder subjects received open-label IV doses of vedolizumab 
induction treatment at Weeks 0 and 2 in Study SC-3027, were non-responders at Week 6 as assessed 
by a complete Mayo score, but did achieve a clinical response at Week 14 after receiving a third 
vedolizumab IV infusion at Week 6 in Study SC-3027. These subjects were eligible to enroll in Study 
SC-3030 (nonrandomized Week 14 responder UC subjects) and were treated with open-label 
vedolizumab SC on a once every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing regimen. 
Long-term clinical remission rates were calculated for the population of nonrandomized Week 14 
responder subjects who had a baseline (Week 0) assessment in Study SC-3030, and an assessment at 
the study visit of interest or had terminated prematurely from Study SC-3030 before that study visit.  
The combined longitudinal results for clinical remission rates across Studies SC-3027 and SC-3030 are 
shown by visit up to Week 118 in the below. Note that all subjects received open-label vedolizumab SC 
starting at Week 14 upon enrolling into OLE Study SC-3030. The figure shows that in general, 
nonrandomized Week-14 responder subjects who continued with open-label vedolizumab SC treatment 
in Study SC-3030 maintained high clinical remission rates over time. Interpretation of data beyond 
Week 118 is limited, because of the small number of subjects with evaluable data.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study MLN0002SC3027 was a completed phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 52 
week study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab SC as maintenance therapy in 216 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC (complete Mayo score of 6 to 12 with an endoscopic 
subscore ≥2) who achieved clinical response following 2 doses (at Weeks 0 and 2) of open-label 
vedolizumab IV therapy (induction phase). Responders at week 6 (clinical response defined as a 
reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline [Week 0]) at Week 6) were 
randomized in the maintenance phase including using vedolizumab SC 108mg Q2W or placebo (study 
powered for superiority of VDZ SC versus placebo) plus vedolizumab IV arm (within-study descriptive 
comparisons of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between vedolizumab IV and SC). An additional 
week 6 injection in patients non-responders at week 6 was allowed, response was assessed at week 
14. Week 14 responders (assessed by partial Mayo score) were included into the long term extension 
3030 OL study. Non-responders at week 14 entered into early termination. 
The study design is acceptable. Inclusion and exclusion criteria reflect the target population. According 
to entry criteria, TNF-alpha naïve as well as TNF-alpha antagonist failed patients could have been 
enrolled. 
The primary endpoint was clinical remission (defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no 
individual subscore >1 point at Week 52).  The endoscopic endpoint (mucosal healing at Week 52 in 
subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 
0 and 2) is included as first secondary endpoint applying a hierarchical approach. Although the updated 
EMA guideline refers to a primary endpoint meant as co-primary including both clinical remission as 
well as endoscopic remission the selection is acceptable for a line extension. The study is powered for 
the primary and first secondary endpoints and the sample size calculation is considered adequate. 
Secondary endpoints are acceptable as well as those defined as exploratory. 
It is of note that the MAH has included among exploratory endpoints some definition recommended by 
FDA within the draft guidance for industry (UC clinical trial endpoints) such as definition of remission 
by modified Mayo score and clinical remission by Mayo score without PGA assessment. To complement 
mucosal healing definition the MAH added a separate exploratory endpoint i.e. histological changes.  
383 Subjects have been enrolled in the Induction Phase,  216 subjects achieved response at week 6 
and were randomized into the maintenance phase (placebo: 56 subjects; vedolizumab SC: 106 
subjects; and vedolizumab IV: 54 subjects) and 37.5% of the placebo subjects, 72.6% and 75.9% of 
subjects in the vedolizumab SC and vedolizumab IV treatment groups, respectively, completed the 
study. The most frequent reason for discontinuation across all treatment groups was lack of efficacy, 
which was highest in the placebo group (80%) compared with 62.1% and 46.2% for vedolizumab SC 
and vedolizumab IV, respectively. Moreover, It is of note that a total of 86% out of 383 subjects 
treated in the Induction Phase are responders at week 6 or week 14, of these half of subjects (56%) 
out of 383 treated in the Induction Phase were responders at week 6 (vedolizumab infusion at week 0 
and 2) and roughly  30% of subjects much more (79.7%) were responders at week 14 (using one 
additional infusion). This supports the dosage regime reported in the SmPC of “at least 2 intravenous 
infusions”, suggesting that an additional infusion could increase efficacy. 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 62/93 
 
  
In the study conduct, significant protocol deviations were recorded in an important percentage of 
subjects ranging from 40 to 50% across groups, mainly affecting: i) procedures not performed per 
protocol (35 % in the total group) and ii) entry criteria (11%). Overall the high number of significant 
deviations could have affected study results and is not in support of quality standards of trial conduct. 
The PPS population (All FAS subjects who did not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would 
impact the study output significantly) which is the 77% of the total, and the sensitivity analysis using 
this population is therefore deemed important.   
Enrolled population: Demographic characteristics reflect the target population. Roughly 60% of 
subjects had severe UC (ie, Mayo score of 9 to 12) and 40% had moderate disease according to Mayo 
score grading. 
Baseline disease activity, as assessed by the complete Mayo score, was slightly imbalanced among 
study groups in favour of PLB and VDZ IV arms (severe Mayo: 64%, 57%, 68.5% in the PLB, VDZ SC 
and VDZ IV, respectively).   Most subjects had left-sided colitis (42.1%) or pancolitis (35.6%). The 
great majority (82%) of the studied population was in the category of baseline fecal calprotectin >500 
mg/g. Previous treatments: 62,5% had previous treatment with IMM and CCs. 61% of subjects didn’t 
have previous TNF-alpha use (naïve) and 39% had previous treatment failure (20% inadequate 
response and 15%, loss of response and only 3.2% intolerance). 
The  aim  of  study  MLN0002SC3031  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  vedolizumab  SC  as 
maintenance  therapy  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  Crohn’s  Disease  who  responded  to 
vedolizumab  intravenous  (IV)  induction  treatment  (vedolizumab  IV  300  mg  at  Weeks  0  and  2).  Only 
subjects  who  achieved  a  clinical  response  at  Week  6  were  randomized  into  the  maintenance  phase 
(randomization  2:1  ratio  to  double-blind  treatment  with  vedolizumab  SC  administered  once  every  2 
weeks (Q2W) or placebo SC Q2W). The study design was broadly similar to the design of the study in 
UC  but  no  internal  control  arm  using  vedolizumab  IV  was  included,  hampering  a  direct  comparison. 
Therefore, the only possible indirect comparison is the IV arm of the GEMINI 2 (C13007) study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In UC subjects (study MLN0002SC3027), administration of SC vedolizumab resulted in maintenance 
of clinical remission/response with amelioration of endoscopic scores, such as mucosal healing, 
compared to placebo. Results are considered clinically significant. 
The primary endpoint (clinical remission defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no 
individual subscore >1 point at Week 52) for this maintenance study was met: a higher remission rate 
was observed for vedolizumab SC subjects (46.2%) than for placebo subjects (14.3%), and this 
treatment difference was statistically significant (p <0.001) and clinically meaningful (delta 31.9). 
Clinical remission at week 52 was slightly higher in subjects randomized to vedolizumab SC 108mg 
Q2W than in the vedolizumab IV 300mg Q8W (32.3% versus 27.9%). Sensitivity analyses and 
exploratory analysis using FDA modified definitions as well as a PPS analysis showed consistent results. 
Subgroup analyses overall favour VDZ over PLB; subgroups of interest: baseline disease activity (risk 
difference estimate moderate 39.3 vs severe 26); clinical remission at week 6 (risk difference estimate 
yes 37.4 and no 27.6); prior anti-TNF alpha failure (risk difference estimate yes 28.1 no 32.1). 
Endoscopic response, evaluated by Mucosal healing (a Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≤1 point) at week 
52, was the first secondary endpoint according to the applied ranking. The percentage of subjects 
achieving mucosal healing was statistically higher in vedolizumab SC subjects (56.6%) as compared 
with subjects who received placebo 21.4%, and the magnitude of effect was clinically relevant. 
Vedolizumab SC treatment showed similar results as the vedolizumab IV treatment. 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 63/93 
 
  
The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Week 52 in the PPS population was similar to the 
FAS population.  A consistent treatment difference was observed between the placebo and 
vedolizumab SC (adjusted difference from placebo: 36.2 [95% CI: 20.5, 51.9], p<0.001). 
Different endpoints have been assessed with the aim of evaluating the durability of the effect 
(response/remission) being the treatment meant for chronic use and for an 
autoinflammatory/autoimmune disease. Below the results are summarized according to the different 
applied definitions:   
Durable (both Weeks 6 and 52) clinical response (according to total Mayo score) was statistically 
significantly higher in vedolizumab SC subjects versus PLB (difference from placebo 36.1%).  
Vedolizumab IV showed slightly higher results to vedolizumab SC (44.5 versus 36.1). Consistent 
results were achieved in the PPS population.  
As regards durable remission (defined as complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual subscore 
>1 point at both Weeks 6 and 52), a more stringent endpoint, a numerical trend in favour of 
vedolizumab was observed (15.1%) compared with the placebo group (5.4%). Vedolizumab IV showed 
similar results. 
At the CHMP request, the proportion of subjects who were in clinical remission in at least 80% of clinic 
visits including the final visit during the maintenance phase of the study was evaluated as exploratory 
endpoint, in order to gain information on durability/sustainable remission.  Of note, this definition was 
based on Partial Mayo Scores (defined as a partial Mayo score ≤2 and no individual subscore >1, 
excluding endoscopy. In the FAS population, a higher proportion of subjects treated with vedolizumab 
SC had sustained Maintenance of Efficacy (i.e. clinical remission in at least 80% of the study visits, 
delta from PLB 37.8 ; Clinical remission at ≥60% of study visits, delta from PLB 39.9; clinical response 
in at least of 60% of the study visits, delta from PLB 26.8) supporting the maintenance/persistence of 
the effect. Using alternative FDA definitions for remission, consistent results have been observed.  
The CHMP considered that the results did not support a substantial corticosteroid sparing effect of VDZ 
treatment; there was a favorable trend towards VDZ SC but the results were not statistically 
significant. Approximately 41.7% of the FAS subjects were on corticosteroids at baseline. 
Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (as subjects using oral corticosteroids at baseline who had 
discontinued oral corticosteroids and were in clinical remission based on the complete Mayo score at 
Week 52) which is considered an important although difficult achievement in these patients, showed 
only numerically higher rates in VDZ SC with a treatment difference of 20.6 from placebo. A similar 
treatment difference from placebo was observed for the vedolizumab IV group (20.2). This result was 
statistically significant in data obtained from GEMINI 1 (VDZ IV initial MAA study treatment difference 
17.6, IV Q8W dosing versus placebo), a possible reason for this difference could be the limited number 
of subjects in the subgroup evaluated for the corticosteroid sparing effect in the SC-3027 study.  
Also, the proportion of subjects who achieved clinical remission and were corticosteroid free for 90 or 
for 180 days was only numerically higher in VDZ SC treated subjects as compared to PLB (vedolizumab 
SC group 26.7%, placebo group (8.3%).  
Considering the two subgroups of interest (TNF-alpha naïve and failed subjects) similar results in the 
FAS analysis have been observed, with a magnitude of effect higher in the antiTNF-alpha naïve 
subjects. 
Results on calprotectin, a biomarker of inflammation, further support efficacy, showing increase of 
subjects within the less severe calprotectin (<250 μg/g) category among VDZ treated subjects. 
Of note, there seems to be a trend in reduction of hospitalization/surgery, which are important clinical 
goals, however numbers are limited to draw firm conclusions.

 CD subjects (study MLN0002SC3031).  
At D120 the MAH was asked to justify that the available PK data can support the extrapolation of efficacy 
and safety from IV to SC vedolizumab to patients with CD, considering that the PK/PD relationship may 
not be exactly the same in UC and CD or provide clinical data from CD patients. Accordingly results from 
study MLN0002SC3031 were provided to further support the indication. 
644 subjects were enrolled in the open-label vedolizumab IV induction period, and 410 were randomized 
into the double-blinded maintenance phase of the study.  
The primary endpoint clinical remission at Week 52, was met (VDZ 48.0% vs PLB 34.3%, respectively) 
(adjusted treatment difference 13.7 p.p.; 95% CI [3.8, 23.7, p = 0.008]). Of note, in the vedolizumab 
IV Q8W group of GEMINI 2 study, the treatment difference was similar: 17 p.p., PLB 22% and VDZ Q8W 
39%.   
When a more stringent and exploratory evaluation of remission (durable defined as remission at week 6 
and 52) was considered the difference between PLB and VDZ SC arms was very limited (5.6%).  
The  first  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  enhanced  clinical  response,  was  not  statistically  significant; 
placebo  response  is  very  high  (44.8%)  resulting  in  a  very  limited  difference  between  the  two  arms 
(treatment difference 7.3, p=0.167).  In the GEMINI 2 the treatment difference was higher (14%) and 
a PLB response of 30%.  
Statistical  inference  was  not  conducted,  and  nominal  p-values  are  reported  for  the  second 
(corticosteroid-free clinical remission) and third (clinical remission at Week 52 in TNF-α antagonist naïve 
subjects) secondary endpoints.  
Taking  into  account  this  methodological  limit/failure,  evaluation  of  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of 
corticosteroid-free  remission  at  Week  52  suggested  an  effect  of  vedolizumab  SC  over  placebo 
(vedolizumab SC, 45.3%; placebo, 18.2%; adjusted difference from placebo 27.1 p.p., 95% CI [11.9, 
42.3]; nominal p = 0.002).    
Looking at the endpoint of clinical remission at Week 52 in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
α) antagonist naïve subject population (third secondary endpoint, 50% of the enrolled population) 
again a very high PLB response is observed leading to very limited treatment difference (42.9% PLB and 
48.6% VDZ, treatment difference 4.3).  In subjects with prior antiTNF-alpha failure a larger difference 
is seen (VDZ 45.4 PLB 28.8 difference 17.6%) due to a lower PLB response while a very similar response 
is seen in the treatment arm.  
Reduction in inflammatory markers was observed for fecal calprotectin (increase of subjects having 
≤250mg/g as compared to higher cut-off levels) but not for CRP reduction in subjects having high CPR 
level at baseline (≥2.87mg/L). A positive trend in favour of vedolizumab was reported for some PROs 
and HQL measures. 
In conclusion, a high PLB response is seen across different endpoints negatively impacting the treatment 
difference  and  therefore  study  results.  However,  the  subjective  nature  of  CDAI  as  endpoint  is 
acknowledged and heterogeneity of placebo response is seen across trials using drugs for the treatment 
of IBD and is reported in literature. 
The  MAH  was  asked  during  the  procedure  to  further  discuss  the  added  value  of  Vedolizumab  to 
background therapy (corticosteroids and immunomodulators).  Analyses of study endpoints stratified by 
different background treatments were provided and did not suggest a significant impact of background 
therapy on vedolizumab efficacy results.  
Stratified analyses were also provided by dose category and type of steroid, showing that the majority 
of patients were treated with low doses. A comprehensive discussion of the added value of Vedolizumab 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 65/93 
 
  
to  background  therapy  (corticosteroids  and  immunomodulators)  from  a  clinical  perspective  was  not 
provided; however, overall the added value of vedolizumab SC over background therapies seems limited, 
although in line with the results observed with the IV formulation in particular for the primary endpoint. 
Supportive information is coming from the SC-3030 Study. As mentioned before, this study is an interim 
report  and  allows  the  inclusion  of  both  UC  and  CD  pts  coming  from  these  two  studies.  No  patient 
completed the study, 77% of subjects are still ongoing, 23% terminated early (primary reason being 
lack of efficacy 59% of the total population of early terminators). 
The MAH has provided an interim update of the in subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from Study SC-
3030 (A Phase 3b Open-Label Study to Determine the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Vedolizumab 
Subcutaneous in Subjects With Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease [CD]) through the data lock point 
(DLP) of 17 May 2019. Details about subjects’ disposition across arms were provided. Lack of efficacy 
remains the main reason for study interruption in both UC and CD subjects, at the IA (cut-off May 2019). 
Considering  the  previous  treatment  group,  subjects  who  interrupted  study  3030  were  similarly 
distributed.   
Data up to week 116 on clinical remission in subjects with UC who completed 52 weeks of treatment in 
Study SC-3027 and rolled over to Study SC-3030 (randomized completers) and in nonrandomized Week 
14 responder subjects who rolled over to Study SC-3030 support a trend in the maintenance of the effect 
although less pronounced in the nonrandomized week 14 responders.  
Data on PRO analysis in both subjects’ groups are supportive of a positive trend over time. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of subcutaneous vedolizumab treatment (108 mg administered by subcutaneous injection 
once every 2 weeks following at least 2 intravenous infusions) as maintenance treatment of patients 
with moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis 
factoralpha (TNFα) antagonist is sufficiently demonstrated. Entyvio (either as IV or SC) seems less 
efficacious in Crohn’s disease compared to ulcerative colitis. No direct comparison has been made 
between Entyvio SC and Entyvio IV in Crohn’s disease. Indirect comparison with previous studies of 
Entyvio IV, suggest that the efficacy in both indications appears similar for Entyvio SC and Entyvio IV. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  assessment  of  vedolizumab  SC  includes  safety  data  from  3  phase  3  studies  and  5 
phase 1 studies. The phase 3 studies include pivotal Study SC-3027 in subjects with UC, ongoing Study 
SC-3031 (blinded study in subjects with CD, week 52 database lock provided), and ongoing Study SC-
3030  (OLE  study  from  parent  Studies  SC-3027  [UC]  and  SC-3031  [CD]).  Pivotal  Study  SC-3027  was 
assessed independently and as part of 2 pooled data sets listed below. Safety data from Study SC-3031 
in subjects with CD have been provided within the responses to D120 LoQ.

Demographic Characteristics:  
The majority of patients were male, white and <65 years old. Previous therapies included corticosteroids 
and immunomodulators for more than half of subjects in pool1 and pool 2 and TNF-α antagonist in 42% 
and 52% of subjects, respectively, in pool 1 and 2. Overall, demographic baseline characteristics seem 
to be well balanced among placebo and treatment arms in Study SC-3027. However, it was noted that 
a higher proportion of Asian were included in placebo arm (23.2%) compared to Vedolizumab SC (13.2%) 
and IV (9.3%) arms.

73.5% of CD subjects, compared to 76.1 of subjects in the PLB arm, experienced TEAEs of which the 
majority were mild or moderate in intensity (32.8% and 34.3% of subjects, respectively for placebo 
and 32.4% and 36.0%, respectively for vedolizumab SC). 
Pool 1 (UC) 
Overall, 185 subjects (61.1%) reported any TEAE in Pool 1 (see Table below). UC, the condition under 
study, was the most common TEAE reported in 42 subjects (13.9%) followed by nasopharyngitis in 31 
subjects  (10.2%),  upper  respiratory  infections  in  21  subjects  (6.9%),  and  anaemia  in  20  subjects 
(6.6%). 
Pool2 (UC/CD) 
Overall, 367 subjects (59.9%) reported any TEAE in Pool 2 (see Table below). UC and CD, the conditions 
under  study,  were  among  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs,  reported  in  42  subjects  (6.9%)  and 
28 subjects (4.6%), respectively. Nasopharyngitis was reported in 45 subjects (7.3%), followed by upper 
respiratory infection in 37 subjects (6%) and arthralgia in 28 subjects (4.6%). Abdominal pain, anaemia, 
diarrhoea, and headache were reported in ≥3% of subjects. Bronchitis, cough, nausea, back pain, blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased, influenza, and injection site reaction were reported in ≥2% subjects. 
AEs by Intensity  
Study SC-3027 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 69/93 
 
  
Within each treatment group, most subjects developed AEs that were considered by the investigator to 
be mild or moderate in intensity (32.1% and 39.3% of subjects, respectively, for placebo; 25.5% and 
34.0%,  respectively,  for  vedolizumab  SC;  and  31.5%  and  42.6%,  respectively  for  vedolizumab  IV). 
Severe AEs occurred in 5.4% of subjects in the placebo group, 5.7% in the vedolizumab SC group, and 
1.9% in the vedolizumab IV group. Most of the severe cases in the placebo and vedolizumab SC groups 
were  in  the  SOC  of  gastrointestinal  disorders,  mostly  due  to  UC.  One  (0.5%)  severe  infection 
(peritonitis, in the vedolizumab SC group) was reported in the study.  
Pool 1 (UC) 
Most TEAEs were mild (31.7%) or moderate in intensity (24.1%). Severe TEAEs occurred in 16 subjects 
(5.3%).  The  most  frequent  severe  AEs  occurred  in  the  gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  (10 subjects, 
3.3%) with UC being the most commonly reported severe TEAE (9 subjects, 3.0%). Other severe TEAEs 
included  anaemia  in  3  (1.0%),  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased  in  2 (0.7%),  tachycardia  in  1 
(0.3%),  acute  abdomen  in  1  (0.3%),  large  intestine  perforation  in  1 (0.3%),  peritonitis  in  1  (0.3%), 
appendicitis in 1 (0.3%), and alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased in 1 (0.3%) subject. 
Pool 2 
Most  subjects  develop  ped  TEAEs  that  were  mild  (30.3%)  or  moderate  (24.1%)  in  intensity.  Severe 
TEAEs occurred in 33 subjects (5.4%). Most severe TEAEs occurred in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC 
(21 subjects, 3.4%) with UC (9 subjects, 1.5%) and CD (7 subjects, 1.1%) being the most commonly 
reported severe TEAEs.  
TRAEs  
Study SC-3027 
AEs considered related to study treatment were reported in a total of 47 subjects (21.8%) including 28 
subjects (26.4%) in the vedolizumab SC group, 9 subjects (16.7%) in the vedolizumab IV group, and 
10 subjects (17.9%) in the placebo group. Most AEs were in gastrointestinal disorders (5.6%), infections 
and infestations (5.6%), and general disorders and administration site conditions (6%) SOCs.  
Study SC-3031 
AEs considered related to study treatment were reported in 19.3% of subjects in the vedolizumab SC 
group  and  in  14.9%  in  the  placebo  group,  mainly  due  to  injection-site  reactions,  all  of  which  were 
considered drug related in the vedolizumab SC group.

Study SC-3027 
Infections were reported in 79 of 216 subjects (36.6%) in Study SC-3027 (35.7%, 36.8%, and 37.0% 
in the placebo, vedolizumab SC, and vedolizumab IV groups, respectively). 
In the vedolizumab SC group, the most common PTs of infections were nasopharyngitis (10.4%) and 
upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (9.4%).  Nasopharyngitis  was  reported  in  19.6%  of  subjects  in  the 
placebo group and 18.5% of subjects in the IV groups. Upper respiratory tract infection was reported 
in  1.8%,  3.7%  and  9.4%  of  subject  in  the  placebo,  IV  and  SC  groups,  respectively.  Pneumonia  was 
reported with an overall frequency of 2.3% (2.8% in vedolizumab SC group, 1.8% and 1.9% in placebo 
and vedolizumab IV groups, respectively). 
Study SC-3031 
A slightly higher number of infections were reported in the placebo-treated subjects (34.3%) than in 
the vedolizumab SC–treated subjects (31.3%). The most frequently reported infection AESIs were in the 
HLT  of  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (including  PTs  of  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract 
EMA/220524/2020

infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute sinusitis, and rhinitis) and occurred more frequently in 
vedolizumab  SC–treated  subjects  (17.8%)  than  in  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (14.2%).    The  most 
common  PTs  of  infection  in  both  groups  were  nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infections. 
These  were  more  frequent  in  the  vedolizumab  SC  group  (9.1%  and  6.2%,  respectively)  than  in  the 
placebo group (4.5% and 3.7%, respectively). Treatment-related AEs of infections in the vedolizumab 
SC group included abscess intestinal, anal abscess, Clostridium difficile infection, tongue fungal infection, 
bronchitis, pneumonia, tinea versicolour, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection 
(each in 1 subject, 0.4%).

In  Pool  2  SAEs  of  infection  were  reported  in  13  subjects  (2.1%),  5  UC  and  8  CD.  These  included 
appendicitis  in  2  subjects  with  UC  (0.7%);  pneumonia  in  2 subjects  with  CD  (0.3%);  and  abdominal 
abscess, abdominal wall abscess, anal abscess, peritonitis, rectal abscess, Clostridium difficile infection, 
herpes zoster, influenza, and tonsillitis in 1 subject (0.2%) each. Treatment-related infection SAEs were 
reported in only 2 subjects including 1 subject each with Clostridium difficile infection and influenza.  
Malignancies 
Six subjects (1.0%) reported 7 TEAEs in the SOC of neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl 
cysts and polyps) in Pool 2 (three UC patients and three CD patients). However, they were considered 
all not to be related to study treatment by the investigators. 
Hypersensitivity (Including Injection Site Reactions and Infusion Reactions)                
In Study SC-3027 all AEs were reported as nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-
related TEAEs  were  reported  for  7  subjects  (3.2%)  overall,  6  from the  vedolizumab  SC  group  and 1 
from the placebo group. Injection site rash and pruritus were reported in 2 subjects (1.9%), and all other 
AEs including peripheral swelling, eczema, erythema, and urticaria were reported in 1 subject (0.9%) 
each in the vedolizumab SC group. No subject reported any treatment-related TEAE of hypersensitivity 
in the vedolizumab IV group.  
There was no case of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction. None of the AEs led to study discontinuation. 
Injection-Related  AEs: Overall,  12  subjects  (5.6%)  reported  an  injection  site  reaction,  11  (10.4%) 
subjects in the vedolizumab SC group and 1 subject in vedolizumab IV group.

In Study SC-3031, 37 subjects (9.0%) experienced a hypersensitivity reaction (13 subjects, 9.7%   
in placebo-treated subjects and 24 subjects, 8.7% in vedolizumab SC–treated subjects). Most AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity. An event of seasonal allergy, in a subject treated with vedolizumab SC, 
was considered severe. There were no cases of anaphylaxis during the maintenance phase. Overall, 10 
of 409 subjects (2.4%) reported an injection site reaction and these reports were more frequent in 
the vedolizumab SC group (8 subjects, 2.9%) than in the placebo group (2 subjects, 1.5%). 
In Pool 2 hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 59 subjects (9.6%). The most frequently reported 
reactions were rash (9 subjects [1.5%]), pruritus (6 subjects [1.0%]), and eczema (6 subjects [1.0%]).

Liver injury 
2  subjects  in  vedolizumab  SC  group  in  Study  SC-3027  and  4  subjects  in  pool  1  reported  liver  injury 
AESIs. In Study SC-3031 there were 8 subjects (2.9%) with liver injury AESIs in the vedolizumab SC 
group. Treatment-related liver injury TEAEs (per the investigator) were reported for 2 subjects in the 
vedolizumab SC group. 
The  number  increased  in  pool  2,  where  11  subjects  (1.8%)  experienced  liver  injury  with  the  most 
frequently reported AEs being gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5 subjects [0.8%]). 
Pool 2: Liver injury AESIs were reported in 11 subjects (1.8%) in Pool 2 (UC/CD). The most frequently 
reported AEs were gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5 subjects [0.8%]), LFT increased (3 subjects 
[0.5%]),  and  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  (2  subjects  [0.3%]).  Aspartate  aminotransferase 
increase, hepatic  enzyme  increased,  and hyperbilirubinemia  were  reported  in 1  subject  each.  Most  of 
these were mild or moderate in intensity except for severe TEAEs of alanine aminotransferase increased, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased in a single subject. All events 
were  reported  as  nonserious.  One  event  each  of  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  and 
gamma-glutamyl transferase increased lead to study discontinuation. There were no cases of Hy’s law 
abnormality.

There were no subjects diagnosed with PML. 
Laboratory findings 
In Study SC-3027, as well as in pool 1 and pool 2, no clinically relevant differences between the treatment 
groups  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  at  any  time  point  were  observed  for  any  hematology  and 
chemistry parameter.

Safety in special populations 
AEs by Age 
Pool 2: A total of 18/23 subjects (78.3%) aged ≥65 years reported an AE. In subjects aged ≥65 years, 
bronchitis,  nausea,  abdominal  pain,  anaemia,  arthralgia,  pneumonia,  vomiting,  cough,  diarrhoea, 
gastroenteritis, hyponatraemia, hypertension, large intestine polyp, oedema peripheral, and urinary tract 
infection  were  reported  with  higher  frequencies  that  in  subjects  aged  <65  years.  However,  the  small 
sample size of subjects aged ≥65 years precludes an appropriate comparison between the age groups. 
A incidence of AEs was observed, both in pool 1 and pool 2, in subjects between 65 and 74 years of age 
compared to subjects younger than 65 years, in particular in the infections and infestations (54.5% vs 
EMA/220524/2020

32.9% in pool 1 and 48.4% vs 29.9% in pool 2) and gastrointestinal disorders SOCs (36.4% vs 26.4% 
in pool1 and 35.5% vs 25.9% in pool 2). The analysis in subjects ≥75 years of age is hampered by the 
very small numbers of patients. In a new/updated safety pool (pool B) with data cut-off of 17 May 2019, 
including  all  SC-3027/SC-3031  vedolizumab  SC  and  all  SC-3030  subjects  with  UC  or  CD,    AEs  in  the 
infections and infestations SOC were confirmed to be more frequent in the elderly age group (55.6% [25 
of 45]) than in the adult age group (41.5% [318 of 766]), even though the difference between groups 
has narrowed from that observed in the previous data cut and it was not confirmed by the long-term 
safety study (C13008). 
AEs by BMI 
Pool  2:  TEAEs  considered  related  to  study  medication  were  more  frequent  in  subjects  with  a  BMI  of 
≥30 kg/m2 (24 [25.0%]) than in subjects with a BMI of <30 kg/m2 (96 subjects [18.6%]). In contrast, 
the TESAEs that lead to treatment discontinuation in subjects with a BMI of <30 kg/m2 were greater (9 
subjects [1.7%]) than in subjects with a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 (0). However, these differences could be due 
to the smaller sample size of subjects with BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 compared with subjects 
with BMI <30 kg/m2 in the infections and infestations (40% vs 34% in pool 1 and 37.5% vs 29.6% in 
pool 2) and gastrointestinal disorders SOCs (42.9% vs 25% in pool 1 and 32.3% vs 25.1% in pool 2)  
and it was also confirmed in the newly submitted recent data pool (Pool B: infection AEs 39.3% vs 
58.1%) and by the long-term safety study (C13008). Therefore, this information has been added 
under the section 4.8 of the SmPCs. 
AEs for Subjects with Previous TNF-α Antagonist Use  
Overall, a slightly higher incidence of AEs was reported in anti-TNF-α experienced subjects compared to 
those without previous TNF-α antagonist use both in pool 1 (57.9 events per 100 P/Y vs 49.2 events per 
100 P/Y) and pool 2 (66.7 events per 100 P/Y vs 55.3 events per 100 P/Y). The most common TEAEs 
(≥3%) that occurred more in anti-TNF-α-experienced subjects than anti-TNF-α-naïve subjects included 
UC, nasopharyngitis, cough, headache, diarrhoea, influenza, oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, chills, 
haemorrhoids, nausea, and pharyngitis. 
The rate of serious infections was higher in anti–TNFα experienced group compared to anti–TNFα naïve 
subjects in both pool 1 (2.3% vs 1.1%) and pool 2 (3.1% vs 1%), including no gastrointestinal serious 
infections such as herpes zoster, influenza, pneumonia (2 reports) and tonsillitis. 
The  more  recent  data  pool  (pool  B)  confirms  a  more  frequently  reported  SAEs  in  the  Infections  and 
infestations SOC in the anti–TNFα–experienced subjects (4.5% [19 of 420]) than in the anti–TNFα–naïve 
subjects (2.8% [11 of 391]), without a specific trend, even if the difference between groups has narrowed 
from that observed in the previous interim data cut. Moreover, a slight difference between groups was 
also observed in the vedolizumab IV data from the long-term safety Study C13008 (10% vs 8%).

a Subjects received 2 doses of vedolizumab and were randomized to placebo at Week 6. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Vedolizumab  is  an  antibody  and  does  not  modulate  cytokine  production;  therefore,  the  potential  to 
directly affect or be affected by cytochrome P450 enzymes is low. The potential for vedolizumab to be 
affected by other drugs commonly used to treat the IBD (azathioprine, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 
and aminosalicylates) was assessed through population PK modeling using data from phase 3 studies. 
Immunomodulator  coadministration  was  not  a  predictor  of  clearance  for  vedolizumab.  No  dedicated 
drug-drug interaction studies were conducted before, or since, the IV submission.

Table 29:AEs Leading to Study Discontinuation by SOC and PT (SAF) 
Study SC-3031 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation was 22 of 409 subjects (5.4%); of these 
22 subjects, 10 discontinued because of CD disease worsening or exacerbation. This was higher in the 
placebo  group  than  in  the  vedolizumab  SC  group  (placebo:  7  subjects,  5.2%;  vedolizumab  SC:  3 
subjects,  1.1%).  Four  of  the  remaining  12  subjects  who  discontinued  study  medication  were  in  the 
placebo group. The remaining 8 subjects in the vedolizumab SC group discontinued the study because 
of  ileal  stenosis  and  abscess  intestinal  (both  in  1  subject),  anal  fistula  (2  subjects),  subileus,  blood 
creatinine increased, lymphopenia, white blood cell count increased, and hypersensitivity. 
Pool 2 
A total of 17 subjects (2.8%) discontinued from the studies included in Pool 2 because of a TEAE. UC 
and CD were the most common reason for discontinuation (11 subjects, 1.8%). Anaemia in 2 subjects 
(0.3%)  and  arthralgia,  increased  alanine  aminotransferase,  increased  gamma-glutamyl  transferase, 
increased  blood  alkaline  phosphatase,  B-cell  lymphoma  and  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  rapidly 
progressive  glomerulonephritis,  and  headache  (1 subject  each)  were  the  other  reasons  for 
discontinuation. 
In total, 9 subjects (1.5%) were withdrawn from study treatment because of a TRAE mainly due to UC 
(4 subjects, 0.7%) and CD (2 subjects, 0.3%). The remaining 3 subjects discontinued treatment because 
of arthralgia (1 subject), headache (1 subject), and increased alanine aminotransferase, gamma-
glutamyl transferase increased and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (1 subject).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  subcutaneous  vedolizumab  is based  on  data  from  the  pivotal  phase  3  study SC-
3027 in UC patients and the ongoing Study SC-3030 (OLE study from parent Studies SC-3027 [UC] and 
SC-3031 [CD]), which are presented in pool 1, including data only from UC patients, and pool 2, including 
data  from  both  UC  and  CD  patients  (the  latter  only  from  the  OLE  Study  SC-3030),  supporting,  the 
assessment  of  long  term vedolizumab  SC  safety  profile.  Safety  data  from  Study  SC-3031  in  subjects 
with CD have been provided within the responses to D120 LoQ. 
Across  studies  SC-3027  and  SC-3030  (Pool  2),  most  subjects  [523  (85.3%)]  were  exposed  to 
vedolizumab SC for ≥6 months and only 44.5% of subjects were exposed for ≥12 months. Updates on 
long term safety from the long-term study 3030 OL will be provided post authorisation as outlined in the 
RMP. Most patients were male, white and <65 years old. Previous therapies included corticosteroids and 
immunomodulators for more than half of subjects and TNF-α antagonist in 42% and 52% of subjects, 
respectively, in pool 1 and 2. Overall, demographic and disease baseline characteristics seem to be well 
balanced among placebo and treatment arms in Study SC-3027. 
About 60% of subjects in Study SC-3027 SC group, pool 1 and pool 2 experienced TEAEs. The spectrum 
of vedolizumab SC AEs seems to be overall similar to that reported for vedolizumab IV formulation. The 
most  frequently  reported  TEAE  in  Study  SC-3027  was  colitis  ulcerative,  which  however  was  most 
common  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  next  most  common  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  anaemia, 
and upper respiratory tract infection. The incidence of AEs between the vedolizumab SC and vedolizumab 
IV groups was generally similar, even if some differences were noted between the groups (for example, 
headache was reported in the 8.5% of subjects in the vedolizumab SC group but none in the IV group 
and  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  was  reported  in  the  9.4%  of  the  SC  group  and  3.7%  of  the 
vedolizumab IV group), probably by chance. TEAEs did not changed in the long time, with reference to 
type and frequency, as observed in pool 1. Moreover, no clinically significant differences were observed 
between pool 1 and pool 2, where also CD patients were included, apart from a slightly higher incidence 
of abdominal pain and bronchitis (respectively, 4 and 3 events/100 patients-year in pool 1 compared to 
2.3 and 1.7 events/100 patients-year in pool 2).  
Most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity, however severe events were more frequent in 
vedolizumab SC arm (5.7%) compared to vedolizumab IV (1.9%) arm, but similar to placebo (5.4%). 
The  majority  of  the  severe  cases  in  the  vedolizumab  SC  groups  were  in  the  SOC  of  gastrointestinal 
disorders mostly due to UC, suggesting a potential lack of efficacy in about 5% of subjects in placebo 
and  3.8%  of  subjects  in  SC  groups  (refer  also  to  efficacy  section),  which  has  not  been  observed  in 
vedolizumab IV group. From Study SC-3031, 73.5% of CD subjects, compared to 76.1 of subjects in the 
PLB arm, experienced TEAEs of which the majority were mild or moderate in intensity (32.8% and 34.3% 
of subjects, respectively for placebo and 32.4% and 36.0%, respectively for vedolizumab SC).   
Related TEAEs were observed in a higher rate of subjects in vedolizumab SC arm (26.4%) compared to 
placebo  (17.9%)  and  vedolizumab  IV  (16.7%)  arms  in  Study  SC-3027.  The  majority  of  these  events 
were in gastrointestinal disorders (5.6%), infections and infestations (5.6%), and general disorders and 
administration site conditions (6%) SOCs and the difference in TREAEs between SC and IV administration 
seems to be driven mainly by GI disorders (7.5% and 1.9% in vedolizumab SC and IV, respectively) and  
general disorders and administration site conditions (10.4% vs 1.9%, respectively). In the latter case it 
was expected due in particular to Injection site reactions. A higher percentage of CD subjects in Study 
SC-3031 had drug-related AEs in the vedolizumab SC group (19.3%) than in the placebo group (14.9%), 
mainly due to injection-site reactions, all of which were considered drug related in the vedolizumab SC 
group. In pool 1 and pool 2 a similar rate of subjects reported TRAEs (25.4% and 20%, respectively) 
with  the  most  frequent  being  Colitis  Ulcerative  followed  by  injection  site  reactions  and  injection  site 
erythema.  
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 80/93 
 
  
SAEs were reported in about 10% of subjects in the SC-3027 study and 8.4% of subjects in SC-3031 
study, as well as in pool 1 and pool 2, with a similar frequency across groups. Gastrointestinal disorders 
by SOC, with UC by PT, was the most common reported TESAEs in SC-3027 study as well as in pool 1 
and 2. Anaemia was also reported, with a similar incidence between the vedolizumab SC and placebo 
groups. Overall, 9 subjects in pool 2 experienced treatment-related SAEs. One death was reported during 
Study SC-3030 (pulmonary embolism) considered not related to study treatment by the investigator. 
Overall, 127 subjects (41.9%) in Pool 1 reported an AESI of which Infections were the most common 
AESI  (34.7%),  followed  by  hypersensitivity  reactions  (13.2%)  and  injection  site  reactions  (7.6%).  A 
similar picture was observed in pool 2 with only a slight major number of liver injury increase (1.8 events 
P/Y) compared to pool 1 (1.1 events P/Y). 
Infections:  In  Study  SC-3027  infections  were  reported  with  a  similar  frequency  across  arms  (35.7%, 
36.8%, and 37.0% in the placebo, vedolizumab SC, and vedolizumab IV groups, respectively) with the 
most frequent being in the HLT of upper respiratory tract infections. Similar percentages were reported 
in CD subjects from SC-3031 Study. In the vedolizumab SC group, the most common PTs of infections 
were  nasopharyngitis  (10.4%)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (9.4%).  Upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (as PT) and pneumonia were reported with a higher frequency of subjects in SC group (9.4% 
and  2.8%,  respectively)  compared  to  placebo  (1.8%  each)  and  the  IV  (3.7%  and  1.9%)  groups. 
However, infections were reported as related AEs only in 4 patients (3.8%) in the vedolizumab SC group 
(anal abscess, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia and ear infection, 0.9% each). No increases of frequencies 
in infections and infestations were observed in the long-term safety evaluation as reported in pool 1. In 
pool 2, bronchitis occurred more frequently, suggesting a possible higher incidence in CD patients. The 
majority of infections were mild or moderate in intensity and 2 subjects (0.7%) had severe infections. 
In Study SC-3031 2 infection AESIs led to discontinuation of study participation in the vedolizumab SC 
group,  of  which  one  was  considered  related  to  treatment  (anal  abscess).  Treatment-related  AEs  of 
infections  in  the  vedolizumab  SC  group  from  Study  3031  included  abscess  intestinal,  anal  abscess, 
Clostridium  difficile  infection,  tongue  fungal  infection,  bronchitis,  pneumonia,  tinea  versicolour, 
nasopharyngitis,  sinusitis,  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (each  in  1  subject,  0.4%). 
Treatment-related infection SAEs were reported in 2 subjects in Pool 2, including 1 subject each with 
Clostridium  difficile  infection  and  influenza.  Overall,  ADRs  of  infections  and  infestations  are  already 
reflected in the SmPC including SAEs of infection. 
Malignancies: Overall, six subjects in pool 2 (three UC patients and three CD patients) experienced TEAEs 
in the SOC of neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified. However, they were considered all not to 
be related to study treatment by the investigators. A wording on malignancies is included in 4.4 and 4.8 
sections of the SmPC.  
Hypersensitivity: 11.6% of subjects in Study SC-3027 and 9% in Study SC-3031 experienced at least 1 
hypersensitivity TEAE. These AEs were more common in the vedolizumab-treated groups than in subjects 
treated with placebo and were comparable between the vedolizumab SC and IV groups (15.1% vs 13.0%, 
respectively). There was no case of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction. The most common reported 
TEAEs of hypersensitivity were in the SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which occurred 
more frequently in vedolizumab arms (9.4% and 13% in SC and IV vedolizumab arm, respectively) than 
in the placebo arm. Hypersensitivity reactions in the SOC of General disorders and administration site 
conditions  (peripheral  swelling,  injection  site  rush  and  oedema  peripheral  by  PT)  were  reported  in 
vedolizumab SC group. Injection site reactions were reported also in Pool 1 (7.6% of subjects; 6.6 events 
per 100 P/Y) and pool 2 (4.7% of subjects; 4.8 events per 100 P/Y) with the most frequent event being 
Injection  site  erythema  (2.3  and  1.8,  respectively).  Injection  site  reactions  have  been  added  and 
described in 4.8 section of the SmPC which is agreed, and some examples of injections site reactions 
have been added.  
EMA/220524/2020

Liver injury: 2 subjects in vedolizumab SC group in Study SC-3027 and 4 subjects in pool 1 reported 
liver injury AESIs. The number increased in pool 2, where 11 subjects (1.8%) experienced liver injury 
with the most frequently reported AEs being gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5 subjects [0.8%]). 
Severe TEAEs of alanine aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and blood alkaline 
phosphatase  increased  occurred  in  a  single  subject.  Moreover,  in  pool  2  alanine  aminotransferase 
increased  and  LFT  increased  in  2 subjects  each,  and  hyperbilirubinemia,  aspartate  aminotransferase 
increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, and hepatic enzyme increased in 1 subject each were 
considered  related  to  the  study  treatment.    At  the  request  of  the  PRAC,  a  cumulative  review  of 
vedolizumab  liver  injury  reports  has  been  conducted  by  the  Applicant,  retrieving  438  case  reports 
(530 AEs). However, for the 66.4% of these the causal association was in doubt due to the presence of 
confounding factors. This analysis was accepted by the PRAC and that liver injury cases will be further 
monitored  with  no  request  to  include  liver  injuries  in  the  product  SmPC  at  this  stage  (Reference: 
EMA/PRAC/ 369233/2018). 
PML: There were no subjects diagnosed with PML.  
No  clinically  relevant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  and  across  pooling  in  mean  changes 
from baseline at any time point were observed for any hematology and chemistry parameter. However, 
decreased  red  blood  cells,  hemoglobin,  and  hematocrit  were  reported  in  some  subjects  in  the 
vedolizumab  SC  group  of  Study  SC-3027,  Pool  1,  and  Pool  2.  In  particular,  in  Study  SC-3027  was 
observed a marked reduction in hemoglobin in a slightly higher rate of subjects in vedolizumab SC group 
(13.2%) than in placebo (8.9%) and vedolizumab IV (7.4%) groups. Moreover, increased platelet counts 
were also more common in vedolizumab SC group (8,5%) than in placebo (7.1%) and in vedolizumab 
IV (1.9%) groups. However, no AEs related to abnormal coagulation were reported in these subjects. As 
stated by the Applicant, anaemia may be due to disease under study and thrombocytosis may be due to 
ongoing inflammation. Moreover, absolute lymphocyte counts <0.5 × 109/L has been observed in 2.6% 
of combined Study SC-3027 and SC-3030 subjects, and in 1.1% of Study SC-3031 subjects. However, 
at  present  a  causal  association  between  the  reduction  lymphocyte  counts  <0.5 × 109/L  and  the 
occurrence of infections has not been demonstrated.  
 A slightly higher frequency in the most common reported TEAEs (SOCs of infections and GI disorders) 
were noted in the elderly as well as in subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2.  
Overall, a slightly higher incidence of AEs was reported in anti-TNF-α experienced subjects compared to 
those without previous TNF-α antagonist use both in pool 1 (57.9 events per 100 P/Y vs 49.2 events per 
100 P/Y) and pool 2 (66.7 events per 100 P/Y vs 55.3 events per 100 P/Y). The most common TEAEs 
(≥3%) that occurred more in anti-TNF-α-experienced subjects than anti-TNF-α-naïve subjects included 
UC, nasopharyngitis, cough, headache, diarrhoea, influenza, oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, chills, 
haemorrhoids,  nausea,  and  pharyngitis.    Even  though    the  small  number  of  serious  infection  events 
makes  difficult  to  drawn  firm  conclusion,  a  higher  frequency  of  serious  infections  in  anti–TNFα–
experienced (rate of serious infections in pool 1: 2.3% and pool 2: 3.1%) compared to anti–TNFα–naïve 
subjects (pool 1: 1.1% and pool 2: 1%), was noted and confirmed in the more recent data pool (pool B) 
as well as in the vedolizumab IV data from the long-term safety Study C13008 (10% vs 8%). At present 
there is not sufficient evidence for the inclusion of a warning in 4.4 section of the SmPC advising on the 
higher potential risk of serious infection in the anti–TNFα–experienced population with vedolizumab use. 
However, information on this slightly higher incidence of serious infection was included in 4.8 section of 
the SmPC. Moreover, the Applicant states that will continue to monitor TEAEs of infections in the ongoing 
long-term safety study (SC-3030) and this is agreed. 
Vedolizumab SC safety profile seems to be not negatively influenced by AVA  positivity with regard to 
hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions. 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 82/93 
 
  
Discontinuation  due  to  AEs  in  Study  SC-3027  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  group  than  in 
either vedolizumab group (placebo: 8.9%; vedolizumab SC: 3.8%; vedolizumab IV: 1.9%), because of 
UC disease worsening or exacerbation in the majority of cases. One subject (from the vedolizumab SC 
group)  discontinued  because  of  a  severe,  nonserious  AE  of  increased  liver  enzymes,  which  was 
considered by the investigator as related to the study drug. The overall incidence of AEs leading to study 
discontinuation in Study SC-3031 was 22 of 409 subjects (5.4%); of these 22 subjects, 10 discontinued 
because  of  CD  disease  worsening  or  exacerbation.  This  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the 
vedolizumab SC group (placebo: 7 subjects, 5.2%; vedolizumab SC: 3 subjects, 1.1%). 8 subjects in 
the vedolizumab SC group discontinued the study because of ileal stenosis and abscess intestinal (both 
in 1 subject), anal fistula (2 subjects), subileus, blood creatinine increased, lymphopenia, white blood 
cell count increased, and hypersensitivity. 
In pool 1 and pool 2 there was not an increase of discontinuation and the reasons were for the most part 
UC and CD and anemia.  
From the D120 responses the MAH completed the second interim analysis of the long-term Study SC-
3030,  which  seems  to  not  show  new  safety  signals  compared  to  the  previous  analysis.  Overall,  the 
incidence of the majority of TEAEs were similar between UC and CD populations, even if some imbalances 
in frequency presentation were observed. The exposure–adjusted incidence rates for the most common 
TEAEs, decreased within the UC population and were quite similar (or slightly increased in some cases) 
for the CD population. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of vedolizumab SC as maintenance treatment in UC and CD subjects seems to 
be in line to that of IV administration, with nasopharyngitis, headache, anaemia, and upper respiratory 
tract  infection  being  the  most  common  AEs.  However,  injection  site  reactions  were  reported  more 
frequently with SC administration, as expected, and therefore have been included in 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No clinically significant differences were noted between pool 1 and pool 2.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Within this line extension the MAH is seeking approval for the Vedolizumab subcutaneous Solution for 
Injection in Pre-filled Syringe as a new liquid formulation for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and 
Crohn’s Disease in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an 
inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. The objective of vedolizumab SC is to allow the option 
for patients and health care providers (HCPs) to use either registered vedolizumab IV or the proposed 
vedolizumab SC as maintenance therapy after a response has been achieved with vedolizumab IV. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately 
to severely active UC or CD for whom conventional treatments have failed, including 
immunomodulators, corticosteroids, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonists. 
Subcutaneous vedolizumab has now been developed for the maintenance treatment of the same 
patient population for which vedolizumab IV is already approved.  
Pharmacological treatments with SC routes of administration provide convenience for patients, HCPs, 
and caregivers by removing the time, logistics, and burden required for IV infusion.  
At present there are alternative SC therapies available for vedolizumab second line indication. 
EMA/220524/2020

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The development program consists of pivotal study MLN0002SC-3027 and a roll-over long-term study 
MLN0002SC-3030.  Furthermore, in support of the indication in Crohns Disease data from ongoing 
study MLN0002SC-3031 were provided. 
MLN0002SC-3027: The efficacy and safety of subcutaneous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopic sub 
score ≥ 2) was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating 
efficacy endpoints at week 52. Enrolled patients had failed at least 1 conventional therapy, including 
corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNFα antagonists (including primary non responders). 
Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators were 
permitted.  
The primary study endpoint clinical remission was defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤ 2 points and 
no individual subscore > 1 point at 52 weeks in patients who had achieved a clinical response at 
week 6 of intravenous vedolizumab induction treatment. Clinical response was defined as a reduction 
in complete Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in 
rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤ 2 points and no 
individual subscore >1 point. 
Patients who achieved clinical response to open-label treatment with intravenous vedolizumab at 
week 6 were eligible to be randomised. For the evaluation of the week 52 endpoints, patients were 
randomised and treated in a double-blind fashion (2:1:1) to 1 of the following regimens: subcutaneous 
vedolizumab 108 mg every 2 weeks, intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, or placebo.  
Study MLN0002SC-3031 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in CD 
patients, which is currently ongoing and for which data from the week 52 database lock have been 
analyzed and presented within this submission in support of the CD indication. 
Patients who completed study MLN0002SC-3027 or study MLN0002SC-3030 were eligible to enrol in 
the ongoing, open-label extension study MLN0002SC-3031 to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of 
subcutaneous vedolizumab treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. The duration 
of vedolizumab SC treatment in this study will vary by subject based on continued benefit, for up to a 
maximum of 5 years. An interim clinical study report (CSR) for SC-3030, based on a 17 May 2019 data 
cut-off date, was provided with this submission 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Remission/response in UC:  
A statistically significant and clinically meaningful gain in clinical remission rate (defined as a complete 
Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual sub-score >1 point at Week 52) was shown for vedolizumab 
SC subjects (46.2%) compared to placebo subjects (14.3%).Clinical remission at week 52 was slightly 
higher in subjects randomized to vedolizumab SC 108mg Q2W than in the vedolizumab IV 300mg Q8W 
(32.3% versus 27.9%).  
Results were confirmed by all sensitivity analyses as well as by an exploratory analysis using FDA 
modified definitions, and PPS analysis. 
In addition, all subgroup analyses of clinical interest (i.e. baseline disease activity, naïve versus prior 
anti-TNF alpha failure) favoured VDZ over PLB. In particular, vedolizumab SC was proved effective 
both in anti-TNF-alpha naïve as well as in anti-TNF-alpha failed patients, although the magnitude of 
the effect was higher in the anti-TNF-alpha naïve subjects. 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 86/93 
 
  
The durability of the effect in UC was explored by different endpoints, being the treatment meant for 
chronic use and for an autoinflammatory/autoimmune disease. Results on durable (both Weeks 6 and 
52) clinical response (according to total Mayo score) confirmed the statistical superiority of VDZ SC 
over PLB (vedolizumab SC subjects 64.2% compared with subjects who received placebo 28.6%; 
difference from placebo 36.1%. Vedolizumab IV showed slightly higher results to vedolizumab SC 
(44.5% versus 36.1%).However, only a positive trend (15.1% VDZ SC vs 5.4% PLB), suggestive of a 
better performance over placebo, was shown for vedolizumab SC on the more stringent endpoint, 
durable remission defined as complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual sub-score >1 point 
at both Weeks 6 and 52). Vedolizumab SC showed a similar increase in the difference from placebo as 
vedolizumab IV (9.7% and 11.3%, respectively).  
 A statistically higher proportion of subjects treated with vedolizumab SC was also observed in favour 
of vedolizumab for the exploratory endpoints of the proportion of subjects who were in clinical 
remission (according to Partial Mayo Scores) in at least 80%/60% of clinic visits. 
The superiority of VDZ SC versus PLB was also confirmed by endoscopic data (Mucosal healing, a Mayo 
endoscopic sub-score of ≤1 point at week 52), and further supported by calprotectin data showing 
reduced inflammation following vedolizumab SC treatment.   
Overall, in patients with UC, results obtained with Vedolizumab SC treatment were similar to those 
achieved with vedolizumab IV treatment.  
Remission/response in CD:  
The primary endpoint clinical remission at Week 52, was met (VDZ 48.0% vs PLB 34.3%, respectively 
[adjusted treatment difference 13.7%; 95% CI, 3.8, 23.7, p = 0.008]), with a similar treatment 
difference in GEMINI 2 (17%, PLB 22 and VDZ Q8W 39%).  When a more stringent evaluation of 
remission (durable defined as remission at week 6 and 52) was considered the difference between PLB 
and VDZ SC arms was rather limited (5.6%).  
However, evaluation of corticosteroid-free remission at Week 52 demonstrated an effect of 
vedolizumab SC over placebo (vedolizumab SC, 45.3%; placebo, 18.2%; adjusted difference from 
placebo 27.1% [95% CI, 11.9, 42.3]; nominal p = 0.002). 
Reduction in inflammatory markers was observed for fecal calprotectin (increase of subjects having ≤
250mg/g as compared to higher cut-off levels) but not for CRP reduction in subjects having high CPR 
level at baseline (≥2.87mg/L). A positive trend in favour of vedolizumab was reported for some PROs 
and HQL measures. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
UC 
Corticosteroid sparing effect in UC is considered an important although difficult achievement in these 
patients. Approximately 41.7% of the FAS subjects were on corticosteroids at baseline. Corticosteroid-
free clinical remission (based on the complete Mayo score at Week 52) showed only numerically higher 
rates in VDZ SC with a treatment difference of 20.6 from placebo. A similar treatment difference from 
placebo  was  observed  for  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  (20.2).  Similar  results  were  seen  using  the 
proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  clinical  remission  and  were  corticosteroid  free  for  90  or  for  180 
days. 
More mature data on the long-term maintenance of the effect (after 52 weeks) are at present available 
from the 5-year 3030 study in the UC indication, supporting a favourable trend. 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 87/93 
 
  
CD 
The  first  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  enhanced  clinical  response,  was  not  statistically  significant; 
placebo  response  is  very  high  (44.8%)  resulting  in  a  very  limited  difference  between  the  two  arms 
(treatment difference 7.3 p=0.167). In the GEMINI 2 the treatment difference was higher (14%) and a 
PLB response of 30%. For the second (corticosteroid-free clinical remission) and third (clinical remission 
at Week 52 in TNF-α antagonist naïve subjects) secondary endpoints nominal p-values are reported.  
Evaluation of the key secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free remission at Week 52 suggested an effect 
of  vedolizumab  SC  over  placebo  (vedolizumab  SC,  45.3%;  placebo,  18.2%;  adjusted  difference  from 
placebo 27.1% [95% CI, 11.9, 42.3]; nominal p = 0.002). However, the very limited number of subjects 
achieving the endpoint in the PLB arm (8 subjects) together with the outlier result (lower compared to 
the other ones having roughly 30-40%) makes it difficult to draw a firm conclusion.    
Looking at the endpoint of clinical remission at Week 52 in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α) antagonist naïve subject population (third secondary endpoint, 50% of the enrolled 
population) again a very high PLB response is observed leading to very limited treatment difference 
(42.9% PLB and 48.6% VDZ, treatment difference 4.3).  In subjects with prior antiTNF-alpha failure a 
larger difference is seen (VDZ 45.4 PLB 28.8 difference 17.6%) due to a lower PLB response while a 
very similar response is seen in the treatment arm. 
A  high  PLB  response  is  seen  across  different endpoints  negatively  impacting  the  treatment  difference 
and therefore study results. However, the subjective nature of CDAI as endpoint is acknowledged and 
heterogeneity  of  placebo  response  is  seen  across  trials  using  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  IBD  and  is 
reported in literature. 
Overall, efficacy in Crohn’s disease appears similar for Entyvio SC and Entyvio IV (in particular for the 
primary endpoint and indirect comparison) as compared to Ulcerative Colitis.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The spectrum of vedolizumab SC AEs seems to be overall similar to that reported for vedolizumab IV 
formulation.  
The most frequently reported TEAE in Study SC-3027 was ulcerative colitis, which however was most 
common  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  next  most  common  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  anaemia, 
and upper respiratory tract infection. Overall, type and frequency of TEAEs seem to not change in the 
long term. In Study SC-3031 the overall percentage of most-frequently reported (≥5%) AEs was similar 
in the placebo and vedolizumab SC groups (41.8% and 39.3%, respectively). Nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and headache were more common in the vedolizumab SC treatment group 
than in the placebo group, while nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were more common in placebo 
group than in the vedolizumab SC group. 
In Study SC-3027 most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity, however severe events were 
more frequent in vedolizumab SC arm (5.7%) compared to vedolizumab IV (1.9%) arm, but similar to 
placebo (5.4%) and the majority were in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders mostly due to UC. Related 
TEAEs were observed in a higher rate of subjects in vedolizumab SC arm (26.4%) compared to placebo 
(17.9%) and vedolizumab IV (16.7%) arms. The difference in TREAEs between SC and IV administration 
seems to be driven mainly by GI disorders (7.5% and 1.9% in vedolizumab SC and IV, respectively), 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 88/93 
 
  
and  injection  site  reactions  and  general  disorders  (10.4%  SC  vs  1.9%  IV).    However,  the  provided 
evidence does not allow to draw firm conclusions and a specific wording in the SmPC is at present not 
required. 
In Study Sc-3031 a higher percentage of subjects had drug-related AEs in the vedolizumab SC group 
(19.3%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (14.9%),  mainly  due  to  injection-site  reactions.  Infections  and 
infestations, malignancies, hypersensitivity, liver injury and PML are confirmed AESIs and defined risks 
in the RMP.  There were no subjects diagnosed with PML. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Some  differences  in  AEs  were  noted  between  anti-TNF-α-experienced  subjects  and  anti-TNF-α-naïve 
subjects, in particular for serious infections which were slightly higher in anti–TNFα–experienced (rate 
of serious infections in pool 1: 2.3% and pool 2: 3.1%) compared to anti–TNFα–naïve subjects (pool 1: 
1.1%  and  pool  2:  1%)  as  also  confirmed  in  the  more  recent  data  pool  (pool  B)  as  well  as  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  data  from  the  long-term  safety  Study  C13008  (10%  vs  8%).  At  present  there  is  not 
sufficient  evidence  for  the  inclusion  of  a  warning  in  4.4  section  of  the  SmPC  advising  on  the  higher 
potential  risk  of  serious  infection  in  the  anti–TNFα–experienced  population  with  vedolizumab  use. 
However, information on this slightly higher incidence of serious infection was included in 4.8 section of 
the SmPC. Moreover, the Applicant will continue to monitor TEAEs of infections in the ongoing long-term 
safety study (SC-3030) as outlined in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  availability  of  a  SC  formulation  for  vedolizumab  is  considered  an  important  favourable  effect, 
particularly in the maintenance therapy, as it decreases the burden for IV infusion.  
UC indication: 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 90/93 
 
  
 
 
 
Overall the efficacy of vedolizumab SC in the sought UC indication is considered sufficiently demonstrated 
and characterised as substantially similar to vedolizumab IV. No statistically significant difference was 
observed for corticosteroid sparing effect by VDZ SC, which is acceptable, considering that a particularly 
difficult-to-treat patient population is targeted by the drug. Maintenance of the effect in the long-term, 
after  52  weeks  of  treatment,  is  at  present  poorly  characterised  but  not  required  for  this  marketing 
authorisation; a dedicated 5-year study is currently on-going and the MAH will report on this study as 
defined in the RMP. The safety profile of the SC formulation is clinically manageable and substantially 
similar to that already known for the IV formulation, with the exceptions of injection-site reactions that 
are obviously related to the route of administration, and GI disorders that are numerically higher with 
the SC formulation compared to IV, but a potential less optimal control of the UC pathology compared  
to the IV formulation is not further supported by efficacy data.  
CD indication 
Overall vedolizumab SC showed efficacy in the sought CD indication. A high PLB response across 
different endpoints was apparent, negatively impacting the difference in treatment effect between 
arms (Vedolizumab versus background therapy corticosteroids and immunomodulators). The added 
benefit of vedolizumab SC over background therapy is limited, although in line with what observed with 
the IV formulation, in particular for the primary endpoint.   
Overall, the safety profile of vedolizumab SC in CD patients from Study 3031 seems to be consistent 
with that observed in UC subjects from Study SC-3027 and that already known from vedolizumab IV 
administration. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits observed with the SC formulation of vedolizumab in the UC and CD indications (patients 
who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonist) outweigh the risks specific to this route of 
administration which are considered manageable with routine pharmacovigilance measures. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Entyvio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Entyvio 108 mg solution for injection for subcutaneous use 
is favourable in the following indications: 
Ulcerative colitis 
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. 
Crohn’s disease 
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 91/93 
 
  
 
 
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Entyvio subject 
to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that, prior to launch, all physicians who are 
expected to prescribe/use Entyvio are provided with a physician pack containing the following:  
• Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet  
• Physician’s Educational Material  
• Patient alert card,  
EMA/220524/2020 
Page 92/93 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The Educational Material for physicians should contain the following key messages:  
•  Consider the patient’s full medical history, including any prior or concurrent biological medicine 
use  
• 
• 
There is no clinical trial experience with Entyvio in patients previously treated with 
natalizumab. Given the known risk of PML development in patients with previous natalizumab 
exposure, physicians should normally wait 12 weeks after the last natalizumab dose prior to 
initiating Entyvio treatment.  
Patients treated with Entyvio should be monitored for any new onset or worsening of 
neurological signs and symptoms such as those listed below:  
o Progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs  
o Disturbance of vision  
o Changes in thinking, memory, and orientation, leading to confusion and personality changes  
•  Any patients with new onset or worsening signs and symptoms suggestive of PML should be 
considered for neurological referral at a center equipped to diagnose PML.

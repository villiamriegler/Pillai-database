4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
LIVTENCITY is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease that 
are refractory (with or without resistance) to one or more prior therapies, including ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet in adult patients who have undergone a haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT).
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antiviral agents.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
LIVTENCITY should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of patients who have 
undergone solid organ transplant or haematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Posology
The recommended dose of LIVTENCITY is 400 mg (two 200 mg tablets) twice daily resulting in a 
daily dose of 800 mg for 8 weeks. Treatment duration may need to be individualised based on the 
clinical characteristics of each patient.
2
Co-administration with CYP3A inducers
Co-administration of LIVTENCITY with the strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers 
rifampicin, rifabutin or St. John’s wort is not recommended due to potential for a decrease in efficacy 
of maribavir. 
If co-administration of LIVTENCITY with other strong or moderate CYP3A inducers (e,g., 
carbamazepine, efavirenz, phenobarbital and phenytoin) cannot be avoided, the LIVTENCITY dose 
should be increased to 1 200 mg twice daily (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).
Missed dose
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of LIVTENCITY, and the next dose is due within 
the next 3 hours, they should skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule. Patients 
should not double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.
Special populations
Elderly patients
No dose adjustment is required for patients over 65 years (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of LIVTENCITY is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Administration of LIVTENCITY in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), 
including patients on dialysis, has not been studied. No dose adjustments is expected to be required for 
patients on dialysis due to the high plasma protein binding of maribavir (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of LIVTENCITY is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Administration of LIVTENCITY in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been studied. It is not known whether 
exposure to maribavir will significantly increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Therefore, caution is advised when LIVTENCITY is administered to patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of LIVTENCITY in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available.
Method of administration
Oral use.
LIVTENCITY is intended for oral use only and can be taken with or without food. The film-coated 
tablet can be taken as a whole tablet, a crushed tablet, or a crushed tablet through a nasogastric or 
orogastric tube.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with ganciclovir or valganciclovir (see section 4.5).

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Virologic failure during treatment and relapse post-treatment
Virologic failure can occur during and after treatment with LIVTENCITY. Virologic relapse during 
the post-treatment period usually occurred within 4-8 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Some 
maribavir pUL97 resistance-associated substitutions confer cross-resistance to ganciclovir and 
valganciclovir. CMV DNA levels should be monitored and resistance mutations should be 
investigated in patients who do not respond to treatment.  Treatment should be discontinued if 
maribavir resistance mutations are detected.
CMV disease with CNS involvement
LIVTENCITY was not studied in patients with CMV CNS infection. Based on nonclinical data, CNS 
penetration of maribavir is expected to be low compared to plasma levels (section 5.2 and 5.3). 
Therefore, LIVTENCITY is not expected to be effective in treating CMV CNS infections (e.g. 
meningo-encephalitis).
Use with immunosuppressants 
LIVTENCITY has the potential to increase the concentrations of immunosuppressants that are 
cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A/P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic margins (including tacrolimus, 
cyclosporine, sirolimus and everolimus). The plasma levels of these immunosuppressants must be 
frequently monitored throughout treatment with LIVTENCITY, especially following initiation and 
after discontinuation of LIVTENCITY, and doses should be adjusted, as needed (see sections 4.5, 4.8 
and 5.2).
Risk of adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect due to medicinal product interactions
The concomitant use of LIVTENCITY and certain medicinal products may result in known or 
potentially significant medicinal product interactions, some of which may lead to:


possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposure of concomitant 
medicinal products.
reduced therapeutic effect of LIVTENCITY.
See Table 1 for steps to prevent or manage these known or potentially significant medicinal product
interactions, including dosing recommendations (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effect of other medicinal products on maribavir
Maribavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A 
are expected to affect the clearance of maribavir (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration of maribavir and medicinal products that are inhibitors of CYP3A may result in 
increased plasma concentrations of maribavir (see section 5.2). However, no dose adjustment is 
needed when maribavir is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.
Concomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz and St John’s wort), is expected to significantly
4
decrease maribavir plasma concentrations, which may result in decrease in efficacy. Therefore, 
alternative medicinal products with no CYP3A induction potential should be considered. Co-
administration of maribavir with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers rifampicin, rifabutin 
or St. John’s wort is not recommended. 
If co-administration of maribavir with other strong or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, 
efavirenz, phenobarbital and phenytoin) cannot be avoided, the maribavir dose should be increased to 
1 200 mg twice daily (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Effect of maribavir on other medicinal products
Co-administration of maribavir with valganciclovir and ganciclovir is contraindicated (see section 
4.3). LIVTENCITY may antagonise the antiviral effect of ganciclovir and valganciclovir by inhibiting 
human CMV UL97 serine/threonine kinase, which is required for activation/phosphorylation of 
ganciclovir and valganciclovir (see sections 4.3 and 5.1).
At therapeutic concentrations, clinically relevant interactions are not expected when maribavir is co-
administered with substrates of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, 2D6, and 3A4; UGT1A1, 
1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7; bile salt export pump (BSEP); multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 
(MATE)/2K; organic anion transporters (OAT)1; organic cation transporters (OCT)1 and OCT2; 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 based on in vitro and clinical  
interaction results (Table 1 and section 5.2).
Maribavir acted as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme in vitro. There are no clinical data available to 
exclude an interaction risk via CYP1A2 induction in vivo. Therefore, the concomitant administration 
of maribavir and medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic 
window (e.g., tizanidine and theophylline) should be avoided due to the risk for lack of efficacy of 
CYP1A2 substrates.
Co-administration of maribavir increased plasma concentrations of tacrolimus (see Table 1). When the 
immunosuppressants tacrolimus, cyclosporine, everolimus or sirolimus are co-administered with 
maribavir, immunosuppressant levels should be frequently monitored throughout treatment with 
maribavir, especially following initiation and after discontinuation of maribavir and dose adjusted, 
when needed (see sections 4.4 and Table 1).
Maribavir inhibited P-gp transporter in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. In a clinical study, 
co-administration of maribavir increased plasma concentrations of digoxin (see Table 1 Therefore, 
caution should be exercised when maribavir and sensitive P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran)
are co-administered. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored, and dose of digoxin may 
need to be reduced, as needed (see Table 1).
Maribavir inhibited BCRP transporter in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore,
co-administration of maribavir with sensitive BCRP substrates such as rosuvastatin, is expected to 
increase their exposure and lead to undesirable effects.
In vitro, maribavir inhibits OAT3, therefore, plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported 
by OAT3 may be increased (e.g.: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and cilastin).
In vitro, maribavir inhibits MATE1. There are no clinical data available whether the co-administration 
of maribavir with sensitive MATE1 substrates (e.g., metformin) could potentially lead to clinically 
relevant interactions.
General information
If dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with maribavir, 
doses should be readjusted after treatment with maribavir is completed. Table 1 provides a listing of 
established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product interactions. The medicinal product 
5
interactions described are based on studies conducted with maribavir or are predicted medicinal 
product interactions that may occur with maribavir (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data of maribavir use in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). LIVTENCITY is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception.
Maribavir is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of systemically acting oral contraceptive
steroids (see Section 4.5).
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether maribavir or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling 
child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with LIVTENCITY.
Fertility
Fertility studies were not conducted in humans with LIVTENCITY. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive performance were noted in rats in a combined fertility and embryofoetal development 
study, however, a decrease in sperm straight line velocity was observed at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day 
(which is estimated to be < 1 times the human exposure at the recommended human dose [RHD]). 
There were no effects on reproductive organs in either males or females in nonclinical studies in rats 
and monkeys (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
LIVTENCITY has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Adverse events were collected during the treatment phase and follow-up phase through Study 
Week 20 in the Phase 3 study (see section 5.1). The mean exposures (SD) for LIVTENCITY was 48.6 
(13.82) days with a maximum of 60 days. The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in 
at least 10% of subjects in the LIVTENCITY group were: taste disturbance (46%), nausea (21%), 
diarrhoea (19%), vomiting (14%) and fatigue (12%). The most commonly reported serious adverse 
reactions were diarrhoea (2%) and nausea, weight decreased, fatigue, immunosuppressant drug 
concentration level increased, and vomiting (all occurring at > 1%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to 
< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000) or very rare (< 1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions*
Taste disturbance
Taste disturbance (comprised of the reported preferred terms ageusia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia and taste 
disorder) occurred in 46% of patients treated with LIVTENCITY. These events rarely led to 
discontinuation of LIVTENCITY (0.9%) and, for most patients, resolved while patients remained on 
therapy (37%) or within a median of 7 days (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 95% CI: 4-8 days) after treatment 
discontinuation.
Increases in plasma levels of immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressant drug level increase (comprised of the preferred terms immunosuppressant drug 
level increased and drug level increased) occurred in 9% of patients treated with LIVTENCITY. 
LIVTENCITY has the potential to increase the drug concentrations of immunosuppressants that are 
CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges (including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, 
sirolimus and everolimus). (See sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
In Study 303, an accidental overdose of a single extra dose occurred in 1 LIVTENCITY-treated 
subject on Day 13 (1 200 mg total daily dose). No adverse reactions were reported.
In Study 202, 40 subjects were exposed to doses of 800 mg twice daily and 40 subjects were exposed 
to 1 200 mg twice daily for a mean of approximately 90 days. In Study 203, 40 subjects were exposed 
to doses of 800 mg twice daily and 39 subjects were exposed to 1 200 mg twice daily for a maximum 
of 177 days. There were no appreciable differences in the safety profile in either study compared to the 
400 mg twice daily group in Study 303 in which subjects received maribavir for a maximum of 
60 days.
There is no known specific antidote for maribavir. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the 
patient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. Due to 
the high plasma protein binding of maribavir, dialysis is unlikely to reduce plasma concentrations of 
maribavir significantly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AX10.
Mechanism of action
Maribavir is a competitive inhibitor of the UL97 protein kinase. UL97 inhibition occurs at the viral 
DNA replication phase, inhibiting UL97 serine/threonine kinase by competitively inhibiting the 
binding of ATP to the kinase ATP-binding site, without affecting the concatemer maturation process, 
abolishing phosphotransferase inhibiting CMV DNA replication and maturation, CMV DNA 
encapsidation, and CMV DNA nuclear egress.
Antiviral activity
Maribavir inhibited human CMV replication in virus yield reduction, DNA hybridization, and plaque 
reduction assays in human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5), human embryonic kidney (HEK), and 
human foreskin fibroblast (MRHF) cells. The EC50 values ranged from 0.03 to 2.2 µM depending on 
the cell line and assay endpoint. The cell culture antiviral activity of maribavir has also been evaluated 
against CMV clinical isolates. The median EC50 values were 0.1 μM (n=10, range 0.03-0.13 μM) and 
0.28 μM (n=10, range 0.12-0.56 μM) using DNA hybridization and plaque reduction assays, 
respectively. No significant difference in EC50 values across the four human CMV glycoprotein B 
genotypes (N = 2, 1, 4, and 1 for gB1, gB2, gB3, and gB4, respectively) was seen.
Combination antiviral activity
When maribavir was tested in in vitro combination with other antiviral compounds, strong antagonism 
was seen with ganciclovir.
No antagonism was seen in combination with cidofovir, foscarnet and letermovir.
Viral resistance
In cell culture
Maribavir does not affect the UL54encoded DNA polymerase that, when presenting certain mutations, 
confers resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet and/or cidofovir. Mutations conferring 
resistance to maribavir have been identified on gene UL97: L337M, F342Y, V353A, V356G, L397R, 
T409M, H411L/N/Y, D456N, V466G C480F, P521L, and Y617del. These mutations confer resistance 
that ranges from 3.5-fold to > 200-fold increase in EC50 values. UL27 gene variants (R233S, W362R, 
W153R, L193F, A269T, V353E, L426F, E22stop, W362stop, 218delC, and 301311del) conferred 
only mild maribavir resistance (< 5fold increase in EC50), while L335P conferred high maribavir 
resistance.
In clinical studies
In Phase 2 Study 202 and Study 203 evaluating maribavir in 279 HSCT or SOT recipients, 
post-treatment pUL97 genotyping data from 23 of 29 patients who initially achieved viremia clearance 
and later experienced recurrent CMV infection while on maribavir showed 17 patients with mutations 
T409M or H411Y and 6 patients with mutation C480F. Among 25 patients who did not respond to 
> 14 days of maribavir therapy, 9 had mutations T409M or H411Y, and 5 patients had mutation 
C480F. Additional pUL27 genotyping was performed on 39 patients in Study 202 and 43 patients in 
Study 203. The only resistance-associated amino acid substitution in pUL27 that was not detected at 
baseline was G344D. Phenotypic analysis of pUL27 and pUL97 recombinants showed that pUL97 
mutations T409M, H411Y, and C480F conferred 78-fold, 15-fold, and 224-fold increases, 
11
respectively, in maribavir EC50 compared with the wild-type strain, whereas the pUL27 mutation 
G344D showed no difference in maribavir EC50 as compared to the wild-type strain. 
In Phase 3 Study 303 evaluating maribavir in patients with phenotypic resistance to 
valganciclovir/ganciclovir, DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of pUL97 and pUL27 
was performed on 134 paired sequences from maribavir-treated patients. The treatment-emergent 
pUL97 substitutions F342Y (4.5-fold), T409M (78-fold), H411L/N/Y (69-, 9-, and 12-fold, 
respectively), and/or C480F (224-fold) were detected in 60 subjects and were associated with non-
response (47 subjects were on-treatment failures and 13 subjects were relapsers). One subject with the 
pUL27 L193F substitution (2.6-fold reduced susceptibility to maribavir) at baseline did not meet the 
primary endpoint. In addition, the following multiple mutations were associated with non-response; 
F342Y+T409M+H411N (78-fold), C480F+H411L+H411Y (224-fold), F342Y+H411Y (56-fold), 
T409M+C480F (224-fold) and H411Y+C480F (224-fold).
Cross resistance
Cross-resistance has been observed between maribavir and ganciclovir/valganciclovir (vGCV/GCV)
in cell culture and in clinical studies. In the phase 3 Study 303, a total of 44 patients in the maribavir 
arm had a treatment emergent resistance associated substitutions (RAS) to Investigator assigned 
treatment (IAT). Of these 24 had treatment-emergent C480F or the F342Y RAS, both are cross-
resistant to both ganciclovir/valganciclovir and maribavir. Of these 24 patients, 1 (0.04%) achieved the 
primary endpoint. Overall, only eight of these 44 patients achieved the primary endpoint.
pUL97 vGCV/GCV resistance-associated substitutions F342S/Y, K355del, V356G, D456N, V466G, 
C480R, P521L, and Y617del reduce susceptibility to maribavir > 4.5-fold. Other vGCV/GCV 
resistance pathways have not been evaluated for cross-resistance to maribavir. pUL54 DNA 
polymerase substitutions conferring resistance to vGCV/GCV, cidofovir, or foscarnet remained 
susceptible to maribavir.
Substitutions pUL97 F342Y and C480F are maribavir treatment-emergent resistance-associated 
substitutions that confer > 1.5-fold reduced susceptibility to vGCV/GCV, a fold reduction that is 
associated with phenotypic resistance to vGCV/GCV. The clinical significance of this cross-resistance 
to vGCV/GCV for these substitutions has not been determined. Maribavir resistant virus remained 
susceptible to cidofovir and foscarnet. Additionally, there are no reports of any pUL27 maribavir 
resistance-associated substitutions being evaluated for vGCV/GCV, cidofovir, or foscarnet cross-
resistance. Given the lack of resistance-associated substitutions for these drugs mapping to pUL27, 
cross-resistance is not expected for pUL27 maribavir substitutions.
Clinical efficacy 
A Phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled superiority study (Study 
SHP620-303) assessed the efficacy and safety of LIVTENCITY treatment compared to Investigator 
assigned treatment (IAT) in 352 HSCT and SOT recipients with CMV infections that were refractory 
to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, including CMV infections with 
or without confirmed resistance to 1 or more anti-CMV agents. Refractory CMV infection was defined 
as documented failure to achieve > 1 log10 decrease in CMV DNA level in whole blood or plasma 
after a 14-day or longer treatment period with intravenous ganciclovir/oral valganciclovir, intravenous
foscarnet, or intravenous cidofovir. This definition was applied to the current CMV infection and the 
most recently administered anti-CMV agent.
Patients were stratified by transplant type (HSCT or SOT) and screening CMV DNA levels and then 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive LIVTENCITY 400 mg twice daily or IAT (ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) for an 8-week treatment period and a 12 week follow-up phase.
The mean age of trial subjects was 53 years and most subjects were male (61%), white (76%) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (83%), with similar distributions across the two treatment arms. Baseline disease 
characteristics are summarised in Table 3 below.

e Viral load was defined for analysis by the baseline central specialty laboratory plasma CMV DNA qPCR results as high 
(≥91,000 IU/mL), intermediate (≥ 9,100 and < 91,000 IU/mL), and low (< 9,100 IU/mL).
f Confirmed by Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC).
g Patients could have CMV syndrome and tissue invasive disease.
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed CMV viraemia clearance (plasma CMV DNA 
concentration below the lower limit of quantification (< LLOQ; i.e., < 137 IU/mL) at Week 8
regardless of whether either study-assigned treatment was discontinued before the end of the stipulated 
8 weeks of therapy. The key secondary endpoint was CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection 
symptom control at Week 8 with maintenance of this treatment effect through Study Week 16. CMV 
infection symptom control was defined as resolution or improvement of tissue-invasive disease or 
13
CMV syndrome for symptomatic patients at baseline, or no new symptoms for patients who were 
asymptomatic at baseline.
For the primary endpoint, LIVTENCITY was superior to IAT (56% vs. 24%, respectively, p < 0.001). 
For the key secondary endpoint, 19% vs. 10% achieved both CMV viraemia clearance and CMV 
infection symptom control in the LIVTENCITY and IAT group, respectively (p=0.013) (See Table 4).

Recurrence
The secondary endpoint of recurrence of CMV viraemia was reported in 57% of the maribavir treated 
patients and in 34% of the IAT treated patients. Of these, 18% in the maribavir group had recurrence 
of CMV viraemia while on-treatment compared to 12% the IAT group. Recurrence of CMV viraemia 
during follow up was seen in 39% of patients in the maribavir group and in 22% of the patients in the 
IAT group. 
Overall mortality: All-cause mortality was assessed for the entire study period. A similar percentage of 
subjects in each treatment group died during the trial (LIVTENCITY 11% [27/235]; IAT 11% 
[13/117]).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
LIVTENCITY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of cytomegalovirus 
infection (see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Maribavir pharmacological activity is due to the parent medicinal product. The pharmacokinetics of 
maribavir have been characterised following oral administration in healthy subjects and transplant 
patients. Maribavir exposure increased in an approximately dose proportionally manner. In healthy 
subjects, the geometric mean steady-state AUC0-t, Cmax and Ctrough values were 101 µg*h/mL, 
16.4 µg/mL and 2.89 µg/mL, respectively, following 400 mg twice daily oral maribavir doses.
In transplant recipients, maribavir steady state exposure following oral administration of 400 mg twice 
daily doses are provided below, based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis. Steady-state was 
reached in 2 days, with an accumulation ratio of 1.47 for AUC and 1.37 for Cmax. The intrasubject 
15
variability (< 22%) and intersubject variability (< 37%) in maribavir PK parameters are low to 
moderate.

Absorption
Maribavir was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1.0 to 3.0 hours post dose. 
Exposure to maribavir is unaffected by crushing the tablet, administration of crushed tablet through 
nasogastric (NG)/orogastric tubes or co-administration with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 
H2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers) or antacids.
Effect of food
In healthy subjects, oral administration of a single 400 mg dose of maribavir with a high fat meal 
resulted in no change in the overall exposure (AUC) and a 28% decrease in Cmax of maribavir, which 
was not considered clinically relevant. 
Distribution
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the apparent steady-state volume of distribution is 
estimated to be 27.3 L.
In vitro binding of maribavir to human plasma proteins was 98.0% over the concentration range of 
0.05-200 μg/mL. Ex vivo protein binding of maribavir (98.5%-99.0%) was consistent with in vitro
data, with no apparent difference observed among healthy subjects, subjects with hepatic (moderate) 
or renal (mild, moderate or severe) impairment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, or 
transplant patients.
Maribavir may cross the blood-brain barrier in humans but CNS penetration is expected to be low 
compared to plasma levels (see section 4.4 and 5.3).
In vitro data indicate that maribavir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) transporters. Changes in maribavir plasma 
concentrations due to inhibition of P-gp/BCRP/OCT1 were not clinically relevant.
Biotransformation
Maribavir is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 (primary metabolic pathway 
fraction metabolised estimated to be at least 35%), with secondary contribution from CYP1A2 
(fraction metabolised estimated at no more than 25%). The major metabolite of maribavir is formed by 
N-dealkylation of the isopropyl moiety and is considered pharmacologically inactive. The metabolic 
ratio for this major metabolite in plasma was 0.15-0.20. Multiple UGT enzymes, namely UGT1A1, 
UGT1A3, UGT2B7, and possibly UGT1A9, are involved in the glucuronidation of maribavir in 
humans, however, the contribution of glucuronidation to the overall clearance of maribavir is low 
based on in vitro data.
Based on in vitro studies, metabolism of maribavir is not mediated by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP3A5, 1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A10, or UGT2B15.
16
Elimination
The elimination half-life and oral clearance of maribavir are estimated at 4.3 hours and 2.9 L/h, 
respectively, in transplant patients. After single dose oral administration of [14C]-maribavir, 
approximately 61% and 14% of the radioactivity were recovered in urine and faeces, respectively, 
primarily as the major and inactive metabolite. Urinary excretion of unchanged maribavir is minimal.
Special populations
Renal impairment
No clinically significant effect of mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (measured creatinine 
clearance ranging from 12 to 70 mL/min) was observed on maribavir total PK parameters following a 
single dose of 400 mg maribavir. The difference in maribavir PK parameters between subjects with 
mild/moderate or severe renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function was < 9%. As 
maribavir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that maribavir will be significantly 
removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment
No clinically significant effect of moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score of 7-9) was
observed on total or unbound maribavir PK parameters following a single dose of 200 mg of 
maribavir. Compared to the healthy control subjects, AUC and Cmax were 26% and 35% higher, 
respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. It is not known whether the exposure to 
maribavir will increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Age, gender, race, ethnicity, and weight
Age (18-79 years), gender, race (Caucasian, Black, Asian, or others), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or 
non-Hispanic/Latino) and body weight (36 to 141 kg) did not have clinically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of maribavir based on population PK analysis.
Transplant types
Transplant types (HSCT vs. SOT) or between SOT types (liver, lung, kidney, or heart) or presence of 
gastrointestinal (GI) graft-versus host disease (GvHD) do not have a clinically significant impact on 
PK of maribavir.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
General
Regenerative anaemia and mucosal cell hyperplasia in the intestinal tract, observed with dehydration 
was noted in rats and monkeys, together with clinical observations of soft to liquid stool, and 
electrolyte changes (in monkeys only). A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not 
established in monkeys and was < 100 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 0.25 the human exposure at 
the recommended human dose (RHD). In rats the NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day, at which exposures 
were 0.05 and 0.1 times the human exposure at the RHD in males and females, respectively.
Maribavir did not demonstrate phototoxicity in vitro, therefore, the potential for phototoxicity in 
humans is considered unlikely.
Maribavir was detected at low levels in the choroid plexus of rats and the brain and CSF of the 
monkey (see section 4.4 and 5.2).
17
Carcinogenesis
No carcinogenic potential was identified in rats up to 100 mg/kg/day at which exposures in males and 
females were 0.2 and 0.36 times, respectively the human exposure at the RHD. In male mice, an 
equivocal elevation in the incidence of haemangioma, haemangiosarcoma, and combined 
haemangioma/ hemangiosarcoma across multiple tissues at 150 mg/kg/day is of uncertain relevance in 
terms of its translation to human risk given the lack of an effect in female mice or in rats after 
104 weeks of administration, lack of neoplastic proliferative effects in male and female mice after 
13 weeks administration, the negative genotoxicity package and the difference in duration of 
administration in humans. There were no carcinogenic findings at the next lower dose of 
75 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 0.35 and 0.25 in males and females, respectively, the human 
exposure at the RHD.
Mutagenesis
Maribavir was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay, nor clastogenic in the bone marrow 
micronucleus assay. In mouse lymphoma assays, maribavir demonstrated mutagenic potential in the 
absence of metabolic activation and the results were equivocal in the presence of metabolic activation. 
Overall, the weight of evidence indicates that maribavir does not exhibit genotoxic potential.
Reproduction
Fertility
In the combined fertility and embryofoetal development study in rats, there were no effects of 
maribavir on fertility. However, in male rats decreases in sperm straight line velocity, were observed 
at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day (which is estimated to be less than the human exposure at the RHD), but 
without any impact on male fertility.
Prenatal and postnatal development
In a combined fertility and embryofoetal development study in rats, maribavir was not teratogenic and 
had no effect on embryofoetal growth or development at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the 
number of viable foetuses due to increase in early resorptions and post-implantation losses was 
observed in females at all tested maribavir doses which were also maternally toxic. The lowest dose 
corresponded to approximately half the human exposure at the RHD. In the pre and postnatal 
developmental toxicity study conducted in rats, decreased pup survival due to poor maternal care and 
reduced body weight gain associated with a delay in developmental milestones (pinna detachment, eye 
opening and preputial separation) were observed at maribavir doses ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. Postnatal 
development was not affected at 50 mg/kg/day. Fertility and mating performance of the F1 generation, 
and their ability to maintain pregnancy and to deliver live offspring, was unaffected up to 
400 mg/kg/day.
In rabbits, maribavir was not teratogenic at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.45 times the 
human exposure at the RHD).

1. What LIVTENCITY is and what it is used for
LIVTENCITY is an antiviral medicine that contains the active substance maribavir.
It is a medicine used to treat adults who have had an organ or bone marrow transplant and developed a 
CMV (‘cytomegalovirus’) infection that did not go away or came back again after taking another 
antiviral medicine.
CMV is a virus that a lot of people have without symptoms and normally just stays in the body
without causing any harm. However, if your immune system is weakened after you get an organ or 
bone marrow transplant, you may be at higher risk of becoming ill from CMV.

You should not be given LIVTENCITY if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given LIVTENCITY.
Warnings and precautions

take LIVTENCITY with other medicines.

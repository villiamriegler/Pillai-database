CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Segluromet is indicated in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and
exercise:
• 
• 
• 
in patients insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes in patients
insufficiently controlled with metformin and these products 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate
tablets. 
For study results with respect to combinations of therapies, effects on glycaemic control,
cardiovascular events and the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults with normal renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 90 mL/min)
The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. The dose should be individualised on the basis of the
patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability using the recommended daily dose of 5 mg or
15 mg of ertugliflozin, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of metformin.
In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of Segluromet is
recommended (see section 4.4). 
For patients insufficiently controlled on metformin (either alone or in combination with other
medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes) 
The recommended starting dose of Segluromet should provide ertugliflozin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg
daily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. In patients tolerating a
total daily dose of ertugliflozin 5 mg, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of ertugliflozin
15 mg if additional glycaemic control is needed. 
For patients switching from separate tablets of ertugliflozin and metformin
Patients switching from separate tablets of ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg total daily dose) and
metformin to Segluromet should receive the same daily dose of ertugliflozin and metformin already
being taken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin.
When Segluromet is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of
insulin or the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see
sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. Patients should not take two
doses of Segluromet at the same time.
3
Special populations
Renal impairment
A GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin-containing products and at
least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in
the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g., every 3-6 months (see section 4.4).
Initiation of this medicinal product is not recommended in patients with a GFR less than 45 mL/min
(see section 4.4).
Because the glycaemic lowering efficacy of ertugliflozin is reduced in patients with moderate renal
impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment, if further glycaemic control is
needed, the addition of other anti-hyperglycaemic agents should be considered (see section 4.4).
The maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that
may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering
initiation of metformin in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min. 
If no adequate strength of Segluromet is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead
of the fixed-dose combination.

Metformin is contraindicated. 
Not recommended.
Hepatic impairment
Segluromet is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Elderly
Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities
can occur after initiating ertugliflozin, and metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the
kidneys, Segluromet should be used with caution in the elderly. Regular assessment of renal function
is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in elderly
patients (see section 4.4). Renal function and risk of volume depletion should be taken into account
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Segluromet in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No
data are available.
4
Method of administration
Segluromet should be taken orally twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse
reactions associated with metformin. In case of swallowing difficulties, the tablet could be broken or
crushed as it is an immediate-release dosage form.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Segluromet should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It may increase the risk of
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in these patients.
Lactic acidosis
Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening
of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute
worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. 
In case of dehydration (severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should be
temporarily discontinued and contact with a healthcare professional is recommended.
Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) should be initiated with caution in metformin-
treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic
insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions
associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic
acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Patients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is
characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia
followed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek
immediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35),
increased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.
Administration of iodinated contrast agents
Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast-induced nephropathy,
resulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Segluromet should be
5
discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours
after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and
4.5).
Renal impairment
The efficacy of ertugliflozin for glycaemic control is dependent on renal function, and glycaemic
efficacy is reduced in patients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with
severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).
Segluromet should not be initiated in patients with a GFR below 45 mL/min. Segluromet should be
discontinued when GFR is persistently below 45 mL/min. 
GFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter (see section 4.2). More
frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min.
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min and should be temporarily
discontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).
Surgery
Segluromet must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal, or epidural anaesthesia.
Therapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition
and provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.
Hypotension/Volume depletion
Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction.
Therefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating Segluromet (see section 4.8),
particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a
creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min), elderly patients (≥ 65 years), patients on diuretics, or
patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension. Before initiating Segluromet,
volume status should be assessed and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms after
initiating therapy.
Due to its mechanism of action, ertugliflozin induces an osmotic diuresis and increases serum
creatinine and decreases eGFR. Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR were greater in
patients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.8).
In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g., gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of
volume status (e.g., physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including
haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving ertugliflozin. Temporary
interruption of treatment should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Rare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in clinical trials and
post-marketing in patients treated with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including
ertugliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately
increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is more likely
to occur with higher doses of ertugliflozin.
The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue, or
sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms occur,
regardless of blood glucose level.
6
In patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Segluromet should be discontinued
immediately.
Treatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute
serious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of
blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with Segluromet may be restarted when the ketone
values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.
Before initiating Segluromet, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should
be considered.
Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g.,
type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or
patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or
severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin
requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery, or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used
with caution in these patients.
Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor
treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.
The safety and efficacy of Segluromet in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and
Segluromet should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from
clinical trials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are
treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.
Lower limb amputations 
In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study VERTIS CV (eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and
Safety, CardioVascular), a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, non-traumatic lower limb amputations (primarily of the toe)
were reported with an incidence of 2% (0.57 subjects with event per 100 patient-years), 2.1% (0.60
subjects with event per 100 patient-years) and 1.6% (0.47 subjects with event per 100 patient-years)
for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups. The event rates of lower limb
amputations were 0.75 and 0.96 versus 0.74 events per 100 patient-years for ertugliflozin 5 mg and
ertugliflozin 15 mg versus placebo, respectively. An increase in cases of lower limb amputation
(primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term clinical studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus with
SGLT2 inhibitors. It is not known whether this constitutes a class effect. It is important to counsel
patients with diabetes on routine preventative foot care.
Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and insulin secretagogues
Ertugliflozin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an
insulin secretagogue, which are known to cause hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). Therefore, a lower
dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia when
used in combination with Segluromet (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Genital mycotic infections
Ertugliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. In trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, patients
with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop
genital mycotic infections (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated appropriately.
7
Urinary tract infections
Urinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (see
section 4.8). Temporary interruption of ertugliflozin should be considered when treating
pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) 
Post-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene),
have been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and
potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of
pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware
that either urogenital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier’s
gangrene is suspected, Segluromet should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics
and surgical debridement) should be instituted. 
Elderly patients
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of volume depletion and renal impairment. Patients
65 years and older treated with ertugliflozin had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to
volume depletion compared to younger patients. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis
increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic,
renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study
VERTIS CV, safety and efficacy were similar for patients age 65 years and older compared to patients
younger than 65 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. 
Cardiac failure 
There is no experience in clinical studies with ertugliflozin in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class IV.
Urine laboratory assessments
Due to the mechanism of action of ertugliflozin, patients taking Segluromet will test positive for
glucose in their urine. Alternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.
Interference with 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are
unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking medicines containing an SGLT2 inhibitor.
Alternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.
Vitamin B12 Deficiency
Metformin may reduce vitamin B12 serum levels. The risk of low vitamin B12 levels increases with
increasing metformin dose, treatment duration, and/or in patients with risk factors known to cause
vitamin B12 deficiency. In case of suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency (such as anaemia or
neuropathy), vitamin B12 serum levels should be monitored. Periodic vitamin B12 monitoring could be
necessary in patients with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency. Metformin therapy should be
continued for as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated and appropriate corrective treatment for
vitamin B12 deficiency provided in line with current clinical guidelines.

Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Segluromet have not been performed; however, such
studies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and metformin, the individual active substances of
Segluromet.
Ertugliflozin
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Diuretics
Ertugliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and
hypotension (see section 4.4).
Insulin and insulin secretagogues
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Ertugliflozin may
increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin
secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce
the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Segluromet (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin
Metabolism by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. 
Interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using a single dose design, suggest that the
pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are not altered by sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin.
Multiple-dose administration of rifampicin (a uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]
and cytochrome P450 [CYP] inducer) decreases ertugliflozin area under the concentration-time curve
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 39% and 15%, respectively. This decrease in
exposure is not considered clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended. A
clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not
expected. 
The impact of UGT inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin has not been studied clinically,
but potential increase in ertugliflozin exposure due to UGT inhibition is not considered to be clinically
relevant. 
Effects of ertugliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant
effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, metformin, and glimepiride.
Coadministration of simvastatin with ertugliflozin resulted in a 24% and 19% increase in AUC and
Cmax of simvastatin, respectively, and 30% and 16% increase in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid,
respectively. The mechanism for the small increases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid is unknown
and is not perpetrated through organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) inhibition by
ertugliflozin. These increases are not considered to be clinically meaningful.
9
Metformin
Concomitant use is not recommended
Alcohol
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of
fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment.
Iodinated contrast agents
Segluromet must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted
until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Combinations requiring precautions for use
Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function, which may increase the risk of lactic
acidosis, e.g., NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors,
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics,
especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close
monitoring of renal function is necessary.
Organic cation transporters (OCT) 
Metformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2.
Coadministration of metformin with 
Inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin. 
Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of
metformin.
Inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprim, vandetanib,
isavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in
metformin plasma concentration.
Inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal
elimination of metformin.
Caution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these medicinal
products are coadministered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If
needed, dose adjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the
efficacy of metformin.
Glucocorticoids (given by systemic and local administration), beta 2 agonists, and diuretics have
intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose
monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If
necessary, the dose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy
with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of Segluromet in pregnant women. 
A limited amount of data suggests the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an
increased risk of congenital malformations. Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, parturition or post-natal
development (see section 5.3).
10

 

 

 

 
There are limited data from the use of ertugliflozin in pregnant women. Based on results from animal
studies, ertugliflozin may affect renal development and maturation (see section 5.3). Therefore,
Segluromet should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding
There is no information regarding the presence of ertugliflozin in human milk, the effects on the
breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Metformin is present in human breast milk.
Ertugliflozin and metformin are present in the milk of lactating rats. Ertugliflozin caused effects in the
offspring of lactating rats.
Pharmacologically mediated effects were observed in juvenile rats treated with ertugliflozin (see
section 5.3). Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when
exposure from breast-feeding may occur, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Segluromet
should not be used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
The effect of Segluromet on fertility in humans has not been studied. No effects of ertugliflozin or
metformin on fertility were observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Segluromet has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be
alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Segluromet is used in combination with insulin or an insulin
secretagogue and to the elevated risk of adverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as postural
dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Ertugliflozin and metformin
The safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and metformin has been evaluated in
1 083 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in a pool of two placebo-controlled
trials: as ertugliflozin add on therapy to metformin and as ertugliflozin add-on therapy to sitagliptin
and metformin (see section 5.1). The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these two trials were
similar to the adverse reactions seen with the individual monotherapies ertugliflozin and metformin as
described below in Table 1.
Ertugliflozin
The safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin were assessed in 7 placebo- or active comparator-controlled
studies with a total of 3 409 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg or
15 mg. In addition, the safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were assessed in VERTIS CV (see section 5.1) with
a total of 5 493 patients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg and a mean duration of exposure of
2.9 years.
Pool of placebo-controlled trials
The primary assessment of safety was conducted in a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials.
Ertugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials (see
section 5.1). These data reflect exposure of 1 029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure
duration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg
(N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily.
11
The most commonly reported adverse reactions across the clinical program were urinary tract
infections, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, and other female genital mycotic infections. Serious DKA
occurred rarely (see section 4.4).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (SOC),
within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10),
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very
rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Ertugliflozin
Volume depletion
Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and
adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence
of adverse events related to volume depletion (dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope,
hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) was low (< 2%) and not notably different across the
ertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the subgroup analyses in the broader pool of phase 3 studies,
subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects ≥ 65 years of age and subjects on diuretics had a
higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the comparator group (see
sections 4.2 and 4.4). In subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 5.1%, 2.6%, and
0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and the comparator group and for subjects with
eGFR 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 3.7%, and 0% respectively.
Hypoglycaemia
In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was increased
for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). In this population, the
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 0.4% in each group. When ertugliflozin was used as
monotherapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the ertugliflozin groups was 2.6% in both
groups and 0.7% in the placebo group. When used as add-on to metformin, the incidence of
hypoglycaemic events was 7.2% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 7.8% in the ertugliflozin 15 mg
group and 4.3% in the placebo group.
When ertugliflozin was added to metformin and compared to sulphonylurea, the incidence of
hypoglycaemia was higher for the sulphonylurea (27%) compared to ertugliflozin (5.6% and 8.2% for
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively). 
In the VERTIS CV sub-studies, when ertugliflozin was added to insulin with or without metformin,
the incidences of documented hypoglycaemia were 39.4%, 38.9% and 37.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg,
ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to a sulphonylurea, the
13
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 7.3%, 9.3% and 4.2% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg
and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to metformin and a sulphonylurea, the
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 20%, 26.5% and 14.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg
and placebo, respectively.
In patients with moderate renal impairment taking insulins, sulphonylurea, or meglitinides as
background medicinal products, documented hypoglycaemia was 36%, 27% and 36% for ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5).
Diabetic ketoacidosis
In VERTIS CV, ketoacidosis was identified in 19 (0.3%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and in 2 (0.1%)
placebo treated patients. Across 7 other phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development
program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0 (0%) of
comparator-treated patients (see section 4.4).
Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased and renal-related events 
Initial increases in mean creatinine and decreases in mean eGFR in patients treated with ertugliflozin
were generally transient during continuous treatment. Patients with moderate renal impairment at
baseline had larger mean changes that did not return to baseline at Week 26; these changes reversed
after treatment discontinuation.
In VERTIS CV, treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with an initial decrease in mean eGFR (at
Week 6, -2.7, -3.8 and -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo
groups, respectively) followed by a return toward baseline. Long-term, continued treatment with
ertugliflozin was associated with a slower decline in eGFR compared to placebo (up to week 260).
In VERTIS CV, the incidences of renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal
impairment, acute prerenal failure) were 4.2%, 4.3% and 4.7% in patients treated with ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo respectively in the overall population and were 9.7%, 10% and
10.2% in patients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo respectively in
patients with an eGFR from 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Genital mycotic infections
In the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital
candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal
mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 9.1%, 12%, and 3% of females treated with ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. In females, discontinuation due to genital
mycotic infections occurred in 0.6% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo,
respectively (see section 4.4).
In the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital
infection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 3.7%, 4.2%, and 0.4% of males treated with
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections
occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic
infections occurred in 0.2% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. In
rare instances, phimosis was reported and sometimes circumcision was performed (see section 4.4).
Urinary tract infections 
In VERTIS CV, urinary tract infections occurred in 12.2%, 12% and 10.2% of patients treated with
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The incidences of serious urinary
tract infections were 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.8% with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo,
respectively.
14
Across 7 other phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development program, the incidences of
urinary tract infections were 4% and 4.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups and 3.9% for
placebo. Most of the events were mild or moderate, and no serious cases were reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
In the event of an overdose with Segluromet, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute
supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient’s clinical status.
Ertugliflozin
Ertugliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 300 mg and
multiple doses up to 100 mg daily for 2 weeks. No potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose
were identified. Removal of ertugliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.
Metformin
Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 g.
Hypoglycaemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with
metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately
32% of metformin overdose cases (see section 4.4). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must
be treated in a hospital. Metformin is dialysable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good
haemodynamic conditions. Therefore, haemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated
metformin from patients in whom metformin overdose is suspected.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering
drugs, ATC code: A10BD23.
Mechanism of action
Segluromet combines two anti-hyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to
improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and
metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
Ertugliflozin
SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular
filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.
By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal
threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.
15
Metformin
Metformin is an anti-hyperglycaemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2
diabetes, lowering both basal and post-prandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of
action are different from other classes of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents. Metformin decreases
hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation. Unlike sulphonylureas, metformin does not
produce hypoglycaemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects, except in special
circumstances (see section 4.5), and does not cause hyperinsulinaemia. With metformin therapy,
insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response
may actually decrease.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Ertugliflozin
Urinary glucose excretion and urinary volume
Dose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy
subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose
administration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modelling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg
result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
providing 87% and 96% of maximal inhibition, respectively.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Both improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are
integral parts of the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Glycaemic control
The glycaemic efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin have been studied in
4 multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, phase 3 clinical
studies involving 3 643 patients with type 2 diabetes. Across the four studies, the racial distribution
ranged from 66.2% to 80.3% White, 10.6% to 20.3% Asian, 1.9% to 10.3% Black, and 4.5% to 7.4%
other. Hispanic or Latino patients comprised 15.6% to 34.5% of the population. The mean age of the
patients across these four studies ranged from 55.1 to 59.1 years (range 21 years to 86 years); 15.6% to
29.9% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 0.6% to 3.8% were ≥75 years of age.
Ertugliflozin as add-on combination therapy with metformin
A total of 621 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy
(≥ 1 500 mg/day) participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, 26-week, placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin.
Patients were randomised to ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo administered once
daily in addition to continuation of background metformin therapy (see Table 2).

Factorial study with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin
A total of 1 233 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre,
26-week, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in
combination with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to the individual components. Patients with type 2
diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (≥ 1 500 mg/day) were randomised to one
of five active-treatment arms: ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or sitagliptin 100 mg in

Active-controlled study of ertugliflozin versus glimepiride as add-on combination therapy with
metformin 
A total of 1 326 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy
participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, 52-week, active comparator-controlled study
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin. These patients, who
were receiving metformin monotherapy (≥ 1 500 mg/day), were randomised to ertugliflozin 5 mg,
ertugliflozin 15 mg, or glimepiride administered once daily in addition to continuation of background
metformin therapy. Glimepiride was initiated at 1 mg/day and titrated up to a maximum dose of 6 or
8 mg/day (depending on maximum approved dose in each country) or a maximum tolerated dose or
down-titrated to avoid or manage hypoglycaemia. The mean daily dose of glimepiride was 3 mg (see
Table 5).

Fasting plasma glucose
In three placebo-controlled studies, ertugliflozin resulted in statistically significant reductions in
fasting plasma glucose (FPG). For ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, the placebo-corrected
reductions in FPG were 1.92 and 2.44 mmol/L as monotherapy, 1.48 and 2.12 mmol/L as add-on to
metformin, and 1.40 and 1.74 mmol/L as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin. 
The combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin on a background of metformin resulted in significantly
greater reductions in FPG compared to sitagliptin or ertugliflozin alone. The combination of
ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg and sitagliptin resulted in incremental FPG reductions of 0.46 and
0.65 mmol/L compared to the ertugliflozin alone or 1.02 and 1.28 mmol/L compared to sitagliptin
alone, respectively.
Efficacy in patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9% 
In the study of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin in patients with baseline HbA1c from
7-10.5%, the placebo-corrected reductions in HbA1c for the subgroup of patients in the study with
baseline HbA1c ≥ 9% were 1.31% and 1.43% with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively.
In the study of patients inadequately controlled on metformin with baseline HbA1c from 7.5-11%,
among the subgroup of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 10%, the combination of ertugliflozin 5 mg
or 15 mg with sitagliptin resulted in reductions of HbA1c of 2.35% and 2.66%, respectively, compared
to 2.10%, 1.30%, and 1.82% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and sitagliptin alone,
respectively.
Blood pressure
As add-on to metformin, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg resulted in statistically significant
placebo-corrected reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 3.7 mmHg and 4.5 mmHg,
respectively. As add-on to metformin and sitagliptin, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg resulted in
statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in SBP of 2.9 mmHg and 3.9 mmHg,
respectively. 
21
 
 
In a 52-week, active-controlled study versus glimepiride, reductions from baseline in SBP were
2.2 mmHg and 3.8 mmHg for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, while subjects treated with
glimepiride had an increase in SBP from baseline of 1.0 mmHg.
Subgroup analysis
In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with ertugliflozin in combination with metformin, clinically
meaningful reductions in HbA1c were observed in subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity,
geographic region, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline HbA1c, and duration of type 2 diabetes
mellitus.
Cardiovascular outcomes
The effect of ertugliflozin on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was evaluated in the VERTIS CV study, a
multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial. The
study compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between
ertugliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care
treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
A total of 8 246 patients were randomised (placebo N=2 747, ertugliflozin 5 mg N=2 752, ertugliflozin
15 mg N=2 747) and followed for a median of 3 years. The mean age was 64 years and approximately
70% were male.
All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c
greater than or equal to 7%). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 13 years, the mean
HbA1c at baseline was 8.2% and the mean eGFR was 76 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were
treated with one (32%) or more (67%) antidiabetic medicinal products including metformin (76%),
insulin (47%), sulphonylureas (41%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (11%) and glucagon-
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (3%).
Almost all patients (99%) had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline.
Approximately 24% patients had a history of heart failure. The primary endpoint in VERTIS CV was
the time to first occurrence of MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or
non-fatal stroke).
Ertugliflozin demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for MACE (see Table 8). Results for the
individual 5 mg and 15 mg doses were consistent with results for the combined dose groups. 
In patients treated with ertugliflozin, the rate of hospitalisation for heart failure was lower than in
patients treated with placebo (see Table 8 and Figure 1).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with
Segluromet in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (see
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Segluromet
Segluromet has been shown to be bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of
ertugliflozin and metformin tablets.
Ertugliflozin
General introduction
The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.
The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 398 ng∙hr/mL and 81 ng/mL, respectively, with
5 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment, and 1 193 ng∙hr/mL and 268 ng/mL, respectively, with 15 mg
ertugliflozin once daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with
ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in
plasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing.
Absorption
Following single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma
concentrations (median time to maximum plasma concentration [Tmax]) of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour
post-dose under fasted conditions. Plasma Cmax and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-
proportional manner following single doses from 0.5 mg to 300 mg and following multiple doses from
1 mg to 100 mg. The absolute oral bioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15-mg
dose is approximately 100%. 
Administration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin Cmax by
29% and prolongs Tmax by 1 hour but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The
observed effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and
ertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was
administered without regard to meals.
The effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and metformin when
administered as Segluromet tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets. Food
had no meaningful effect on AUCinf of ertugliflozin or metformin, but reduced mean ertugliflozin Cmax
by approximately 41% and metformin Cmax by approximately 29% compared to the fasted condition.
Ertugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)
transporters.
Distribution
The mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 86 L.
Plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma
concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic
impairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66.
24
Ertugliflozin is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation
transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) in
vitro.
Biotransformation
Metabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for
ertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are
pharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative)
metabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%).
Elimination
The mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 µg dose was 11 L/hr. The mean
elimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be
17 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral
[14C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 41% and 50% of the drug-related
radioactivity was eliminated in faeces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was
excreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 34% as unchanged ertugliflozin in faeces, which is
likely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent.
Special populations
Renal impairment
In a phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or severe
renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg
ertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were ≤ 1.7-fold, compared to subjects with
normal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically relevant.
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the ertugliflozin Cmax values among the different
renal function groups. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal
impairment (see section 4.4). The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients
with renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment
Moderate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in
exposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and C max
decreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in
ertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in
patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of
ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
Paediatric population
No studies with ertugliflozin have been performed in paediatric patients.
Effects of age, body weight, gender and race
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin.
Drug interactions
In vitro assessment of ertugliflozin
In in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit or inactivate CYPs 1A2,
2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin and
ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit the activity of UGTs 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 in vitro. Ertugliflozin
was a weak inhibitor of UGTs 1A1 and 1A4 in vitro at higher concentrations that are not clinically
relevant. Ertugliflozin glucuronides had no effect on these isoforms. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely
25
to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medicinal products eliminated by these
enzymes.
Ertugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3
transporters or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant
concentrations in vitro. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently
administered medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters.
Metformin
Absorption
The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting
conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride
tablets 500 mg to 1 500 mg, and 850 mg to 2 550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose
proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in
elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady-
state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 µg/mL.
During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed
5 µg/mL, even at maximum doses.
Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by
approximately a 40% lower mean Cmax, a 25% lower AUC, and a 35-minute prolongation of Tmax
following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same
tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.
Distribution
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin
hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma
proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. 
Biotransformation
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.
Elimination
Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that
tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration,
approximately 90% of the absorbed metformin is eliminated via the renal route within the first
24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours.
Special populations
Renal impairment
In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and
the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in eGFR (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency.
Effects of age, body weight, gender and race
Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest
that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased,
compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin
pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.
26
Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and
patients with type 2 diabetes when analysed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical
studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of metformin was comparable
in males and females.
No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In
controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, the anti-hyperglycaemic effect
was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety
pharmacology, acute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.
General toxicity
Ertugliflozin
Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs for up to 13, 26, and
39 weeks, respectively. Signs of toxicity that were considered adverse were generally observed at
exposures greater than or equal to 77 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at the maximum
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 15 mg/day. Most toxicity was consistent with pharmacology
related to urinary glucose loss and included decreased body weight and body fat, increased food
consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum
parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism, gluconeogenesis and electrolyte imbalances,
and urinary changes such as polyuria, glucosuria, and calciuria. Microscopic changes related to
glucosuria and/or calciuria observed only in rodents included dilatation of renal tubules, hypertrophy
of zona glomerulosa in adrenal glands (rats), and increased trabecular bone (rats). Except for emesis,
there were no adverse toxicity findings in dogs at 379 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at
the MRHD of 15 mg/day.
Carcinogenesis
Ertugliflozin
In the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5,
15, and 40 mg/kg/day. There were no ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings at doses up to
40 mg/kg/day (approximately 41 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on
AUC). In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses
of 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day. Ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence
of benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma in male rats at 15 mg/kg/day. This finding was
attributed to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis and was not
considered relevant to human risk. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for neoplasia was
5 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day).
Metformin
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and
mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1 500 mg/kg/day,
respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily
dose of 2 000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with
metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential
observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal
uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.
27
Mutagenesis
Ertugliflozin
Ertugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial
reverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (human lymphocytes), and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.
Metformin
There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test
(S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test
(human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.
Reproductive toxicology
Ertugliflozin
In the rat fertility and embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered
ertugliflozin at 5, 25, and 250 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg/kg/day
(approximately 386 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC
comparisons). Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at
maternal exposures that were 239 and 1 069 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum
clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. At a maternally toxic dose in rats (250 mg/kg/day), lower
foetal viability and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation were observed at maternal exposure
that was 510 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day.
In the pre- and post-natal development study, decreased post-natal growth and development were
observed in rats administered ertugliflozin gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at
≥ 100 mg/kg/day (estimated 239 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of
15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sexual maturation was delayed in both sexes at 250 mg/kg/day (estimated
620 times the MRHD at 15 mg/day, based on AUC).
When ertugliflozin was administered to juvenile rats from post-natal day (PND) 21 to PND 90, a
period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human
pregnancy, increased kidney weights, dilatation of the renal pelvis and tubules, and renal tubular
mineralisation were seen at an exposure 13 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on
AUC. Effects on bone (shorter femur length, increased trabecular bone in the femur) as well as effects
of delayed puberty were observed at an exposure 817 times the MHRD of 15 mg/day based on AUC.
The effects on kidney and bone did not fully reverse after the 1-month recovery period.
Metformin
Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as
600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose
based on body surface area comparisons. Metformin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes
when administered to rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of
about 2 and 6 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 2 000 mg based on
body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of foetal
concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Segluromet is and what it is used for
What Segluromet is
Segluromet contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and metformin. Each belongs to a group of
medicines called “oral anti-diabetics”. These are medicines taken by mouth to treat diabetes.
- 
- 
Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
Metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides.
What Segluromet is used for
- 
Segluromet lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2
diabetes.
It can also help prevent heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Segluromet can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. 
Segluromet can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. 
You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Segluromet.
How Segluromet works
- 
Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to
be removed in your urine.
Metformin works by decreasing sugar (glucose) production in the liver.
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. This leads to a high level of sugar in your
blood. When this happens, this can lead to serious medical problems, like heart disease, kidney
disease, blindness and poor circulation.
57
2.  What you need to know before you take Segluromet
Do not take Segluromet
- 
if you are allergic to ertugliflozin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6).
if you have severely reduced kidney function or need dialysis.
if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic
acidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone
bodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness, or your breath developing an unusual fruity
smell.
if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated.
if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as ‘shock’ or
breathing difficulties.
if you have liver problems.
if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either regularly or from time to time (please see section
“Segluromet with alcohol”).
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Do not take Segluromet if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before
taking Segluromet. 
Warnings and precautions
Risk of lactic acidosis
Segluromet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if
your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Segluromet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Segluromet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you
experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
vomiting
stomach ache (abdominal pain)
muscle cramps
a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness
difficulty in breathing
reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Segluromet, if you:
- 
have kidney problems. Your doctor may do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are
working.
have or have had urinary tract infections.
have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.
have type 1 diabetes. Segluromet should not be used to treat this condition as it may increase the
risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients.
take other diabetes medicines; you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain
medicines.
- 
- 
- 
- 
58
- 
- 
might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine
production [diuretics] lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways to
prevent dehydration.
experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and
deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet
or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a doctor or
the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “diabetic ketoacidosis” –
a problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your
urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin
dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by
your healthcare professional. 
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness,
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier’s gangrene which destroys the tissue
under the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
When this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from
the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
insulin or other medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Segluromet during and for some time after the
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with
Segluromet.
During treatment with Segluromet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Urine glucose 
Because of how Segluromet works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on
this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this
medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Segluromet
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to
adjust the dose of Segluromet. In particular, tell your doctor:
- 
- 
if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics).
if you are taking other medicines that lower the sugar in your blood, such as insulin or
medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.
if you are taking medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors,
such as ibuprofen and celecoxib).
if you are taking certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin II receptor antagonists).
if you are taking corticosteroids (used to treat a variety of conditions, such as severe
inflammation of the skin or in asthma).
- 
- 
- 
59
- 
- 
if you are taking beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol or terbutaline (used to treat asthma).
if you are taking medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially
if you have reduced kidney function (verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir,
ranolazine, trimethoprim, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib or olaparib).
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for
example, in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Segluromet before or at the time of
the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with
Segluromet.
Segluromet with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Segluromet since this may increase the risk of lactic
acidosis (see section “Warnings and precautions”).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Vaniqa. This scientific 
discussion has been updated until 1 July 2004. For information on changes after this date please

Introduction 
Vaniqa, with the active ingredient eflornithine hydrochloride monohydrate, an amino acid analogue, is 
intended for the treatment of facial hirsutism in women. Vaniqa is to be applied to the affected areas 
twice daily.  
Eflornithine  hydrochloride  is  an  irreversible  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  ornithine  decarboxylase  (ODC). 
ODC  is  responsible  for  the  catalysis  of  ornithine  to  putrescene,  and  is  a  critical  enzyme  for  cell 
proliferation and function. Follicular cell proliferation and synthetic functions are important factors in hair 
growth. As ODC is present in the hair follicle, and implicated in the growth process, eflornithine has been 
developed as a topical product to treat facial hirsutism in women. In view of the reported rapid turnover of 
ODC  and  the  short  half-life  of  eflornithine,  continuous  treatment  is  required.  An  intravenous  form  has 
been available for the treatment of West African trypanosomiasis (T. brucei gambiense). 
Hirsutism is the presence  of excess hair growth in women and should not be considered, by itself, a 
disease.  Although  the  condition  may  indicate  an  underlying  disorder  of  androgen  production  (e.g. 
polycystic  ovary syndrome), in  most  cases  hirsutism results  from  a  combination  of  mildly increased 
androgen  production  and  increased  skin  sensitivity  to  androgens  (‘idiopathic’  hirsutism).  Not  all 
hirsutism is androgen-dependent. Androgen-independent hirsutism can be inherited as a familial trait. 
In addition, drugs such as steroids, cyclosporin, diazoxide and phenytoin, can cause hirsutism.   
There are many levels of hirsutism severity. If of minor severity it is often considered to be a cosmetic 
problem. However if of sufficient severity, it may have social and psychological influences on women. 
The  amount  of  hair  a  woman  will  tolerate  before  it  becomes  unwanted  varies  considerably  both 
culturally  and  racially.  Women  of  Indian  or  Negroid  origin  tend  to  have  less  facial  or  body  hair 
compared  with  Caucasians.  Among  Caucasians,  women  of  Mediterranean  origin  tend  to  have  a 
heavier hair growth than those of Nordic origin.  
The usual forms of treatment are mechanical hair removal (shaving, plucking, waxing, and depilatory 
creams) and medical treatment. Electrolysis and laser therapy are expensive but effective methods of 
permanent hair removal. Mechanical methods alleviate the problem temporarily but may result in local 
irritation.  Medical  treatment  consists  mainly  of  suppressing  ovarian  (oral  contraceptives)  or  adrenal 
androgen  secretion  or  of  blocking  androgen  in  the  skin  (e.g.  cyproterone  acetate).  The potential  for 
systemic side-effects limits the use of these treatments.  
There is a need for a safe and effective topical treatment for female facial hirsutism.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
The  cream  contains  15%  w/w  eflornithine  hydrochloride  monohydrate  (eflornithine)  corresponding  to 
11.5% w/w eflornithine anhydrous in an oil-in-water emulsion for topical administration. The excipients 
consist  of  water  (solvent),  glyceryl  stearate  and  polyethylene  glycol-100  stearate  (emulsifiers), 
cetearyl  alcohol  and  ceteareth-20 
(emulsifiers),  phenoxyethanol/methylparahydroxybenzoate/ 
propylparahydroxybenzoate (preservative system), stearyl alcohol (gelling agent), with mineral oil and 
dimethicone as emollients. 
The  product  is  packaged  in  15g,  30g  and  60g  tubes  (blend  of  high  density  and  low  density 
polyethylene), with a polypropylene screw cap.

Active substance 
Information  on  the  active  substance  has  been  provided  in  the  form  of  an  EDMF  for  each  site  of 
manufacture. 
Eflornithine is a racemic mixture, with no chiral reagents used during synthesis. Data for 19 batches 
demonstrates the absence of chiral (optical) activity. Eflornithine can exist in 3 physical forms A, B or 
C  at  ambient  conditions  confirmed  by  spectroscopic  and  thermal  studies.  Form  C  is  the 
thermodynamically  most  stable  form  and  the  one  routinely  produced  by  the  method  of  synthesis  as 
defined  in the  dossier.  However,  as  the  drug  substance  is  in  a  solution  prior  to  mixing  and  remains 
solubilised in the final product, the different polymorphs are not an issue  for product bioavailability. 
Proof  of structure is provided  using IR spectroscopy (in  water);  1H-NMR,  13C-NMR,  19F-NMR, and 
elemental analysis.  
There  are  no  unknown  impurities  present  at  levels  above  0.1%.  Six  known  impurities  have  been 
identified  at  levels  less  than  0.1%  with  a  further  degradation  product  also  controlled  by  the 
specification (each impurity ≤ 0.1%).  
The  identification  of  eflornithine  is  based  on  IR.  The  purity  is  controlled  by  HPLC.  The  impurity 
limits in the specifications are justified by the toxicology studies. 
A total of 21 batch analysis results  have been presented. Data comply with specifications.  
Thermal  and  light  stress  testing  has  been  performed  on  eflornithine  as  solid  substance  as  well  as  in 
aqueous  solutions.  From  these  studies  it  can  be  concluded  that  eflornithine  dry  substance  is  stable 
towards high temperatures but should be protected from light. The major degradation products formed 
during the studies  were identified. Data  was presented for  six batches  of product (three at  each site) 
investigated at 25°C/60% RH, 30°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH. Data support  a retest period  of 12 
months. 
Other ingredients 
Methyl  and  propyl  parahydroxybenzoates,  phenoxyethanol,  stearyl  alcohol,  dimeticone  and  purified 
water, all comply with the relevant Ph.Eur. monographs. Certificates of analysis are provided for these 
ingredients  and  are  acceptable.  A  statement  is  provided  to  the  effect  that  these  materials  do  not 
contain,  and  are  not  derived  from  specified  risk  material  as  defined  in  Commission  Decision 
97/534/EEC. A similar statement has been provided regarding the non-pharmacopoeial ingredients. 
The  non-pharmacopoeial  ingredients  consist  of  mineral  oil,  and  two  proprietary  excipients.  These 
latter  two  excipients  consist  of  a  mixture  of  cetearyl  alcohol  and  ceteareth  20,  and  a  mixture  of 
glyceryl stearate and polyethylene  glycol 100  stearate. Specifications and  certificates  of  analysis are 
provided  for  these  ingredients.  The  mineral  oil  used  in  the  preparation  meets  the  Ph.Eur.  purity 
requirements,  but  does  not  meet  the  Ph.Eur.  viscosity  requirement.  It  does,  however,  meet  all  NF 
requirements for light mineral oil. The specifications provided are acceptable. 
Product development and finished product 
Eight  different  formulations  (including  three  placebo  formulations)  were  used  in  the  clinical  trials. 
One of the formulations is identical to that to be marketed and three other formulations (containing 5, 
10 and 15% of eflornithine, equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) are very 
similar to the marketing formulation except that a modified preservative system was included. The last 
formulation is entirely different from that to be marketed, a water/ethanol mixture is used as solvent 
and no emulsifiers or preservatives are included. 
The crystalline forms A, C and mixtures of these have been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. 
From solubility studies it was evident that the three crystal forms have the same aqueous solubility at 
the temperatures studied (room temperature and 65°C, which is the temperature used to dissolve the 
substance).  Independently  of  crystal  form  the  substance  dissolves  within  5  minutes  and  does  not 
recrystalize when frozen. As the drug substance is easily dissolved during manufacture independently 
of morphic form this is not an issue for the bioavailability of the substance.

The particle size distribution of the drug substance varies from batch to batch as demonstrated by light 
scattering measurements. Since the substance is easily and completely dissolved this parameter is not 
critical for product manufacture or for the bioavailability of the active substance. 
The preservative system was optimised at a 0.4% level in the formulation. To ensure that the product 
is  adequately  preserved  throughout  its  shelf  life,  the  product  was  challenged  at  the  reduced  level  of 
preservative of 70%, 80% and 80% of its initial level of phenoxyethanol, methyl parahydroxybenzoate 
and  propyl  parahydroxybenzoate,  respectively,  and  the  results  indicate  a  satisfactory  capacity  to 
withstand microbial contamination even with low levels of preservatives.  
The product is being manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary Manufacturing Authorisation. 
The control tests and specifications for the finished product are adequately drawn up, and are 
considered to be relevant for a product of this type. The identification of eflornithine is based on 
HPLC. 
Specifications for microbial purity for the finished product are included in the release and shelf-life 
specifications and conform to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. 
The results from 4 pilot scale batches and two of smaller size have been submitted. The data presented 
clearly  indicates  uniformity  of  mixing  for  the  active  and  each  preservative  at  pilot  scale  (10%  of 
proposed commercial scale). Impurities have not been detected except for one batch, which utilised a 
different test method.  
Stability of the product 
The applicant has provided data from 23 stability studies performed on 10 batches (seven of these are 
of at least pilot scale). Five of the pilot scale batches are manufactured at the intended site. 
The  conclusion  from the studies is that there is  no significant  degradation  of the  finished product  at 
any of the conditions studied (5°C, 25°C/60% RH, 30°C/60% RH, 40°C, 50°C, 40°C/75% RH, light 
studies, and freeze/thaw conditions). Concerning accelerated studies the provided data package do not 
fulfil the ICH requirements (CPMP/ICH/380/95), three batches of at least pilot scale manufactured at 
the intended site and stored for at least 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. For a third batch  data is provided 
for  12  weeks  of  storage  at  45°C/75%RH. However  there  are  enough  data  from  supporting  stability 
testing to confirm the stability of the finished product throughout the proposed shelf life of 2 years. 
Apart  from  quantitation  of  eflornithine,  preservatives  and  related  substances  other  parameters, 
including appearance, viscosity, weight change and pH have been monitored. The analytical methods 
used are the same as those used for release testing of the finished product. 
There is no evidence of interaction between the product and the packaging container. 
The stability data presented are satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life of 2 years when stored 
below 25°C, as defined in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Vaniqa  cream  is  manufactured  using  a  conventional  manufacturing  process.  The  chemical-
pharmaceutical  dossier  is  well  documented  and  guarantees  the  quality  of  the  active  substance  and 
finished product, both initially and throughout the shelflife. The  proposed specifications are suitable 
and relevant for a topical product of this type. A number of quality points were not resolved at the time 
of  the  CPMP  opinion.  However,  these  were  considered  to  be  minor,  without  any  impact  on  the 
efficacy or safety of the product, and are indicated to be addressed post-approval.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Eflornithine has been developed as an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor. 
In the following text the strength of eflornithine is expressed both as the monohydrate chloride form 
and as the anhydrous form.

Pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
Eflornithine in vitro inhibited ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in hamster epididymal cytosol. 
The  results  were  confirmed  ex  vivo  where  treatment  of  male  Syrian  golden  hamsters  with 
eflornithine 2% (equivalent to 1.52% anhydrous hydrochloride free) significantly inhibited ODC in the 
cytosol  of  hair  follicles.  Hence,  an  indication  of  in  vivo  penetration  of  eflornithine  was  noted  at  a 
concentration lower than the 15%  cream  formulation  (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous  hydrochloride 
free) proposed for marketing.  
In vivo studies 
A  variety  of  dosages,  vehicle  formulations  and  treatment  times  were  used  in  the  studies  in  animal 
models of  hair  growth using the Syrian golden hamster and  mice, which to some  extent  can  explain 
the disparity in obtained results. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the most effective 
dose/concentration of eflornithine. In one study, the dose-response profile of eflornithine (1-10%) was 
investigated in the Syrian golden hamster after 21 days of treatment. Maximum reduction of hair mass 
(-50%)  was  obtained  with  a  2%  eflornithine  (equivalent  to  1.52%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free) 
formulation. In another study, also performed in the  golden  hamster,  comparable results  were  found 
with  5,  10  and  15%  eflornithine  (equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free), 
resulting  in  85%  hair  mass  inhibition.  In  mice,  a  dose  dependent  reduction  in  hair  growth  was 
observed  after  treatment  with  eflornithine  1-15%  (equivalent  to  0.76-11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride 
free).  Apart  from  the  differences  in  these  results,  it  is  evident  that  eflornithine  induces  a  marked 
reduction in hair growth rate of both daily and total hair lengths. The reduction in hair mass was partly 
reversible  when  investigated  in  a  42  days  reversibility  study.  The  reversibility  of  hair  growth  is  not 
immediate,  although  during  withdrawal  of  treatment,  the  ODC  level  returned  to  baseline  within  24 
hours.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. 
General pharmacology 
No studies on general pharmacodynamics have been performed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics  of radiolabelled  or  non-radiolabelled  eflornithine  was determined in  mice  and 
rats  after  single  topical  or  oral  administration.  In  addition,  dermal  permeability  of  eflornithine  was 
investigated in vitro in guinea pig and human cadaver skin. Pharmacokinetic parameters after repeated 
oral dosing were investigated in toxicology studies in rats. 
The  limit  of  quantification  (LOQ)  by  LC-MS-MS  was  5  ng/ml  (equivalent  to  3.83%  anhydrous 
hydrochloride free) for rat plasma. In K3EDTA samples, the LOQ was 2.5 ng/ml (equivalent to 1.92% 
anhydrous hydrochloride free) for mouse, rat and human plasma. 
The absorption of eflornithine is complete (100% of dose) in dogs or nearly complete (90% of dose) in 
rats following oral administration. 
In mice, following oral administration, the pharmacokinetics were linear over a wide dose range (10-
2000 mg/kg (equivalent to 7.67-1533.2% anhydrous hydrochloride free)). 
Terminal  plasma  half  life  is  6  hours  in  the  mouse  following  intravenous  or  oral  administration  and  
6-8h following dermal application. 
Systemically absorbed eflornithine is rapidly excreted unchanged via the renal route in mice, rats and 
humans.  
When  using  skin  permeation  techniques  in  vitro,  the  dermal  absorption  of  eflornithine  was  1.6%  in 
guinea pig, and 0.2% in human cadaver skin.  
Dermally applied radiolabeled eflornithine to male and female mice passed the stratum corneum when 
investigated  with  tape  stripping  techniques.  The  highest  levels  of  radioactivity  found  4  hours  after 
4/23

dosing  were in the skin test site,  kidneys, lungs, urinary bladder, liver, stomach  and  small intestine. 
After  24  hours,  eflornithine  related  radioactivity  was  found  at  the  skin  test  site  and  the  kidneys. 
Radioactivity was still present at the skin test site, large intestine and kidneys 96  hours  after dosing, 
although the levels were decreasing with time. 
After  application  of  the  cream  base  formulation  intended  for  marketing  as  a  single  dermal  dose 
(approximately  600  mg/kg,  equivalent  to  459.96%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  to  mice,  the 
systemic  absorption  was  less  than  0.84%  of  the  dose  administered.  In  female  rats  treated  dermally 
twice  daily  (approximately  30  mg/kg/dose,  equivalent  to  23  mg/kg/dose  anhydrous  hydrochloride 
free) the dermal absorption was less than 0.75% after up to 5 days of treatment, but 3-4% after 7 days 
of dermal dosing. In another study in rats, no difference in absorption was observed between male and 
female rats after both oral and dermal administration of eflornithine. 
In  rats,  which  were  treated  topically  twice  daily  for  1-7  days,  the  concentration  of  drug  derived 
radioactivity  increased  during  the  7-day  dermal  dosing  period.  Apart  from  the  skin  test  site, 
radioactivity  was  found  in  the  urinary  bladder,  kidneys,  pituitary  gland  and  spleen  after  7  days  of 
dermal dosing. Following oral dosing (7 days of single oral doses), the highest concentration of drug 
related radioactivity was found in the intestine, kidneys, adrenals and liver. Ninety-six hours after the 
last dose, low amounts could still be detected especially in the kidneys and liver.  
Eflornithine does not bind to plasma proteins.  
Eflornithine  is  decarboxylated  by  ornithine  decarboxylase  in  vitro.  However,  no  metabolism  of 
eflornithine has been observed in vivo and no metabolism studies have been performed. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In acute oral and dermal toxicity assessed in rabbits and rats respectively eflornithine showed very low 
acute toxicity. However, autopsies were not performed and therefore no determination of target organ 
toxicity could be made. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A two-week, a six-month and a one-year toxicity study  of  eflornithine  were performed in mice,  rats 
and minipigs. The six-month study in rats compared the toxicity of eflornithine to vehicle. Based on 
dosages the animals received approximately 25 (rat) and 75 (minipig) times the intended clinical dose 
in humans. 
The two-week study in mice was a limited study in which no autopsies or biochemical/haematological 
measurements were made. No clinical or dermal effects were observed in either group  of animals over 
the 14-day observation period.   
In  the  six-month study  in  rats  in  which  the  10%  eflornithine  solution  (equivalent  to  7.67%  anhydrous 
hydrochloride free) and 15% eflornithine cream (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) were 
applied  transient,  very  slight,  reversible  erythema  of  the  treatment  site  was  noted  initially  in  animals 
treated with either the 15% eflornithine cream (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) or its 
corresponding  vehicle  control. No local  effects  on the  skin  were  observed in rats  treated  with the  10% 
eflornithine solution (equivalent to 7.67% anhydrous hydrochloride free) or the vehicle solution. No other 
treatment related effects were observed neither during the study nor at necropsy. There were no signs of 
systemic toxicity. The concentrations of the compound in rat plasma were below the limit of detection.

animals and were not considered to be toxicologically relevant. There were no treatment-related changes 
in  bodyweight  gain,  physical  or  ophthalmic  parameters,  clinical  chemistry,  organ  weights  or 
histopathology.  The  NOEL  was  considered  to  be  > 150  mg/kg/day  (equivalent  to  115  mg/kg/day  as 
anhydrous hydrochloride free).

Genotoxicity 
Eflornithine  was  not  genotoxic  in  the  standard  genotoxicity  test  battery  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  at 
concentrations in the in vivo study 1000 times above clinical exposure. 
Carcinogenicity

in  mice  were  performed,  one

Two  carcinogenicity 
photocarcinogenicity  study.  In  the  ‘conventional’  study,  the  animals  were  treated  with  dermal 
application of eflornithine 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg (equivalent to 115, 230 and 460 mg/kg anhydrous 
hydrochloride free). When calculating on exposure, the animals were exposed hundreds/thousand fold 
above  clinical  exposure  already  at  the  lowest  dosage.  There  were  no  product  related  changes  in 
survival, clinical observations, body weights or food consumption. No treatment related findings were 
noted at  necropsy  except acanthosis and  hyperkeratosis of the treated skin  without  dermal irritation, 
observed  especially in  female  mice in all  dosage  groups except the  untreated  control. The incidence 
and severity  was relatively  even  across the  vehicle  control and treatment  groups,  except  for a slight 
increase  at  high  dose  level.  Hence,  these  findings  seem  to  be  caused  by  the  vehicle,  although  an 
additive  effect  by  eflornithine  at  high  dose  level  can  not  be  ruled  out.  No  difference  in  neoplastic 
changes (including skin tumours) between the groups was observed.  
In  the  photocarcinogenicity  study,  hairless  mice  were  treated  for  40  weeks  with  60,  180  and  600 
mg/kg of eflornithine (equivalent to 46, 138 and 460 mg/kg anhydrous hydrochloride free) topically, 
plus subjected to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Untreated control groups received UVR at two different 
radiation intensities, which induced  a dose-related response in  development  of skin tumours (shorter 
duration  of  tumour  onset  and  increased  tumour  yield).  An  enhanced  tumour  response  was  also 
observed in the group receiving the vehicle lotion plus UVR (600 RBU/week) compared to the group 
receiving  only  UVR. After application to skin  areas  of a  moisturising  cream,  less  reflection  of light 
occurs  and  a  higher  amount  of  light  is  penetrated  into  the  skin,  which  might  explain  the  higher 
incidence of tumours observed in the vehicle control group. Mice that received eflornithine showed a 
reduced skin tumour development compared to those administered the vehicle lotion. 
In  response  to  the List  of  Questions  the  results  of  two  oral  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice 
performed  by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  were  submitted.  Eflornithine  was  not  carcinogenic  after 
oral administration to mice  for 2 years at  doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 767 mg/kg/day 
anhydrous hydrochloride free) (Johnson 2000) and not carcinogenic after oral administration to rats of 
eflornithine  for  2  years  at  doses  up  to  600  mg/kg/day  (equivalent  to  460  mg/kg/day  anhydrous 
hydrochloride free) (Crowell 2000). 
Reproduction toxicity 
The reproduction toxicity studies were performed in rats and rabbits. Eflornithine was in most studies 
administered to the animals via the dermal route. In the peri/postnatal study in rats, drinking water was 
used as route of administration. 
Eflornithine  had  no  effect  on  male  or  female  fertility  investigated  in  rats  at  exposure  levels 
approximately 500-1000 times above clinical exposure in the high dose group. 
Two  embryotoxicity  studies  with  topical  application  to  rats  were  performed.  In  one  study  severe 
toxicity of the embryos/foetuses was observed in both treatment groups. The incidence of live foetuses 
and  weights  in  surviving  foetuses  was  low.  Skeletal  malformations  (delayed  ossification)  and  soft 
tissue variations (dilatation of the lateral ventricles of the brain and increased renal pelvic cavitation) 
were observed. These findings were probably caused by oral ingestion of the test compound since no 
precautions  were  taken  to  prevent  oral  exposure  of  the  cream.  The  study  was  repeated  under  such 
precautionary measures and no treatment related findings on either maternal  or litter parameters were 
observed  except  skin  reactions  (erythema).  Toxicokinetic  data  from  the  HD  group  demonstrated  an 
exposure approximately 5-25 times (depending  on time  of  measurement) less than in the  first study. 
Hence, the toxicokinetic data support the assumption of suspected oral ingestion of the test substance 
in first study. The animals were exposed considerably (500-1000 times) above clinical exposure.  
In the rabbit embryotoxicity study, the  high  dose level (150 times the intended  clinical dose)  caused 
severe  maternal  toxicity  (prolonged  reductions  in  body  weight  gain  (≈  10%)  and  food  consumption, 
severe skin reactions at the application sites and one death/four abortions). Necropsy demonstrated an 
6/23 


increase in implantation loss and a decreased foetal body weight in this group. In response to the List 
of Questions and List of Outstanding Issues the applicant submitted a preliminary report on a seven-
day pharmakokinetic study in pregnant rabbits. The study showed an adequate safety margin (>500 the 
exposure) for use in man.  
The peri/postnatal study in rats  demonstrated slight  maternal toxicity (reduction in body  weight  gain 
and food consumption) at doses > 190 times the intended clinical dose. A decrease in mean pup weight 
was noted in mid and high dose groups while other parameters related to gestation, pup survival and 
development  were  normal  except a slight  decrease in  fertility  of the  high  dose F1  generation.  These 
results  can,  however,  be  accepted  considering  the  high  oral  doses  used  in  the  study  and  the  low 
systemic absorption of eflornithine following dermal administration of eflornithine cream.  
Local tolerance and special toxicity studies 
The  dermal  irritating  potential  of  different  cream  formulations,  among  them  the  one  proposed  for 
marketing,  was  tested  in  a  number  of  studies  in  New  Zealand  White  rabbits.  The  duration  of  the 
studies  was  between  5  and  14  days.  In  general,  information  on  the  concentration  of  the  active 
compound was lacking. All formulation tested resulted in mild to moderate irritation. The 15% cream 
formulation  (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  was  also tested in  mice  (13  weeks) 
and  hamsters  (13  days).  No  indications  of  systemic  toxicity  (mice)  or  dermal  irritation  (mice, 
hamsters) were seen.  
In  guinea pigs, a 10%  eflornithine solution (equivalent to 7.67% anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  was 
nonsensitizing. No phototoxicity  was observed in guinea pigs after application of a 15% eflornithine 
solution plus 1 hour exposure to UVA light.  
The  primary  eye  irritation  potential  was  investigated  in  rabbits.  A  10%  eflornithine  solution 
(equivalent  to  7.67%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  or  the  15%  cream  formulation  (equivalent  to 
11.5% anhydrous  hydrochloride free) was administered to washed and unwashed eyes of the rabbits. 
Mild to moderate (conjunctival) irritation potential was observed in both washed and unwashed eyes. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
An  assessment  of  the  environmental  risk  was  performed  and  no  significant  risk  to  the  environment 
related to the use of eflornithine is anticipated. 
Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Several  deficiencies  regarding  the  preclinical  investigation  of  systemic  toxicity  of  eflornithine  have 
been  identified,  i.e.  lack  of  investigation  of  target  organ  toxicity  in  acute dosing  and  lack  of  safety 
pharmacology  studies.  However,  considering  the  low  systemic  exposure  and  the  absence  of  clinical 
safety concerns based on experience from long-term use of high oral doses this can be accepted. Daily 
doses  of  eflornithine  1 g/day  (equivalent  to  0.76  g/day  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  has  been 
administered orally to humans for one year without significant toxicity in most patients. 
It  is  concluded  that  eflornithine  is  not  genotoxic  and  does  not  seem  to  have  carcinogenic  or 
photocarcinogenic potential. However, the vehicle used in the photocarcinogenicity study, which with 
only minor differences is similar to the vehicle intended for marketing, induced an enhanced tumour 
response. In  response to the List of Questions the applicant  argued based  on  a literature survey that 
topically applied vehicles can alter the properties of the skin (decrease the amount of light reflected, 
scattered, or  absorbed by the skin  or increase the  extent and/or  depth  of penetration into the skin  of 
humans and mice). Hence, an increased amount of light can be absorbed which might lead to skin tumour 
development.  A  comparison  between  the  vehicle  used  in  the  formulation  proposed  for  marketing,  and 
other  vehicles, is  not possible  from the  literature  data submitted by the  applicant. However, there is  no 
indication  that  this  vehicle  formulation  is  worse  than  other  widely  used  formulations.  Therefore,  it  is 
concluded  that  the  vehicle  of  Vaniqa,  like  other  vehicles,  can  alter  skin  properties  that  during  UV 
exposure can lead to enhanced skin tumour formation in mice.

Part IV: Clinical aspects 
Vaniqa  is  proposed  for  the  treatment  of  facial  hirsutism  in  women.  Eflornithine  is  an  irreversible 
inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  ornithine  decarboxylase  (ODC),  which  is  present  in  the  hair  follicle  and 
implicated  in  the  growth  process.  Efficacy  and  safety  has  been  evaluated  in  a  dose  ranging  study 
(GMEH-3071)  and  two  pivotal,  multicentre,  randomised,  vehicle  controlled  studies  (DE140-001, 
DE140-002).  In  addition,  one  supportive,  open  label  study  (GMEH-2664)  and  two  long-term  open 
label  studies  (DE140-010,  DE140-011)  were  presented.  The  total  number  of  subjects  who  received 
eflornithine in the phase II and III studies (including the additional studies) is 1,487 patients out of the 
enrolled 1721 patients.  
In the following text the strength of eflornithine is expressed both as the monohydrate chloride form 
and as the anhydrous form.  
Clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  eflornithine  were  investigated  in  both 
healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  facial  hirsutism.  The  6  studies  enrolled  a  total  of  343  subjects 
applying  eflornithine  for up to 37 consecutive  days. The studies  were  conducted in  compliance  with 
GCP.

Pharmacodynamics 
Local irritant effect 
DE140-004 
In this open, single-centre study 230 healthy individuals were enrolled to determine the contact allergy 
sensitisation  potential  of  eflornithine.  Each  subject  was  exposed  to  both  eflornithine  15%  cream 
(equivalent  to  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  and  vehicle  on  different  skin  sites.  Occlusive 
patches were left in continuous contact with the skin for three weeks and fresh test material applied 3 
times per week during this period. Following a two-week no-treatment rest period, a single challenge 
application was made. 
Both  the  active  cream  and  the  vehicle  seem  to  be  skin  irritants  when  applied  under  occlusion. 
Although eflornithine 15% cream (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) does not seem 
to cause allergic sensitisation, the possibility cannot be ruled out.  
DE140-005 
This was a 21-day long open-label skin irritant study  including 30 healthy volunteers (25 females, 5 
males).  Eflornithine  15%  cream  (equivalent  to  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free,  vehicle  cream 
and  a  known skin irritant, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), were applied  under  occlusive patches  for 21 
8/23

days on the subject’s back. Evaluation of the exposure sites for skin irritancy was done on a daily basis 
during this period. 
Tukey’s Studentized Range Test for multiple comparisons indicated the irritation scores for all three 
test products were significantly different  from one another. The highest score was for SLS, followed 
by eflornithine 15% cream (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) and the vehicle cream. 
Eflornithine  15%  cream  (equivalent  to  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  was  classified  as 
“irritating”, the vehicle cream as “moderately irritating” and SLS as “extremely irritating. 
Photoallergy-toxicity 
DE140-006 
This was an open-label photocontact allergy test of healthy subjects. Five males and 25 females were 
enrolled  and  the  duration  of  treatment  37  days.  Twenty-eight  individuals  completed  the  study. 
Application of eflornithine 15% cream (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free and vehicle 
cream  twice  weekly  for  24  hours  during  a  three-week  induction  period  followed  by  exposure  to 
ultraviolet light (UVA  and  UVB). Following a period without treatment, a single application  of test 
substances was made of untreated skin sites and thereafter irradiated with UVA light. 
The  results  of  the  study  do  not  indicate  any  tendency  for  photoallergic  reactions  caused  by  the 
eflornithine 15% (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  cream. However, according to 
the  protocol,  2  MEDs  (minimal  erythema  dose)  of  unfiltered  light  from  a  defined  UV  source,  were 
used for the irradiation of test sites during the induction phase. Prior to entry of study each individual 
was  tested  for  MED  values.  However,  several  individuals  in  both  treatment  groups  did  not  reach  a 
score of even a slight erythema after irradiation of untreated skin with 2 MEDs, especially during the 
first study week.  
DE140-007 
This was an open-label study of healthy individuals (22 females and 3 males). A single application of 
the eflornithine 15% (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) cream or vehicle was applied 
on a single occasion onto tape-stripped skin sites followed by irradiation with 0.5 MEDs of UVB and 
to  UVA  for a  duration  of 10 times the  MED  equivalent. Responses  were  graded  on a 5-point scale. 
Subjects acted as their own controls in that each individual had both test products applied and also an 
untreated irradiated skin site. 
There  seems  to  be  no  indication  of  a  phototoxic  potential.  The  gradings  of  erythemal reaction  after 
irradiation appears to be similar for treated and untreated skin. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  documentation  for  Vaniqa  consists  of  two  pharmacokinetic  studies  (GMEH 
2971, DE140-003) and published data from three studies on i.v. and oral eflornithine. 
The systemic absorption of eflornithine 15% (equivalent to 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) after 
topical administration appears low. The estimated absorption based  on urine and faecal recoveries of 
radiolabelled drug after single and multiple dosing were 0.34% and 0.82% of the dose, respectively. 
Based on LC/MS analysis of urine the mean amount of the dose excreted renally was 1.3% at steady 
state.  The  total  recoveries  (including  unabsorbed  drug  from  the  application  site)  were  72.4%  and 
85.4%  respectively  and  thus,  approximately  30  and  15%  of  the  dose  were  not  accounted  for. 
Considering  that the radiolabelled  drug  was  administered topically, the  recovery is considered  fairly 
high.   
The steady state plasma half-life of eflornithine was approximately 8 hours. Steady state was reached 
within  4  days.  Measurable  plasma  levels  of  eflornithine  are  obtained  and  the  mean  maximum  and 
trough levels are approximately 10 and 5  ng/ml (equivalent to 7.67 and 3.83 anhydrous hydrochloride 
free), respectively. After 7 days treatment with eflornithine cream twice daily the maximum levels of 
eflornithine  were  approximately twice as  high  on the  last day  compared  with the  first  day. The  data 
indicate  no  major  concerns  with respect to  accumulation  of  eflornithine after topical  administration. 
Although  no data are available  for longer treatment periods  even a large increase in absorption  over 
time would not be of concern for the safety of Vaniqa given the low systemic absorption and the much 
lower doses used compared with other indications.

The dose of eflornithine used for the treatment of sleeping sickness is according to published data in 
the range of 25-30 g per day (equivalent to 19.2-23 g/day anhydrous hydrochloride free), administered 
i.v. or orally. No maximum daily dosage has been given in the SPC for topical treatment with Vaniqa. 
In one clinical study, the mean amount of cream applied was approximately 0.5 g (0.383 g anhydrous 
hydrochloride  free)  per  day,  which  contains  75 mg  (57.5  mg  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free) 
eflornithine.  Doses  used  to  treat  sleeping  sickness  would  then  be  300-400-fold  the  daily  dose  of 
Vaniqa.  Considering  an  absorption  of  approximately  1%,  the  difference  would  be  even  larger.  The 
maximum  plasma  levels  of  eflornithine after  repeated  topical  administration  of 0.5 g  (0.383  g)  15% 
cream  twice  daily  were  up  to  15  ng/ml  (about  80  nM,  equivalent  to  11.5  ng/ml  (about  61.3  nM) 
anhydrous  hydrochloride  free).  In  a  Phase  I  study  in  cancer  patients,  systemic  effects  (decreased 
polyamine excretion in urine) were observed with Cmax values of eflornithine between 2.8 µg/ml (15 µ
M)  and  58 µg/ml  (320 µM,  equivalent  to  2.2 µg/ml  and  44.5 µg/ml  (11.5  and  245 µgM)  anhydrous 
hydrochloride free). These data indicate that the safety margins for topical eflornithine in comparison 
with i.v. or oral administration are high.  
According  to  published  data,  eflornithine  is  mainly  eliminated  by  excretion  of  unchanged  drug  in 
urine.  Thus,  increased  plasma  levels  after  topical  administration  cannot  be  completely  excluded  in 
patients with severe renal impairment, despite the low systemic absorption. 
Studies in special populations 
No separate studies have been carried out in special populations, like the elderly, subjects of different 
races  or  subjects  with  renal  or  hepatic  disease.  The  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  in  the 
target  population,  i.e.  females  with  hirsutism.  Eflornithine  is  mainly  excreted  unchanged  in  urine. 
However,  the  applicant  has  estimated  that  a  subject  with  an  80%  reduction  in  creatinine  clearance 
would obtain a 5-fold higher systemic exposure to eflornithine after topical administration. Compared 
to the high exposures after systemic administration, the predicted increase in a renally impaired patient 
is not a safety concern.  
Interaction studies 
No interaction studies were initially performed with Vaniqa since it is a product for topical use and the 
systemic  exposure  to  the  drug  is  low.  However,  in  response  to  the  List  of  Questions  the  company 
submitted results from in vitro inhibition studies of eflornithine with recombinant human cytochrome 
P450  isoenzymes.  The  studies  showed  that  eflornithine  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  metabolism  by  these 
enzymes and the likelihood of drug-drug interactions of eflornithine with their respective substrates is 
low.

Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose-response study (GMEH-3071) 
The  study  was  double-blind  with  parallel  groups  treated  with  5%,10  %,  and  15%  eflornithine 
(equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) and placebo. The study period was 
24 weeks with application twice daily and a follow-up 8 weeks after cessation of therapy.  
A total  of 187 potential patients  with  facial  hirsutism  were screened  and  of these 125 subjects  were 
included in the study.  
Efficacy  was  measured by  using a  modification of the Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scoring  method (5-
point  scale  for  each  of  the  parameters  length,  area,  opacity  and  stiffness)  and  by  video  microscopic 
image  analysis  of  the  chin  area.  Subject  self-assessment  and  subject  reports  of  time  spent  on  hair 
removal were also reported. Prior to entry the subjects were selected by grading based  on mFG chin 
area score for their hirsutism.  
There was a statistically significant reduction of mFG scores for length (but not for area, opacity and 
stiffness)  at  the  end  of  treatment  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0001)  only  for  the  15%  eflornithine 
((equivalent  to  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  cream  but  not  for  the  other  formulations.  For 
15%  (equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  eflornithine  cream  the 
absolute difference from baseline was –0.61 (from 3.09 + 0.53 to 2.48 + 0.69 of a score 0-4), the score 
3  represents  definite  visible  and  the  score  2  represents  barely  visible.  If  all  four  mFG  scores  were 
summarised  the  difference  was  still  significant  (p=0.0027)  at  the  end  of  treatment.  This  effect  was 
reversed  8  weeks  post-treatment.  A  statistically  significant  reduction  of  growth  rate  (0.19  mm 
difference  in  growth  length  measured  after  48  hours  ±  6  hours)  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0022) 
was also  detected by the image  analysis 25  weeks after initiating therapy  with the  eflornithine 15%

(equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  cream  only.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  between  groups  for  any  subject  perception  parameter  at  week  25.  The  15% 
eflornithine (equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) cream formulation was 
chosen for further studies. 
Main clinical studies ( DE140-001 and DE140-002) 
Both  studies  were  multicentre,  double-blind,  parallel  and  vehicle-controlled.  Altogether  596  female 
subjects with excessive facial hair were enrolled. Using a sample size ratio of 2:1, 395 subjects were 
treated  with  the  proposed  market  formulation  of  eflornithine  and  201  received  treatment  with  the 
vehicle. Study medication was applied to facial areas affected by excessive hair growth twice daily for 
24  weeks,  followed  by  a  period  of  8  weeks  with  no  treatment.  Only  subjects  who  had  a  clinical 
diagnosis of facial hirsutism, a customary frequency of removal of facial hair of two or more times per 
week and a  chin and  upper lip  hair  density  of at least 5 terminal  hairs per square  centimetre (video 
image analysis) were included in the study. 
Between 24-31% of the included population had an endocrine/metabolic history but the figures were 
comparable for the two treatment  groups. Nine individuals who received eflornithine cream and four 
individuals  who received the  vehicle presented  with a medical history of polycystic  ovarian  disease. 
Women taking oral contraceptives were accepted for inclusion.  
Primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA). This was an 
evaluation of the extent of improvement/worsening of the patient’s facial hirsutism compared with an 
initial pre-treatment evaluation. Hair parameters such as length of hairs, density of hairs and darkening 
of  the  skin  were  considered,  though  not  separately  ranked.  The  PGA  was  performed  48  hours  after 
supervised shaving  using a  four-point scale:  clear/almost  clear,  marked improvement, improved and 
no improvement/worse.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were Subjects Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SSAQ) and Video Image 
Analysis (VIA).  
The SSAQ consisted of six questions on the impact of facial hair on the quality of life. The subjects 
responded to these questions by rating on an analogue scale ranging from 1-100 mm. The 0 point was 
labelled 
“extremely 
bothered/uncomfortable”.   
“not  bothered/uncomfortable” 
the  100  point  was 
labelled 
and 
A video fibre optic microscope was used to collect images of the skin including hair on the treatment 
sites. Images were transferred to an image analysis system for evaluation of hair growth (length) and 
spatial mass (hair area).  
The  primary  endpoint,  PGA,  was  dichotomised  into  success  (clear/almost  clear  or  marked 
improvement) and  failure (improved  or  no improvement/worse).  A  difference between the treatments 
groups  at  week  24 of 20%  (based  on  an  expected  rate  of success  of  30%  for  eflornithine  and 10%  for 
vehicle)  was  prospectively  defined  to  be  clinically  significant.  Differences  between  treatment  in  the 
proportion  of  subjects  achieving  success  were  analysed  by  the  Cochran  Mantel-Haenszel  test  and 
when the sample of the cell-sizes was small, exact tests such as Fisher’s exact test were used.  
For the secondary endpoint, the Subject’s Self-Assessment, in which the responses to the six questions 
were  expected  to  be  intercorrelated,  a  multivariate  analysis  of  variance  (Wilk’s  Criterion)  was 
performed with treatment and investigational site as effects in the model to test the null hypothesis that 
the treatment vectors of means were equal. It this test was statistically significant, a univariate analysis 
for each question was evaluated. 
The other secondary endpoint, reduction of hair growth and spatial mass evaluated by Video Imaging 
Analysis,  was  dichotomised  into  “success”  if  the  reduction  of  hair  growth  was  at  least  50%  and 
“failure” if the reduction was < 50%. Due to small samples of the cell-sizes, the differences between 
treatments  for  achieving  success  were  analysed  by  Fisher’s  Exact  Test.  An  analysis  of  variance 
(ANOVA) was used to analyse treatment differences in spatial mass. ANOVA was also used as an a 
posteriori analysis for hair growth. 
Two data sets were formed for the purposes of efficacy evaluation. One was All Subjects Randomised 
(ASR)  which  was the primary  data set, which  comprised  all subjects randomised into the study  and 
who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  The  other  data  set  was  the  Evaluable  data  set, 
12/23

which consisted of all subjects who were without significant protocol violations. For both data sets all 
subjects  withdrawn  from  the  studies  had  their  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF).  The 
distribution of the patients is given below.

The reasons for discontinuation were similar for the two treatment groups within each study. The total 
percentage of the study population who discontinued varied between 24% to 27% for the eflornithine-
treated  group  and  between  25%  to  28%  for  the  vehicle-treated  group.  Seven  subjects  in  the  vehicle 
group and three in the eflornithine group requested to discontinue due to lack of efficacy. 
For  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  (PGA)  a  statistically  significant  difference  of  improvement  in 
favour of eflornithine 15%  (equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride free) cream 
over vehicle was seen during the treatment period from week 4 and onwards in study DE140-001 and 
from  week  8  and  onwards  in  study  DE140-002.  Following  the  cessation  of  therapy,  the  drug  effect 
decreased  and  no  statistical  significance  versus  vehicle  was  seen  after  8  weeks.  The  percentage  of 
subjects who had at least some improvement in the PGA reached a plateau after 8 weeks of treatment. 
However, the  degree  of improvement  continued to increase throughout the study  with  more subjects 
achieving success throughout the study.

Post  hoc  data  of  all  categories  of  any  improvement  were  summarised  (this  was  not  the  primary 
efficacy measure) and at the end of treatment there were 118 subjects (67%) in the eflornithine 15% 
cream group compared with 36 subjects (39%) in the vehicle group in DE 140-001. Of subjects treated

in DE 140-002 with eflornithine 15% cream, 73%  versus 44% of subjects treated with the vehicle had 
a PGA, which showed at least some improvement. 
For  DE  140-001  a  treatment-investigator  interaction  logistic  analysis  showed  that  no  statistically 
significant  treatment-investigator  interaction  could  be  detected.  For  the  study  DE  140-002  the 
treatment-investigator interaction logistic analysis indicated the presence  of  a statistically significant 
treatment-investigator interaction (p=0.059). However, the interaction was evaluated to be quantitative 
rather than qualitative and therefore the data were deemed poolable. 
Analysis  of  prognostic  factors  for  DE  140-001  such  as  effects  of  age,  race  and  prior  hair  removal 
technique  upon the primary response  measure  demonstrated  an  effect  of  race  only. The success rate 
for  whites  at  Week  24  was  30.6%  and  for  non-whites  13.8%  as  assessed  according  to  the  PGA 
evaluation  dichotomised  into  success  at  the  end  of  treatment.  This  success  rate  was  24.4%  for  the 
whole study population. A 50% (3 out of 6) success rate was seen for individuals above the age of 65 
years.  However,  the  sample  size  was  too  small  to  verify  an  age-dependent  difference.  Prior  hair 
removal  techniques  did  not  appear  to  have  prognostic  significance.  For  DE140-002  analysis  of 
prognostic  factors  upon  the  primary  response  measure  demonstrated  a  tendency  for  a  lower  success 
rate for non-whites (34.9%) compared with whites (46.2%), however the difference is not of the same 
magnitude and significance as in study DE140-001. According to the demographic data for the study 
population  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  A  55.6% 
success rate was seen for individuals above the age of 65 years as compared with 43% < 65 years of 
age but again, the sample size was too small to verify an age-dependent difference. 
For  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  SSAQ,  mean  baseline  scores  in  both  study  DE 140-001  and 
DE 140-002  for  all  six  self-assessment  questions  were  over  77  units  in  both  treatment  groups.  For 
DE 140-001  examination  of  the  univariate  results  from  the  individual  questions  constituting  the 
questionnaire  revealed  significant  baseline  differences  for  two  of  the  questions.  To  adjust  for  this 
initial  bias  a  multivariate  analysis  of  covariance  using  these  two  significant  baseline  questions  as 
covariates  was  performed  on  the  assessment  at  all  post-baseline  periods.  There  was  a  significant 
difference for all six questions in favour of the eflornithine-treated group compared with the vehicle 
group (multivariate Wilks test, p= 0.0297) in DE 140-001 and in DE 140-002 (multivariate, p<0.003).

The  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  for  the  reduction  of  the  score  for  different  questions 
varied between approximately 9 and 11 units in DE 140-001 and between 19 and 21 points in DE 140-
002.  Differences  between  treatment  groups  were  no  longer  statistically  significant  8  weeks  after 
cessation of therapy.  
For  the  other  secondary  endpoint,  video  image  data,  the  results  of  the  analysis  for  DE 140-001 and 
DE 140-002 at the  end  of treatment demonstrated  no  statistically significant treatment difference  for 
the evaluation of hair growth (success defined as hair length reduced by at least 50%). Of the subjects 
treated  with  eflornithine  cream  in  study  DE 140-001,  6.3%  were  deemed  successes  (at  least  50% 
reduction) compared with 1.3% for those treated with the vehicle. In DE 140-002 8.6% of the subjects

treated with eflornithine cream were deemed successes compared with 2.6% for those treated with the 
vehicle.  
For the spatial mass, the results demonstrated a statistically significant treatment difference in favour 
of  eflornithine.  At  the  end  of  treatment  in  DE 140-001,  the  mean  spatial  mass  for  the  eflornithine-
treated  subjects  was  0.037  mm2  and  0.046  mm2  for  the  vehicle-treated  subjects  (p=0.0001).  At  the 
same time point in the study DE 140-002, mean spatial mass for the eflornithine-treated subjects was 
0.036 mm2 and 0.043 mm2 for the vehicle-treated subjects (p=0.0004).

Supportive studies 
GMEH-2664  
A Phase II open-label study, which was conducted using prototype formulations of eflornithine.  
GMEH-2664 was the first study of women with hirsutism. It was an open, multi-centre study where 
thirty  subjects  were  enrolled  and  24  completed  the  treatment  twice  daily  for  24  weeks  with 
eflornithine  15%  (equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5%  anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  cream  and  12-
week  post  treatment  follow-up.  It  was  concluded  at  the  end  of  study  that  all  subjects,  except  two, 
experienced a reduction in the number of  hairs in the treated area. However, although individual data 
have been provided, no formal efficacy results are available and conclusions with respect to efficacy are 
not possible. 
DE140-010 and DE140-011 
These open-label non-comparative studies were of similar design, however, DE140-010 had a 12-month 
treatment period, whereas DE140-011 had a 6-month treatment period. Inclusion criteria included 20 hairs 
on the chin and upper lip and twice weekly removal of facial hairs. The PGA was the primary efficacy 
measure.   
In DE140-010, ten US investigators enrolled 216 subjects; 144 subjects completed the 52-week treatment 
phase  and  142  completed  the  study  (including  4-week  follow-up).  At  20  weeks,  18.4%  (32/174)  of 
subjects were rated as clear/almost clear or markedly improved on PGA and at 52 weeks, 23.9% (35/146) 
were  considered  responders  (clear/almost  clear  or  markedly  improved).  For  80.7%  of  the  subjects 
improvement or greater response was demonstrated. Improvement increases slightly from week 20 to 52 
and the study implies that there is a continuous effect as measured by PGA.  A total of 34% of subjects 
discontinued the study, in majority of cases due to subjects ‘lost to follow-up’.    
In DE140-011 754 subjects were enrolled by 31 investigators from multinational sites, 612 completed the 
26-week treatment phase and 577 completed the study (including 4-week follow-up). At 26 weeks, 47.3% 
(289/611) were rated clear/almost clear or markedly improved as determined by PGA. For 90.3% of the 
subjects improvement or a greater response was demonstrated. A total of 23% of subjects discontinued the 
study in the majority of cases due to subjects ‘lost to follow-up’. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA). The results from the two 
pivotal  studies  demonstrate  a  treatment  effect  evaluated  as  successful  outcome  of  24.4%  -  43.9% 
versus  4.3%  -  12.9%  of  the  study  population  for  eflornithine  and  vehicle  respectively.  This  would 
mean  an  approximate  percentage  points  difference  of  20-31  for  subjects  evaluated  as  successful 
outcome  as  compared  with  the  vehicle.  It  was,  however,  not  obvious  from  the  submitted 
documentation how the physician’s initial pre-treatment evaluation at baseline was performed or how 
the investigator graded the extent of facial hirsutism in relation to further assessment of the PGA. In 
response to the List of Questions the applicant stated that the clinical criterion for entry to the studies 
was  a  diagnosis  of  facial  hirsutism  made  following  visual  inspection  of  subjects  by  trained 
investigators.  Other  criteria  for  eligibility  included  a  requirement  that  subjects  were  regularly 
removing hairs two or more times a week, video analysis quantifying hair count on the upper lip and 
chin/neck, and a significant level of bother on Subject Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SSAQ).  
15/23

EMEA 2004 
 
 
About 60% of patients reported baseline levels of bother/discomfort in excess of 90/100 (i.e., on the 
last tenth part of the visual analogue scale) on the SSAQ, in both pivotal studies, and on both arms of 
these studies. In both pivotal studies, distributions at baseline of the video analysis results were similar 
between  treatment  arms,  except  for  hair  length  in  Study  DE140-002,  which  had  a  statistically 
significant baseline treatment difference (p=0.011) with the  vehicle  mean (0.497  mm) slightly lower 
than  the  active  (0.535  mm).  Baseline  differences  were  corrected  for  in  the  analysis  presented.  The 
baseline  data  from  the  secondary  efficacy  criteria  (video  image  analysis  and  SSAQ),  therefore, 
indicate that patients entering the study had a significant severity of facial hirsutism.  
Only subjects in the first two categories of the PGA (clear/most clear or marked improvement) were 
considered  as  successes.  However,  in  response  to the  List  of  Questions  the  applicant  submitted  the 
results  based  on  the  definition  of  success  as  clear/almost  clear,  marked  improvement  and 
improvement. The results show that the magnitude of differences in response rates are similar for both 
analyses  as  the  response  rates,  for  both  pivotal  studies  pooled,  when  ‘improved’  is  considered  as 
success are 70% for eflornithine and 41% for vehicle and 35% for eflornithine versus 9% for vehicle, 
when improved is considered as failure.  
To  further  validate  the  PGA  the  relationship  between  the  several  endpoints  (PGA,  hair length,  hair 
mass, SSAQs) regardless of treatment and group was determined and provided in response to the List 
of  Questions.  A  consistency  in  the  response  and  the  incremental  response  over  time  including 
worsening  at  8  weeks  after  stopping  treatment  at  24  weeks  was  seen.  Moreover,  the  changes  in  the 
video analysis data (hair length and hair mass respectively) and SSAQ were parallel to improvement 
or lack of improvement of the PGA. Greater PGA responders clearly demonstrated stronger responses 
in objective measures of length and area  change with treatment. These length and area changes were 
consistent for both pivotal trials. Patients’ responses to the SSAQ also correlated with PGA score as 
groups with greater levels of PGA improvement also showed greater levels of SSAQ response.  
Analysis of prognostic factors, such as effects of age, race and prior hair removal technique upon the 
primary  response  measure,  demonstrated  an  effect  of  race  only.  The  response  rates  for  DE140-001 
were  30.6%  and  13.3%  for  Caucasian  and  Black  subjects,  respectively.  In  Study  DE140-002  the 
response  rates  between  Caucasians  and  Black  subjects  were  more  similar  with  46.2%  and  35.2%, 
respectively rated as successes. The difference in success rates is reflected in the SPC. The difference 
in  effect  size  (active  treatment  versus  placebo)  between  normal-weight  and  over-weight  women 
increases over time indicating a less pronounced effect in obese women. This is reflected in the SPC. 
In  the  proposed  SPC  it  states  that  27%  of  non-white  women  and  39%  of  white  women  showed  a 
marked  or  better  improvement  whereas  the  US labelling  refers  to  success  rates  of  22%  and  37%  in 
non-whites  and  whites,  respectively.  In  answer  to  the  List  of  Outstanding  Issues  the  applicant 
explained that the clinical datasets are identical but the calculation of the success rate is different. In 
the centralised application data include all subjects withdrawing during the treatment period with their 
last  PGA  observation  carried  forward.  The  figures  in  the  US  labelling  are,  however,  calculated 
assigning  the  subjects  without  a  PGA  measurement  at  week  24  as  treatment  failures.  A  statement 
indicating that the data provided include all subjects with their last PGA observation carried forward 
to the end of treatment) was therefore included in the SPC, to explain the difference in the figures in 
the US labelling and the SPC. 
Subjects who rated the level of bother as greater than or equal to 20 mm (analog scale 0-100 mm) were 
included in study. However, the magnitude of fall in ‘level of bother’ which could be considered clinically 
significant was not prospectively defined.  
It  can  be  anticipated  that  in  practice  physicians  will  differ  in  their  clinical  impression  of  degree  of 
improvement. However, it is the patient’s impression of the therapeutic benefit that is most relevant. 
The Self-assessment  questions  were  generally  directed  at the  psychological  and social  aspects  of  facial 
hirsutism. In determining the efficacy of eflornithine it could have been more valuable to know whether 
the subjects were satisfied with the magnitude of the  effect, effects on hair characteristics, and whether 
they would continue treatment. However, the quality of life assessments were not designed to evaluate 
behaviours  such  as  hair  removal  in  a  quantitative  sense,  but  rather  they  were  designed  to  elicit 
qualitative impressions associated with the ‘condition’. The bother scales of the SSAQ do not measure 
behaviours  associated  with  hirsutism,  but  rather  how  upset  are  the  patients  with  their  specific 
condition and how they interpret interference with aspects of daily life.

In response to the List of Questions the applicant submitted further analyses comparing SSAQ results 
to the primary endpoint, PGA, in order to further evaluate the relevance of the SSAQ findings. There 
is a very good concordance of SSAQ with the PGA over the study period including the four week no 
treatment  phase  at  the  end  of  the  study  during  which  both  PGA  and  SSAQ  deteriorate  in  parallel.  
Similar concordance was observed when each of the individual questions of the SSAQ was compared 
to the PGA response. 
Pooled data showed that at baselinefor both the eflornithine 15% (equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% 
anhydrous  hydrochloride  free)  cream and vehicle treated  women  had  a  mean  value  of 89  for  general 
bother , indicating a high  degree of distress over their condition. At the end of treatment (24 weeks) 
the  pooled  data  from  both  trials  showed  a  31  point  decrease  in  women  receiving  eflornithine  15% 
cream  compared  with  a  14  point  decrease  for  the  vehicle  treated  group  (p<0.01).  Similar  statistical 
differences in favour of eflornithine 15% (equivalent to 3.83, 7.67 and 11.5% anhydrous hydrochloride 
free) cream (p<0.01) were observed for the other five SSAQ questions. Thus, there was uniformity of 
results across the questions within the SSAQ in each study and across the two pivotal studies.   
A responder analyses with a cumulative distribution of difference from baseline (in 10 mm intervals) 
for  the  question  on  ‘bother  by  facial  hair’  of  the  SSAQ  by  treatment  arms  was  presented  by  the 
applicant  during  the  oral  explanation.  The  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  is  greatest  at  an 
improvement  of  more  than  20  points,  where  53.1%  of  Vaniqa  treated  subjects  showed  this 
improvement compared to 25.4% in the vehicle group. There is a consistent separation in the SSAQ 
score between Vaniqa and vehicle treated subjects. 
In  addition  when  patients  were  grouped  according  to  the  PGA  assigned  to  them  at  week  24  and 
analysed for SSAQ response those patients graded as most improved by the physician (PGA) indicated 
similar high levels of self-assessment response. This relationship holds true for all four PGA response 
groups with SSAQ mean data showing non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for all time points 
on treatment beyond week 8. The benefits of treatment receded and were no longer significant 8 weeks 
after treatment cessation. 
In conclusion, the above findings support a consistency of the SSAQ results. 
A number of problems were encountered with the video image analysis. For example, ‘data files for the 
video image analysis showed a many-fold excess of the expected number of hairs being identified by the 
software’  due  to  ‘numerous  artefacts  that  were  being  counted  as  hairs’.  As  a  result,  many  hair 
measurements calculated by this software could not be used and it was determined that each image would 
be reviewed visually to manually select hairs. In order to implement the manual selection of imaged hairs, 
a  new  software  package  was  developed.  However,  the  large  volume  of  data  stored  on  the  equipment 
resulted in malfunctioning of the software and the loss some images and data.  
In  response  to  the  List  of  Questions  the  applicant  stated  that,  when  used  as  an  entry  criterion,  video 
image  analysis  might  have  underestimated  the  hair  count  due  to  contrast  problems  (problems 
identifying grey hairs on light skin, light hairs on light skin, and dark hairs on darker black skin). It is 
argued that this may have resulted in the disqualification of subjects who may have been eligible.   
When used to measure the secondary efficacy parameter, the technique tended to overestimate the hair 
count  as  artefacts  were  counted  as  hairs,  however,  it  appears  that  this  would  not  have  occurred  at 
baseline as baseline images  were  reviewed  for the purpose  of  excluding  artefacts and  verifying  hair 
count. For the secondary efficacy parameter the artefacts were excluded in a blinded fashion. Because 
of these problems, complete image data for the baseline and final (Week 24 or early discharge) visits 
(the primary evaluation period), were obtained for about 70% of the subjects in the two studies. The 
video  analysis  data  from  this  relatively  smaller  “core  group  data  set”  (patients  with  image  data 
analyses)  for  the  secondary  efficacy  measures  of  hair  length  and  hair  spatial  mass  still  showed 
statistical superiority of active over vehicle in each of the two studies despite the reduced power. The 
PGA success rates for these “core groups” were also consistent with the success rates for all subjects 
randomised.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data are available on 315 healthy individuals and 1,749 subjects enrolled in 12 trials. A total of 
1375  subjects  were  exposed  to  eflornithine  15%  (equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5%  anhydrous 
hydrochloride free) cream identical to the one proposed for marketing. 
A  total  of  944  subjects  with  excessive  facial  hair  received  eflornithine  for  24  weeks  and  134  subjects 
received treatment for at least one year.  
Although recently marketed in USA (27 July 2000), there is as yet no significant post-marketing data.  
Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
In DE140-001 and DE140-002 more than 80% of subjects reported adverse events following exposure to 
either eflornithine or vehicle (regardless of relation to treatment).  In DE-140-001, a total of 33% of 
subjects reported adverse events which were considered related to treatment; in DE 140-002, 53% of 
subjects reported adverse events which were considered related to treatment. 
The number of patients in study DE-140-001 and DE140-002 with treatment related adverse events 
relating to the skin and appendages is given below.

With the exception of burning or stinging skin, the adverse event profile appeared similar for both groups. 
Vaniqa was compared to vehicle not placebo. The skin-related adverse events were generally mild in 
intensity. Subjects were specifically evaluated for acne and pseudofolliculitis barbae and these adverse 
events were the most frequently reported adverse events in both groups. Apparently an evaluation of the 
baseline photographs of subjects enrolled in the pivotal studies confirms the presence of these two 
conditions in the study population. Only subjects with severe inflammatory acne were excluded from 
the study. As alopecia is a known adverse event of eflornithine when administered intravenously, the 
subjects were specifically evaluated for alopecia. Most reports of alopecia were not considered related to 
treatment and for those considered related to treatment the incidences were similar.    
The proportion of subjects reporting skin-related adverse events in the two treatment groups was similar 
across race and for hair removal methods used prior to treatment; the numbers were too small to draw any 
conclusions for age. 
Subjects  were  specifically  asked  about  adverse  events,  which  have  been  associated  with  intravenous 
administration  of  eflornithine  hydrochloride  (e.g.  hair  loss,  facial  swelling,  seizures,  hearing 
impairment,  stomach  upset,  loss  of  appetite,  headaches,  weakness  and  dizziness).  The  number  of 
subjects  reporting  systemic  symptoms  related  to  treatment  was  very  low  and  did  not  differ  between 
groups.  In addition, haematological parameters (thrombocyte count, leukocyte count and liver enzymes) 
were  specifically  monitored.  There  were  few  haematological  abnormalities  reported  and  most  were 
considered unrelated to treatment.

In study DE140-001 and DE140-002 eleven eflornithine-treated subjects and six vehicle-treated subjects 
discontinued due to adverse events.  In study DE140-010 and DE140-011 only 1% and 2% respectively of 
subjects discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events. In DE140-001 and DE140-002 six patients 
treated with eflornithine and four patients treated with vehicle required dose reduction or interruption due 
to adverse events. 
In  DE140-010  and  DE140-011  42%  and  30%  respectively  had  adverse  events  considered  related  to 
treatment.  Most  of  these  subjects  (34%  in  DE140-010  and  24%  in  DE140-011)  had  treatment-related 
adverse  events  which  occurred  on  the  skin.    These  were  usually  considered  mild.  The  most  frequently 
reported adverse events in DE140-010 were dry skin (7.4%), acne (6.9%), alopecia (6.5%) and pruritus 
(5.1%) and in DE140-011 acne (6.6%) and alopecia (4.8%); folliculitis was reported by 1.5% of subjects.  
In  GMEH  3071,  the  dose-finding  study,  125  subjects  reported  473  adverse  events.  The adverse  events 
associated with the skin were reported most frequently. Acne was reported in 34 events and application 
site  reactions  in  34  events.  The  incidence  of  acne  did  not  appear  to  be  associated  with  increasing 
concentration  of  eflornithine,  whereas  stinging  appeared  to  be  dose-related.  The  majority  of  adverse 
events were determined to be mild in intensity.  
In GMEH-2664 only one adverse event was reported. The adverse event (vaginal bleeding) was 
considered to be unrelated to treatment. 
Serious events were reported in 82 of the 2064 subjects (4%). These are summarised below.

The majority of serious adverse events were hospitalisations for diseases across many body systems. 
They were all considered as unrelated to the treatment and included fracture of bone, chest pain, basal 
cell carcinoma, depression, abdominal pain, pneumonia, uterine fibroid enlargement and vomiting.  
There were three cases of basal cell carcinomas, none of which were considered related to study 
medication. All three subjects had received active treatment. Two had their carcinoma on areas of the 
skin that were not treated with the study medication. One 54-year old subject was diagnosed with a 
basal cell carcinoma on the right lower leg on Day 86. The subject reported that she had noticed the 
growth 5 months prior to enrolling in the study and she also had a history of a basal cell carcinoma on her 
nose. One 59-year old subject in DE140-002 was diagnosed on Day 120 with a basal cell carcinoma on 
her nose. There was a baseline history of carcinoma in this area. A 66-year old subject was diagnosed 
with a basal cell carcinoma on the left cheek on Study Day 182. The lesion was excised following 
completion of the study. 
There were no deaths in study DE140-002, DE140-002, DE140-010 or GMEH 3071. However, in study 
DE140-011 there was one death considered unrelated to treatment (road traffic accident). 
Eflornithine has been available as an intravenous medicinal product for several years in the EU. Adverse 
reactions  in  association  with  the  intravenous  administration  have been  identified  and  include  hair  loss, 
facial  swelling,  seizures,  hearing  impairment,  stomach  upset,  loss  of  appetite,  headaches,  weakness, 
dizziness  and  haematological  abnormalities,  such  as  thrombocytopenia,  leucopenia  and  altered  liver 
function. Apart from alopecia and possibly facial swelling, these reactions have not been identified in the 
clinical  studies  of  the  topical  administration  of  eflornithine  15%  (equivalent  to  3.83,  7.67  and  11.5% 
anhydrous hydrochloride free) cream.

Laboratory findings 
Analyses  for  blood  chemistry,  haematology  and  hormones  including  free  testosterone,  prolacatin, 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were 
done  within  the  pivotal  studies.  No  clinically  significant  trend  of  clinical  chemistry,  hormonal  and 
haematology parameters versus baseline was identified. 
Safety in special populations 
There were no safety studies performed in special populations. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Eflornithine appeared to be well-tolerated when used for up to 52 weeks. The adverse event profile of the 
longterm trials was consistent with that reported in the shorter pivotal trials, however, the proportion of 
subjects reporting acne and folliculitis was lower and alopecia higher. Subjects in the open-label, 
longterm studies had, on a percentage basis, 3-4 times as many reports of alopecia that were 
considered related to the treatment compared with pivotal trials. It can be accepted that a reasonable 
explanation for the increased amount of reported alopecia in the open-label studies could be the active 
questioning. However, the adverse reaction is in line with the pharmacological activity of the drug and 
the open-label studies contain the present available long-term data. Accordingly, the frequency of 
reported alopecia in the safety studies is addressed in the SPC.   
No photo-toxicity reactions have been reported within the clinical trials and this absence is supported 
by  the  pre-clinical  and  clinical  phase  I-II  studies.  Local  pigmentary  changes  such  as  Berloque 
dermatitis could indicate an interaction with light with potentiation of melanogenesis. There are only a 
few  reports  of  hyper-and  hypo-pigmentation  reported.  Four  cases  of  hyper-pigmentation  were 
reported,  2  cases  in  both  the  active  treatment  group  and  vehicle-treated  group  in  study  DE140-002. 
The hyperpigmentation adverse events were considered by the investigators as post inflammatory and 
secondary  to  acne  or  pseudofolliculitis  barbae  and  not  related  to  treatment.  Two  cases  of 
hypopigmentation  were  reported  one  in  study  DE140-001  and  one  in  DE140-011.  One  case  was 
considered possibly related to therapy, and  one  case  as  not related to the therapy. The two  cases  of 
hypopigmentation both resolved within the study period. 
Treatment-related adverse events involved the skin in the majority of cases, however, these adverse events 
were usually considered mild and did not result in discontinuation from the study. The high proportion of 
subjects reporting acne and pseudofolliculitis barbae following exposure to eflornithine or vehicle in the 
pivotal  studies  is,  however,  of  concern.  Both  conditions  may  cause  further  distress  to  women  with 
excessive  facial  hair  who  are prescribed  eflornithine. In response to the  List  of Questions the  applicant 
submitted  a  further  evaluation  of acne and pseudofolliculitis barbae  during the pivotal study periods, 
which  do  not  suggest  that  eflornithine  15%  has  severe  acnegenic  potential.  However,  it  should  be 
noted that 14% of subjects in each treatment group (active or vehicle) who did not have acne and 9% 
of  the  subjects,  who  did  not  have  pseudofolliculitis  barbae  at  baseline,  became  worse  during  the 
treatment. For the group of subjects, who worsened during the study period, the treatment group with 
active cream had a slightly higher tendency for a grade two change of worsening compared with the 
vehicle  treated  group.  However,  the  majority  of  subjects,  whether  in  the  active  or  vehicle-treated 
group, were unchanged in their acne grade compared with baseline.  
In response to the List of Questions the results from a rabbit ear comedogenicity study was submitted. 
The study showed  no  evidence  of comedogenicity  from Vaniqa  or vehicle  cream. While there  were 
significant and severe treatment related histological findings of comedogenicity with standard positive 
control (1% coal tar).  
Although eflornithine in different published pre-clinical study-models appears to possess some 
chemopreventive effect of carcinogenesis rather than the opposite, adverse events such as skin 
malignancies are of concern. It is reasonable to believe that most basal cell carcinomas would need a 
longer exposure period than the reported study duration to develop and be detected. In white races, 
basal cell carcinoma is the commonest malignant tumour of the skin. A population-based incidence 
study in Minnesota reports an annual incidence for females of 124 per 100 000 annum while a recent 
Australian survey gives an incidence of 605/10 5  for females. Given that the study population of the 
Minnesota report would reasonably reflect subjects of the pivotal studies and calculating on the basis 
20/23 

EMEA 2004 
 
 
of the 944 subjects that were treated for 24 weeks, the corresponding figures for the study population 
would be approximately 106 per 100 000. In conclusion these figures do not indicate an increased risk 
for the treated population of developing basal cell carcinoma and the pharmacological profile of 
eflornithine acting as an anti-proliferative substance supports this finding. However, it should be noted 
that these calculations are made on the basis of a treatment period of only 24 weeks + 8 weeks of 
follow-up. The true incidence/ treatment year is not known.  
On the other hand, the possibility of developing skin atrophy with long-term topical application of a 
substance interfering with cell proliferation on skin areas exposed to UV-light with an additional 
atrophy potential is a highly relevant issue and should be considered. Apparently no cases of skin 
atrophy were reported in any of the clinical trials. However, this could be an adverse event appearing 
after a long treatment period. A possibility of any type of rebound-phenomenon appearing after 
cessation of therapy after a long treatment period should also be considered. The applicant has argued 
that because of the inhibition of ODC being intermittent it is less likely to suppress the cells’ potential 
to proliferate. However, the aim of the submitted documentation is to demonstrate efficacy in terms of 
suppression of the hair growth with a twice daily application. Although the cell turnover of the hair 
root is more rapid than that for the epidermis, the possible effects of longstanding intermittent 
suppression of the keratinocytes cannot be ignored. An increased incidence of skin atrophy was not 
demonstrated in the animal studies. However, in one of the studies, a two-year study in mice, there 
were histological findings of acanthosis of the epidermis at the end of the study. The applicant has 
been requested to address the question of eflornithine potentiating the atrophy in sun exposed areas of 
the skin as a follow up measure. 
While  most adverse  events are  reported in slightly  higher percentages  of subjects in the  one-year study 
than in the six-month study, there is no individual adverse event whose frequency increases substantially. 
The reason for the higher percentage of subjects having treatment-related adverse events in the one year 
study can be attributed to the longer period of study duration.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
• 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that  eflornithine inhibits 
hair growth in relevant animal models. 
The absorption of eflornithine is low following single dermal applications. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that eflornithine was not genotoxic and no tumour 
inducing effect was observed in the carcinogenicity studies including one photocarcinogenicity study 
and two oral studies in rodents at high doses relative to humans. 
Eflornithine had no effect on male or female fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and 
rabbits at doses up to 180 and 36 times the human dose, respectively. Higher doses resulted in 
maternal and foetal toxicity without evidence of teratogenicity. 
This information has been included in the SPC. 
• 
Efficacy 
A  statistically  significant  difference  of  improvement  in  favour  of  eflornithine  11.5% cream  over 
vehicle was seen during the treatment period with from week 4 onwards. Following the cessation of 
therapy, the effect decreased and no statistical significance versus vehicle was seen after 8 weeks. 
The difference in success rates between non-whites and whites is reflected in the SPC. The difference 
in success rate between normal-weight and over-weight women is also reflected in the SPC.

There was a significant difference in both pivotal studies for all six questions on quality of life relating 
to  the  impact  of  facial  hair  as  assessed  by  the  subject  in  favour  of  the  eflornithine-treated  group 
compared with the vehicle group. 
The most relevant parameter was considered to have been the patient’s impression of the therapeutic 
benefit.  It  would  therefore  have  been  valuable  to  know  whether  the  subjects  were  satisfied  with  the 
magnitude  of  the  effect,  effects  on  hair  characteristics,  and  whether  they  would  continue  treatment. 
However,  a  concordance  between  the  patient’s  self  assessment  and  the  physician’s  assessment  was 
shown. 
• 
Safety 
The  most  common  treatment  related  adverse  events  were  acne  and  pseudofolliculitis  barbae  and 
burning, stinging, tingling of the skin. With the exception of burning, stinging or tingling  of the skin 
there  was  no  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  frequency  or  type  of  adverse 
event  in  the  two  24-week  studies.  In  the  two  longterm  studies  the  adverse  events  acne  and 
pseudofolliculitis barbae were reported less often than in the 24-week studies.  
Most of the AEs reported during the study were graded as mild to moderate in severity. Most serious 
events were related to hospitalisation and were all considered as unrelated to the treatment.  
There were three cases of basal cell carcinomas, none of which were considered related to study 
medication. There was one death reported, which was considered unrelated to treatment (road traffic 
accident). 
Evaluation  of  acne  incidence  and  severity  in  the  Vaniqa  trials  revealed  no  evidence  of  relation  to 
either  Vaniqa  or  the  vehicle  cream.  Background  (baseline)  incidences  of  approximately  41%  were 
observed in each of the pivotal trials and remained unchanged throughout  the trials. The animal and 
clinical data do not suggest that Vaniqa or its vehicle precipitate acne. 
An issue remains regarding the effect of eflornithine on normally replicating cells within the skin and 
the possibility of an increased risk of skin atrophy after long-term treatment of normal skin and 
enhanced skin atrophy on areas exposed to UV-light. It can be concluded from the clinical trials that 
no clinical signs of atrophy was reported and published studies indicate similar beneficial effects 
(minimise and reversal of actinic damage) for eflornithine as have been previously demonstrated for 
the retinoids. However, previous published studies of topical retinoids show that clinically visible 
changes of the skin are minimal after 3 months of treatment although transformations are evident 
histologically. The applicant has therefore been requested to address the question of eflornithine 
potentiating the atrophy in sun exposed areas of the skin as a follow up measure. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
During an oral explanation held during the CPMP on 15 November 2000, the applicant addressed the 
following issues:  
1. 
2. 
3. 
The concern that the opinion of the patient on the success of the treatment has not been 
adequately addressed  
A further responder analysis of the SSAQ results, illustrating the difference in responder rate for 
a range of responder definitions (cut-off points) and supporting the consistency of the SSAQ 
results 
The risk of enhanced skin atrophy of sun-exposed skin areas with longterm daily application 
and the potential for eflornithine to precipitate or potentiate acne in the context of the overall 
benefit/risk assessment.  
The overall benefit/risk assessment is considered to be positive considering that 
• 
A clinically relevant effect was seen in the target population (females with facial hirsutism) and 
that there was a good concordance between the physician’s assessment and the patient’s self 
assessment

The adverse reactions were mostly skin related, of mild intensity and resolved without 
discontinuation of Vaniqa. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was acne, however, 
animal and clinical data do not suggest that Vaniqa or its vehicle precipitate acne. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Vaniqa  in  the  treatment  of  excessive  facial  hair  in  women  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

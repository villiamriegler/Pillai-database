a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: 
aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal; BLV: baseline value.
b Upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. 
Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is 
worsening or no improvement. 
c After withholding, IMJUDO and/or durvalumab can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions 
improved to ≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per 
day. IMJUDO and durvalumab should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 adverse reactions, 
as applicable.
d For patients with alternative cause follow the recommendations for AST or ALT increases without concurrent 
bilirubin elevations.
6
e If AST and ALT are less than or equal to ULN at baseline in patients with liver involvement, withhold or 
permanently discontinue durvalumab based on recommendations for hepatitis with no liver involvement.
f If no improvement within 2 to 3 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive 
therapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 
month.
g Permanently discontinue IMJUDO and durvalumab if the adverse reaction does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 
30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency.
h Includes immune thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, cystitis noninfective, immune-mediated arthritis, and uveitis.
i With the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue treatment 
should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment.
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to 
confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies. 
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.2). Data on 
patients aged 75 years or older with metastatic NSCLC are limited (see section 4.4).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of IMJUDO is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population 
(see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of IMJUDO is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. IMJUDO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of IMJUDO in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not been 
established with regard to HCC and NSCLC. No data are available. Outside its authorised indications, 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab has been studied in children aged 1 to 17 years with 
neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma, however the results of the study did not allow to conclude 
that the benefits of such use outweigh the risks. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 
and 5.2.
Method of administration
IMJUDO is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution, over 1 hour 
(see section 6.6). 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab
When IMJUDO is given in combination with durvalumab, administer IMJUDO as a separate 
intravenous infusion prior to durvalumab on the same day. Refer to the SmPC for durvalumab 
administration information.
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy
When IMJUDO is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, 
IMJUDO is given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-based chemotherapy on the day of 
dosing.
7
When IMJUDO is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and pemetrexed maintenance 
therapy at week 16, IMJUDO is given first, followed by durvalumab and then pemetrexed 
maintenance therapy on the day of dosing.
IMJUDO, durvalumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous 
infusions. IMJUDO and durvalumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, 
refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the 
SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be 
used.
During cycle 1, IMJUDO is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 
hours) after the end of the IMJUDO infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should start 
approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the durvalumab infusion. If there are no 
clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician’s discretion, subsequent cycles of 
durvalumab can be given immediately after IMJUDO and the time period between the end of the 
durvalumab infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Immune-mediated pneumonitis
Immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic 
corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be 
confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded,
and managed as recommended in section 4.2.

alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, or 
with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Monitor alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels prior to initiation of treatment and 
prior to each subsequent infusion. Additional monitoring is to be considered based on clinical 
evaluation. Immune-mediated hepatitis should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated colitis
Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no 
clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Intestinal perforation and large 
intestine perforation were reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal 
perforation and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies
8
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis occurred in patients receiving 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy, and 
hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on 
clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be
managed as recommended in section 4.2.

Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination 
with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal 
insufficiency, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism
Immune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For 
symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended in section 
4.2.
Immune-mediated nephritis
Immune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear 
alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, or

corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Events of 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with 
PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or 
dermatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Immune-mediated myocarditis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab, or with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated myocarditis and managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated pancreatitis 
9
Immune-mediated pancreatitis, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of immune-mediated pancreatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, or with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy: myasthenia gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, 
Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, cystitis noninfective, immune-mediated arthritis
and uveitis (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Infusion-related reactions
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Severe 
infusion-related reactions have been reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab (see section 4.8). Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in 
section 4.2.
Disease-specific precaution
Metastatic NSCLC
Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) treated with tremelimumab in combination 
with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Careful consideration 
of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended.
Patients excluded from clinical studies
Advanced or unresectable HCC
Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: Child-Pugh Score B or C, main portal 
vein thrombosis, liver transplant, uncontrolled hypertension, history of, or current brain metastases, 
spinal cord compression, co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, active or prior documented 
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 months, ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention 
within 6 months, hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment, active or prior 
documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be 
used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an 
individual basis.
Metastatic NSCLC
Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: active or prior documented 
autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; 
administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of tremelimumab or 
durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (< 10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illness; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection 
or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of tremelimumab
or durvalumab. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be used with caution in these populations 
after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
10
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after
starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).
No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via 
reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically 
meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, 
pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with
tremelimumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of tremelimumab.
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, 
and placental transfer of human IgG2, tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of 
pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
IMJUDO is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
Breast-feeding
There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and 
effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is known to be 
excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during treatment with IMJUDO and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the potential effects of tremelimumab on fertility in humans or animals. However, 
mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see 
Section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these findings for fertility is unknown.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tremelimumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions
Tremelimumab is associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe 
reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of tremelimumab. 
The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are based on 2280 patients from nine
studies across multiple tumour types who received tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks or 1 mg/kg 
every 4 weeks in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This combined safety dataset excludes the POSEIDON Study (and patients 
treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy). 
Details for the significant adverse reactions for tremelimumab when given in combination with 
15
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were 
noted in comparison to tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. 
The data below also reflects information for significant adverse reactions for tremelimumab 300 mg in

There were no Grade 4 or 5 events.
Laboratory abnormalities
In patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy in the POSEIDON study (n=330), the proportion of patients who experienced a shift 
from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 6.2% for alanine 
aminotransferase increased, 5.2% for aspartate aminotransferase increased, 4.0% for blood creatinine 
increased, 9.4% for amylase increased and 13.6% for lipase increased. The proportion of patients who 
experienced a TSH shift from baseline that was ≤ ULN to > ULN was 24.8% and a TSH shift from 
baseline that was ≥ LLN to < LLN was 32.9%.
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 2075 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg or 
1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Two-hundred fifty-two 
patients (12.1%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 10.0% (208/2075) patients. The presence of ADAs did not impact 
tremelimumab pharmacokinetics, and there was no apparent effect on safety. 
In the HIMALAYA study, of the 182 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 300 mg as a single 
dose in combination with durvalumab and evaluable for the presence of ADAs against tremelimumab, 
20 (11.0%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 4.4% (8/182) patients. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent 
effect on pharmacokinetics or safety. 
In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in 
combination with durvalumab 1500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and 
evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Neutralising antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. The 
presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety.
Elderly
Data from HCC patients 75 years of age or older are limited. 
In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) 
and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or older are limited to a total of 74 
patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation of any study 
treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of age or older treated with 
19
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, 
respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older who received platinum-based 
chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no information on overdose with tremelimumab. In case of overdose, patients should be 
closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates. ATC code: 
L01FX20
Mechanism of action
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) is primarily expressed on the surface of T 
lymphocytes. Interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limits effector T-cell 
activation, through a number of potential mechanisms, but primarily by limiting co-stimulatory 
signalling through CD28. 
Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 antibody that blocks CTLA-4 interaction with CD80 
and CD86, thus enhancing T-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity 
and enhanced anti-tumour activity.
The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor results in 
improved anti-tumour responses in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
Clinical efficacy
HCC - HIMALAYA Study
The efficacy of IMJUDO 300 mg as a single dose in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in 
the HIMALAYA Study, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in patients with confirmed uHCC 
who did not receive prior systemic treatment for HCC. The study included patients with Barcelona 
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) and Child-Pugh 
Score Class A.
The study excluded patients with brain metastases or a history of brain metastases, co-infection of viral 
hepatitis B and hepatitis C; active or prior documented gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 
months; ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months; hepatic encephalopathy 
within 12 months before the start of treatment; active or prior documented autoimmune or 
inflammatory disorders.
20
Patients with esophageal varices were included except those with active or prior documented GI 
bleeding within 12 months prior to study entry. 
Randomisation was stratified by macrovascular invasion (MVI) (yes vs. no), aetiology of liver disease 
(confirmed hepatitis B virus vs. confirmed hepatitis C virus vs. others) and ECOG performance status 
(0 vs. 1). The HIMALAYA study randomised 1171 patients 1:1:1 to receive:
 Durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks

IMJUDO 300 mg as a single dose + durvalumab 1500 mg; followed by durvalumab 1500 mg
every 4 weeks
Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily

Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks 
thereafter. Survival assessments were conducted every month for the first 3 months following 
treatment discontinuation and then every 2 months. 
The primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS) for the comparison of IMJUDO 300 mg as a single 
dose in combination with durvalumab vs. sorafenib. Secondary endpoints included Progression-Free 
Survival (PFS), Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response 
(DoR) according to RECIST v1.1. 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. The 
baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (83.7%), age < 65 years 
(50.4%), White (44.6%), Asian (50.7%), Black or African American (1.7%), Other race (2.3%), 
ECOG PS 0 (62.6%); Child-Pugh Class score A (99.5%), macrovascular invasion (25.2%), 
extrahepatic spread (53.4%), baseline AFP < 400 ng/ml (63.7%), baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (34.5%), 
viral aetiology; hepatitis B (30.6%), hepatitis C (27.2%), uninfected (42.2%), evaluable PD-L1 data 
(86.3%), PD-L1 Tumour area positivity (TAP) ≥ 1% (38.9%), PD-L1 TAP < 1% (48.3%) [Ventana 
PD-L1 (SP263) assay].

NSCLC – POSEIDON study
POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab with or without IMJUDO in 
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a randomised, open-label, 
multicentre study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. 
Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were eligible for 
enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. 
Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana PD-L1 
(SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.
The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or 
untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic 
immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of IMJUDO or durvalumab, except physiological 
dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients 
receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMJUDO and/or 
durvalumab (see section 4.4).
Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC < 50%), 
disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), 
and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).
Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive: 
 Arm 1: IMJUDO 75 mg with durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 
weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. A fifth dose 
of IMJUDO 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside durvalumab dose 6.
22
 
 
 
 Arm 2: Durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, 
followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.
 Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 2 
additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at investigator’s 
discretion.
Patients received one of the following platinum-based chemotherapy regimens:
 Non-squamous NSCLC

Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be 
given.

Squamous NSCLC
 Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or 
carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.
 Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC
 Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 
every 3 weeks.
IMJUDO was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Durvalumab and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance therapy (when applicable) was 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then 
every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted 
every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.
The dual primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 2) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone 
(Arm 3). The key secondary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for IMJUDO + durvalumab + 
platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) and platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). The 
secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). PFS, 
ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to 
RECIST v1.1.
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. 
Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years 
(47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian 
(34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%), other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current 
smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%) and WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease 
characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of 
squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%), PD-L1 expression 
TC ≥ 50% (28.8%) and PD-L1 expression TC < 50% (71.1%).
The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with IMJUDO + durvalumab + 
platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). IMJUDO + 
durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. 
platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised below.

Elderly population
A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab 
and platinum-based chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only (n=40) arms of the 
POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was observed for IMJUDO
in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy 
within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis no definitive 
conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when considering this regimen for elderly patients.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab in children and adolescents aged 
less than 18 years has not been established. Study D419EC00001 was a multi centre, open-label dose 
finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy in paediatric 
patients with advanced malignant solid tumours (except primary central nervous system tumours) who 
had disease progression and for whom no standard of care treatment exists. The study enrolled 
50 paediatric patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years with primary tumour categories:
neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma. Patients received IMJUDO 1 mg/kg either in combination 
with durvalumab 20 mg/kg or durvalumab 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by 
durvalumab as monotherapy every 4 weeks. In the dose finding phase, IMJUDO and durvalumab 
combination therapy was preceded by a single cycle of durvalumab; 8 patients in this phase however 
discontinued treatment prior to receiving IMJUDO. Thus, of the 50 patients enrolled in the study, 42 
received IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and 8 received durvalumab only. In the dose-
expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis 
set. No new safety signals were observed relative to the known safety profiles of IMJUDO and
durvalumab in adults. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed for tremelimumab as monotherapy,in 
combination with durvalumab and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.
The PK of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 mg or 
10 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy, or at a single dose of 
300 mg. PK exposure increased dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady state was 
achieved at approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included patients 
(n = 1605) who received tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal products 
in the dose range of ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the estimated tremelimumab clearance 
(CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) were 0.309 l/day and 6.33 l, respectively. The terminal half-life 
was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein 
catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.
Special populations
Age (18–87 years), body weight (34-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no 
clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab.
Renal impairment
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab.
The effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is 
unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal 
antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to 
influence tremelimumab exposure.
26
Hepatic impairment
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any 
AST) and moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) had no clinically 
significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
> 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose 
adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared 
via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence tremelimumab 
exposure.
Paediatric population
The PK of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in a study of 50 paediatric 
patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years in study D419EC00001. Patients received tremelimumab 
1 mg/kg either in combination with durvalumab 20 mg/kg or in combination with durvalumab 
30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab as monotherapy every 4 weeks. Based 
on population PK analysis, tremelimumab systemic exposure in paediatric patients ≥ 35kg receiving 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks was similar to exposure in adults receiving 1 mg/kg every 
4 weeks, whereas in paediatric patients < 35kg, exposure was lower relative to adults.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Animal toxicology
In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated 
with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were 
dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and 
swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical 
signs included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, mononuclear cell infiltration 
in the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues.
A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of mononuclear cell infiltration with or 
without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, 
parathyroid, adrenal, heart, esophagus, tongue, periportal liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, 
pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was 
found in this study with animals treated with the lowest dose of 5 mg/kg/week, however the 
intermediate dose of 15 mg/kg week was considered the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD). 
This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin of 1.77-5.33 to clinical relevant exposure based 
on the clinical dosing regimen of either a 300 mg single dose or 75 mg every three weeks.
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab has not been evaluated.
Reproductive toxicology
Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since 
animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the relevance of these findings 
for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or 
effects on pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of 
selected foetal organs.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IMJUDO is and what it is used for
IMJUDO is an anti-cancer medicine. It contains the active substance tremelimumab, which is a type of 
medicine called a monoclonal antibody. This medicine is designed to recognise a specific target 
substance in the body. IMJUDO works by helping your immune system fight your cancer.
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is used to treat a type of liver cancer, called advanced or 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is used when your HCC: 
cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and

 may have spread within your liver or to other parts of the body. 
IMJUDO is used to treat a type of lung cancer called advanced non-small cell lung cancer in adults. It 
will be used in combination with other anti-cancer medicines (durvalumab and chemotherapy).
As IMJUDO will be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines, it is important that you 
also read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these 
medicines, ask your doctor.
2. What you need to know before you are given IMJUDO

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Preparation and administration of the infusion:
•
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to 
slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, 
discoloured or visible particles are observed.
Do not shake the vial.
Withdraw the required volume of concentrate from the vial(s) and transfer into an intravenous 
bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or glucose 50 mg/ml
(5%) solution for injection, to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 
0.1 to 10 mg/ml. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.
Use the medicinal product immediately once diluted. The diluted solution must not be frozen. If 
not used immediately, the total time from vial puncture to start of the administration should not 
exceed 24 hours at 2 ºC to 8 ºC or 12 hours at room temperature (up to 25 ºC). If refrigerated, 
intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Administer the 
infusion solution intravenously over 1 hour using a sterile, low-protein binding 0.2 or 
0.22 micron in-line filter.
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.
IMJUDO is a single dose. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION
ANNEX IV
48
Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tremelimumab, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
In view of available data from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab and “uveitis” and “arthritis” is at least a reasonable possibility. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tremelimumab should be 
amended accordingly.
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions 
and grounds for recommendation.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tremelimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tremelimumab is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Rationale for submitting an 
updated RMP (if applicable)
Summary of significant 
changes in this RMP:
Submission of a TTS mechanistic study report using clinical 
trial samples (from Ad26-based Company vaccine studies 
other than Ad26.COV2.S) and of the COV2001 CSR 
addendum, with a milestone date in the EU-RMP of 31 March 
2023 and 31 December 2023, respectively.
Consolidation of EU-RMP version 6.4 (approved within 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0072/G) and version 6.1 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0071/G).


Removal of a mechanistic study using clinical trial 
samples (ie, Test pre- and post-vaccination serum using 
clinical samples from Ad26-based Company vaccine 
studies other than Ad26.COV2.S) as additional 
pharmacovigilance activity as the study is completed.
Removal of trial COV2001 as additional 
pharmacovigilance activity as the CSR addendum is 
completed.
 Key safety findings related to TTS were moved from 
Module SVII.3.1 to Module SII. Key safety findings 
related to biodistribution and host cell protein, as shared 
in procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0047/G (CHMP 
opinion on 13 October 2022), were added to Module SII.

Removal of the TFUQ for the characterization of venous 
thromboembolism and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
syndrome and of the TFUQ to collect information on
vaccination failure/lack of effect, including events of 
VAED and VAERD in line with the PSUR submitted on 
27 October 2022 (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010916/202208).

Indication:
JCOVDEN is indicated for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 18 years of age and older.
Incidence and Prevalence:
SARS-CoV-2 was first identified following reports of a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases 
in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (Li 2020). It is a novel RNA virus from the 
family Coronaviridae, subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, and is most closely 
related (approximately 88% identical) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses previously sampled 
from bats in China (Martin 2008, Wu 2020, Lu 2020).
The  identification  of  SARS-CoV-2  follows  the  emergence  of  2  other  novel  beta-coronaviruses 
capable of causing severe human disease over the past 18 years: SARS-CoV identified in Southern 
China in November 2002 and MERS-CoV isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who died of 
severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure in June 2012 (Lu 2020, WHO 2004, Zumla 2016).
SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly and globally since its emergence. The WHO declared that the 
outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and 
declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (WHO 2020a, WHO 2020b).
As of 09 May 2022, over 516 million cases and over 6.3 million deaths from COVID-19 have been 
reported worldwide. Globally, over 4.0 million new cases and 16,734 deaths were reported during 
the week of 25 April through 01 May 2022 (WHO 2022a).
As of 01 May 2022, 138,908,085 cases and 1,087,139 deaths have been reported in the European 
Union/EEA (ECDC 2022a), and 22,328,784 cases and 189,251 deaths have been reported in the 
United Kingdom (Johns Hopkins 2022b). Ending 06 May 2022, the 14-day case notification rate 
for  the  European  Union/EEA,  based  on  pooled  data  collected  by  ECDC  from  official  national 
sources  from 29  countries,  was  867.7  per  100,000  population  (country  range:  30.2-2,064) 
(ECDC 2022b).

Over  the  course  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  pandemic,  there  has  been  a  continuous  evolution  of 
circulating  SARS-CoV-2  variants.  The  reason  why  these  strains  seem  to  spread  so  quickly  is 
poorly  understood  and  is currently  a  topic  of  intensive  research  (Lauring  2021,  Plante  2020, 
Tegally 2020, de Souza 2022). Vaccine effectiveness has been shown to be decreased with more 
recent  variants,  including  Omicron  (Ferdinands  2022,  Natarajan  2022,  Plumb  2022). As  of 
26 November 2021, the WHO declared Omicron a variant of concern, and by 22 December 2021, 
the Omicron variant was detected in 110 countries (WHO 2021). Since its identification, Omicron 
has  continued  to  evolve,  leading  to  variants  with  slightly  different  genetic  constellations  of 
mutations  (WHO  2022b). As  of  05  June  2022,  the  Omicron  variant  is  the  dominant  variant  of 
concern circulating globally according to the WHO (WHO 2022c).
Demographics of the Population within the Authorised Indication – Age, Sex, Racial and/or 
Ethnic Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease
Age
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages. However, people aged >60 years are at a higher risk of 
severe COVID-19 (ECDC 2023a). As of 13 May 2022, transmission continues to decline in most
EU countries, as shown by decreases in both overall case notification rates and case rates among 
people aged 65 years and older. While decreasing, transmission in people aged 65 years and older 
is still at one of the highest levels in the pandemic (ECDC 2022c). In the European Union/EEA, 
the risk of hospitalization and death increases sharply with age (ECDC 2021).
Sex
Although  there  is  no  clear  answer  to  the  question  of  how  much  sex  is  influencing  the  health 
outcome of people diagnosed with COVID-19, in most countries with available data, mortality 
rates are consistently higher in men than in women (Global Health 50/50 2022). The ECDC reports 
previously included TESS (The European Surveillance System) analysis by demographics, noting 
that males had a higher risk of severe outcomes than females, particularly in the older age groups 
(ECDC 2021).
Racial and/or Ethnic Origin
Data on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. 
There is increasing evidence that some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately 
affected  by  COVID-19  (Price-Haywood  2020,  Millett  2020,  CDC  2022b, CDC  2022c, 
ECDC 2020, Johns Hopkins 2022a). Inequities in the social determinants of health affecting these 
groups, such as occupation, education, income, healthcare access, and housing, are interrelated and 
influence  a  wide  range  of  health  and  quality-of-life  outcomes  and  risks  (ECDC  2020, 
Johns Hopkins 2022a).
Risk Factors for the Disease
Risk factors increasing the risk for COVID-19 infection are the type of employment (public facing) 
and  not  using  non-pharmaceutical  prevention  methods  (distancing  and  masking)  (Chu  2020, 
Hiironen 2022). Demographic factors increasing the risk for a severe disease course are older age,

male sex, and postmenopausal state. The most common pre-existing comorbidities and risk factors 
in  COVID-19  patients  are  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  cardiovascular  diseases,  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, obesity, 
weakened immune system, and smoking (Dessie 2021, Wolff 2021, Emami 2020, CDC 2022c, 
CDC 2022d).
Main Existing Treatment and Prevention Options:
Prophylaxis
As  of  10  January  2023,  besides  JCOVDEN,  6 vaccines have  received  (conditional) marketing 
authorisation from EMA  (EMA 2022a): the mRNA-based  BNT162b2 vaccine Comirnaty from 
Pfizer  and  BioNTech,  the  mRNA-1273  vaccine  Spikevax  from  Moderna  Inc,  the  ChAdOx1-S
(recombinant) vaccine Vaxzevria from AstraZeneca, the (recombinant) vaccine Nuvaxovid from 
Novavax,  the  (inactivated)  COVID-19  vaccine  Valneva  (VLA2001)  from  Valneva,  and  the 
(recombinant) vaccine VidPrevtyn Beta from Sanofi Pasteur.
Therapeutics
As of 24 June 2022, the following treatments received (conditional) approval by the EMA for the 
treatment  of  COVID-19:  remdesivir  (Veklury),  tixagevimab/cilgavimab  (Evusheld),  anakinra 
(Kineret),  PF-07321332/ritonavir 
tocilizumab 
(RoActemra), casirivimab/imdevimab (Ronapreve), and sotrovimab (Xevudy) (EMA 2022a). In 
addition, EMA endorses the use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients on oxygen or mechanical 
ventilation (EMA 2020c).
regdanvimab 
(Regkirona), 
(Paxlovid), 
Despite the ever growing number of available treatment options, an emphasis remains on disease 
prevention  for  global  control  of  SARS-CoV-2.  Since  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  occurs 
primarily  through  respiratory  secretions  (droplets)  and  to  a  lesser  extent  via  contact  with 
contaminated surfaces, covering coughs and sneezes as well as social distancing (maintaining a 
distance  of  1.5 m  or  6  feet  from  others)  can  reduce  the  risk  of  transmission.  Mouth  and  nose 
coverings,  if  properly  pursued,  may  further  reduce  the  spread  of  droplets  from  infectious 
individuals to others when social distancing is not possible. Furthermore, frequent handwashing 
and the use of hand sanitizer (>60% alcohol) are effective in reducing acquisition (CDC 2020).
Finally, frequent testing  for SARS-CoV-2,  contact tracing, and local quarantine measures have 
shown to be effective in reducing virus spread.
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Unvaccinated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from human to human by exposure to respiratory fluids carrying 
virus (CDC 2021). Contact tracing studies confirm that prolonged close contact is the main risk 
factor for transmission and that the risk of infection is much higher in household contacts compared 
to  nonhousehold  contacts  (Bi  2020,  Burke  2020,  WHO  2020c).  Transmission  may  also  occur 
indirectly through infected surfaces or fomites.

Approximately  40%  to  45%  of  infected  individuals  will  remain  asymptomatic  (Feehan  2021, 
Lavezzo  2020,  Oran  2020).  Respiratory  symptoms  of  COVID-19  typically  appear  5  to  6  days 
following exposure to the virus, but may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the 
clinical  manifestations  ranging  from  mild  symptoms  to  severe  illness  or  death  (CDC  2022a, 
Guan 2020, Linton 2020, US San Diego Health 2022, WHO 2020d). In a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of 148 studies, including 127 studies from China, which comprised 24,410 adults in 
9 countries with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, the most prevalent symptoms were fever (78%), 
cough  (57%),  and  fatigue  (31%).  Overall,  19%  of  hospitalized  patients  required  non-invasive 
ventilation, 17% required intensive care, 9% required invasive ventilation, and 2% required extra-
corporeal  membrane  oxygenation  (Grant  2020).  CDC  descriptions  of  COVID-19  clinical  case 
definitions and interviews with COVID-19-experienced clinicians sponsored by the MAH have 
included signs and symptoms of respiratory distress such as blue lips, extreme shortness of breath 
and dyspnea, persistent cough, deep vein thrombosis, discoloration of feet and toes, chills, shaking 
chills,  loss  of  sense  of  taste  and  smell,  signs  of  stroke,  disorientation,  inability  to  respond  or 
understand verbal communication, among others. Other less common gastrointestinal symptoms 
have been reported by CDC (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (CDC 2022a). Although SARS-CoV-2 
primarily affects the lungs, it has been found to damage the vascular endothelium of several other 
organs, resulting in complaints such as brain fog, palpitations, and fatigue. The extrapulmonary 
manifestations of COVID-19 vary, with the heart, brain, and kidneys being particularly susceptible 
to  damage  (EClinicalMedicine  2020).  This  vascular  component  of  COVID-19  might  help  to 
explain  the  observed  prolonged  illness,  also  seen  in  young  adults  without  underlying  chronic 
medical conditions (Tenforde 2020).
For  the  week  ending  13 May  2022,  pooled  data  from  18 EU/EEA  countries  showed  that the 
hospital occupancy rate was 15.1 COVID-19 patients per 100,000 population. The ICU admission 
rate  for  the  European  Union/EEA,  based  on  data  reported  by  10 countries,  was  0.5  per 
100,000 population (country range: 0.1–1.0). The 14-day COVID-19 death rate for the European 
Union/EEA, based on data collected by ECDC from official national sources for 30 countries, was 
16.2 (country range: 0.0-42.0) per million population (ECDC 2022c). 
Important Comorbidities:
Important comorbidities for severe COVID-19 are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular 
diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell
disease, obesity, and weakened immune system.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SII:  Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification
The nonclinical safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S was assessed in 2 pivotal GLP studies in NZW 
rabbits:  a  combined  repeat-dose  toxicity  and  local  tolerance  study and a  combined  EF-PPND 
toxicity study. Biodistribution studies (with 2 other Ad26-based vaccines) were conducted in NZW 
rabbits to assess the distribution, persistence, and clearance of the Ad26 vector. The nonclinical 
safety  testing  was  consistent  with  applicable  guidelines,  including  the  WHO  Guidelines on 
nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), the EMA Guideline on quality, non-clinical and 
clinical aspects of live recombinant viral vectored vaccines (EMA 2010), the ICH-S5 Guideline 
on detection of toxicity to reproduction for human pharmaceuticals (EMA 2020a), and the FDA 
Guidance  for  Industry  – Considerations  for  developmental  toxicity  studies  for  preventive  and 
therapeutic vaccines for infectious disease indications (FDA 2006).
In  line  with  the  applicable  guidelines,  safety  pharmacology,  genotoxicity,  and  carcinogenicity 
studies have not been conducted with Ad26.COV2.S.
The nonclinical biodistribution and safety studies were conducted using the IM route, which is the 
route  for  use  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  humans.  The  rabbit  was  considered  a  relevant  toxicological 
species since Ad26.COV2.S was shown to elicit an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 S 
protein  encoded  by  the  vaccine.  The  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine  dose  level and  dosing  volume 
(ie, 1x1011 vp,  as a 1-mL injection) applied in the 2 pivotal nonclinical  safety studies  is  2-fold 
above the human dose level (ie, 5x1010 vp, as a 0.5-mL injection), hence the full human dose was 
covered. In addition, the number of Ad26.COV2.S doses administered in these studies (ie, 3 doses 
administered with a 14-day interval period between injections) exceeds the single-dose vaccine 
regimen as proposed in humans.
In nonclinical vaccine efficacy studies, VAED and VAERD were monitored after SARS-CoV-2 
challenge of vaccinated NHP and Syrian hamsters. Clinical signs, viral load, and histopathology 
scores of respiratory tract tissues were determined in challenged animals to assess a theoretical 
risk of enhanced disease. Furthermore, immunogenicity was assessed in NHP, Syrian hamsters, 
mice,  and  rabbits  to  show  induction  of  neutralizing  antibodies  and/or  a  Th1-polarized  immune 
response; factors that are thought to minimize the occurrence of VAERD.
Additional  nonclinical  studies  were  performed  to  gain  insights  into  potential  mechanisms  of 
(vaccine-induced) TTS.  The studies  addressed several hypotheses for the pathogenesis of TTS. 
The results obtained from these studies may separately or in combination also have relevance for 
the  understanding  of  the  pathogenesis  of  vaccine-associated  thrombocytopenia,  including  ITP, 
and/or VTE.
Key findings from these nonclinical studies are presented in the table below.

Key Safety Findings
Toxicity
Single & repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance
A single-dose toxicity study with Ad26.COV2.S was not 
conducted.
Possible signs of acute toxicity were monitored following 
the first vaccination in the GLP combined repeat-dose 
toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S in 
rabbits. In this study, IM administration of Ad26.COV2.S 
at 1x1011 vp/dose on 3 occasions with a 14-day interval 
period between injections was well tolerated. The observed 
changes were related to a normal, anticipated, (local and 
systemic) immunologic response to vaccination and 
consisted clinically of (rare) transient local injection site 
dermal reactions, with transient minimal hyperthermia and 
minimal body weight loss or lower body weight gain after 
injection. This was associated with a transient (acute 
phase/immune) response in clinical pathology parameters, 
characterized by increases in plasma proteins (C-reactive 
protein, fibrinogen, and globulins) and white blood cell 
counts (monocytes and lymphocytes). Microscopic 
pathology findings of minimal to slight inflammation and 
hemorrhage were observed at the injection sites, along with 
increased lymphoid cellularity of germinal centers in 
popliteal and iliac lymph nodes and the spleen, which is 
consistent with an immune response to the vaccine 
administration. Overall, the findings were considered non-
adverse and were partially or completely reversible after a 
3-week treatment-free period. There were no signs 
suggestive of an increased risk for thromboembolic events 
or coagulopathies. All vaccinated animals developed an 
antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 
confirming responsiveness of the rabbits to the vaccine.
Reproductive toxicity
In the EF-PPND toxicity study in female rabbits, 
administration of Ad26.COV2.S at 1x1011 vp during the 
premating (ie, 7 days prior to mating) and gestation period 
(ie, Day 6 and Day 20 of gestation) did not reveal any 
vaccine-related adverse effects on reproductive 
performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, or 
parturition. In addition, the repeat-dose toxicity and local 
tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S did not reveal any 
effect on male sex organs that would impair male fertility.
Relevance to Human Usage
The combined repeat-dose toxicity and 
local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S 
did not indicate any adverse vaccine-
related effects. All vaccine-related 
effects noted were considered to reflect a 
normal, immunologic response to the 
vaccine. There were no findings 
observed that would raise a specific 
safety concern for the use of 
Ad26.COV2.S in humans.
The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine dose level 
and dosing volume applied in the 
combined repeat-dose toxicity and local 
tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S (ie, 
1x1011 vp, as a 1-mL injection) is 2-fold 
above the human dose level (5x1010 vp, 
as a 0.5-mL injection), hence the full 
human dose was covered. In addition, 
the number of Ad26.COV2.S doses 
administered (ie, 3 doses administered 
with a 14-day interval period between 
injections) exceeds the single-dose 
vaccine regimen as proposed in humans.
The available toxicity studies with 
Ad26.COV2.S do not indicate any 
harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity or fertility.
The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine dose level
and dosing volume applied in the 
EF-PPND toxicity study (ie, 1x1011 vp, 
as a 1-mL injection) is 2-fold above the 
human dose level (ie, 5x1010 vp, as a 
0.5-mL injection), hence the full human 
dose was covered.

Relevance to Human Usage
The EF-PPND toxicity study with 
Ad26.COV2.S does not indicate any 
harmful effects with respect to 
embryofetal or postnatal development. 
The data indicate that maternal 
antibodies were transferred to the 
fetuses. This profile is expected to be 
similar in humans. The clinical 
significance of maternal antibody 
transfer to the fetus is unknown.
Ad26.COV2.S is not expected to be 
genotoxic in humans. 
Key Safety Findings
Developmental toxicity
In the EF-PPND toxicity study in female rabbits, there was 
no adverse effect of vaccination on fetal body weights, 
external, visceral, and skeletal evaluations, or on postnatal 
development of the offspring. The parental females as well 
as their fetuses and offspring exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S 
protein-specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal 
antibodies were transferred to the fetuses during gestation.
Genotoxicity
In accordance with the WHO Guidelines on nonclinical 
evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), no genotoxicity 
studies were performed for Ad26.COV2.S. Adenoviral 
vectors are classified as nonintegrating because they lack 
the machinery to integrate their genome into the host 
chromosomes (EMA 2006, FDA 2020). As such, although 
adenoviral vector DNA is transferred to the nucleus of 
transduced cells, these vectors do not have the propensity 
to modify the host genome, hence reducing the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis (Feuerbach 1996, Lee 2017).
Carcinogenicity
In accordance with the WHO Guidelines on nonclinical 
evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), no carcinogenicity 
testing was performed for Ad26.COV2.S.
Ad26.COV2.S is not expected to be 
carcinogenic in humans.
Juvenile toxicity
Studies in juvenile animals were not performed.
Safety pharmacology
Safety pharmacology studies have not been conducted.
There were no findings in the available 
(conventional) toxicity studies that 
would indicate a specific concern for the 
use of the vaccine in infants/children.
Data from the repeat-dose toxicity study 
(which included detailed clinical 
observations) do not suggest that 
Ad26.COV2.S affects physiological 
functions (eg, central nervous system, 
respiratory, and cardiovascular 
functions) other than those of the 
immune system.

Other toxicity-related information or data
Biodistribution
Nonclinical biodistribution studies in NZW rabbits showed 
a limited distribution profile of the Ad26 vector following 
IM injection. In addition, clearance of the vector was 
observed within 90 to 180 days, reflected by a downward 
trend in the number of positive tissues and vector copies 
over time, to levels close to or below the detection limit.
In addition, immunohistochemical evaluation showed the 
presence of S protein, with a similar distribution of S1 and 
S2 subunits, in the administration site and draining lymph 
node 1 day after IM injection of Ad26.COV2.S in NZW 
rabbits. Eleven days after injection, the S protein was no 
longer detectable in any of the examined tissues.
Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease
Immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced neutralizing 
antibody responses in all species tested (mice, rabbits, 
Syrian hamsters, and NHP) and elicited a Th1-polarized
immune response in mice and NHP. Induction of 
neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-polarized immune 
response were confirmed in clinical study samples (Sadoff 
2021, Stephenson 2021).
In Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2 challenged 
NHP, no clinical or histopathological evidence of VAERD 
or VAED was observed at any vaccine dose level or for 
any vaccine regimen given, including animals with 
suboptimal immune responses that failed to protect against 
breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
In Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2 challenged 
Syrian hamsters, no increased lung histopathology, viral 
load, or body weight loss was observed compared with the 
control group after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, including 
vaccinated animals showing breakthrough infection in the 
lung, indicating the absence of any signs of VAERD or 
VAED. 
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
Presence of high levels of anti-PF4 antibodies appears to be 
a central mechanistic aspect of TTS pathogenesis.
A possible interaction between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S that 
has been hypothesized to lead to induction of anti-PF4 
antibodies has been assessed using 3 different biophysical 
techniques: dynamic light scattering (DLS), biolayer 
interferometry (BLI), and surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR). In DLS and BLI experiments, no direct interactions 
between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S were observed. SPR data 
demonstrated that the induced binding of PF4 to 
Ad26.COV2.S as published by Baker et al. (Baker 2021) is 
Ad26.COV2.S is neither expected to 
distribute widely, nor to replicate and/or 
persist in the tissues following IM 
injection.
The available nonclinical data do not 
indicate any risk related to possible 
VAERD in humans.
The available (mechanistic) nonclinical 
data generated with Ad26.COV2.S do 
not allow to conclude on the potential 
mechanism of TTS.

likely an experimental artefact. These findings are in line 
with findings of Michalik et al. (Michalik 2022) using 
DLS, showing no complex formation of PF4 with 
Ad26.COV2.S. Therefore, it is unlikely that binding of 
Ad26-vector particles to PF4 is driving the etiology of 
TTS.
Characterization of the host cell protein (HCP) content and 
an overall safety assessment of the residual HCP identified 
in Ad26.COV2.S when produced from PER.C6 TetR cells, 
has shown that Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contains only trace 
levels of HCP and host cell DNA. HCP levels were 
significantly below levels of residual HCP reported for 
other commercial vaccines that are also produced on 
human cells. In the assessment of product quality 
attributes, no discrepancy regarding release and 
characterization data was found in Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
batches associated with reported TTS case(s) compared 
with batches currently on the market with which no cases 
of TTS were reported. These data suggest that HCP, host 
cell DNA, any potential impurities and/or excipients of 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are not likely a contributing factor 
in the pathogenesis of TTS.
An analysis of sequence homologies of the Ad26 Capsid 
proteins, TetR protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 
vaccine antigen with the human proteome and 4 selected 
human proteins potentially associated with TTS was 
performed and revealed only limited linear homologies. 
Linear epitope homology is unlikely to be the root cause to 
TTS.
RNA sequencing of Ad26.COV2.S transduced cells in vitro 
to assess alternative splicing events leading to C-terminally 
truncated, soluble S protein variants was performed. No or 
very low frequency of aberrant splicing events were found 
that would affect the spike transgene encoded by 
Ad26.COV2.S, making it unlikely to contribute to TTS.
Expression of S protein was assessed in the IM 
administration site, draining lymph nodes, and spleen by 
immunohistochemistry and in the blood by S-PLEX assay, 
on Days 1 and 11 following IM dosing in rabbits. 
A transient expression of the S protein was observed in the 
IM administration site, draining lymph nodes (iliac and/or 
popliteal), and blood on Day 1, with all tissues examined 
being negative for S protein expression on Day 11 post 
dosing. No adverse vaccine-related effects were noted. 
Overall, Ad26.COV2.S-induced S protein expression, 
including its bioavailability in blood, was not associated 
with a safety concern in this study, but does not allow S 
protein to be ruled out as a potential contributing factor in a 
multifactorial scenario of TTS induction following 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in humans.

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S did not induce hPF4 
binding antibodies in NHP and rabbits. In mice, hPF4 
binding antibody responses were induced, however, 
responses were also seen with non-adeno-based vaccines 
not including or encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen 
(eg, marketed influenza vaccine), hence indicative of an 
unspecific immune activation.
In rabbits, IV administration of Ad26.COV2.S did not 
induce any additional changes in safety parameters, nor 
changes which were more pronounced to what was 
observed after IM administration of the same vaccine dose 
level (based on an evaluation of eg, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation and hematology endpoints including platelet 
counts, as well as S protein and Ad26 vector DNA 
distribution in the blood). Overall, a single dose IV 
administration of Ad26.COV2.S was well tolerated and did 
not induce any relevant changes in platelets, prothrombin 
time, or APTT clotting times, or gross or histopathological 
changes related to thrombosis, thromboembolic disease, or 
their sequelae. Although based on a limited number of 
animals, these data indicate that an accidental IV injection 
of Ad26.COV2.S may not represent an increased risk of 
TTS.

Brief Overview of Development
The  current  clinical  development  plan  of  Ad26.COV2.S  aims  to  develop  a  vaccine  for  the 
prevention  of  COVID-19  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2  in  adults.  In  the  course  of  the  clinical 
development, different dose levels (1x1010 vp, 1.25x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 3.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, 
7x1010 vp,  9x1010 vp,  and  1x1011 vp),  vaccination  schedules (single  dose with  or  without  a 
second/booster  dose2),  and  intervals  between  doses  (2 to  ≥6 months) are  being  assessed. The 
current clinical development plan includes 11 Company-sponsored interventional trials, including 
5 trials that provide information on the efficacy and/or safety of booster doses for Ad26.COV2.S
(ie, 5x1010 vp) (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV2008, and COV3009). At the time of this 
EU-RMP, all studies (except COV1002, COV1003, and COV2001) are ongoing.
The  first-in-human  Phase  1/2a  trial  COV1001  performs  an  initial  evaluation  of  the  safety  and 
immunogenicity  of  Ad26.COV2.S.  This  trial  assesses  the  preselected  5x1010 vp  and  1x1011 vp 
dose levels, both administered as a 1-dose and a 2-dose regimen in adults aged 18 to 55 years and 
≥65 years.
A Phase 1 trial COV1002 was conducted in Japan, in parallel with trial COV1001, to evaluate the 
safety  and  immunogenicity  of  Ad26.COV2.S  administered  as  a  2-dose  regimen  (5x1010 vp, 
1x1011 vp) in Japanese adults aged 20 to 55 years and ≥65 years.
A  Phase  1  trial  COV1003  was conducted  to  compare  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of 
Ad26.COV2.S at a single dose of 5x1010 vp in 2 different volumes (0.3 mL or 0.5 mL) in healthy 
adults aged 18 to ≤65 years.
A Phase 2a trial COV2001 in adults aged 18 to 55 years and ≥65 years evaluated the safety and 
immunogenicity  of  2-dose  (5x1010 vp,  2.5x1010 vp,  1.25x1010 vp)  and  1-dose  (5x1010 vp, 
1x1011 vp) vaccination regimens, and safety and immunogenicity of 56- and 84-day vaccination 
intervals  for  the  2-dose  regimen  (5x1010 vp). The  trial  also  evaluated the safety  and 
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in healthy adolescents aged 16 and 17 years, at a single dose of 
2.5x1010 vp.
A Phase 2 trial COV2004 evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in healthy 
pregnant participants aged 18 to 45 years, after a single dose of 5x1010 vp or 2 doses at 2.5x1010 vp.
A  Phase  2  trial  COV2008  in  adults  aged  18  years  and  older  who  have  previously  received 
vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S  or  BNT162b2  evaluates  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of 
2 In this document, the terms “booster” and “second dose” are used interchangeably for participants who received a 
second dose of Ad26.COV2.S. As all participants had shown a response (both in ELISA and functional antibodies) 
after the first dose, and all showed a rapid rise of antibodies within a week after administration of the second dose, 
the second dose is effectively a booster.

Ad26.COV2.S administered as booster vaccination (5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 1x1010 vp), ≥6 months 
after the primary vaccination.
A Phase 3 trial COV3003 in adults aged 18 to 55 years evaluates 6 dose levels (range: 1.25x1010 vp 
- 9x1010 vp) of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 2-dose schedule.
The Phase 3 trials COV3001 (ENSEMBLE) and COV3009 (ENSEMBLE-2) evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 18 to 59 years and ≥60 years, after 
administration of a single dose of study vaccine (COV3001) or 2 doses of study vaccine with an 
interval of  56 days  (COV3009).  Interim results  from trial COV1001 led to the selection of  the 
5x1010 vp dose level for evaluation in these Phase 3 trials.
A  Phase  3  trial  COV3005  evaluates  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  Ad26.COV2.S  co-
administered with an influenza vaccine in adults aged 18 years and older.
All  above  clinical  trials  are  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  and  conducted  in  a  double-blind 
fashion; except for COV1003 which was a randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group trial without 
placebo control, COV2004 which is an open-label study, and COV2008, COV3003, and COV3005
which  are not  placebo-controlled. During  the  course  of  the  clinical  development  program,  the 
placebo-controlled  trials  COV1001,  COV1002,  COV2001,  COV3001,  and  COV3009  were 
unblinded  and  participants  in  the  Placebo  group  were  offered  a  single  dose  of  Ad26.COV2.S
(except for trial COV1002). The trials were continued in an open-label manner. In addition, the 
trial  COV3001  protocol  has  been  amended  to  offer  all  participants  a  booster  vaccination  with 
Ad26.COV2.S. Long-term safety follow-up post-booster will continue for 1 year in COV3001 and 
at  least  6  months  in  COV3009. If  a  booster  dose  was  required,  other  trial  protocols  were  also 
amended to allow administration of a booster, either with Ad26.COV2.S or with another COVID-
19 vaccine according to local recommendations.
A  Phase  3b  study  COV3012  (Sisonke-1 [Together])  is  a non-Company  sponsored open-label, 
single-arm vaccine implementation study that monitors vaccine effectiveness and safety of a single 
dose of Ad26.COV2.S among healthcare workers aged ≥18 years in South Africa. This study is 
sponsored by the South African Medical Research Council and is currently ongoing. The Sisonke 
study  was  expanded  to  include  an  Ad26.COV2.S  booster  dose  6  to  9  months  after  the  initial 
vaccination in healthcare workers (ie, study COV3021 [Sisonke-2/Sisonke Boost]).
A  Phase  2 trial  COV3006  evaluates  the  safety and  immunogenicity  of  different  dose  levels  of 
Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 1- or 2-dose regimen in healthy adolescents from 12 to 17 years 
inclusive.

Clinical Trial Exposure
Company-sponsored Clinical Trials
The  clinical  trial  exposure  and  safety  data  shown  in  this  EU-RMP  are based  upon  the  pooled 
analyses of several Company-sponsored clinical trials.
Three sets of pooled data are presented in this EU-RMP, ie, the primary pooling, the cross-dose 
level pooling, and the extended cross-dose level pooling.
1) Primary Pooling
The primary pooling served as the primary source for determining the safety and reactogenicity 
profile of Ad26.COV2.S in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner.
Data from the following 5 trials were used for characterization of exposure and safety up to the 
cut-off dates for interim or primary analyses of the individual trials (02 August 2021 at the latest):




1 Phase 1/2a trial: COV1001 (unblinded data)
1 Phase 1 trial: COV1002 (unblinded data)
1 Phase 2a trial: COV2001 (adult cohort, unblinded data)
2 Phase 3 trials: COV3001 (unblinded data) and COV3009 (unblinded data)
The primary pooling includes exposure and safety data of  Ad26.COV2.S at the approved dose 
level (5x1010 vp), in adults aged ≥18 years. This pooling includes data from the double-blind phase
of the above-mentioned double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and includes primary 
vaccination and homologous boosting with Ad26.COV2.S. Data from participants who received
another COVID-19 vaccine outside the study were excluded from the analysis from the date of the 
other vaccination onwards.
The dataset used for the primary pooling safety analyses is the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which 
includes  all  participants  with  at  least  1  documented  vaccine  (placebo  or  Ad26.COV2.S) 
administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations.
2) Cross-dose Level Pooling
Data of the cross-dose level pooling complements the findings of the primary pooling, providing 
extended data beyond the primary pooling cut-off dates, and supports risk characterization for risk 
management  planning  based  on  the  current  safety  knowledge. The  cross-dose  level  pooling 
includes clinical trial data that is not placebo-controlled and also groups for which the sequence of 
vaccination is not taken into account (mixed schedules).

The cross-dose level pooling includes exposure and safety data of Ad26.COV2.S at any dose level 
(ranging from 1x1010 vp to 1x1011 vp), in adults aged ≥18 years. This pooling includes primary 
vaccination,  as  well  as homologous  booster  and mixed  schedules  (encompassing a  number  of 
booster  regimens  of  different COVID-19  vaccines,  eg,  Ad26.COV2.S  followed  by  an  mRNA
vaccine). Data from participants who received another COVID-19 vaccine outside the study were
included in the analysis of this pooling. Exposure data is presented by each Ad26.COV2.S dose 
level individually as well as for all dose levels combined.
The dataset used for the cross-dose level pooling safety analyses is the FAS, which includes all 
participants with at least 1 documented vaccine (placebo, Ad26.COV2.S either alone or as part of 
a mixed schedule with another COVID-19 vaccine) administration, regardless of the occurrence 
of protocol deviations.
3) Extended Cross-dose Level Pooling
Additional pooled clinical trial data are included for the important identified risk ‘myocarditis and 
pericarditis’. This extended cross-dose level pooling includes exposure and safety data from the
10 trials included in the cross-dose level pooling and from trial COV3006 (adolescents), up to the 
cut-off date of 24 February 2023.
Non-company Sponsored Studies
Data from the following 2 non-Company sponsored studies were also used for characterization of 
exposure and safety up to the cut-off date of 24 February 2022:

2 Phase 3b studies: COV3012 (open-label) and COV3021 (open-label)
These  studies provide exposure and  safety  data of  Ad26.COV2.S  at  the  approved  dose level 
(5x1010 vp; primary vaccination and booster vaccination).
Exposure in the Primary Pooling
At the cut-off date of 02 August 2021, a total of 76,347 participants were included in the primary
pooling, of which 38,538 participants received at least 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5x1010 vp 
dose level and 9,199 participants received 2 doses. Overall, 47,737 doses of Ad26.COV2.S at the 
5x1010 vp dose level were administered in the double-blind phase.

Exposure in the Cross-dose Level Pooling
At the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, a total of 80,462 participants had been included in the 
cross-dose  level pooling,  of  which  a  total  of  65,490 participants  received at  least  1  dose  of 
Ad26.COV2.S at any dose level; 63,400 participants received at least 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 
the 5x1010 vp dose level (unblinded or randomized to active vaccine). In total, 686 participants 
from  trial  COV3005  were still  blinded. Overall,  107,088 doses  of  Ad26.COV2.S  had  been 
administered at any dose level (unblinded or randomized to active vaccine).
Exposure to Ad26.COV2.S and matching placebo in the cross-dose level pooling is available for 
all participants by dose, by age group, by sex, by race, by ethnicity, and by special populations (ie, 
participants with HIV infection, breastfeeding women at baseline, pregnant women at baseline,

Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
Table SIV.1: Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 1
Reason for being an exclusion 
criterion
Known or suspected allergy or history of anaphylaxis or 
other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or their excipients 
(including specifically the excipients of the study vaccine)
These individuals were excluded from clinical trials to avoid 
potentially severe and life-threatening allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions. In addition, anaphylaxis is always considered a risk 
with foreign proteins administered by vaccination.
Considered to be included as missing 
information:
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Standard medical practice for any vaccine includes 
contraindication of administration of the vaccines in case of 
known allergy to their components and for the vaccinator to be 
ready to immediately treat any possible severe allergic reaction 
such as anaphylaxis.
The SmPC Section 4.3 states that JCOVDEN is contraindicated
in individuals with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to 
any of the excipients. Section 4.4 states that events of 
anaphylaxis have been reported and appropriate medical 
treatment and supervision should always be readily available in 
case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of 
the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is 
recommended following vaccination.

Criterion 2
Immunocompromised participants
Reason for being an exclusion 
criterion
These individuals were excluded from clinical trials to obtain 
unconfounded immunogenicity results. However, participants
were not excluded from Stages 1b and 2b of trial COV3001 and 
from Stage 2 of trial COV3009 if they had a stable and well-
controlled medical condition including comorbidities associated 
with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 
(eg, stable/well-controlled HIV infection3), or if they were 
receiving chronic low-dose (less than 20 mg of prednisone or 
equivalent) immunosuppressive therapy. Participants with 
clinical conditions stable under non-immunomodulator treatment 
(eg, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune inflammatory 
rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis) could also be 
enrolled in trials COV3001 (Stages 1b and 2b) and COV3009
(Stage 2) at the discretion of the investigator.
However, of all immunocompromised subgroups, only those 
participants with HIV infection were included at sufficient 
numbers to be able to provide meaningful data.
Considered to be included as missing 
information:
Yes
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Not applicable
Criterion 3
Receipt of licensed live attenuated vaccines within 28 days 
before or after planned administration of the first or 
subsequent study vaccinations, or receipt of any other 
licensed (not live) vaccine from 14 days before to 14 days 
after any study vaccine
Reason for being an exclusion 
criterion
Concomitant vaccination could influence the individual’s 
immune response to the vaccine and could confound the safety 
evaluation.
Considered to be included as missing 
information:
Yes

Criterion 6
Chronic active HBV or HCV infection per medical history
Reason for being an exclusion 
criterion
These individuals were excluded from clinical trials to obtain 
unconfounded immunogenicity results. However, they were not 
excluded from Stages 1b and 2b of trial COV3001 and Stage 2 of 
trial COV3009.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: 
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Ad26.COV2.S is a nonreplicating vaccine, therefore, there is no 
risk of infection leading to potential adverse clinical outcomes 
and the safety profile is not expected to be significantly different 
than in the general population.
Recent studies suggest that patients with chronic HBV or HCV 
infection have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality from 
COVID-19 (Mirzaie 2021). Based on this assessment, it is 
considered that the potential benefit greatly outweighs the risk of 
vaccinating individuals with chronic HBV or HCV infection.

different ethnic origin
Up to the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, 23 women who were 
pregnant at baseline received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
(cross-dose level pooling; all dose levels).
Any case of study vaccine exposure during pregnancy was 
included in the Company’s Global Safety Database when reported 
during the course of the trials. As of the cut-off date of 24 February 
2022, 154 unique pregnancies following Ad26.COV2.S 
administration were retrieved from Company-sponsored clinical 
trials post-baseline. Of note, 1 participant reported 2 pregnancies 
during the trial.
Up to the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, 718 women who were 
breastfeeding at baseline have received at least one dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S (cross-dose level pooling; all dose levels).
Individuals aged <18 years were excluded from Phase 1 trials and 
only limited data are available from Phase 2 trials. Up to the cut-
off date of 24 February 2022, 33 adolescents (16-17 years) have 
been vaccinated in trial COV2001. In addition, 109 adolescents
(12-17 years) have been vaccinated in trial COV3006 in the 
pediatric development program. The use in pediatrics is not in 
scope of the indication.
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 
21,323 (32.6%) participants were aged ≥60 years, 
11,801 (18.0%) participants were aged ≥65 years, and 
2,003 (3.1%) participants were aged ≥75 years.
Not applicable
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 
42,559 (65.0%) participants were white, 10,423 (15.9%) were
black or African American, 4,204 (6.4%) were American Indian or 
Alaska Native (who were mainly enrolled in Latin America), 
3,845 (5.9%) were Asian, 2,424 (3.7%) were of multiple race, and 
149 (0.2%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.

Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 
1,440 (2.2%) participants had a stable/well-controlled HIV 
infection. Participants with other immunodeficiencies were 
included at low numbers. 
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 
25,737 (39.3%) participants had 1 or more comorbidities 
associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19.
Participants with clinical conditions stable under non-
immunomodulator treatment (eg, autoimmune thyroiditis, 
autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid 
arthritis) were eligible for enrollment in Phase 3 trials COV3001 
(Stages 1b and 2b) and COV3009 (Stage 2) at the discretion of the 
investigator. Of the 21,898 participants in the FAS of trial 
COV3001 who received Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose level), 
552 participants had a medical history of at least 1 immune-
mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline. Of the 
15,708 participants in the FAS of trial COV3009 who received at 
least 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose level), 
458 participants had a medical history of at least 1 immune-
mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline.
Following a protocol amendment for trial COV3001 on 
14 December 2020, calculation of a frailty index has been included 
to be applied to participants enrolled. Of the 19,577 participants in 
the Per Protocol set who received Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose
level), 6 (<0.1%) were defined as frail and 2,147 (11.0%) were 
defined as pre-frail (COV3001 CSR Dec 2021).
Individuals who are SARS-
CoV-2 seropositive at 
baseline
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels),
6,891 (10.5%) participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline
(based on serology).
Rationale for not considering special populations as safety concerns
Use in pediatrics
Children and adolescents aged <18 years were excluded from Phase 1 trials and only limited data 
are  available  from  Phase  2 trials.  Up  to  the cut-off  date of  24 February  2022,  33 adolescents
(16-17 years) have been vaccinated in trial COV2001. In addition, 109 adolescents (12-17 years)
have  been  vaccinated  in  trial  COV3006  in  the  pediatric  development  program.  The  safety  and 
efficacy  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  children  and  adolescents  (<18 years  of  age)  have  not  yet  been 
established. The  available  data from  the  completed  trial  COV2001  suggest  that Ad26.COV2.S 
administered at 2.5×1010 vp dose level in adolescents aged 16 to 17 years had an acceptable safety

and  reactogenicity  profile.  The  trial  COV3006  protocol  has  been  amended  to  reduce  the  trial 
sample size. Besides this study, no other pediatric studies are ongoing or planned.
On  30 December 2022, EMA granted  a product  specific waiver  for all subsets  of  the pediatric 
population on  the  grounds  that  the  specific  medicinal  product  does  not  represent  a  significant 
therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients.

During the primary pooling, the overall frequency of solicited local and systemic AEs post any 
dose  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  was  lower  in  participants  aged  ≥60 years  (42.6%  and  49.7%, 
respectively) compared to participants aged ≥18 to 59 years (69.5% and 70.8%, respectively). This 
lower frequency in participants aged ≥60 years was reported for all selected solicited local and 
systemic AEs.
The potential benefit of receiving Ad26.COV2.S in elderly populations outweighs the risks. This 
age group is one of the primary targets of vaccination worldwide. Based on the number of elderly 
participants and the primary pooling results, use in elderly is not considered missing information.
Individuals with comorbidities associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19
Individuals with comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progression 
to  severe  COVID-19  were  included  in trials  COV2008,  COV3001  (Stages  1b  and  2b), and 
COV3009 (Stage 2). These included individuals with respiratory comorbidities, ie, moderate to 
severe asthma; chronic lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis; and 
individuals  with  other  comorbidities,  ie,  type  1  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus;  serious  heart 
conditions  (including  heart  failure,  coronary  artery  disease,  congenital  heart  disease, 
cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension); moderate to severe hypertension; obesity; liver 
disease; sickle cell disease; thalassemia; cerebrovascular disease; neurologic conditions such as 
dementia; chronic kidney disease; cancer; immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant; 
immunocompromised state from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, use of 
corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines; and HIV.
Of the 38,538 participants in the primary pooling who received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S, 
15,708  (40.8%)  participants  had  1  or  more  comorbidities  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for 
severe COVID-19.

During the primary pooling, the overall frequency of solicited local and systemic AEs post any 
dose  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  was  lower  in  participants  with  one  or  more  comorbidities  at 
baseline  (51.7%  and  57.0%,  respectively)  compared  to  participants  without  comorbidities  at 
baseline (62.6% and 65.3%, respectively). This lower frequency in participants with one or more 
comorbidities was reported for most selected solicited local and systemic AEs.
Use in individuals with comorbidities associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 is not 
considered missing information.
The safety and efficacy of individuals who are frail and also have comorbidities associated with 
increased  risk  for  severe  COVID-19  has  not  yet  been  assessed  and  is  considered  missing 
information (see Module SVII.1.2).
Individuals who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline
The  extent  to  which  pre-existing  antibodies  to SARS-CoV-2  could  impact  the  safety  and 
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S is not yet known.
A positive serological test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an exclusion criterion in trials 
COV3001 and COV3009.
Of the 38,538 participants in the primary pooling who received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S, 
3,941 (10.2%) participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline, based on serology. Based on 
serology or RT-PCR assessment, a total of 10.6% of participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive at 
baseline.
During the primary pooling, no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of solicited local 
and systemic AEs were observed in participants receiving Ad26.COV2.S who were SARS-CoV-2 
sero- and PCR-negative at baseline (58.9% and 62.9%, respectively) compared to participants who 
were SARS-CoV-2 sero- and/or PCR-positive at baseline (59.7% and 58.9%, respectively).
Use  in  individuals who  are  SARS-CoV-2  seropositive  at  baseline is  not  considered  missing 
information.

Post-authorisation Exposure
A  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation was  granted by  the  European  Commission  for 
Ad26.COV2.S on  11  March  2021 and  vaccination  of  the  EU/EEA  population  was  initiated on 
14 April 2021. Additionally, the WHO granted Ad26.COV2.S vaccine emergency use listing on 
12  March  2021.  On  16 December 2021,  the  European  Commission authorized  (as  part  of  the 
conditional  Marketing  Authorisation) Ad26.COV2.S as  homologous  or  heterologous  booster
following completion of primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. On 
11 November 2022, the European Commission authorized (as part of the conditional Marketing 
Authorisation)  Ad26.COV2.S  as  heterologous  booster  following  completion  of  primary 
vaccination  with  an  adenoviral  vector-based  COVID-19  vaccine.  On  09 January  2023,  the 
European Commission converted the conditional marketing authorization for the Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine  into  a  standard  marketing  authorization.  Post-authorisation  exposure  in  the  European 
Union/EEA and worldwide from launch up to 28 February 20234 is presented below.
SV.1.1.
Method used to Calculate Exposure
Post-authorisation exposure in the European Union/EEA is based on the number of administered 
doses reported on the ECDC COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker website (ECDC 2023b).
Estimates of worldwide post-authorisation exposure are based upon the number of administered 
doses  reported  from  CDC  for  the  US (CDC  2023),  ECDC  for  EEA  countries,  Korea  Disease 
Control and Prevention Agency for South Korea (KDCA 2023), Ministério da Saúde for Brazil
(Ministério da Saúde 2021), and National Department of Health for South Africa (NDH 2023).
The  vaccine  exposure  figures  described  in  this  section  are  an  overall  estimation  with  some 
uncertainties regarding the lack of exposure information received from many countries.
SV.1.2.
Exposure
European Union/EEA
Cumulative postmarketing exposure from the European Union/EEA according to the ECDC as of 
28 February 2023, is a total of 19,781,050 primary doses of Ad26.COV2.S.
The ECDC publishes the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses administered by age group (ECDC 2023c). 
The  age  group  numbers  in  this  report  currently  cover  29  EEA  countries,  ie,  all  EEA  countries 
excluding France. In addition, the French age group breakdown for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is 
published on a regular basis by ANSM in France (ANSM 2023), which is combined with the age 
group data for the other 29 countries. Therefore, the overall EEA age group distribution is based 
on the number of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses administered in all EEA countries. 
4 Note: The data for the distributed/delivered doses is available for whole months only, therefore the exposure data 
was cumulatively provided until 28 February 2023, instead of the DLP of 24 February 2023.

Module SVII:  Identified and Potential Risks
In accordance with EMA’s ‘Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines’ 
guidance (EMA 2020b), the below factors were taken into consideration for the generation of the 
safety specifications and are not determined to be identified or potential risks.

The vaccine construct and the formulation.
Ad26.COV2.S is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent 
human  Ad26  vector  that  encodes  a  SARS-CoV-2  full  length  S  protein  in  a  stabilized 
conformation. The S protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor of a 
host  cell, allowing  the  virus  to  infect  the  cell.  Vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S  leads  to 
humoral  and  cellular  immune  responses  directed  against  the  S  protein.  The  production  of 
neutralizing and other functional S-specific antibodies may block binding of the viral S protein 
to  the  ACE2  receptor,  thereby  inhibiting  viral  entry  into  host  cells,  and  mediate  cellular 
effector mechanisms via Fc function, leading to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and 
infected  cells.  Cellular  immune  responses  may  further  contribute  to  protection  by  clearing 
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells via cytotoxic mechanisms. Ad26.COV2.S is produced in PER.C6 
TetR cells.

The non-pathogenicity of the vector.
Ad26.COV2.S is replication-incompetent as it only encodes the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 
and  is  not  capable  of  replicating  in  human  cells.  As  such,  it  is  not  capable  of  causing 
infection/disease.

The vaccine does not contain an adjuvant.

Reactogenicity
In  acknowledgment  of  EMA’s  ‘Consideration  on  core  requirements  for  RMPs  of  COVID-19 
vaccines’ guidance (EMA 2020b), the reactogenicity profile of Ad26.COV2.S is discussed below. 
The  reactogenicity  profile  does  not  impact  the  overall  safety  profile  of  the  vaccine  and  is  not 
proposed to be included in the list of safety concerns, rather it is discussed for completeness here.
Frequencies were calculated based on the Safety Subset of trial COV3001 (primary analysis). The 
most common local adverse reaction reported was injection site pain (48.6%). The most common 
systemic adverse reactions were headache (38.9%), fatigue (38.2%), myalgia (33.2%), and nausea
(14.2%). Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥38°C) was observed in 9% of participants. Most 
adverse reactions occurred within 1 to 2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in 
severity and of short duration (1 to 2 days).
Adverse drug reactions observed during trial COV3001 in adults aged ≥18 years are listed below, 
organized by  SOC,  with  their  corresponding  frequency  categories  in  order  of  decreasing 
seriousness. Frequency  categories  are  defined  as  follows:  very  common  (≥ 1/10);  common

Solicited AEs  were recorded in an  e-Diary from the day of  vaccination  until 7 days  after each 
vaccination. The frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs were analyzed by age (18 to 
<60 years and 60 years), comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline. A summary of 
the results is presented below.
Overall,  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  reactogenicity  profile  of  Ad26.COV2.S  were 
observed across comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline. The frequency of solicited 
local and systemic AEs was lower in participants aged ≥60 years compared to participants aged 
≥18 to <60 years. No overall differences in safety were observed between older adults 65 years 
and 75 years of age and younger adults (18 to <60 years of age). Furthermore, participants with 
one  or  more  comorbidity  (ie,  asthma,  cerebrovascular  disease,  chronic  kidney  disease,  COPD, 
serious heart conditions, hypertension, and obesity) at baseline had higher frequencies of solicited 
AEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to placebo.
Solicited Local Adverse Events
In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of solicited local AEs was lower in participants aged 
≥60 years compared to participants aged ≥18 to <60 years. In general, this lower frequency was 
reported  for  all  selected  solicited  local  AEs,  including  the  most  frequent  solicited  local  AE, 
ie, vaccination site pain (33.3% of participants aged ≥60 years compared to 58.6% of participants 
aged ≥18 to <60 years).
In general, no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of solicited local AEs were observed
in  participants  with  one  or  more  comorbidities  compared  to  participants  without  comorbidities 
after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. The most frequent solicited local AE, ie, vaccination site 
pain, was reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a lower frequency in participants with one or 
more comorbidities compared to those without comorbidities (40.9% versus 52.7%). In general, a 
similar frequency for all other selected solicited local AEs was reported in participants with and 
without comorbidities.
The  frequency  of  solicited  local  AEs  was  similar  in  participants  who  were  seronegative  for 
SARS-CoV-2  at  baseline  compared  to  participants  who  were  seropositive  for  SARS-CoV-2  at 
baseline (50.1% and 54.5%, respectively) in the Ad26.COV2.S group.
In the Ad26.COV2.S group, no clinically relevant differences in median duration and the median 
time to onset for solicited local AEs were reported within the subgroups by age (18 to <60 years

Solicited Systemic Adverse Events
In  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group,  the  overall  frequency  of  solicited  systemic  AEs  was  lower  in 
participants aged ≥60 years compared to participants aged ≥18 to <60 years. In general, this lower
frequency in  participants  aged  ≥60 years  was  reported  for  all  selected  solicited  systemic  AEs, 
including  the  most  frequent  solicited  systemic  AE,  ie,  headache (30.5%  of  participants  aged 
≥60 years compared to 44.5% of participants aged ≥18 to <60 years).

Pyrexia (fever defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C, as recorded by the participants) was reported 
in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  in  3.1%  of  participants  aged  ≥60 years  compared  to  12.8%  of 
participants aged ≥18  to  <60 years. Grade 3 pyrexia was reported in 1 (0.1%)  participant aged 
≥60 years (67 years of age) compared to 7 (0.3%) participants aged ≥18 to <60 years (all <35 years 
of age).
No clinically relevant differences in the frequency of solicited systemic AEs were observed in the 
Ad26.COV2.S  group in  participants  with one  or  more  comorbidities  (49.6%)  compared  to 
participants  without  comorbidities  (58.1%)  and  in  participants  who  were  seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at  baseline  (55.4%)  compared  to  participants  who  were  seropositive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (50.6%).
In  the Ad26.COV2.S  group,  no  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed  in  the  median 
duration  and  median  time  to  onset  for  solicited  systemic  AEs,  with  specifically  pyrexia  being 
similar  across  subgroups  by  age  (18  to  <60  years  and  60  years),  comorbidities,  and 
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline.
Per  protocol,  prophylactic  antipyretic  use  was  not  encouraged.  However,  antipyretics  were 
recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed and were used more frequently in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the Placebo group. Of the 302 participants who experienced 
pyrexia in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group,  202  (66.9%)  used  antipyretics.  Overall,  in  the  FAS, 
1,128/21,895 (5.2%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group used analgesics or antipyretics up to 
7 days post-vaccination.
Anxiety-related reactions
Individuals can react in anticipation of, or as a result of, an injection of any kind. These reactions 
are  not  related  to  the  vaccine,  but  to  fear  of  the  injection (WHO  2019).  The  most  common 
manifestations of anxiety-related reactions to immunization are:

Fainting  (syncope and  presyncope):  the  most  commonly  reported  anxiety-related reaction, 
especially in older children, adolescents, and older adults. It does not require any additional 
measures other than to prevent injury from fainting.
 Hyperventilation: increased breathing rate may cause dizziness and tingling sensation. It will 
typically recede shortly after vaccination has been completed.
 Vomiting:  more  commonly  observed  in  children,  typically  following  extended  periods  of 
crying and apnea. Regular measures to avoid broncho-aspiration are sufficient.

Convulsions: might occur in very rare instances, especially in children and in adolescents, and 
it may be accompanied by fainting. The individual should recover without any sequelae.
As  stated  in  the  SmPC  Section  4.4,  anxiety-related  reactions,  including  vasovagal  reactions 
(syncope), hyperventilation, or stress‐related reactions, may occur in association with vaccination 
as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to 
avoid injury from fainting.

Anxiety-related  reactions  are  not  considered  an  important  potential  risk  as  they  do  not  require 
further characterization by additional pharmacovigilance activities, or risk minimization beyond 
standard clinical practice. The routine risk minimization measures included in the SmPC and PL 
are  part  of  standard  clinical  practice  for  vaccines  in  general  and  are  considered  sufficient  for 
purposes of risk communication.
Exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (ie, asthma and COPD)
An increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes has been reported in individuals with chronic 
lung diseases including COPD (Schultze 2020). Asthma patients are also at an increased risk for 
severe COVID-19; however, the disease burden in these patients is less evident for SARS-CoV-2 
compared  to  influenza  and  other  viruses  (Izquierdo  2021).  Therefore,  these  populations  are  a 
priority for vaccination against COVID-19.
Vaccines  against  other  respiratory  diseases,  including  influenza,  have  been  associated  with 
exacerbations of both asthma and COPD (Duffy 2017). Two possible mechanistic pathways have 
been proposed: viral infection (ie, lack of efficacy) and IgE hypersensitivity. Evidence for such 
association, however, remains weak (Committee to Review Adverse Effects of Vaccines; Institute 
of Medicine 2012).
A numerical imbalance has been observed in trial COV3001 regarding exacerbations of asthma 
and  COPD  in  participants  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  compared  to  placebo  (8  versus  1).  The 
median  time  to  onset  was  11 days  after  vaccination.  A  single  event  was  reported  as  serious 
(exacerbation of COPD), which occurred 39 days after vaccination. All events were assessed as 
not related by the investigator and were recovered at the time of reporting.
Despite the numerical imbalance in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus placebo, a causal link cannot 
be  established  based  on  the  currently  available  data.  All  reported events  occurred  later  than
72 hours after vaccination, which does not support a causal mechanism of reactive airway disease 
due  to  vaccine  hypersensitivity.  In  addition,  the  onset  of  these  episodes  could  have  been 
confounded by other triggers such as infection. Since patients with asthma and COPD are at an 
increased risk for severe  COVID-19 outcomes, exacerbation of  chronic pulmonary disorders  is 
considered a risk but not a safety concern.
Immunization errors
Large-scale public health approaches for mass vaccination may represent changes to the standard 
vaccine treatment process, thereby potentially introducing the risk of immunization errors related 
to administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, errors associated with a multidose vial, 
and confusion with other COVID-19 vaccines.

Risk Management Plan Version 7.1
Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0071/G - HA approval date 08/06/2023
Anticipated undesirable clinical outcomes arising from immunization errors include:


Insufficient  immunogenicity  of  the  vaccine(s)  in  case  of  ‘failure  to  vaccinate’  (due  to 
immunization error) leading to lack of anticipated clinical benefit (related to efficacy).
Increased reactogenicity in case of overdosing (due to the use of multidose vial). Higher doses
(up  to  2-fold,  ie,  1x1011 vp)  administered  in  Phase  1/2 trials  were well  tolerated, but  an 
increased reactogenicity was reported.
Other potential undesirable clinical outcomes of immunization errors are unknown. Immunization 
errors are not expected to result in any safety concerns. Any AE arising as a consequence of an
immunization  error will  be  monitored  via  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  will  be 
presented in each PBRER/PSUR.
At  the  time  of  initial  cMAA  submission, the  Company  considered  the  following  situations  as 
potential sources of immunization errors:
 As the majority of other COVID-19 vaccine regimens are administered as a 2-dose schedule, 
there is a possibility for Ad26.COV2.S to be erroneously administered twice.
 As  multidose  vials  (>5  mL)  will  be  used  for  vaccination,  there  is  the  possibility  of 
administering a higher dose than the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp of Ad26.COV2.S.
 Ad26.COV2.S  is  indicated  in  individuals  aged  ≥18  years. As  the  indication  of  other 
manufacturer’s  COVID-19  vaccines  includes  the  use  in  adolescents  aged  16  and  17 years, 
there is a risk for Ad26.COV2.S being erroneously administered in this age group.

Currently, no safety data exist regarding the use of Ad26.COV2.S in combination with any 
other  COVID-19  vaccine  as  part  of  a  mixed  schedule.  There  is  a  risk  for  the  vaccine 
unwittingly being administered to an individual already vaccinated with another COVID-19 
vaccine or vice versa.
Potential immunization errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC Sections 4.1, 
4.2, and 6.6, which contain instructions regarding the therapeutic indication, posology, method of 
administration, and storage conditions of Ad26.COV2.S.
In  addition,  a  Janssen  COVID-19  vaccine-specific  Contact  Center  will  be  available  to  support 
vaccination providers (eg, healthcare professionals and individuals who administer the vaccine) 
and  recipients by  providing  a  straightforward  and  streamlined  way  for  them  to  ask  unsolicited 
requests for medical information.
These available resources will provide information on the proper preparation and administration 
of the vaccine and reduce the potential for immunization errors in the context of a mass vaccination 
campaign.

Risk-Benefit Impact
Allergic reactions, including possibly severe reactions (eg, 
hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis), are known to occur with any 
injectable vaccine.
Most individuals fully recover with treatment, but serious complications 
can occur. Reporting from selected healthcare organizations in the 
United States found an overall rate of anaphylaxis after vaccination of 
1.3 cases per million doses administered to both children and adults. The 
estimated rate of anaphylaxis reported to VAERS from 1990 to 2016 
was 0.6 per 1 million doses distributed after measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine, and 0.2 per 1 million doses distributed after 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; from 2006 to 2016, the estimated 
rate was 1.2 per 1 million doses distributed after varicella vaccine. From 
2010 to 2016, the median estimated annual rate after influenza vaccine 
(all types) among persons aged 1 to 84 years was 0.2 (range: 0.1-0.4) per 
1 million doses administered (Su 2019). Available data seem to suggest 
a particular patient profile for individuals who experience anaphylaxis 
after vaccination: the vast majority has a history of atopy (history of 
atopic disease, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or food 
or drug allergy) but anaphylaxis can occur among individuals with no 
known history of hypersensitivity.
Ad26.COV2.S contains ingredients with known potential to cause 
allergic reactions, including polysorbate 80.
VAERD was first seen in the 1960s in infants with RSV infection after 
receiving a vaccine against RSV that led to markedly worse respiratory 
disease as compared to non-vaccinated infants. Subsequently, reports of 
VAED were reported in individuals without prior exposure to Dengue 
who received tetravalent Dengue vaccines. Nonclinical experience with 
SARS-CoV- and MERS CoV-based vaccines also indicated a risk for 
VAERD, however, this risk could not be confirmed in humans due to the 
lack of efficacy studies. For candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, no 
evidence of VAED or VAERD after IM immunization has been reported 
to date in nonclinical studies or clinical trials.
Nevertheless, in the absence of long-term safety and efficacy data, the 
evidence is not yet sufficient to fully dismiss VAED, including VAERD 
as a safety concern, and it remains an important potential risk.
If VAED, including VAERD was to be identified as a true risk, 
depending on its incidence and severity, it could negatively impact the 
overall risk-benefit balance of Ad26.COV2.S for certain individuals.

Risk-Benefit Impact
Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be associated with 
hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulation, 
microangiopathy, and VTE or arterial thrombosis. The occurrence of 
thrombotic and thromboembolic events in context of COVID-19 is 
associated with a poor outcome. The hypercoagulable state observed in 
patients with severe COVID-19 is thought to be related to the high-grade 
systemic inflammatory response, although other mechanisms such as the 
higher incidence of severe COVID-19 in individuals with risk factors for 
thrombotic and thromboembolic events have been proposed.
It is unknown whether these proposed mechanisms linking COVID-19 
and thromboembolic events could also be applicable for vaccines against 
COVID-19.
The available evidence from the clinical trial development program does 
not suggest that VTE is an important identified risk in participants 
vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S. Nevertheless, due to the observed 
numerical imbalance and its potential life-threatening nature, the risk of 
VTE resulting from vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, especially in 
participants with comorbidities associated with DVT and PE, cannot be 
entirely ruled out. Therefore, venous thromboembolism is considered an 
important potential risk.
As being pregnant or planning to become pregnant is an exclusion 
criterion in all clinical trials being conducted to date, the safety profile of 
Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women has not been established and the risk 
in this population has not yet been defined. 
Breastfeeding women were excluded from all clinical trials, except from 
Phase 3 trials COV3001 and COV3009. Up to the DLP of the EU-RMP 
that was part of the initial cMAA submission (22 January 2021), 
128 breastfeeding women have received Ad26.COV2.S in trial 
COV3001, but no data are currently available from these trials in this 
subpopulation. Therefore, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in 
breastfeeding women has not been established and the risk in this 
population has not yet been defined.
The safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S is not known in 
immunocompromised patients, including those receiving 
immunosuppressant therapy, due to their exclusion from the clinical 
development program. Only individuals with a stable/well-controlled 
HIV infection, those receiving chronic low-dose (less than 20 mg of 
prednisone or equivalent) immunosuppressive therapy were included in 
trials COV3001 and COV3009.
Given the fact that Ad26.COV2.S is a replication-incompetent vaccine, 
the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S when used in immunocompromised 
individuals is not expected to differ from that in the general population, 
with no specific safety concerns.

Risk-Benefit Impact
There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in 
individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and a theoretical 
concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underlying disease.
There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in frail 
patients with comorbidities. These comorbidities may compromise their 
immune response and the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in this 
subpopulation could vary from that seen in healthy adults, with a 
potentially higher risk of severe COVID-19.
Ad26.COV2.S will be used in individuals who may also receive other 
vaccines. Trials to determine if concomitant administration of 
Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines may affect the efficacy or safety of 
either vaccine have not been performed. This applies also to mixed 
schedules with other COVID-19 vaccines.
Long-term safety
There are no available data on the long-term safety of Ad26.COV2.S.
Further data are being collected for at least 2 years in ongoing trials 
COV3001 and COV3009 following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, 
and for up to 1 year in studies COV4003 and COV4001.
Based on long-term safety data from other Ad26-based vaccines (at least 
6 months up to 4.5 years post-vaccination in clinical trials), no long-term 
safety issues have been identified (Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks
Important Identified Risk: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
The  exact  mechanism  of  thrombosis  with  thrombocytopenia  syndrome  (TTS)  following 
vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S  is  unknown.  Several  hypothetical  biological  mechanisms  have 
been  proposed  to  explain  the  pathophysiology  of  vaccine-induced  TTS,  including  vaccine-
mediated induction  of  platelet-activating  antibodies  directed  against  the  cationic  platelet 
chemokine PF4 (CXCL4), subsequently referred to as anti-PF4 antibodies (Greinacher 2021).
The MAH assessed a possible interaction between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S (for details see Module 
SII) and does not have conclusive evidence for binding of Ad26.COV2.S to PF4 in vitro. However, 
several research teams in the TTS field are pursuing to investigate the potential binding of different 
Adenovirus vectors or other components in the formulation of the COVID-19 vaccines to PF4. 
The MAH will continue to follow the research developments regarding the potential binding to 
PF4 and support those activities wherever possible.
Besides the adenovirus vector, a potential role of a predisposition of the patient as well as of the 
S protein should be considered. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been associated with endothelial 
inflammation,  leukocyte  adhesion,  release  of  PF4,  hypercoagulation,  and  thrombosis  (Robles 
2022, Lei 2021, Perico 2022, Zhang 2020, Grobbelaar 2021, Zheng 2021), and is hypothesized to 
be related to adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022). 
PF4 binding data and a potential role of the S protein were presented by the MAH at the virtual 
workshop  on  27  June  2022,  hosted  by  the  EMA  to  review  the  current  understanding  of  the 
pathophysiology of TTS (EMA 2022c, Buoninfante 2022).
With  the  remaining ongoing additional  pharmacovigilance activities  included  in  Part  III.2,  the 
MAH aims to further understand what the potential causes of TTS might be and to gain insights 
into possible anti-PF4 antibody induction in the context of post-vaccination TTS.

Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has 
been  observed  very  rarely  following  vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S and  is  an  adverse drug
reaction described in the SmPC.
Characterization of the Risk:
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has 
been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. This includes severe cases 
of  venous  thrombosis  at  unusual  sites  such  as  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis  (CVST), 
splanchnic  vein  thrombosis  as  well  as  arterial  thrombosis  concomitant  with  thrombocytopenia. 
Fatal  outcomes  have been  reported.  These  cases  occurred  within  the  first  3  weeks  following 
vaccination, and mostly in individuals <60 years of age.
In this EU-RMP, for purposes of TTS risk characterization and presentation of cases, the PRAC 
case definition, which is based on the one proposed by the UK’s National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) [NICE 2022] is used.
Clinical Trial Data
A table presenting the data for the 28-day post any dose period of the primary pooling is provided

Cases  of  thrombosis  with  concurrent  thrombocytopenia  in  clinical  trials  are  identified  and 
reviewed. Cases that were qualified for TTS assessment and classified according to PRAC case 
definition are presented below.

At time of database releases classifications for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia qualified for TTS assessment were not yet 
available in the database. AEs which were present in database and were later identified as ‘Qualified for TTS Assessment’ and
classified per PRAC criteria, are presented in the table (latest classification at the time of RMP cut-off date 24 February 2022 
was used).   When there is a thromboembolic event with a concurrent thrombocytopenia and/or a low platelet count (both 
defined as platelet count below 150,000/µL) within 42 days of the thromboembolic event, the case is labeled as “qualified for 
assessment” and is being discussed and classified by the TTS Assessment Committee.

In  the  primary  pooling,  within  28 days post  any  dose,  5  cases  in  4 (<0.1%) participants  were 
qualified for TTS assessment, following Ad26.COV2.S administration. Of the 5 cases that were 
qualified for TTS assessment, 1 case (considered related to the study vaccine by both the Company 
and the investigator) met the PRAC case definition of confirmed TTS and 3 cases met possible 
PRAC case definition.
Similar incidences were observed in the cross-dose level pooling analysis within 28 days post any 
dose following Ad26.COV2.S administration.
No new information to further characterize this safety concern was identified from clinical trials 
evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.
COV3012 (Sisonke-1) and COV3021 (Sisonke Boost)
Up to 24 August 2022, 1 non-fatal case was qualified for TTS assessment in study COV3012. This
case was classified as a possible TTS case according to the PRAC case definition.
Up to 24 August 2022, no TTS cases were reported in study COV3021.

Postmarketing Experience
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 225 primary dose cases received from 
postmarketing  experience  were  qualified  for  TTS  assessment.  Of  these  cases,  192 cases  met 
confirmed (n=27), probable (n=14), or possible (n=151) PRAC case definition. This represents a 
reporting rate of 3.45 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. The outcome was fatal in 
33 out of these 192 cases.
Cumulatively,  from  launch  to  24  August  2022,  a  total  of  6  heterologous  booster  dose  cases 
received from postmarketing experience were qualified for TTS assessment. Of these cases, 1 case 
(for which  primary  vaccination  with  an  mRNA  vaccine  was  followed  by  a  booster  dose  of 
Ad26.COV2.S)  met  possible  PRAC  case  definition.  This  represents  a  reporting  rate  of 
0.34 spontaneous  cases  per  million  doses  administered.  This  case  had  a  fatal  outcome. No 
homologous booster dose cases were reported.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Although no clear risk factors have been identified, the cases of thrombosis in combination with 
thrombocytopenia reported in the postmarketing setting more commonly occurred in individuals 
aged <60 years.
Preventability:
TTS requires specialized clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable 
guidance and/or consult specialists (eg, hematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and 
treat this condition (SmPC Section 4.4).
The SmPC Section 4.3 states that JCOVDEN is contraindicated in individuals with a history of 
confirmed TTS following vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine. The SmPC Section 4.4 makes 
reference  to  this  contraindication  and  states  that healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the 
signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be 
instructed  to  seek  immediate  medical  attention  if  they  develop  symptoms  such  as  shortness  of 
breath,  chest  pain,  leg  pain,  leg  swelling,  or  persistent  abdominal  pain  following  vaccination. 
Additionally,  anyone  with  neurological  symptoms  including  severe  or  persistent  headaches, 
seizures,  mental  status  changes,  or  blurred  vision  after  vaccination,  or  who  experiences
spontaneous bleeding, skin  bruising (petechia) beyond the site of  vaccination after  a few  days, 
should  seek  prompt  medical  attention.  Individuals  diagnosed  with  thrombocytopenia  within 
3 weeks after vaccination with JCOVDEN should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. 
Similarly,  individuals  who present  with  thrombosis  within  3  weeks  of  vaccination  should  be 
evaluated for thrombocytopenia.

Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S is a very 
rare event which is potentially life-threatening, especially if improperly managed. Adequate risk 
minimization that raises public awareness and supports education of healthcare professionals may 
lead  to  earlier  diagnosis  and  appropriate  treatment,  which  may  improve  the  prognosis  of  TTS. 
Based on current information, the overall risk-benefit balance for Ad26.COV2.S is considered to 
remain positive for the indicated target populations.
Public Health Impact:
The occurrence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome is very rare following vaccination 
with Ad26.COV2.S. Therefore, the impact on public health is expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk: Guillain-Barré syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
The mechanism of Ad26.COV2.S-related GBS has not been established. However, as with other
vaccines, immune activation is believed to play a role in the development of the disease (Sejvar 
2011). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
GBS has  been  observed  very  rarely  following  vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S both  in  clinical 
trials  and  in  the  postmarketing setting.  Similar  AEs  have  also  been  described  following 
administration  of  other  COVID-19  vaccines.  Despite  no  clear  biological  mechanism  being 
identified, the MAH considers the increase in observed versus expected ratios since authorisation
to be sufficient evidence for a plausible association between Ad26.COV2.S and GBS. 
Guillain-Barré syndrome is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC.

In the primary pooling, within 28 days post any dose, 1 event of GBS was reported in 1 (<0.1%) 
participant  following  Ad26.COV2.S  administration. The  event  was  reported  post-dose 1  and
assessed as related to the study vaccine by the investigator. Within the 42-day risk window after 
vaccination for GBS, as well as during the rest of the double-blind phase, no additional events of 
GBS were reported.
There were no new events observed in the cross-dose level pooling analysis within 28 days post 
any dose following Ad26.COV2.S administration. No additional events were reported within the
42-day  risk  window  after  vaccination  of  GBS and 7  additional  events  were  reported  in  the 
Ad26.COV2.S group with an onset within Day 102 – Day 284 post-vaccination, of which 1 was 
considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator.
No new information to further characterize this safety concern was identified from clinical trials 
evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.
COV3012 (Sisonke-1) and COV3021 (Sisonke Boost)
Up to 24 August 2022, 2 cases of GBS were identified in study COV3012 (of which none were 
fatal). 
Up to 24 August 2022, no cases of GBS were reported in study COV3021.
Postmarketing Experience
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 537 primary dose cases of GBS meeting 
at  least  Brighton  Collaboration  Level  4  of  diagnostic  certainty  have  been  received  from 
postmarketing experience. This represents a reporting rate of 10.19 spontaneous cases per million 
doses administered. The outcome was fatal in 10 out of these 537 cases.
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 10 booster dose cases (3 homologous and 
7 heterologous) of GBS meeting at least Brighton Collaboration Level 4 of diagnostic certainty 
have  been  received  from  postmarketing  experience.  This  represents  a  reporting  rate  of 
3.36 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. The outcome was fatal in 1 out of these 
10 cases.
A recent large cohort study using data from the US Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) showed an 
unadjusted incidence rate for GBS of 32.4 (95% CI: 14.8-61.5) per 100,000 person-years (1 to 
21 days  following Ad26.COV2.S administration),  which  was  significantly  higher  than  the 
background rate. The adjusted risk ratio was 6.03 (95% CI: 0.79-147.79) (1 to 21 days vs 22 to 
42 days  following  Ad26.COV2.S  administration). Nearly  all  patients  presenting GBS  after 
Ad.26.COV2.S administration, identified in this surveillance, had facial weakness or paralysis, in 
addition to weakness and decreased reflexes in the limbs.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. 
Based mainly on data from North America and Europe, it has been shown in literature that the 
GBS incidence increased by 20% for every 10-year increase in age; GBS is usually more frequent 
in males, with the highest incidence between 50 to 70 years of age (Van Doorn 2020).
Preventability:
The  SmPC  Section 4.4 states  that  healthcare  professionals should  be  alert  of GBS  signs  and 
symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment 
and to rule out other causes.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Although GBS is a serious event that has been reported following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, 
it  has  been  reported  at  a  very  low  incidence  and  adequate  risk  minimization  via  the  SmPC  is 
considered sufficient to manage this risk. Therefore, the impact on the risk-benefit balance for the
vaccine is considered to be low.
Public Health Impact:
GBS associated with vaccines typically occurs at a low incidence, resulting in a low public health 
impact. Although the potential clinical consequences of GBS are serious, this is a risk known to 
healthcare professionals, with negligible public health impact.

Important Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia
Potential Mechanisms:
The mechanistic evidence for vaccine-derived thrombocytopenia is not very well understood. It is 
suspected to have a strong immune component such as immunostimulation causing alterations in 
cytokines that abrogate platelet production from megakaryocyte precursors and antigenic mimicry 
between  virus  and  platelet  antigens,  giving  rise  to  cross-reactive  anti-platelet  antibodies 
(anti-IIb/IIIa) and/or activation of cytotoxic T cells that decrease platelet survival (Wise 2007). 
Similar to other autoimmune disorders, molecular mimicry with bacterial or viral proteins might 
be one reason for the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (Marini 2019).
The  SARS-CoV-2  S protein  has  been  associated  with  endothelial  inflammation,  leukocyte 
adhesion, release of PF4, hypercoagulation, and thrombosis (Robles 2022, Lei 2021, Perico 2022, 
Zhang 2020, Grobbelaar 2021, Zheng 2021), and is hypothesized to be related to adverse effects 
after COVID-19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022).
Recent mechanistic studies (nonclinical studies, and studies using clinical trial samples) conducted 
by  the  MAH to  study  the  pathogenesis  of  (vaccine-induced)  TTS with  potential  relevance  to 
thrombocytopenia  (including  ITP), did  not  elucidate  a  clear  mechanism of  action for 
thrombocytopenia (including ITP) following Ad26.COV2.S administration.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of ITP with very low platelet levels (<20,000 per μL) have been reported very rarely after 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, usually within the first 4 weeks after receiving Ad26.COV2.S. 
This included cases with bleeding and cases with fatal outcome. Some of these cases occurred in 
individuals with a history of ITP.
Based  on  the  observed  imbalance  in  postmarketing  events,  ITP  is  an  adverse  drug  reaction 
described in the SmPC.

Events of thrombocytopenia were observed at an increased frequency in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
in  the  cross-dose  level  pooling  analysis within  28  days  post  any  dose  when  compared  to  the 
primary pooling analysis. Within 28 days post any dose, 285 events of thrombocytopenia were
reported in 277 (0.4%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group; no events of ITP, as reported by 
the  investigator, were  reported in  the  Ad26.COV2.s  group. Thirty-two  (11.2%)  of  the 
thrombocytopenia events were considered related to the study vaccine.
The observed increased frequency in events of thrombocytopenia in the Ad26.COV2.S group in 
the cross-dose level pooling (0.4%) compared to the primary pooling (<0.1%), is primarily driven 
by  the  implementation  of  protocol  amendments that  defined  the  follow-up  of  AESIs 
(thrombocytopenia  and/or  thrombosis).  After  the  implementation  of  these  amendments,  a
prospective pre-vaccination blood sample collection for platelet count assessment was required at 
the time of Ad26.COV2.S (or blinded) vaccine administration. As a result, an increased rate of 
thrombocytopenia  was  observed  as  compared  to  the  double-blind  phase  of  trials  where this 
requirement  was  not  in  place. The  majority  of  these  were  thrombocytopenias on  the  day  of 
vaccination, suggesting some events may have had an onset pre-vaccination.
No new information to further characterize this safety concern was identified from clinical trials 
evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.
COV3012 (Sisonke-1) and COV3021 (Sisonke Boost)
Up to 24 August 2022, a total of 3 cases of thrombocytopenia were received from study COV3012. 
Two cases met the diagnostic criteria for ITP, of which 1 was fatal.
Up to 24 August 2022, no cases of thrombocytopenia were reported in study COV3021.
Postmarketing Experience
Cumulatively,  from launch to  24  August 2022,  a  total  of  804  primary  dose cases  of 
thrombocytopenia  were  received  from  postmarketing  experience,  of  which  87 were  fatal.  This 
represents a reporting rate of 14.90 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. Of these 
804 cases, 400 met the diagnostic criteria for ITP, of which 19 were fatal.
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 20 booster dose cases (7 homologous and 
13 heterologous) of thrombocytopenia were  received from postmarketing experience, of  which 
1 was fatal.  This  represents  a  reporting  rate  of  4.70 spontaneous  cases  per  million  doses 
administered. Of these 20 cases, 15 (7 homologous and 8 heterologous) met the diagnostic criteria 
for ITP, including the fatal case of thrombocytopenia.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Limited data from postmarketing experience with Ad26.COV2.S, including literature, suggest that 
individuals with chronic or recurrent ITP may be at increased risk of developing ITP following 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.

Preventability:
The  SmPC  Section 4.4  provides  guidance  to  healthcare  professionals  to  be  alert  to  signs  and 
symptoms  of  thrombocytopenia  and  includes  a  caution  for  bleeding  following  IM  injection  in 
individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.
In addition, Section 4.4 states that if an individual has a history of ITP, the risks of developing low 
platelet levels should be considered before vaccination with JCOVDEN, and platelet monitoring 
is recommended following vaccination with JCOVDEN.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
ITP is a potentially life-threatening event, and if not recognized or managed appropriately, may 
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, and hence requires immediate medical 
intervention.  ITP  has  been  reported  very  rarely  following  vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S  and 
adequate risk minimization via the SmPC is considered sufficient to manage this risk. Based on 
current  clinical  trial  and  postmarketing  data  and  the  information  in  the  SmPC,  the  risk-benefit 
balance for the vaccine is considered to remain favorable for the indicated target populations.
Public Health Impact:
Based on the currently available information on the known frequency, clinical characteristics, and 
outcome  of  ITP  events  reported  after  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccination,  the  public  health  impact  is 
expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk: Venous thromboembolism
Potential Mechanisms:
A  potential  mechanism  for  the  occurrence  of  VTE  includes  a  hypercoagulable  state  due  to  an 
increased pro-inflammatory response to vaccination. Activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and 
leukocytes with subsequent formation of microparticles can trigger the coagulation system through 
the  induction  of  tissue  factor  (Branchford  2018).  An  underlying  mechanism  for  VTE  without 
thrombocytopenia has not been confirmed. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be 
associated  with hypercoagulability, pulmonary  intravascular  coagulation, microangiopathy, and 
VTE or arterial thrombosis (Ribes 2020).
The  SARS-CoV-2  S protein  has  been  associated  with  endothelial  inflammation,  leukocyte 
adhesion, release of PF4, hypercoagulation, and thrombosis (Robles 2022, Lei 2021, Perico 2022, 
Zhang 2020, Grobbelaar 2021, Zheng 2021), and is hypothesized to be related to adverse effects 
after COVID-19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022).
Recent mechanistic studies (nonclinical studies, and studies using clinical trial samples) conducted 
by the MAH to study the pathogenesis of (vaccine-induced) TTS with potential relevance to VTE, 
did not elucidate a clear mechanism of action for VTE following Ad26.COV2.S administration. 
However, in the context of the MAH’s mechanistic work on TTS, the hypothesis was tested if TTS 
and other thrombotic events could have a common mechanism with TTS being the most severe 
manifestation. Obtained data suggest that a common mechanism is unlikely.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
VTE has been observed rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in clinical trials and in 
the postmarketing setting. While a higher proportion of cases of VTE was observed within the 
Ad26.COV2.S group versus the Placebo group in trial COV3001, there was no increase in VTE 
events among individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S in trial COV3009.
VTE is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC.

In  the  primary  pooling,  within  28 days post any  dose,  10 (<0.1%) participants  reported  each 
1 event of VTE following Ad26.COV2.S administration. Of these 10 VTE events, 4 were reported 
as DVT and 3 were reported as PE. The majority of these VTE events had an onset within 28 days 
post-dose 1 (9 events) and 3 events were considered related to the study vaccine. The majority of 
VTE  events  were  reported  more  than  28  days  post-vaccination  (any  dose).  Minor  numerical 
imbalances  between  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  and  the  placebo  group  were  observed  beyond 
28 days post any dose. However, data should be interpreted with caution as some participants had 
confounding risk factors for VTE, which may contribute to the observed risk imbalance between 
both groups.
Similar incidences were observed in the cross-dose level pooling analysis within 28 days post any 
dose. The majority of events in both groups had an onset after 28 days post-vaccination. For the 
entire follow-up period, more events were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group, mainly in post-
dose 1 follow-up period.
No new information to further characterize this safety concern was identified from clinical trials 
evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.
COV3012 (Sisonke-1) and COV3021 (Sisonke Boost)
Up to 24 August 2022, a total of 28 cases of VTE were identified during study COV3012. Of these, 
9 reported DVT, 19 reported PE, and 2 reported CVST. Two cases (both PE) had a fatal outcome.
Up to 24 August 2022, a total of 3 cases of VTE were identified during study COV3021. Of these, 
2 reported PE and 1 reported portal vein thrombosis. None of them were fatal.
Postmarketing Experience
Cumulatively,  from  launch  to  24  August 2022,  a  total  of  2,123 primary  dose cases  of venous
embolic  and  thrombotic  events  have  been  received  from  postmarketing  experience,  of  which 
150 cases  had  a  fatal  outcome.  This  represents  a  reporting  rate  of  39.90 spontaneous cases  per 
million  doses  administered.  Of  these,  781 reported  DVT,  938 reported  PE, and  139 reported 
CVST.
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 59 booster dose cases (35 homologous 
and  24 heterologous)  of  venous  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  have  been  received  from 
postmarketing experience, of which 5 cases had a fatal outcome. This represents a reporting rate 
of 18.79 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. Of these, 26 reported DVT, 20 reported 
PE, and 3 reported CVST.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
In trials COV3001 and COV3009, underlying risk factors have been identified in participants with 
VTE such  as COVID-19,  male  gender,  old  age  (>65  years),  long-haul  travel,  thrombophilia, 
obesity, active malignancy, trauma, previous venous thrombosis, hypertension, and COPD.

Preventability:
The  SmPC  Section  4.4  provides  guidance  to  healthcare  professionals  to  be  alert  to  signs  and 
symptoms of thromboembolism and advises to take the occurrence of VTE into consideration for 
individuals at increased risk for VTE. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
VTE is a potentially life-threatening event, and if not recognized or managed appropriately, may 
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, and hence requires immediate medical 
intervention. Adequate risk  minimization via the SmPC  is  considered sufficient to manage this 
risk. Based on current information, the overall risk benefit balance for JCOVDEN is considered to 
remain positive for the indicated target populations.

Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and pericarditis
Potential Mechanisms:
Infectious diseases account for the majority of cases of myocarditis or pericarditis in previously 
healthy  patients, mainly  due  to  either  a  direct  viral  infection  or  post-viral  immune-mediated 
reaction and myocardial inflammation (Friedrich 2009) and is more frequent in young males. Also 
viral  infection  with  SARS-CoV-2  can  result  in  acute  myocarditis,  yet  COVID-19  vaccination 
(including mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S) was associated with decreased risk of myocarditis, 
myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke after COVID-19 (Jiang 2023, Kim 2022, Patone 2022).
The mechanism of action for vaccine-induced myopericarditis remains to be elucidated. Given the 
increased  incidence  among  males,  differences  in  hormone  signaling  might  be  involved  in  the 
pathophysiology  (Heymans  2022).  It  has  been  proposed  that  vaccines  triggering  an  intense 
immune response could be associated with a higher risk of myocarditis (Karlstad 2022). Also, a 
possible association of circulating S protein with the occurrence of myocarditis has been described 
(Yonker  2023).  Molecular  mimicry  between  the  S  protein  of  SARS-CoV-2  and  cardiac  self-
antigens is another possible mechanism. However, only limited experimental evidence supporting 
this hypothesis exists (Vojdani 2020, Vojdani 2021). The delivery of the Spike gene by different 
vaccine  delivery  platforms  may  result  in  a  different  expression  pattern  of  the  S  protein,  thus 
potentially  affecting  parameters 
location  and/or  post-translational 
modifications. There are also differences in the biosynthesis, structural features, and presentation 
of the S protein in current COVID-19 vaccines (Heinz 2021) that may be additionally related to 
myo/pericarditis incidence.
levels,  kinetics, 
like 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported as rare events following vaccination against 
smallpox,  hepatitis  B,  tetanus,  human-papilloma  virus,  and  viral  influenza  and  have  been 
documented for COVID-19 vaccines (Mei 2018, Su 2021). A systemic review and meta-analysis 
revealed higher incidence of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination but no significant 
difference after influenza vaccinations compared to COVID-19 vaccination (Ling 2022).
Among  COVID-19  vaccines,  myocarditis  and/or  pericarditis  has  been  observed  with  mRNA 
vaccines (Husby 2021, Karlstad 2022, Ling 2022, Patone 2022) with an incidence significantly 
higher in males versus females, in people younger than 30 years, and after a second dose (compared 
to first or third dose). Additionally, a recombinant adjuvanted protein-based COVID-19 vaccine 
has been associated with a disproportional myopericarditis induction (Macías Saint-Gerons 2023).
Events of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed very rarely following vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. Real-world evidence data of 
US claims data sources showed a high level of certainty of an increased risk of myocarditis and 
pericarditis for males aged 18 to 39 years within 28 days of vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.
Myocarditis and pericarditis are adverse drug reactions described in the SmPC.

Up to 24 February 2023, 2 myocarditis/pericarditis cases have been reported in study COV3012. 
Of these 2 cases, 1 myocarditis and 1 pericarditis event was reported. Both events were reported 
as not recovered. There were no fatal events of myocarditis or pericarditis. Of the 2 cases reported, 
both concerned females and the age was within the age category of 36 to 50 years.
Up to 24 February 2023, 1 myocarditis/pericarditis case was reported in study COV3021.  This 
case reported 1 non-fatal pericarditis event. The event was resolved. This case concerned a female 
with the age within the age category of 18 to 35 years.
Postmarketing Experience
Cumulatively, from launch to 24 February 2023, a total of 436 myocarditis/pericarditis primary 
dose  cases  have  been  received  from  postmarketing  experience,  of  which  197  cases  reported 
myocarditis and 177 cases reported pericarditis (4 of these cases reported both myocarditis and 
pericarditis [Brighton  Collaboration  Level  1-3])  within  the  risk  window  of  42  days. Excluding 
solicited  cases,  this  represents  a  spontaneous  reporting  rate  of  4.32 cases  per  million  doses 
administered  for  myocarditis  and  4.15 cases  per  million  doses  administered  for  pericarditis 
(limited to Brighton Collaboration Level 1-4). Of the 436 cases, 22 had a fatal outcome. In terms 
of gender distribution, 278 cases were reported as male, 128 were reported as female, and 30 cases 
did not have gender reported. The age/gender group with the highest number of cases were males 
aged  18  to  29  years  (n=102).  In  this  group,  almost  half  of  the  patients  (n=49)  developed

an increased risk of composite myocarditis-pericarditis following the first Ad26.COV2.S dose for 
males aged 18 to 39 years in 1 to 14 days (meta-analysis relative risk estimates = 2.3-5.4) and 1 to

28 days (meta-analysis relative risk estimates = 1.3-5.2). There was a lack of evidence of increased 
risks for other sex-age groups; however, data are insufficient to confidently exclude the possibility 
of small effects in these groups.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Myocarditis  and  pericarditis  have  been  reported  in  association  with  SARS-CoV-2  infection. 
Historically,  myocarditis  and/or  pericarditis  have  been  reported  as  a  rare  event  following 
vaccination  against  smallpox,  hepatitis  B  and  viral  influenza  (Su  2021).  Myocarditis  and 
pericarditis  have  also  been  reported  with  other  COVID-19  vaccines  (including  mRNA-based 
COVID-19  vaccines  and  a  recombinant  adjuvanted  protein-based COVID-19  vaccine).  Young 
males appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose of COVID-19 
vaccination. The disease course is self-limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show 
a  rapid  resolution  of  symptoms  and  normalization  of  cardiac  biomarkers,  electro- and 
echocardiographic findings within days (Klamer 2022).
Preventability:
The  SmPC Section  4.4 states  that  healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and 
symptoms  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  and  should  consult  guidance  and/or  specialists  to 
diagnose and treat these conditions.  Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical 
attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Myocarditis  and/or  pericarditis  has  been  reported  very  rarely  in  clinical  trials  and  the  post-
marketing setting following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Based on current clinical trial and 
postmarketing  data  and  the  information  in  the  SmPC,  the  identified  risk  of  myocarditis  and 
pericarditis does not change the existing established risk-benefit balance for Ad26.COV2.S.

The  occurrence  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  is  very  rare  following  vaccination  with 
Ad26.COV2.S.  Epidemiologic  analysis  of  real-world  data  sources  such  as  electronic  medical

Important Potential Risk: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)
Potential Mechanisms:
Potential mechanisms of enhanced disease may include both T cell-mediated immune responses 
(a  Th2-skewed  immune  response  favoring  immunopathology)  and  antibody-mediated  immune 
responses  (antibody  responses  with  insufficient  neutralizing  activity  leading  to  formation  of 
immune complexes and activation of complement or allowing for Fc-mediated increase in viral 
entry to cells) (Graham 2020).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Based  on  past  experiences  in  the  development  of  vaccines  against  RSV,  Dengue  virus, 
SARS-CoV, and  MERS-CoV,  there  is  a  theoretical  risk  for  VAED,  including  VAERD,  for 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Chin 1969, Fulginiti 1969, Kapikian 1969, Kim 1969, Su 2020, Agrawal 
2016,  Bolles  2011,  Deming  2006,  Honda-okubo  2015,  Houser  2017).  As COVID-19  clinical 
manifestations are not limited to respiratory symptoms, not only VAERD, but also the broader 
term VAED is being taken into account.
VAED/VAERD has not been described in association with JCOVDEN and has not been confirmed
from any other late phase clinical trial of other COVID-19 vaccines.
Studies  in  Ad26.COV2.S-immunized  Syrian  hamsters  and  NHP  conducted  by  the  MAH have
shown the absence of enhanced lung pathology, absence of increased viral load, and absence of 
enhanced clinical signs of disease compared with controls after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, even 
under conditions of suboptimal immunity allowing breakthrough infection (van der Lubbe 2021, 
He 2021). Together with induction of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-skewed immune response 
after Ad26.COV2.S dosing, these data suggest that the theoretical risk of VAERD and VAED for 
Ad26.COV2.S is low. These data were corroborated by the findings in clinical trials which have 
shown no indication of the presence of VAED, including VAERD.
Characterization of the Risk:
Clinical Trial Data
No events of VAED or VAERD were reported.
In the primary pooling, case splits for COVID-19 associated SAEs and deaths showed a lower 
incidence of severe COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S versus the placebo group. Therefore, there 
was no evidence for VAED/VAERD.
No new information to further characterize this safety concern was identified from clinical trials 
evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.

Risk Management Plan Version 7.1
Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0071/G - HA approval date 08/06/2023
COV3012 (Sisonke-1) and COV3021 (Sisonke Boost)
Up  to  24  August 2022,  no  VAED/VAERD  cases  were  retrieved  from  studies COV3012 and 
COV3021.
Postmarketing Experience
Up to 24 August 2022, 1 primary dose case reported by a healthcare professional was reported as 
VAED following Ad26.COV2.S administration. However, no clinical details were available for 
this individual, nor information on its SARS-CoV.2 status, and therefore this case is not assessable.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
It is postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals producing lower neutralizing 
antibody titers or in those demonstrating waning immunity (Graham 2020, Munoz 2020).
Preventability:
An  effective  vaccine  against  COVID-19  that  produces  strong humoral  and  cellular  immune 
responses  with  a  clear  Th1  bias is  expected  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  VAED, including  VAERD
(Lambert 2020, Graham 2020). Such an immune profile is elicited by Ad26.COV2.S in clinical 
trials and nonclinical studies.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
A confirmed risk of VAED, including VAERD could significantly impact the risk-benefit balance 
of Ad26.COV2.S. The risk will be further characterized through follow-up of study participants in 
Phase  3  trials  for  the  occurrence  of  severe  COVID-19.  Within  post-authorisation  effectiveness
studies, the incidence of severe COVID-19 in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated populations will 
be used as an indirect measure of VAED, including VAERD.
Public Health Impact:
The  potential  risk  of  VAED,  including  VAERD  could  have  a  public  health  impact  if  large 
populations of individuals are affected.

Presentation of the Missing Information
Missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding
Evidence source:
There is limited experience with the use of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women.
Animal data from the EF-PPND toxicity study with Ad26.COV2.S indicate no adverse effect of 
Ad26.COV2.S on reproductive performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, or parturition. 
In addition, there was no adverse effect of vaccination on fetal body weights, external, visceral and 
skeletal evaluations, or on postnatal development of the offspring.
Pregnancy at baseline was not an exclusion criterion in trial COV2008, and trial COV2004 is a trial in 
pregnant women. Up to the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, 23 women who were pregnant at baseline 
received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (cross-dose level pooling; all dose levels). Of the 
pregnancies reported in trial COV2004 (n=22), 9 were still ongoing, 11 had a normal outcome, and 
2 had an outcome of preterm neonate (1 without complications and 1 with complications). The 
pregnancy reported in trial COV2008 had an outcome of premature without complications. No safety 
concerns have been identified in this population.
Any case of study vaccine exposure during pregnancy was included in the Company’s Global Safety 
Database when reported during the course of the trials. As of the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, 
154 unique pregnancies were retrieved from Company-sponsored clinical trials post-baseline; 
132 involved maternal exposure and 22 were partner pregnancies; all following Ad26.COV2.S 
administration. Overall, reported outcomes were live birth (n=10), spontaneous abortion (n=19), still
birth (n=2), anembryonic pregnancy (n=1), ectopic pregnancy (n=1), elective abortion (n=4), unknown 
(n=117). Of note, 1 participant reported 2 pregnancies during the trial (1 with an outcome of 
spontaneous abortion, 1 with an unknown outcome). 
Up to the cut-off date of 24 August 2022, 700 unique cases reporting use in pregnancy were retrieved 
from postmarketing sources (including spontaneous and solicited primary and booster dose cases); 
698 involved maternal exposure and 2 were partner pregnancy. Of these unique pregnancy cases, 
200 cases reported 204 outcomes due to 4 twin pregnancies. One twin pregnancy resulted in a 
spontaneous abortion of one twin and a live birth without congenital anomaly of the other and are 
included in the following counts. The outcomes included live birth without congenital anomaly (n=123
[including 1 set of twins]), spontaneous abortion (n=56 [including 2 sets of twins]), live birth with 
congenital anomaly (n=14), ectopic pregnancy (n=5), blighted ovum (n=2), and 1 case each of still 
birth without congenital anomaly, still birth with congenital anomaly, maternal death, and intrauterine 
death. Of the 56 spontaneous abortion outcomes, there were 10 outcomes with exposure before 
conception, 25 outcomes with exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy, and for the remaining 
21 outcomes timing of vaccine exposure was not reported.
Safety data with Ad26.COV2.S when administered within 3 months before pregnancy as well as during 
pregnancy have shown no safety concerns in the mother or child in over 500 reported pregnancies, with 
over 100 reported pregnancy outcomes.
Breastfeeding women were excluded from all clinical trials, except from the Phase 2 trial COV2008
and the Phase 3 trials COV3001, COV3003, and COV3009. Up to the cut-off date of 24 February 
2022, 718 women who were breastfeeding at baseline have received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S
(cross-dose level pooling; all dose levels). No safety concerns have been identified for breastfeeding 
women. However, safety data for their breastfed children is currently not available. 
Up to 24 August 2022, there have been 135 unique cases (postmarketing spontaneous or non-
interventional cases) of exposure to JCOVDEN via breastfeeding. No safety signals were identified.
It is not known whether the components of Ad26.COV2.S or the antibodies induced by Ad26.COV2.S 
are excreted in human milk. Human data are not available to assess the impact of Ad26.COV2.S on 
milk production or its effects on the breastfed child.

Risk Management Plan Version 7.1
Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0071/G - HA approval date 08/06/2023
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:
Based on the nonreplicating nature of the vaccine and on nonclinical and limited clinical and 
postmarketing data available to date, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S when used in pregnant women 
is not expected to differ from that in the general population, with no specific safety concerns for 
pregnant women or fetuses to date. Therefore, as stated in the SmPC Section 4.6, the administration of 
JCOVDEN in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential 
risks to the mother and fetus.
A Phase 2 trial (COV2004) and a post-authorisation pregnancy exposure registry (COV4005) are 
ongoing to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women and their 
offspring. The adequacy of the post-authorisation safety study COV4003 to address pregnancy 
outcomes is to be assessed.
No effects on the breastfed child are anticipated considering results from animal and human studies 
with Ad26-based vaccines, showing limited dissemination of this nonreplicating vector following IM 
injection. In the event that a small quantity of Ad26.COV2.S would be (transiently) excreted via the 
milk, it would not be considered a risk to the breastfed child, specifically with regard to infections, as 
Ad26.COV2.S is replication-incompetent and does not encode a complete SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Breastfeeding women are being included in trials COV3001 and COV3009 to characterize the safety 
profile of Ad26.COV2.S in this subpopulation. A small subset of participants within trial COV2004 
will be followed up during breastfeeding to assess the transfer of antibodies via breast milk.
Breastfeeding women were also allowed to participate in trials COV2008 and COV3003.
Missing information: Use in immunocompromised patients
Evidence source: 
Patients with stable and well-controlled medical condition including comorbidities associated with an 
increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (eg, stable/well-controlled HIV infection), or those 
receiving chronic low-dose (less than 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent) immunosuppressive therapy 
were included in trials COV2008, COV3001, and COV3009.
The efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.
The final analysis results of the double-blind phase in trial COV3001 showed that, overall, the vaccine 
was efficacious against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 with onset at 
least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination across demographic and baseline characteristics subgroups. 
An exception was noted for HIV-positive participants (with a stable/well-controlled HIV infection) in 
which the VE was lower. Due to few COVID-19 cases in HIV-positive participants, this conclusion 
should be interpreted with caution. No clinically relevant difference in the reactogenicity profile could 
be observed in HIV-infected versus HIV-negative participants (COV3001 CSR Dec 2021).
In the FAS of trial COV3001, SAEs were reported in 8 (1.3%) out of 604 HIV-infected participants
who received Ad26.COV2.S, of which none were considered to be related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator. The frequency of reported SAEs was similar in the Ad26.COV2.S and Placebo groups
(COV3001 CSR Dec 2021).

Based on the final analysis results of the double-blind phase in trial COV3009, no conclusion can
currently be made about VE in HIV-infected participants due to the limited number of HIV-positive 
participants. In the FAS of trial COV3009, SAEs were reported in 3 (1.4%) out of 213 HIV-infected 
participants who received Ad26.COV2.S, of which none were considered to be related to the study 
vaccine by the investigator. The frequency of reported SAEs was similar in the Ad26.COV2.S and 
Placebo groups (COV3009 CSR Dec 2021).
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who received at least one dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 1,440 (2.2%) participants had a stable/well-controlled HIV infection.
Participants with other immunodeficiencies were included at low numbers.
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:
Given the fact that Ad26.COV2.S is a replication-incompetent vaccine, the safety profile of 
Ad26.COV2.S when used in immunocompromised individuals is not expected to differ from that in the 
general population. There were no specific safety concerns and no notable differences between HIV-
infected and healthy participants with regard to reporting frequency or severity of AEs at any timepoint
from trials COV3001 and COV3009.
Use in immunocompromised patients will be further characterized in the post-authorisation safety 
studies COV4003 and COV4001 and effectiveness studies COV4004 and COV4002.
Missing information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders
Evidence source: 
There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in individuals with autoimmune or 
inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underlying 
disease.
Participants with clinical conditions stable under non-immunomodulator treatment (eg, autoimmune 
thyroiditis, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis) were eligible for 
enrollment in Phase 3 trials COV3001 and COV3009 at the discretion of the investigator. Of the 
21,898 participants in the FAS of trial COV3001 who received Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose level), 
552 participants had a medical history of at least 1 immune-mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline. 
Of these 552 participants, 5 (0.9%) reported an exacerbation (flare-up) of their pre-existing 
autoimmune disorder during the double-blind phase of the trial. Of the 15,708 participants in the FAS 
of trial COV3009 who received at least 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose level), 
458 participants had a medical history of at least 1 immune-mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline. 
Of these 458 participants, 2 (0.4%) reported an exacerbation (flare-up) of their pre-existing 
autoimmune disorder, during the double-blind phase of the trial.
Population in need of further characterization:
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders will be further characterized in the post-
authorisation safety studies COV4003 and COV4001.

Missing information: Use in frail patients with comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders)
Evidence source: 
Frail individuals, especially those with multiple comorbidities that may compromise their immune 
response, are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19. In addition, the safety profile in this 
subpopulation could vary from that seen in healthy adults. Increased age and comorbidities are the 
2 major risk factors for frailty.
Of the 65,490 participants in the cross-dose level pooling who received at least one dose of
Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 25,737 (39.3%) participants had 1 or more comorbidities associated 
with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. Of these 25,737 participants, 11,102 (43.1%) were aged 
≥60 years, 6,378 (24.8%) were ≥65 years, and 1,216 (4.7%) were aged ≥75 years.
There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in frail patients with comorbidities that 
may compromise their immune response.
Following a protocol amendment for trial COV3001 on 14 December 2020, calculation of a frailty 
index has been included to be applied to participants enrolled. Of the 19,577 participants in the Per 
Protocol set who received Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp dose level), 6 (<0.1%) were defined as frail and 
2,147 (11.0%) were defined as pre-frail. Of the 6 frail participants, 5 (83.3%) were aged ≥60 years. Of 
the 2,147 pre-frail participants, 1,338 (62.3%) were aged ≥60 years (COV3001 CSR Dec 2021).
Population in need of further characterization:
Safety data will be collected in individuals who are frail due to age or debilitating disease in trial 
COV3001, in the post-authorisation safety studies COV4003 and COV4001, in the post-authorization 
effectiveness study COV4002, and through routine pharmacovigilance.
Missing information: Interaction with other vaccines
Evidence source: 
As no interaction studies have been performed, there are no data to assess if concomitant 
administration of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine.
Population in need of further characterization:
All reports describing interactions of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines per national recommendations 
will be collected and analyzed as per routine pharmacovigilance activities. A coadministration study of 
Ad26.COV2.S with seasonal influenza vaccine (trial COV3005) is ongoing.

Missing information: Long-term safety
Evidence source: 
There are no available data on the long-term safety of Ad26.COV2.S.
Based on long-term safety data from other Ad26-based vaccines (at least 6 months up to 5 years
post-vaccination in clinical trials), no long-term safety issues have been identified (Adenoviral Vaccine 
Safety Database V7.0 2022).
Population in need of further characterization:
The long-term safety of Ad26.COV2.S is not fully known, however there are no known risks with a 
potentially late onset based on the available evidence with other Ad26-based vaccines.
Long-term safety data are being collected for at least 2 years in ongoing trials COV3001 and COV3009 
following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, and for up to 1 year in the post-authorization safety studies 
COV4003 and COV4001.
Participants of trials COV3001 and COV3009 who initially received placebo were unblinded and 
offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (crossover vaccination), since the vaccine has received an EUA 
in the United States and conditional Marketing Authorisation in the European Union/EEA. All 
participants have been encouraged to remain in the trial and will be followed for safety as originally 
planned up to 2 years from time of enrollment into study.

PART III:  PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN
(Including Post-authorisation Safety Studies)
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
The  MAH follows standard  pharmacovigilance  processes  with  regard  to  Ad26.COV2.S,  along 
with the additional actions referenced in the EU-RMP. Due to the special circumstances of the 
pandemic, enhancement of these routine activities has been undertaken. The MAH has a Global 
Safety  Database  in  place  to  manage  the  receipt,  processing,  and  reporting  of  individual  and 
aggregate  safety  data  to  regulatory  authorities,  and  to  support  pharmacovigilance activities 
including safety signal detection and ongoing evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine.
The MAH conducts both passive and active surveillance activities for continued vaccine safety 
monitoring, as further specified below.
ICSR reporting
The MAH submits ICSRs in accordance to GVP Module VI, GVP Product- or Population-Specific 
Considerations I: Vaccines for prophylaxis against infectious diseases, and the detailed guidance 
on ICSRs in the context of COVID-19 (EMA 2022b).
Follow-up for spontaneous and solicited ICSRs
ICSRs  are  followed  up  promptly  to  obtain  additional  information  relevant  to  the  report  as 
necessary  to  provide  a  complete  description  of  the  safety  event.  Two  follow-up  attempts  are 
performed for all ICSRs regardless of validity (non-valid/valid case), seriousness, expectedness, 
or  causal  relationship.  For  all  ICSRs  with  product  exposure  during  pregnancy  (regardless  of 
source,  including  literature  reports),  2  additional  follow-up  attempts  are  performed  to  obtain 
information regarding pregnancy outcome in addition to the standard 2 follow-up attempts.
The  MAH has  created  an  AESI  list  including  events  recommended  by  Brighton  Collaboration 
(SPEAC),  the  ACCESS  protocol,  the  US  CDC,  and  the  MHRA.  For  the  AESIs,  questions  are
added to the standard vaccine AE follow-up questionnaire on a case-by-case basis. 
Furthermore, the ICSR Medical reviewer retains the ability to request follow-up with phone call 
on any case, regardless of seriousness.
Literature review
Monitoring  of  the  medical  and  scientific  literature  includes  a  weekly  scheduled  search  of 
2 commercial databases (Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE).

Signal investigation
All available safety information across clinical investigations, postmarketing data, and all other 
sources of information is reviewed on a regular basis. Other sources of pertinent data may include 
nonclinical  studies,  manufacturing  and  product  quality  reports,  relevant  publications, 
epidemiology  data,  data  from  external  safety  databases,  safety-related  health  authority  and 
healthcare provider queries, and safety-related health authority communications and assessment 
reports.
Routine  aggregate  signal  detection  includes regular  surveillance  of  AE  reports  received  in  the 
Company’s  Global  Safety  Database, irrespective  of  country  of  origin,  seriousness,  medical 
confirmation, or validity. Additional reviews are performed in external databases listed below.
Key routine aggregate surveillance activities for Ad26.COV2.S are summarized in the table below:

using custom grouping of select PTs. Methods for signal detection activities include:
a) Monthly disproportionality analysis
b) Quarterly time-to-onset analysis
c) Temporal analyses are done using monthly TFA which signals changes in reporting 
patterns  for  drug-event(s)  pairs  over  time.  This  includes  review  of  reporting 
percentages by AE and AE groupings through trend analysis. TFA may be useful to 
detect  batch  issues  or  spurious  reports.  A  baseline  must  be  established  before  this 
method is maximally effective.

d) Vaccine lot disproportionality analysis: A Qlik-based application for data visualization 
of Company safety data is being implemented as a proof-of-concept methodology for 
signal detection of vaccine lot analysis every 3 months (quarterly). The dashboard may
be validated, and the methodology formalized following demonstrated success of the 
pilot(s) process and tool.
e) O/E  analysis:  Background  rates  to  support  the  O/E  analyses  are extracted  from  the 
literature. Peer-review papers are used as best evidence. In case such papers are not 
available, data generated by ACCESS (EMA-funded project) or OHDSI (FDA-funded 
collaboration) are used.
2) Data Mining Review: a review of cumulative data in external databases is performed to 
identify AEs reported disproportionately for Ad26.COV2.S relative to all other products in 
the database including:
a) EudraVigilance: quarterly data mining
b) WHO VigiBase: ad hoc data mining
c) FDA VAERS: ad hoc data mining.
3) Real  World  Data  Analytics:  The  MAH has access  to  large  US  real  world  databases  to 
monitor the exposure to Ad26.COV2.S and to conduct sequential analyses to support and 
complement  ongoing  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  to  further  contextualize 
potential safety signals in a rapid manner.
This  signal  detection  strategy  is  based  on  the  current  risk  profile  of  Ad26.COV2.S  and  is 
anticipated to evolve over time as greater understanding of the safety profile is acquired.
Traceability
The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to:


clearly record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability 
(Section 4.4);
report any suspected adverse reactions including batch/lot number if available (Section 4.8).
Traceability is available for every shipping container of JCOVDEN, which is fitted with a unique 
device  that  provides  real-time  monitoring  of  geographic  location  24 hours  per  day,  7 days  per 
week. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The device is activated 
prior to shipment and information is transmitted wirelessly to the MAH at a predefined cadence 
until  delivery  to  each  country’s  government  distribution  center.  Each  shipment  will  be 
accompanied  by  a  passive  temperature  datalogger.  Alarms  for  excursions  (per  predefined 
specifications)  are  programmed  into  the  device.  If  the  display  on  the  device  doesn’t  show  an 
alarmed status, the vaccine can be received. If the display shows an alarmed status, the product

substance) and manufacturer name.
Placeholder space for name of vaccinee.
Placeholder space for date of vaccination and associated lot number.
For EEA countries, reference to the National Reporting System for AE reporting.
 QR code and URL for additional product information.
Vaccination card use will depend on national requirements and/or national competent authority 
guidance.  Printed  vaccination  cards  available  in  a country  may  include  additional,  nationally-
required details.
For EEA countries, in addition to the vaccination cards, 2 stickers per dose containing preprinted 
vaccine brand name (without reference to pharmaceutical form and active substance), lot number,
and a 2D matrix barcode (encoding vaccine brand name and lot number) are made available to 
support documentation of the lot number on both the vaccination cards for vaccinees and in the 
vaccinee  medical  records  in  vaccination  centers.  It  is  acknowledged  that  some  countries  may 
require utilization of nationally-mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document the 
lot number; therefore, the available vaccination cards and stickers with printed lot number may not 
be utilized in all countries.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for JCOVDEN
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for JCOVDEN. The RMP details important 
risks of JCOVDEN, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about JCOVDEN’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
JCOVDEN’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how JCOVDEN should be used.
This summary of the RMP for JCOVDEN should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of JCOVDEN’s
RMP.
I.
The Vaccine and What it is Used For
JCOVDEN is authorised for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains Ad26.COV2.S as the active substance and it is given by 
intramuscular injection.
Further information about the evaluation of JCOVDEN’s benefits can be found in JCOVDEN’s
EPAR,  including in its plain-language summary,  available on the European  Medicines Agency 
website, under the vaccine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/jcovden-previously-covid-19-vaccine-
janssen.
II.
Risks Associated With the Vaccine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of JCOVDEN, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about JCOVDEN’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for vaccines can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to individuals and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the vaccine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of vaccine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
vaccine is used correctly;
The  vaccine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  vaccine is  supplied  to  the  individual (eg, with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.

Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including  Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report/Periodic  Safety  Update 
Report assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of JCOVDEN is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important  risks  of  JCOVDEN are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the vaccine can be safely administered. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of JCOVDEN. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this vaccine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the vaccine that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use 
of the vaccine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (TTS), in some 
cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely 
following vaccination with JCOVDEN and is an adverse drug reaction 
described in the SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk groups Although no clear risk factors have been identified, the cases of 
thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia reported in the 
postmarketing setting more commonly occurred in individuals aged 
<60 years.

Important Identified Risk: Guillain-Barré syndrome
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been observed very rarely 
following vaccination with JCOVDEN both in clinical trials and in the 
postmarketing setting. Similar adverse events have also been described 
following administration of other COVID-19 vaccines. Despite no clear 
biological mechanism being identified, the MAH considers the increase 
in observed versus expected ratios since authorisation to be sufficient 
evidence for a plausible association between JCOVDEN and GBS.
Guillain-Barré syndrome is an adverse drug reaction described in the 
SmPC.
There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following 
JCOVDEN vaccination. Based mainly on data from North America and 
Europe, it has been shown in literature that the GBS incidence 
increased by 20% for every 10-year increase in age; GBS is usually 
more frequent in males, with the highest incidence between 50 to 
70 years of age.

Important Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cases of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with very low platelet levels 
(<20,000 per μL) have been reported very rarely after vaccination with 
JCOVDEN, usually within the first 4 weeks after receiving JCOVDEN. 
This included cases with bleeding and cases with fatal outcome. Some 
of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of ITP.
Based on the observed imbalance in postmarketing events, ITP is an 
adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC.
Limited data from postmarketing experience with JCOVDEN, 
including literature, suggest that individuals with chronic or recurrent 
ITP may be at increased risk of developing ITP following vaccination 
with JCOVDEN.

Important Identified Risk: Venous thromboembolism
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been observed rarely following 
vaccination with JCOVDEN in clinical trials and in the postmarketing 
setting. While a higher proportion of cases of VTE was observed within 
the JCOVDEN group versus the Placebo group in trial COV3001, there 
was no increase in VTE events among individuals who received 
JCOVDEN in trial COV3009.
VTE is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC.
In trials COV3001 and COV3009, underlying risk factors have been 
identified in participants with VTE such as COVID-19, male gender, 
old age (>65 years), long-haul travel, thrombophilia, obesity, active 
malignancy, trauma, previous venous thrombosis, hypertension, and 
COPD.

Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and pericarditis
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported as rare events
following vaccination against smallpox, hepatitis B, tetanus, human-
papilloma virus, and viral influenza and have been documented for 
COVID-19 vaccines. A systemic review and meta-analysis revealed 
higher incidence of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination but 
no significant difference after influenza vaccinations compared to 
COVID-19 vaccination.
Among COVID-19 vaccines, myocarditis and/or pericarditis has been
observed with mRNA vaccines with an incidence significantly higher in 
males versus females, in people younger than 30 years, and after a 
second dose (compared to first or third dose). Additionally, a 
recombinant adjuvanted protein-based COVID-19 vaccine has been 
associated with a disproportional myopericarditis induction.
Events of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed very rarely 
following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S both in clinical trials and in 
the postmarketing setting. Real-world evidence data of US claims data 
sources showed a high level of certainty of an increased risk of 
myocarditis and pericarditis for males aged 18 to 39 years within 
28 days of vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.
Myocarditis and pericarditis are adverse drug reactions described in the 
SmPC.
Risk factors and risk groups Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in association with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Historically, myocarditis and/or pericarditis 
have been reported as a rare event following vaccination against 
smallpox, hepatitis B and viral influenza. Myocarditis and pericarditis 
have also been reported with other COVID-19 vaccines (including 
mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and a recombinant adjuvanted 
protein-based COVID-19 vaccine). Young males appear to be at 
highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose of COVID-
19 vaccination. The disease course is self-limiting in a vast majority of 
cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of symptoms and 
normalization of cardiac biomarkers, electro- and echocardiographic 
findings within days.

Important Potential Risk: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
VAED/VAERD has not been described in association with JCOVDEN
and has not been confirmed from any other late phase clinical trial of 
other COVID-19 vaccines.
For candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, no evidence of VAED or 
VAERD after intramuscular immunization has been reported to date in 
nonclinical studies or clinical trials.
Nevertheless, in the absence of long-term safety and efficacy data, the 
evidence is not yet sufficient to fully dismiss VAED, including 
VAERD as a safety concern, and it remains an important potential risk.
It is postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals 
producing lower neutralizing antibody titers or in those demonstrating 
waning immunity.

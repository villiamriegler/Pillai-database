Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 9 October 1995. 
The Rapporteur’s initial Assessment Report was circulated to all Members of the CPMP on 7 
December 1995. The Co-Rapporteur's Assessment Report was circulated to all Members of the 
CPMP on 14 December 1995. 
The CPMP consolidated list of comments was sent to the company on the 13 February 1996. 
The company submitted the responses to the first consolidated CPMP list of comments on the 8 
March 1996. 
The Rapporteur’s responses assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 12 April 
1996. The Co-Rapporteur’s responses  assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members 
on 11 April 1996. 
During the CPMP meeting on 15-17 April 1996 the clarifications given by the company were 
considered and it was proposed to have a full discussion during the May CPMP meeting and if 
necessary a hearing with the company.  
During  the  CPMP  meeting  on  the  20-23  May  1996  a  “break-out”  session  on  Olanzapine  was 
held. In this meeting a “list of outstanding issues to be answered by the company” was drafted 
and sent to the company. The clock was stopped.  
During the May CPMP meeting it was decided to convene an ad hoc expert working group in 
liaison with the Efficacy Working Party on the treatment of schizophrenia to be held on 6 June 
1996 together with a Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur meeting with the company on 7 June 1996. It 
was  also  decided  to  have  a  hearing  with  the  company  during  the  CPMP  meeting,  18-20  June 
1996. 
The expert  group made recommendations  to the CPMP  on the criteria to be considered in the 
evaluation  of  antischizophrenia  medicines  eg.  criteria  for  evaluating  negative  symptoms, 
extrapolation of efficacy results, definition of first line treatment. 
The CPMP, after the hearing with the company, discussed the Olanzapine dossier in view of the 
scientific recommendations put forward by the expert working group. Amendments were made 
accordingly to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet texts. 
The company, after having been consulted (letter dated 18 June 1996), agreed to submit to the 
EMEA chemical, pharmaceutical and clinical information requested by the CPMP. 
The CPMP on 19 June 1996 issued a positive Opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation 
for Zyprexa. 
The  Commission  issued  a  marketing  authorisation  valid  throughout  the  European  Union  for 
Zyprexa on 27 September 1996.

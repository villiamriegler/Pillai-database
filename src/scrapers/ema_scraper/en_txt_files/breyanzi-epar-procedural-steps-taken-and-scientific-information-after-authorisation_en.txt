1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and 
The efficacy information of the Product Information has 
to update efficacy information based on final results 
Annex II 
been updated with the most recent available efficacy data 
from studies 017001 and JCAR-017-BCM-001 listed 
as obligations in the Annex II. These studies aimed 
to further characterise the long-term efficacy and 
safety of Breyanzi in patients treated with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy. Study 017001 is a phase 
1, open-label, single-arm, multicohort, multicenter, 
seamless design trial, while study JCAR-017-BCM-
001 is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 
multicohort, multicenter trial. The Annex II is 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 3.0 has also 
been submitted.

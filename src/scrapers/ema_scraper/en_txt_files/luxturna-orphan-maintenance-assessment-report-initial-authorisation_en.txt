Introductory comment 
The COMP considered that the granted orphan designations “treatment of Retinitis pigmentosa” and 
“treatment of Leber Congenital Amaurosis” should be renamed under the umbrella condition of 
“inherited retinal dystrophies”. The therapeutic indication “ Luxturna is indicated for the treatment of 
adult and paediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed 
biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells” falls entirely within the condition 
“inherited retinal dystrophies”.

2. Grounds for the COMP opinions at the designation stage 
EU/3/12/981 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
Leber’s congenital amaurosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was 
made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to loss of visual acuity; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
EU/3/15/1518 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2015 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing adenovirus-associated 
viral vector serotype 2 containing the human RPE65 gene was considered justified based on 
preclinical data supporting improvements in visual function following treatment with the product; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the development of nyctalopia and tunnel vision that 
progresses to total blindness; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 3.7 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made; 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
3. Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The applicant had received two orphan medicinal product designations: “treatment of Leber’s 
Congenital Amaurosis” and “treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa”. The therapeutic indication is 
“treatment of patients with vision loss owing to autosomal recessive inherited retinal dystrophy caused 
by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells”.  
In order to establish that the therapeutic indications falls entirely within the designated indications,. 
the applicant was requested to justify the scope of the indication in writing and during an oral 
explanation before the COMP. In response, and during an oral explanation before the COMP the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/810611/2018 2.0,CURRENT,OMAR final,WR final 
Page 6/9 
 
 
applicant noted that other (than RP and LCA) clinical diagnoses have been used to describe phenotypes 
of inherited retinal dystrophy associated with biallelic RPE65 mutations, including juvenile (Lorenz et al 
2000 Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci; 41; 2735-42), early onset retinitis pigmentosa (Walia et al 2010 
Ophthalmology; 117:1190-8), early onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD) (Paunescu et al 2005 Arch 
Clin Exp Ophthalmol; 243:417-26), severe early childhood onset retinal dystrophy (SECORD) (Weleber 
et al 2011 Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci; 52:292-302), and autosomal recessive childhood-onset severe 
retinal dystrophy (arCSRD) (Gu et al 1997 Nat Genet; 2:194-7). However such diagnoses were not 
considered distinct conditions, and were generally on the basis of preferences of individual 
ophthalmologists rather than standardized phenotypic characteristics. The sponsor further posited that 
all these clinical diagnoses were in essence attenuated forms of LCA.  
The COMP acknowledged that in the field of inherited retinal dystrophies, a given mutation may give 
rise to more than one clinical phenotypes, and considered that the proposed orphan conditions should 
be combined and renamed as “inherited retinal dystrophies”, covering both syndromic and non-
syndromic retinal degenerations irrespectively of the involved mutations.  
The orphan indications were therefore reworded as “treatment of inherited retinal dystrophies” and the 
proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Retinitis pigmentosa is a highly variable disorder with some patients developing symptomatic visual 
loss in childhood and others remaining asymptomatic until mid-adulthood (Hartong et al, Lancet. 
2006;368(9549):1795). The typical course of RP is gradual development of visual field scotomas, 
acuity and symptomatic nyctalopia, preceded by ERG changes. Central retinal function declines more 
slowly (Holopigian K et al. Ophthalmology. 1996;103(3):398) and patients meet criteria for legal 
blindness by age 40 due to narrowing of visual fields (Hartong et al, Lancet. 2006;368(9549):1795). 
Retinitis pigmentosa is chronically debilitating due to the development of nyctalopia and tunnel vision 
that progresses to total blindness. 
Similarly, Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis is acknowledged to be chronically debilitating due to loss of 
visual function. Leber congenital amaurosis is the most severe kind of inherited retinal diseases 
accounting for approximately 5% of the whole retinal dystrophies and 20% of the children that study 
on blind schools. Clinical ophthalmologic findings including severe vision loss, nystagmus and ERG 
abnormalities through the first year of life (Chacon-Camacho and Zenteno, World J Clin Cases, 2015. 
3(2): p. 112-24.) 
The COMP considered that the loss of vision is a common characteristic of all inherited retinal 
dystrophies, as discussed above for RP and LCA, which justifies their chronically debilitating feature. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
With regards to Retinitis Pigmentosa, the sponsor conducted a literature review, yielding estimates of 
prevalence ranging from 0.6 to 3.3 per 10,000. The applicant cited Orphanet Report Series (January 
2018) referring to a worldwide prevalence of RP as 2.67 per 10,000. OMIM and NIH databases have 
also been searched by the applicant; they most commonly cite the prevalence estimates of 1 in 3,000 
to 1 in 5,000 (accessed 17 May 2018).  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/810611/2018 2.0,CURRENT,OMAR final,WR final 
Page 7/9 
 
 
As for Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, the applicant has conducted a literature and database (NIH, 
NORD, Orphanet) review. The papers reviewed supported a less than 1 in 10,000 estimate (please 
refer to the embedded maintenance report), while The National Institutes of Health Gene Review 
publication titled “Leber Congenital Amaurosis” (Weleber et al., last updated May 2013) quotes a 
prevalence for LCA of 2-3 per 100,000 births. Similarly, the same figures are provided by Genetics 
Home Reference (NIH) website. A prevalence of 1-2 per 100,000 births is cited in a report on Leber 
Congenital Amaurosis published by the National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD) (NORD report 
2017). The Orphanet database, provides the same values of 2.5 per 100,000 (equivalent to 0.25 per 
10,000) for estimated prevalence and birth prevalence of Leber congenital amaurosis worldwide 
(Orphanet Report Series, January 2018).  
In writing and during the oral explanation, the applicant was invited to amend the estimate accordingly 
to account for all inherited retinal dystrophies. To that end, the applicant estimated the prevalence of 
“inherited retinal dystrophies” to be approximately 3 per 10,000 with reference to a Danish 
epidemiological study (Bertelsen M, Jensen H, Bregnhoj JF, et al (2014) Prevalence of generalized 
retinal dystrophy in Denmark. Ophthalmic Epidemiol; 21:217-23). The COMP accepted this conclusion 
for the maintenance of the orphan designation. It was also considered the previously considered 
estimates for RP and LCA in the context of previous designations (approximately 3 and less than 1 in 
10,000 respectively), represented conservative approaches and were in line with the conclusions of 
this study, which was comprehensive and complete. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
For Inherited retinal dystrophies, no authorised products were identified in the EU. The sponsor noted 
that for Retinitis pigmentosa nutritional/dietary recommendations include supplementation with 
vitamin A and fish oils, modulation of light exposure and supportive treatment via rehabilitation 
centres.  (Hartong et al, Lancet. 2006;368(9549):1795). Similarly for LCA, the applicant did not 
identify any authorised products in the EU for the treatment of the condition.  Care remains supportive 
and confined to correction of refractive error, use of low vision aids and access to educational and 
work-related opportunities (Weleber et al., 2010). The COMP agreed that no authorised products 
currently exist in the EU. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable. 
4. COMP opinion adopted on 11 October 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
the orphan indications should be combined and reworded as “treatment of inherited retinal 
dystrophies”; 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/810611/2018 2.0,CURRENT,OMAR final,WR final 
Page 8/9 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
the prevalence of inherited retinal dystrophies (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be approximately 3 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to loss of vision; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Luxturna, adenovirus-associated 
viral vector serotype 2 containing the human RPE65 gene, voretigene neparvovec, EU/3/12/981 and 
EU/3/15/1518 for treatment of inherited retinal dystrophies is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

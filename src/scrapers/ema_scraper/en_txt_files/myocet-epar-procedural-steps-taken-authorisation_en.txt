Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
During the meeting on 20-22 April 1999 the CPMP considered the proposed trade name Evacet 
not acceptable. 
The procedure started on 30 July 1999. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  8  October 
1999. The Co-Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 14 
October 1999. 
During  the  meeting  on  16-18  November  1999  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of 
questions  to  be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the 
company on 19 November 1999. 
The applicant submitted the responses to the CPMP consolidated list of questions on 7 February 
2000. 
The  summary  report  of  the  inspection  carried  out  at  the  manufacturing  site  between  12-14 
January 2000 was issued on 9 February 2000. 
In  view  of  the  objection  to  the  trade  name  Evacet,  the  applicant  proposed  the  trade  name 
Myocet on 10 March 2000. 
The Rapporteur circulated the response assessment report on the company’s responses to the list 
of questions to all CPMP Members on 21 March 2000. 
The Applicant submitted on 12 April 2000 a letter of undertaking as requested by the CPMP’ 
confirming compliance with Follow-up Measures. 
During the  meeting on 11-12 April 2000 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted 
and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
Marketing Authorisation to Myocet on 12 April 2000. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Somatrogon is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents from 3 years of age with  growth 
disturbance due to  insufficient secretion of growth hormone. 
Human growth  hormone (hGH) deficiency is the  consequence of low or absent secretion of growth 
hormone from the pituitary gland. hGH  is a 191-amino-acid pituitary  protein that stimulates  the 
hepatic production and release of insulin-like growth  factor-1 (IGF-1)  into the systemic circulation.  
hGH and IGF-1 are instrumental  in the promotion of linear growth  in children, and in  the control of 
metabolism and body-mass composition in adults.   
The somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary  gland produce hGH. Secretion of hGH  is under strict 
hormonal homeostatic control. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)  and ghrelin are the most 
significant stimulators of its  production while somatostatin produces the strong inhibitory  action. 
In children, growth hormone disorder (GHD) results in inadequate circulating IGF-1 levels and is 
manifested as abnormal linear growth. Paediatric subjects develop at a slower rate than would  be 
expected based on the growth  charts. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The incidence of short stature associated with  GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4000 to 
1:10,000. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Childhood GHD can be congenital, acquired or idiopathic. Underlying causes of two of these three types 
of GHD in children have been identified.  
Children with  GHD will  not all necessarily continue their deficiency into adulthood, or at least will not 
necessarily require continuation of GH treatment  once their linear growth has reached its limit. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
In neonates, clinical presentations of congenital pituitary GHD include profound hypoglycaemia, 
hypoglycaemic seizures, prolonged jaundice, and microphallus and cryptorchidism in boys. The 
patients diagnosed at younger ages generally have more severe GHD, are more likely to suffer from 
multiple pituitary  hormone deficiencies and tend to have had more complications at birth.   
The age of presentation varies with respect to the time of onset and the degree of GHD. 
Children with  complete absence of growth hormone secretion are usually diagnosed before reaching 
the age of 3 years, whereas those with  lesser degrees of deficiency present at older ages. Although 
sharing the fundamental condition of deficiency, the paediatric population treated for their abnormal 
linear growth is clinically distinct  from the adult GHD population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 10/127 
 
 
 
The diagnosis of GHD in childhood is a multifaceted process requiring comprehensive clinical and 
auxological assessment, combined with biochemical tests of the GH-insulin-like growth  factor (IGF) 
axis, radiological evaluation and pituitary MRI. The diagnosis of severe GHD is usually straightforward, 
as there are well  defined clinical, auxological, biochemical, and radiological abnormalities. However, 
the diagnosis of moderate GHD can be associated with  normal values within  the  IGF axis and a normal 
MRI.  
In a child with slow growth,  whose history and auxology suggest GHD, testing for GH/IGF-I deficiency 
requires IGF-I/IGFBP-3 levels and GH  provocation tests after hypothyroidism has been excluded. In 
suspected isolated GHD, two  GH provocation tests (sequential or on separate days) are required. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current standard of care for paediatric GHD is daily subcutaneous (SC) injection of recombinant 
human growth hormone (rhGH). 
rhGH treatment improves growth  outcomes as demonstrated by increased height velocity and 
normalization of adult  height. rhGH treatment  also has positive effects on the metabolic consequences 
of GHD including improved body composition (fat/lean mass) and reduction in lipids (total cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides), and improvements in QoL/psychosocial aspects of paediatric GHD. 
Treatment response is assessed by measurements of height  and growth velocity and is generally 
continued until  final height,  epiphyseal closure, or both  have been recorded. Early intervention 
produces the most optimal outcome as growth potential decreases overtime. In some individuals with 
persistent GHD, rhGH therapy is continued throughout  adulthood. 
Treatment algorithms are based on the body weight of the growing child which  corrects for the  higher 
physiological need for growth  hormone during growth compared to adults.  IGF-I plasma concentrations 
should be maintained in the normal age and sex-adjusted range for safety reasons. Periodic checks of 
IGF-I levels are required because they may increase over time, even if the  growth hormone dosage 
does not  change. 
Injection frequency has been found to be positively correlated with  growth response and final height 
among children with  idiopathic GHD treated with  daily rhGH. The burden of daily administration 
contributes to nonadherence and can thus limit  the therapeutic benefits of rhGH treatment. 
Non-adherence rates vary widely depending on study methodology and non-adherence/ compliance 
definitions but  have been reported to be 36% to 49%  across a variety of studies and as high  as 66% 
when compliance is defined as taking 85%  of the  prescribed doses (missing >1 dose/week) and is 
based on used vials returned. 
Several different technological approaches to prolong the  duration of action have been evaluated 
including sustained-release preparations that  utilize microsphere encapsulation (Nutropin  Depot), 
pegylated formulations (Jintrolong),  non-covalent albumin binding  (Sogroya), prodrugs (TransCon31), 
and Fc GH fusion formulations (GX-H9, albutropin Nutropin  Depot was withdrawn by the applicant 
before a final position could be reached by the CHMP  . Currently one long-acting GH formulation has 
been approved in the  EU, Sogroya (INN somapacitan).  
Therefore, having additional long-acting  formulations would be beneficial for patients  and care givers.

2.2.  About the product 
Somatrogon (also referred to as MOD-4023)  is a long-acting  rhGH with  receptor binding properties and 
a mechanism of action analogous to hGH.  Somatrogon is a glycoprotein produced in CHO cells by 
recombinant DNA technology. It comprises the amino acid chain sequence of hGH  and one copy of the 
CTP from the beta chain of hCG at  the N-terminus and 2 copies of CTP (in tandem) at the C-terminus. 
The glycosylation and CTP domains account for the  half-life of somatrogon, which allows once-weekly 
dosing. 
Somatrogon binds to the  growth hormone (GH)  receptor and initiates a signal transduction cascade 
culminating  in changes in growth  and metabolism. Consistent with  GH signalling,  somatrogon binding 
leads to  activation of the  STAT5b signalling pathway and increases the serum concentration of 
IGF-1 was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner during treatment with  somatrogon partially 
mediating the clinical effect. As a result, GH and IGF-1 stimulate  metabolic changes, linear growth  and 
enhance growth  velocity in paediatric patients with  GHD. 
Two strengths are proposed: 24 mg and 60 mg solutions for injection in  prefilled pens, each of 1.2 ml 
volume. The recommended dose is 0.66 mg/kg body weight administered once weekly by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
This procedure is subject to  a centralised procedure. No request for an accelerated assessment, 
conditional marketing authorisation or approval under exceptional circumstances was made. Quality, 
non-clinical developmental and clinical development matters were discussed with EU  Competent 
Authorities at a national level and with  the EMA through  scientific advice/protocol assistance requests. 
The advice was followed by the applicant for the most part. 
In the quality development of somatrogon, the  applicant has applied relevant ICH and EMA/CHMP 
quality guidelines related to  the development, quality control, manufacturing and stability of 
biological/biotechnological drug substances and drug products.  
Two paediatric studies were conducted for the intended  indication. A Phase 3 registration study (CP-4-
006)  and a supportive Phase 2 dose finding  study (CP-4-004), contributed  both safety and efficacy 
data to the evaluation of somatrogon for the  proposed indication (treatment of children and 
adolescents from 3 years of age with growth  disturbance due to  insufficient secretion of growth 
hormone).

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General  information 
The INN is somatrogon. Somatrogon is a recombinant chimeric fusion protein of human growth 
hormone (hGH)  with  one copy of the C-terminal peptide (CTP) from the  β-chain of human chorionic 
gonadotropin at the N-terminus  and two copies of CTP at the C-terminus. It is produced in CHO  cells. 
The CTP domains with  multiple O-linked glycosylation sites account for an extended half-life of 
somatrogon allowing for weekly dosing. The predominant somatrogon glycoforms include the molecule 
with  15 or 16 monosialylated, core-1 O-glycans. Additionally, each CTP region contains hydroxyproline 
residues, which  range from 0-5  hydroxy additions per intact  somatrogon molecule. Somatrogon binds 
to the growth  hormone receptor and initiates  a signal transduction cascade culminating  in changes in 
growth and metabolism. 
2.4.2.1.  Manufacture,  characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Sufficient documentation has been provided to  support that all aspects of active substance (AS) 
manufacture and testing  are conducted in a satisfactory GMP environment. 
Somatrogon AS manufacturing process consists of typical upstream and downstream bioprocessing 
steps commonly seen in  recombinant protein production, with  five upstream bioprocessing steps and 
ten downstream steps. Production starts with thawing  of a vial of the working cell bank (WCB). Cells 
are expanded in flasks and culture bags before being transferred to the single use production 
bioreactor. The production bioreactor culture is then harvested and clarified. 
After clarification of the harvest, further purification  is performed via several chromatography and 
filtration  steps. After purification the active substance is formulated. At the end, the active substance is 
filtered (0.2 µm) and filled into  containers and frozen until  transported frozen to the finished product 
manufacturing site.  
In general, the manufacturing process is sufficiently well described and has adequate controls in place. 
The scale of the manufacturing process is defined by the size of the  production bioreactor 
The overall control strategy i.e. process parameters and in  process test ranges are acceptable and 
based on the process characterisation data and have been shown to lead to an active substance of the 
intended and consistent quality. 
Control of materials 
The applicant has provided a list  of all raw materials used in AS manufacture including  where in the 
process they are used. All raw materials used in upstream and downstream steps are either Ph. Eur. 
grade or testing performed on the materials is in general extensive and ensures control. No raw 
materials of human origin are used in manufacture of the  master cell bank (MCB), WCB or AS.  
Somatrogon is expressed in CHO cells. A 2-tiered master cell bank/working cell bank (MCB/WCB) 
system is in place. MCB and WCB testing  is extensive and includes confirmation of sterility, absence of 
mycoplasma, in vitro and in vivo adventitious agents testing. Test methods were suitably qualified (full 
reports were provided). Testing is in accordance with ICH Q5A. Testing also confirms cell identity and 
genetic stability / confirmation of desired genetic manipulation. The protocol for introduction  of future 
WCBs has been provided and is considered acceptable. 
Process Validation 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 13/127 
 
 
 
The somatrogon commercial manufacturing process has been validated by demonstrating that  the 
process met pre-defined acceptance criteria for performance when run within  defined process 
parameters. The acceptable ranges for the  process control parameters were defined based upon risk 
assessments and process characterisation studies as discussed in S.2.6. The validation of the 
manufacturing process is therefore adequate as the parameters tested are sufficiently supported by 
process characterisation studies and therefore relevant for ensuring control and quality of the AS. All 
process controls (i.e., process control parameters and in-process tests)  were met by all PPQ batches. 
Batch release (S.4.4) for the  PPQ lots met acceptance criteria and demonstrates batch to batch 
consistency. 
The applicant claims the  batches demonstrate that process related impurities are removed to 
acceptable safety levels.  
The hold times are adequately supported by microbial data and extensive biochemical data from 
representative small-scale studies held beyond the routine in-process hold range.  
Performance of resins and membranes over the registered lifetimes is adequately supported by small 
scale studies and at scale the  applicant will continue to  evaluate resin lifetime at scale. More cycles are 
planned for each UF/DF  membrane, these are ongoing at scale. Sufficient details of the parameters 
and respective acceptance criteria included in the ongoing validation studies are presented in the 
dossier.  
Manufacturing  process development 
Development history is presented with  clear chronological description and discussion of significant 
changes made to the manufacturing process.  
Comparative process descriptions and tables/summaries of process changes have been provided. Two 
comparability studies are presented. These studies employ an extensive panel of testing  methods and 
acceptably demonstrate comparability between processes. In response to a D120 query, additional 
data from comparability studies from earlier processes was provided as some of these batches were 
used in early clinical studies. Overall, the applicant has provided adequate details of all comparability 
studies conducted to support that  the material used in clinical studies is comparable. 
The applicant provided extensive details of the  extractables studies conducted with  the  contact 
material during active substance manufacturing that were identified as high risk components following 
a risk assessment No extractable compounds were observed, the data provided is considered 
acceptable.  
The applicant has provided a detailed overview of how their  process and its  control strategy have been 
developed. Extensive process characterisation data is presented. The overall approach for process 
characterisation is stepwise and included evaluation of historical data, risk assessments to define 
characterisation study design, establishment of quality target ranges (QTRs) for relevant critical quality 
attributes  (CQAs), assessment of suitability of scale-down models and execution of process 
characterisation studies. This approach is endorsed and the classification of critical process parameters 
(CPPs) is clearly based upon an understanding  of the CQAs of the  molecule as well  as an understanding 
of the manufacturing process, its process parameters and material attributes.  The acceptable ranges 
and criticality classifications are in general acceptable and the ranges registered in  S.2.2 have been 
adequately justified by the process characterisation studies. 
Characterisation 
A broad and adequate panel of analytical methods was used to  evaluate primary structure, post-
translational modifications, charge and size heterogeneity, higher order structure, and biological 
activity of somatrogon AS, and no further characterisation tests  are requested. The process-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

impurities are identified.  No testing of these impurities is proposed during routine in-process testing, 
as noted above this is considered to be acceptable as the  toxicological risk is considered negligible. The 
product-related impurities are adequately controlled through AS release and stability specifications. 
The characterisation is robust and has adequately covered the main attributes  of the  active substance. 
Tests used in  the characterisation were as follows. 
2.4.2.1.  Specification 
The proposed panel of release tests for somatrogon AS at release and during long-term stability 
studies covers identity, quantity,  purity, potency, and microbial assurance. In general, the panel of 
tests are in  line with ICH Q6B and are considered appropriate for routine control of somatrogon AS.   
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical method descriptions include details of reagents, sample preparation, operating 
conditions, and system suitability tests (SSTs) and are considered acceptable. From the method 
descriptions presented, it is clear how the data is interpreted, the results calculated and how system 
suitability  is ensured for each method with suitable acceptance criteria for all test  samples and control 
samples.  
In development a rat weight gain assay was used and transitioned to  the cell based assay (CBA) for 
potency  
The proposed specifications are clearly linked to the manufacturing process data obtained throughout 
development including  data obtained from batches used in the  pivotal clinical studies using the 
commercial manufacturing process and earlier batches used in preclinical and early clinical studies, 
demonstrating manufacturing consistency. Stability batches were also considered when setting  the 
specifications. The applicant has shown no discernible trends over time when stored at the proposed 
condition on attributes,  thereby supporting  the criteria being the same at release and on stability. The 
approach used to set the specifications is clearly presented, including details of how the tolerance 
intervals (TI) are calculated. A list of batches used for the establishment of specifications is presented, 
highlighting  what  batches were including in the  statistical analyses using TI and the batches that  were 
included as supportive data for clinical exposure reference and manufacturing history, not used in 
tolerance interval analysis. The specifications are considered acceptable.  
The history of all reference standard material throughout development of somatrogon is present in the 
dossier and considered acceptable. The information provided is considered acceptable, traceability 
between primary and working reference standard as well as between current and future working 
standards (through the primary standard) is ensured. 
Batch analysis  
The applicant has provided a summary table of all AS batches manufactured during  development and 
indicates their use (toxicology/nonclinical studies, exact number of clinical studies, stability and 
process validation). The dates of release of these batches range from 2008 to 2019.  Different release 
tests were employed throughout development and sufficient analytical method bridging studies is 
presented and discussed in  S.2.6. Results, specifications and test methods applicable at the time of 
release are clearly presented. All batches met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of testing. 
Batch-to-batch consistency is demonstrated, including  the patterns of heterogeneity (charge variants 
and glycan content).  The results for the tests for purity, impurities and product-related substances are 
largely consistent throughout  development.  
Container closure 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 15/127 
 
 
 
Somatrogon AS is filled into  1 L sterile, transparent polyethylene terephthalate co-polymer G (PETG) 
bottles with  screw closures. The choice of the container/closure is justified and supported by 
pharmacopoeial compliance of the  materials and stability data for the AS which  is stored in PETG 
bottles. The bottles are supplied sterile.  
2.4.2.1.  Stability 
In terms of time points,  temperature conditions and the type of testing performed, stability  studies are 
performed in accordance with ICH guidance. The proposed shelf-life for somatrogon AS is 36  months at 
the recommended storage condition is endorsed.  
Data from a total of ten batches is presented to support the long-term storage conditions. The studies 
will continue  through the 60-month  time point.  In addition to the tabulated summary results for each 
batch, the applicant  has presented figures for all long-term batch  data allowing  for ease of assessment 
of data over time. All batches remained within  specification over the course of the long-term stability 
studies with  no discernible trends observed. The data support that  the AS is very stable and the data 
do not give rise to any concern that  the AS would go out of specification by 36  months. As sufficient 
real time data is available for the commercial site the proposed shelf life of 36 months  is considered 
acceptable.   
Results from the  accelerated conditions showed that  excursions above the recommended storage 
condition up to  5 ± 3 °C are acceptable for up to 6 months and excursions above the recommended 
storage condition  up to 25±2  °C/60±5% RH  are acceptable for up  to 2 weeks.  
Freeze-thaw data was provided for one batch that  underwent three cycles of freeze-thaw cycles and no 
change in product quality was noted through 36 months.  It is agreed that somatrogon AS may undergo 
up to 3 freeze-thaw cycling temperature excursions during the 36-month  shelf life.  
The applicant also demonstrated on one primary batch that  AS is photo-labile at  the ICH photostability 
conditions.  
The post-approval stability protocol has been provided and is aligned with ICH Q1A and thus 
considered acceptable. Post-approval, one batch will be placed on annual stability  and tested.  The 
stability-indicating  tests are included and considered suitable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the  product and pharmaceutical development 
Ngenla is presented as a solution for injection containing  24 mg in 1.2  ml (20  mg/ml) or 60 mg in 1.2 
ml (50 mg/ml)  of somatrogon as active substance for subcutaneous injection.  
Other ingredients are: trisodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, L-histidine,  sodium 
chloride, m-Cresol, poloxamer 188 and water for injection. Excipients are all commonly used in 
parenteral biological medicinal products and comply with  their respective European Pharmacopoeia 
monographs.   
The product is available in a 3 ml Type 1 clear glass cartridge enclosed in a single-patient, multiple-use 
disposable prefilled pen (PFP).  Together they form a single integral product intended exclusively for 
use in the given combination. The target fill  volume for both  the 24 mg/1.2  ml and 60 mg/1.2 ml 
cartridges is 1.519  mL which includes an overfill of 0.319  ml to ensure a nominal volume of 1.2 ml is 
available.  
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 16/127 
 
 
 
Each pen presentation contains multiple  doses of somatrogon finished product solution. The dose is 
variable, set within  the range of 10 to  600 µl using a manual dial dose setting  mechanism. The 
healthcare provider will  prescribe the most appropriate strength of product from the  two available 
presentations, based on the dose which is defined by a patient’s body-weight.  
The prefilled pen is provided without  needles, which  must be procured separately, but are referenced 
in the SmPC. Compatibility studies have been performed with 31G x 8 mm (BD Micro-Fine),  31G x 
5mm (BD Micro-Fine),  31G x 6 mm (NovoFine) and 32G x 4mm (NovoFine).  The 31G x 8 mm and 32G 
x 4 mm needles were selected as worst-case for the study with  respect to potential  to influence flow 
resistance and finished product quality attributes.  To simulate conditions  of normal use, PFPs were 
cycled weekly, five times, between 30ºC  (for four hours) and 2-8ºC (for rest of the week). After 28 
days the finished product solution  (FPS) was expelled through either a 31G x 8 mm or 32G x 4 mm 
pen needle for analysis of pre-defined quality attributes.  Control samples were expelled from the pen 
without  a needle attached. All assay results met predetermined expected results and there was no 
significant change in tested parameters at the final timepoint.  The assay results are highly comparable 
for both needles, therefore only the 31G x 8 mm needle was chosen for the remaining studies.  
The impact of weekly simulated doses over the 28-day in-use period was also evaluated. The 24 mg 
(lot 3ET1900074)  and 60 mg (lot 3ET1900075)  PFPs were cycled weekly, five times, between 30ºC and 
2-8ºC. After each 4-hour hold at  30ºC, a dose was simulated by attaching  a new 31G x 8 mm needle 
and expelling a dose of 240 µl  from the PFP.  All assays were tested at  the initial and last timepoint  and 
a selection of stability indicating  assays were tested at interim timepoints.  All results met 
predetermined expected results and there were no significant changes in  tested parameters at the  final 
timepoint.  The concentration of m-Cresol was maintained throughout  the 28-day in-use period and 
resealability of the cartridge met the  requirements of ISO 11608-2:  2012.  Studies on post-expiry PFPs 
were also performed and all results remained within  acceptance criteria. It is therefore endorsed that 
the formulation and container closure system support the safe use of FPS throughout  the shelf life and 
in-use period of the finished product. Updated results from ongoing leachables studies in the 
commercial container closure over shelf life have been requested. 
There is no overage of active substance.  
The formulation has been developed based on extensive formulation studies,  and the  proposed 
commercial formulation has been used in pivotal clinical studies.  For early clinical trials the  product 
was presented as a frozen liquid in a vial, but  for the phase 3 paediatric clinical studies the preserved 
liquid formulation was developed. A concentration of 10 mg/ml somatrogon FPS was included in  the 
clinical studies but has not been selected for onward commercial development, however it has been 
used in supportive stability  and development studies.  
Antimicrobial Effectiveness Testing for m-Cresol does not comply with the  Ph. Eur.  5.1.3 criteria A for 
parenteral products at the lower limit  proposed at the end of shelf life. The applicant proposes that 
criteria B is a more appropriate standard for this  multi-use product and has justified this on the basis 
that  the product is intended for weekly administration,  so the  initial timepoint  of 6 hours from Criteria 
A is less relevant. In addition it  is not possible to increase further the  concentration of m-Cresol in  the 
finished product formulation. This justification is accepted.

The use of poloxamer 188 as a stabiliser is supported by freeze/thaw studies. In addition, the applicant 
has studied the impact of differing levels of silicone on glass cartridges. After 3 months  storage at 2-
8ºC there was no significant  impact on quality parameters, stability profile or functional performance 
observed.  
Photostability studies on the bulk finished product solution  have been performed in accordance with 
ICH and there are no changes to quality parameters observed following exposure to light levels that 
are representative of product exposure during routine manufacture. Therefore, no specific precautions 
are required during filling  to protect the product from light.   
Changes to  the product and manufacturing process throughout the  clinical development programme 
are clearly outlined in  the dossier. The change from frozen vial to single-patient use pen is supported 
by a comprehensive analytical comparability assessment. In addition,  a relative bioavailability study 
(CP-4-011)  was conducted and demonstrated bioequivalence for the two  formulations with  the 
exception of Cmax (not  considered to be clinically significant because IGF-1  exposure was 
bioequivalent).  
The applicant has provided a comprehensive overview of the pharmaceutical development of this 
medicinal product combined with  an integral medical device. The cartridge and pen are pre-assembled 
and intended for single-patient, multiple use.  
The applicant included a Notified  Body Opinion on the device constituent  (PFP), in  accordance with 
Article 117 of the Medical Device Regulation, confirming full  compliance with  the relevant GSPRs.  
The QTPP for the prefilled pen is considered appropriate. Pen assembly is an automated process and 
the commercial process remains unchanged from earlier clinical and stability processes. Before use, 
the patient  or healthcare professional is required to prime the pen in order to  expel air and ensure 
accurate dosing. The product information includes detailed instructions  for the  patient on how this  dose 
priming is to be achieved. The pen assembly is checked (factory priming) to  ensure that the  plunger 
stopper is correctly positioned to  enable user-priming to be performed. The applicant confirms that 
dose accuracy testing  is performed on each dosing mechanism batch received from the supplier 
(supported by results of a study which demonstrate that the  assembly process does not impact on 
dose accuracy testing  of the  PFP).   
A process characterisation study examined the effects of mechanical stress (shock, vibration, rotation) 
and time out of refrigeration (TOR) on the finished product (also referred to as DP) due to the 
assembly process. Additional mechanical stresses at the  maximum permitted TOR hours were 
evaluated. All results met acceptance criteria demonstrating that  the assembly process does not 
impact on the quality of the FPS. Container closure integrity results confirm that the  assembly process 
does not  compromise the integrity of the cartridge.  
The somatrogon PFP has been developed based on existing platform technology. The pen is supplied 
pre-assembled with needles to  be sourced separately. The needles named in the Instructions for Use 
include Becton Dickinson BD MicroFine  (or UltraFine)  (31 gauge), NovoNordisk NovoFine (31  gauge) 
and NovoFine plus (32 gauge), all with  a length  of 8 mm. 
Design verification studies were performed on the commercial pen presentation using  a surrogate 
solution to  demonstrate that  the design outputs meet the input  requirements. Data has been 
presented which  confirms that  the surrogate solution  can be considered as representative of the 
somatrogon finished product solution. 
Design verification studies have been performed and this includes dose accuracy testing and needle 
compatibility testing  for the  needle types specified in the Instructions For Use. The fill volume of the 
cartridge was finalised post-design verification, and so confirmatory studies were also performed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

ensure that  a cartridge could deliver the nominal volume of 1.2 ml.  Functional characteristics testing 
demonstrated that at room temperature functionality  of the  pen meets acceptance criteria (force to 
remove and replace pen cap injection button  (axial) force). Extrusion of the FPS through  the 
recommended needles was evaluated and results confirm that  there is no impact on FPS quality 
attributes  following injection through one of the four named needle types. 
A user capability study confirmed that  the axial force was possible for a range of subjects aged 10 and 
older. Syringeability (maximum force and extrusion force) have also been confirmed. The human 
factors validation test  has taken into account changes in pen design following  clinical study CP-4-006 
and no changes were considered to  impact pen performance data.  
A comprehensive hazard analysis by FMEA  has identified  and considered potential  risk to the  design of 
the process. Overall, the applicant has considered all relevant aspects of design of the device and its 
appropriateness for use with  the finished product.  
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
Manufacturing  sites are adequately supported by valid MIA or GMP certificates as verified on 
EudraGMPD. 
The manufacturing process for finished product manufacture is an aseptic filling process with  sterile 
filtration  immediately prior to  filling.  
There are two  batch sizes registered for the FPS, which  are adequately supported by validation data. 
Acceptable ranges for input  process controls (CPPs, non-CCPs, CMAs) and control limits/ acceptance 
criteria for output  process controls (IPTs) are registered in the  dossier for each unit operation. 
Reworking is not permitted  but reprocessing is proposed during pre-hold filtration  or storage in the 
event of the  bioburden reducing filter failing to meet the post-use integrity test.  The filter integrity  test 
is reported as a ‘pass’ or ‘fail’, Refiltration  is supported by qualification studies where a double 
refiltration of 50 mg/ml FPS demonstrated no impact to  product quality. In addition, the applicant has 
provided additional information on the steps taken in the event of filter integrity  failure of one of the 
filters in sequence.  
The control strategy for somatrogon FPS includes ongoing monitoring and controls to ensure a 
continuous state of control, and combines input  material controls, in-process testing, batch  records, 
release testing and process monitoring. Methods  for in-process tests  are adequately. Following  a query 
raised at D180, the  applicant assigned an acceptance/rejection limit of Not More Than 10 CFU/100  mL 
for the bioburden test  prior to the  sterilising step (sterile filtration  of bulk drug product solution  for 
both 20  mg/ml and 50  mg/ml).  
Process validation was performed on consecutive PPQ batches manufactured at commercial scale; 
three batches for each strength  of product (20 and 50 mg/ml). All PPQ batches met the pre-defined 
acceptance criteria as per the validation protocol. The applicant has used a traditional approach for PV, 
testing  unit operations at the upper and lower limits  of the range for relevant process parameters. 
Process verification will continue  throughout the  lifecycle of the  product.  
Process development studies support the CPPs. Hold  time studies have been performed to establish 
hold times for active substance, bulk finished product and finished product solution.  Studies were 
performed initially at laboratory scale and verified at commercial manufacturing scale on two  lots of 
FPS during process qualification. A summary of the results of the  full scale maximum hold time 
challenge study have also been provided for review. Hold  times registered as CPPs have additionally 
been validated on three PPQ batches and demonstrate that  at the upper limit of hold time there is no 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 19/127 
 
 
 
impact on product quality. A summary of the results of the  hold time studies for full scale PPQ batches 
at maximum challenged hold times has been provided.   
The filter for sterile filtration is supported by shear stress testing  studies which demonstrate that  even 
under worst-case operating conditions the FPS is not impacted by filtration shear-induced aggregation. 
Filter  validation studies on PPQ batches have demonstrated that  the PVDF filter is appropriate for 
bioburden reduction and sterile filtration  of the  bulk FPS. 
Media fill runs met the protocol acceptance criteria and support the maximum filling times for the 
larger batch size. Requalification is performed twice annually. 
NORs and PARs for the  CPPs are adequately supported by PQ studies. Shipping and handling  conditions 
have been extensively and comprehensively studied and the applicant  has demonstrated that the  FPS 
is stable to agitation during transportation.  The impact of x-ray exposure during transportation has 
been evaluated and there is no impact on product stability.  
The immediate cartridge container closure system (type 1 glass, elastomeric plunger stopper) complies 
with  relevant Ph. Eur. monographs. Extractable studies have been performed and potential  leachables 
identified are being monitored as part of ongoing process validation under real time storage conditions 
using qualified methods. Data has been presented to the 12  month timepoint  and is acceptable. 
Each batch of prefilled pens is manufactured from a single batch of cartridges (which  may be pooled 
from more than one batch of finished product solution).  Reprocessing has been described at two unit 
operations – pen assembly and packaging and is supported by validation. In-process tests are 
registered and are considered sufficient to control the  assembly and packaging process. Three process 
validation lots are presented at  the upper, lower and middle of the  batch size range. Each PV lot 
included one reprocessing step and all batches passed acceptance criteria, demonstrating that  the 
manufacturing process is consistently able to  manufacture prefilled pens of appropriate quality. 
Shipping validation supports the transport of prefilled pens by road freight or by air. Simulated 
transportation studies under controlled temperature and pressure conditions representing worst case 
support that  the quality attributes  of the  finished product solution  or the  functionality aspects of the 
prefilled pen are not  adversely impacted by distribution  conditions. Container closure integrity  testing 
passed acceptance criteria demonstrating integrity of the container closure system during transport. 
Passive temperature thermal conveyance studies were performed on representative finished product.  
Overall, the applicant has adequately described the manufacturing and control of this appropriately 
validated manufacturing process for both the cartridge and the prefilled pen.  
For the finished product specification, the applicant has presented a panel of release tests which are in 
accordance with ICHQ6B, Ph. Eur. 01/2012:2031  Monoclonal antibodies for Human  use and Ph. Eur. 
04/2015:0520  Parenteral Preparations. Each method has a reference to the monograph where 
relevant, and includes a unique code linking to the  laboratory method. Tests are included for identity, 
appearance, pH, osmolality, protein concentration, potency, particulates, impurities and microbiological 
characteristics: endotoxin and sterility. 
Analytical procedures are described in  the dossier. Pharmacopoeial methods are described with 
reference to their Ph. Eur. monograph. For the most part descriptions of non-pharmacopoeial methods 
are brief but do include sufficient detail on key operating conditions. System suitability  parameters and 
assay acceptance criteria are also registered. It is therefore accepted that sufficient detail has been 
registered for non-pharmacopoeial methods. The method capability during the validation of methods is 
described by total analytical error limits. 
Non-compendial methods have been validated in accordance with ICHQ2(R1).  Compendial methods 
which were verified and confirmed as suitable for use. Verification of the sterility method was 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 20/127 
 
 
 
performed in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.6.1  and demonstrated that  the FPS does not  have 
bacteriostatic or fungistatic  activity which interferes with the  method. Method verification of the 
endotoxin test, in accordance with  Ph. Eur. 2.6.14,  confirmed that  the FPS does not interfere with the 
method either by inhibition  or enhancement.  
Batch data has been provided for a number of batches manufactured from the  different DP 
manufacturing processes. All batches met specifications in place at time of release and meet 
commercial acceptance criteria. 
No additional impurities were described other than those identified in the active substance. An 
elemental impurities  risk assessment has been performed in accordance with ICH Q3D. Quantitative 
elemental impurity  screening by ICP-MS was performed on PPQ batches and all 24 elements from 
ICHQ3D were below the control threshold. This is considered sufficient assurance that there are no 
elemental impurities  of concern in the finished product.  
A comprehensive risk assessment has been performed to identify potential risk factors for nitrosamine 
formation in the active substance, finished product solution  and primary packaging processes. No risk 
of nitrosamine formation was identified. 
The applicant justifies the proposed release and stability  specifications on the basis of the control 
strategy and the  QTPP, pharmacopoeial requirements and manufacturing experience from other 
products. Specifications have been set based on a number of different finished product solution lots 
including clinical lots,  early phase frozen liquid  vials, and PV batches from the intended commercial 
process. Early clinical batches in vials have been used as supportive data for clinical exposure 
references but not used in tolerance interval analysis. If significant degradation trends are observed on 
storage, then  different limits  will apply to release and stability  criteria. Otherwise both release and 
stability data are used for specification setting  to reflect manufacturing process and assay variability. 
The same limit  will be applied for release and stability  acceptance criteria. This approach is considered 
justified as the stability data provides more opportunities  to quantify assay variability whereas release 
data provides more information on process variability due to the larger number of datasets for batches 
at release. 
While the specifications have been justified in general, a number of specifications were further tightened 
throughout  the procedure. 
The  applicant  is recommended to  re-evaluate the  end  of  shelf life  and  in-use acceptance criteria  after 
the  full  in-use  dataset  is  available, and  submit  this  to  the  Agency  by  Q3  2023  when  the  analysis is 
complete (see Recommendation). 
The  proposed  potency  limits  for  release and  end  of  shelf  life  were  tightened  reflecting  a  change  in 
specification setting  approach and is  in  line  with  the  observed minimum  and maximum values to  date 
during long-term stability.   
2.4.3.1.  Stability of the product 
The applicant claims a shelf life of 36  months at 2-8ºC based on stability  studies performed in 
accordance with ICH guidelines, using container closure systems identical  to those registered for 
routine storage. The analytical methods used in the  stability monitoring programme are the same as 
those used for release testing. The stability indicating  nature of the tests has been verified and testing 
intervals registered in the dossier are in accordance with  ICH Q5A and are acceptable.  
The approach to base stability  of commercial material using data from an earlier process is accepted 
considering that  comparability of the active substance has been demonstrated. All results are within 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 21/127 
 
 
 
acceptance criteria for all batches at all timepoints. Overall, it  is agreed that the stability  of the DP over 
long-term storage conditions  has been demonstrated and support the claimed shelf life of 36 months.   
In addition to real-time studies the applicant has performed studies under accelerated, thermal stress 
and thermal cycling conditions. 
For accelerated studies at 25°C and 30°C, all quality attributes  for the  four primary and two secondary 
lots remained within  specification limits at the  1-month interval These results confirm the stability 
indicating  nature of the test  methods and also support temporary temperature excursions up to 
30°C/75%  RH for up to 1 month. As out of specification results were noted after one week of storage 
at 40°C/75%  RH, it  is agreed that excursions above 30ºC cannot be supported.  
Thermal cycling studies moving between freezer / room temperature and refrigerated conditions 
replicate temperature excursions which may occur during use.  
The proposed in-use conditions for the  patient are 28  days at 2-8°C. The pen should be returned to the 
refrigerator after each weekly SC injection, and there is no provision for long term in-use storage 
outside of refrigerated conditions. However, in-use stability studies support that  the finished product 
can be stored for up  to 4 hours at 25ºC before returning to 2-8°C,  for up to  six cycles, this  wording is 
reflected in the  SPC.  
As an x-ray scanner is used for routine detection of headspace volume during  the filling process, the 
applicant has additionally studied the impact of exposure to x-ray on quality  attributes over the shelf 
life of the product. To date up to  12 months data is available for the 24 mg and 60 mg FPS post-x-ray 
exposure under real-time storage conditions and all results remain within  specification. Excursions 
above the recommended storage condition up to  25±2 °C/60±5%  RH are allowable for up to 2 weeks 
after exposure to x-ray. As this is sufficiently supported by data, it is considered acceptable.   
Photostability has been evaluated in an ICH compliant study and it is confirmed that  the finished 
product solution is not  photolabile. There is no requirement for a warning to protect from light  in the 
product information. Overall, the applicant has demonstrated a logical and comprehensive approach to 
evaluation of stability  of the  finished product under real time  and in-use storage conditions. Additional 
data has been provided and it is concluded that  the requested shelf life of 36  months at 2-8ºC can be 
accepted. 
Stability data has been presented for two  lots each of 24 mg and 60 mg somatrogon prefilled pen on 
primary stability, and 1 lot  each of 24 mg and 60 mg are on additional stability.  Primary stability refers 
to the formal stability studies from which stability data are submitted  for the purpose of establishing a 
shelf life and is generated using  the clinical presentation of the pen. The additional stability studies 
support the proposed shelf life and are from the commercial presentation of the pen. The primary 
studies are complete, and the additional studies remain ongoing. Results for all batches of primary 
stability lots  were within  acceptance criteria and support a 36-month  shelf life at 2-8°C.  There are no 
significant changes in appearance or function of the pen, confirming that  the pen remains within  the 
acceptance limits when  stored at the  recommended storage condition of 2-8°C  throughout  the 
proposed shelf life. Three months data from the  additional stability lots also show no change compared 
to primary lots tested,  supporting the position that  the clinical presentation pen is fully representative 
of the commercial presentation pen. Results for accelerated studies at  25°C and 30°C show that  all 
parameters comply with  acceptance conditions, confirming that  pen functionality  is maintained at 
elevated temperatures. Results through  36 months for the pen primary lots for in-use testing  showed 
no significant changes in appearance or functional attributes  through the study, supporting  an in-use 
shelf life of 28 days. Results from thermal stress studies show no significant  change when exposed to 
40ºC for 2 weeks, or to -5°C for 3 months, confirming that pen functionality  is maintained at 
excursions in temperature above or below the recommended storage condition. Thermal cycling study

results are also presented in the dossier and confirm that pen functionality  is maintained at short-term 
temperature excursions both  above and below the recommended storage conditions.  
Stability testing  on functional properties of the assembled pen were performed.  The studies show that 
the applied procedures are suitable and confirm the performance of the  pen.The available data support 
functional performance of the  pen through  to 36 months  when stored at the  recommended storage 
condition of 2-8°C with  an in-use period of 28 days during the shelf-life during shelf life.  
2.4.3.1.  Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of animal and/or human origin introduced during routine manufacture of 
somatrogon. As required, a risk assessment of the transmission of BSE from materials of animal origin 
used in the culture and banking of the  host cell line has been performed and concludes that the risk 
posed for potential BSE infectious agent introduction is low.  The risk assessment identifies the control 
elements in place (including  the manufacturer quality system, source of starting materials/tissue 
collection process, scientific knowledge, passage number, viral testing  and process clearance capacity) 
to reduce the  risk of transmission of TSE agent or virus. It is agreed that  the risk of transmission of 
BSE is minimal. 
Non-viral agents (mycoplasma, bioburden) are controlled through  AS in process testing  using Ph. Eur. 
methods that  have been verified as fit for purpose. 
The programme of testing  for the  MCB, WCB and End of production (EOP) limit  of in  vitro cell age 
(LIVCA) for virus contamination  was conducted as per ICH Q5A and is discussed in S.2.3,  the cell 
banks are free from viral contamination apart from Type A retrovirus which are commonly observed in 
CHO cells.  
Viral clearance studies have been performed using small scale models. The small-scale model are 
sufficiently described and are deemed suitably qualified. The conditions  used during the  studies reflect 
the conditions of the commercial-scale process described in section S.2.2  and characterised as 
described in section S.2.6. Each step has been evaluated at the  worst case; i.e. where less viral 
removal / clearance would rationally be expected. Four steps of the purification process were 
evaluated, with  three model viruses. The applicant has justified the choice of model viruses based on 
their physical properties and infectious abilities. It is agreed that the  chosen viruses represent relevant 
models, which  possibly may contaminate AS due to rodent origin of cell lines, and as per the relevant 
EMA and ICH guidelines include viruses that show the  robustness of the process and the ability to 
remove and/or inactivate other viruses exhibiting a range of biochemical and biophysical properties  
The data provided ensure the viral and adventitious agent risk associated with  somatrogon is 
negligible.   
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The active substance somatrogon is a C-terminal peptide (CTP)-modified recombinant human growth 
hormone that  binds to the growth  hormone receptor and initiates  a signal transduction  cascade 
culminating  in changes in growth  and metabolism. Somatrogon is manufactured in a CHO cell line.  The 
description of the  manufacturing process and process controls is considered adequate. The active 
substance manufacturing process is sufficiently controlled to ensure routine production of material that 
meets the intended quality and that  is representative of material used in the clinical development 
programme. The active substance is adequately characterised using a suite of appropriate analytical 
tests. The proposed active substance release tests are acceptable. Analytical procedures are well 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 23/127 
 
 
 
described and shown to be fit for purpose. Batch release data has been provided and adequately show 
that  the commercial process in capable of producing an active substance within  specifications. A two 
tiered reference standard system is in place. The container closure system is acceptable. The proposed 
active substance shelf life of 36  months is adequately supported by real time data and thus  endorsed.  
The material has been shown to  be acceptably safe from an adventitious agents and viral safety 
perspective.   
The finished product is presented as a solution for SC injection  in a pre-filled pen at concentrations of 
24 mg/1.2  ml or 60 mg/1.2  ml. The product is formulated using widely used excipients and includes 
m-Cresol as preservative. A comprehensive overview has been provided detailing the pharmaceutical 
and development of the product from early clinical trial formulations of 10 mg/ml frozen liquid  in a vial 
to the current 20 mg/ml  or 50 mg/ml solution  for injection in a multi-dose pre-filled pen for SC 
administration. The product is manufactured under GMP and the process consists of receipt and mixing 
of formulated AS and sterile filtration  and filling. The process is well  characterised. Process validation 
data supports the proposed process. Release and stability  specifications ensure adequate control of the 
product. It is considered that  the process control strategy sufficiently guarantees consistent  and 
satisfactory quality/performance of the product. The analytical methods are suitably validated. The 
primary packaging is adequately described, and the cartridges are supplied sterile. The product 
appears to be stable and safe for use for the  proposed shelf life of 36 months at 5˚C  and for 28 days 
at 2-8ºC  with removal at weekly intervals for sub-cutaneous injection. The device is appropriately 
supported by a Notified  Body Opinion confirming full compliance with  the relevant GSPR from annex 1 
of Regulation (EU) 2017/745.   
Overall, the somatrogon quality dossier is of high  quality and the documentation provided for the 
manufacture, control and stability  of the  active substance and finished product are sufficiently detailed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality  development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
-  the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the end of shelf life and in-use acceptance criteria after 
the full in-use dataset is available and submit this  to the Agency by Q3 2023 when the  analysis is 
complete. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical package includes comparative in vitro pharmacology studies, comparing somatrogon 
to another recombinant human growth hormone, somatropin (Bio-Tropin), with respect to binding 
affinity, induction  of cell proliferation and STAT5b phosphorylation. In vivo, the  ability of somatrogon 
to induce weight  gain and IGF-1 in  both normal and hypophysectomized rats was also compared to 
Assessment report

somatropin. Secondary pharmacodynamics were assessed in a panel of in vitro off-target receptor 
binding assays. Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were not conducted but  standard safety 
pharmacology endpoints were included in the repeat-dose toxicology studies. Single and repeat-dose 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and rhesus monkeys following sub-
cutaneous administration of somatrogon. The toxicokinetics and immunogenicity of somatrogon were 
also assessed in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies in  rats and monkeys and in the pivotal 
embryo-foetal development study in rats. Non-pivotal single dose toxicology studies were conducted in 
rats and monkeys and GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies were also conducted in rats and 
monkeys, with  dosing up  to 4 weeks in rats and both 4-week and 26-weeks dosing periods in 
monkeys. The sponsor provided a justification for the absence of a chronic repeat-dose toxicity study 
in a second species. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted to support this 
biologic medicinal product, in  line with relevant guidance. However, due to  concerns regarding 
potential carcinogenic effects of growth factors, a carcinogenicity assessment was conducted. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in rats covering all stages of the 
reproductive cycle. The sponsor provided a justification for the absence of a segment II study in a 
second species. Stand-alone local tolerance studies have not been conducted, but local tolerance has 
been evaluated at the injection sites in repeat-dose toxicology studies. The sponsor has provided a 
justification for the absence of ERA studies. 
The data submitted were assessed on the legal basis of the application, applicable guidelines and other 
scientific criteria and was found to be acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro  
Primary pharmacodynamic data indicate that  the rat and rhesus monkey are pharmacologically 
relevant species. The binding affinity of somatrogon to GHR is approximately 2-fold lower in rhesus 
monkey in comparison to human receptors, but  the difference in somatrogon binding  affinity between 
human and rat GHR was not statistically significant.  Literature data (Vottero et al. 2003)  showed that 
human GHR and rhesus monkey GHR exhibit 94.1%  similarity in  protein sequence. For rat and human 
GHR, there is 68.9% comparability in the amino acid sequence (Baumbach et al. 1989). The essential 
residues of the hGHR that  interact with  the hGH (R43,  W104, E127,  K167, W169,  and N218 receptor 
residues as reported by De Vos et al. 1992)  are conserved in rhesus monkeys, while four amino acids 
out of six are conserved in rats. Results from a sequence alignment  analysis support this statement 
regarding the reported similarities between rat and human Growth Hormone-Binding Protein as well as 
between rhesus monkey and human Growth Hormone-Binding Protein.  
In order to enable comparability between somatropin and somatrogon, the  concentration of the  latter 
was calculated based on its hGH content.  In some studies, the hGH content  of 72.6% was used for the 
total dose, that  is related to the glycosylated product. In other studies, 72.6%  hGH was related solely 
to the protein backbone, i.e. excluding glycans, which  is equal to 57.8%  hGH in the  glycosylated 
product, corresponding to the  equimolar, both methods reflect similar hGH content  relative to 
somatrogon (72.6%  of 30,469  Da or 57.8% of 38,254  Da).  
Of note, the binding affinity  of somatrogon is 8-13-fold lower than the binding  affinity of somatropin 
for hGHR. Similarly, somatropin induced cell proliferation approximately 33-43-fold more potently than 
Assessment report

somatrogon in  vitro and somatrogon-induced STAT5b phosphorylation required higher concentrations 
than somatropin, indicating  reduced in vitro activity of somatrogon compared to somatropin.  
In vivo 
In vivo data indicate similar weight  gain in hypophysectomied rats following a single SC administration 
of 0.55 and 1.1 mg protein/ kg somatrogon (reportedly equivalent to 0.4  and 0.8  mg/kg hGH) as 
compared to daily 0.1 mg/kg somatropin. Also, repeated SC dosing of 0.48  mg protein/kg/dose 
somatrogon (reportedly equivalent to 0.35  mg/kg hGH),  administered every 4 days for 12 days, 
produced a similar increase in weight gain as daily somatropin (0.1mg/kg/dose). Therefore, despite in 
vitro data indicating reduced somatrogon activity compared to Bio-Tropin with  respect to  binding 
affinity, cell proliferation and STAT5b phosphorylation, in vivo data from hypophysectomised rats 
suggest equivalent activity in terms of body weight gain but  with fewer injections and a slightly lower 
total hGH  dose. Furthermore, the IGF-1 response following a single SC injection of somatrogon to 
hypophysectomied rats was higher (Cmax 3x to 4x higher) than following  daily injection of somatropin 
of similar molarity, i.e. somatrogon 0.6  mg protein/kg (reportedly equivalent to 0.35  mg/kg hGH)  vs 
somatropin 0.35 mg/kg, and somatrogon 1.8 mg protein/kg (reportedly equivalent to 1.05  mg/kg 
hGH) vs somatropin 1.05  mg/kg. The Tmax of IGF-1  following treatment with  somatrogon was 36-48 
hours as compared to 20-24  hours for somatropin, supporting the extended action of somatrogon. This 
difference between in vitro potency and in vivo activity of somatrogon vs somatropin is attributed  to 
both exposure and differing binding  parameters for the GHR. While somatrogon has a slower 
association constant  in comparison to somatropin, the dissociation constants are more similar, 
therefore longer stimulation  at the  receptor reduced the impact of the slower association rate in in 
vitro studies. Hence, the apparent difference in in vitro potency between somatropinand somatrogon is 
reduced as the treatment time in cell-based assays is increased. In vivo, somatrogon induces a 
relatively high Cmax with  a prolonged half-life, leading to sustained activation of the receptors and 
translating into  higher levels of IGF-I production and subsequent weight gain in  non-clinical studies. 
Results from these studies indicate that  somatrogon was pharmacologically active at all dose levels 
tested in the 4-week study (1.8,  18 and 90 mg/kg). In support of sustained somatrogon activity, pre-
dose IGF-1 levels were higher on day 19 compared to pre-dose levels on day 1. However, the IGF-1 
response was not dose proportional (higher circulating IGF-1 at the mid dose than the high  dose in 
both males and females). In contrast,  in the 26-week study, somatrogon (1.5,  15, or 30 mg/kg) 
produced a dose-related increase in IGF-1. Furthermore, the IGF-1 responses to somatropin (3.6 
mg/kg/day) and the intermediate (15 mg/kg) and high (30  mg/kg) doses of somatrogon were similar, 
while low dose somatrogon (1.5mg/kg) induced IGF-1 concentrations greater than  control but  less 
than somatropin. It is concluded that the  evaluation of dose-response relationships in animals with 
normal functioning  pituitaries  is complex due to the  presence of endogenous GH  and the  induction of 
normal levels of IGF-1,  but the considerable increase in IGF-1 response from Day 1 to 91 is evidence 
that  somatrogon has biological activity similar to growth hormone.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics were assessed with  an  in  vitro assay, assessing the  off-target  receptor 
binding  of  somatrogon and  comparing them  to  somatropin.  From  a  panel of  70  receptors somatrogon 
showed no significant affinity to any of the screened receptors with the exception of the glutamate (NMDA 
PCP site) receptor. Similar inhibition  was demonstrated by both somatrogon and somatropin for this site 
(69.95%  and  83.98%,  respectively). Therefore, it  is  concluded  that  the  binding  is  GH-  and  not  CTP-
mediated, in addition there were no indications of effects on the central nervous system, based on review 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

of clinical signs from the  rat and monkey toxicology studies, hence it  was not considered to represent a 
safety concern. The fusion of CTP to rhGH does not  affect the off-target binding  profile of somatrogon.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety  pharmacology programme 
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies with somatrogon have not been conducted, somatrogon was 
tested for potential effects on the  respiratory, central nervous, and/or cardiovascular systems in the 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in rats and the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in  rhesus 
monkeys. This is acceptable, in line with  ICH S6(R1). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted to support somatrogon. This is 
acceptable, due to the nature of this  biologic product and the specificity of its pharmacological activity. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) studies were conducted following SC 
administration of somatrogon in  Sprague-Dawley rats and rhesus monkeys. The TK and 
immunogenicity of somatrogon were evaluated as part of pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats 
(up to 4-weeks) and rhesus monkeys (up to 26-weeks) following repeat SC administration. An embryo-
foetal development (EFD) study conducted in gravid rats confirmed somatrogon dose proportional 
exposure to the foetus. No protein binding,  distribution,  metabolism or excretion studies have been 
carried out. 
A number of bioanalytical methods such as quantitative determination of somatrogon in  rat serum 
(including  foetal and pregnant rat serum) and rhesus monkey serum, quantitative  determination of 
somatropin in monkey serum, qualitative determination of antibodies to somatrogon, CTP and 
somatropin in rat and monkey serum and qualitative determination of neutralising  antibodies to 
somatrogon and somatropin in rat and rhesus monkey serum were developed and in general 
successfully validated.  
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used for the quantification  of total  IGF-1 in rat 
and monkey serum to support the  GLP repeat-dose studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and rhesus 
monkeys.  
For the quantitative  determination of IGF-1 in toxicology studies in rhesus monkeys, a commercially 
available human IGF-1 immunoassay was used. This is acceptable, given the identical amino acid 
sequences of rhesus monkey and human IGF-1 and the exploratory purpose of the  non-clinical study.  
The pharmacokinetics of somatrogon in relation to pharmacodynamic response was evaluated in 
comparison to the marketed somatropin after single injection  in hypophysectomised rats. Cmax was 
significantly higher for somatrogon than for the comparator. The terminal half-life of somatrogon was 
dose-independent and 4.5  times longer than  for somatropin. As a result, the AUC of somatrogon was 
10 times higher compared to somatropin. Finally, Tmax was observed at 8 h for somatrogon in contrast 
to 0.5  h for the comparator. Consistent  with  these results, somatrogon led to  higher IGF-1 levels at 
later time points, which  supports its  long-lasting action. Commercially available kits for determination 
of hGH and IGF-1 were used, and the respective assay description included validation parameters. 
Given the rather exploratory nature of the study, this  is considered sufficient.  
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

Both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are biomarkers for GH treatment, and it  was confirmed that IGFBP-3 was not 
measured in the nonclinical studies. IGFBP-3 was however measured in Phase I Clinical studies and it 
is considered that  IGFBP-3 was unlikely to  confound the  interpretation of the nonclinical IGF-1 data. 
Single-dose PK and TK studies were conducted following SC administration of somatrogon in rats and 
rhesus monkeys (toxicology species). The TK and immunogenicity of somatrogon were evaluated as 
part of pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in  rats (4-week toxicity study) and rhesus monkeys (4-week 
and 26-week toxicity study)  following repeat SC administration. Exposure (as assessed by Cmax and 
AUC) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner. In general, there were no apparent 
sex-related differences in systemic exposure.  
Three copies of the CTP (1 copy being fused at the N-terminus  and 2 copies at the  C-terminus) of the 
beta chain of the  human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are fused to the therapeutic protein hGH to 
form somatrogon. It is expected that  glycosylation of the negatively charged, heavily sialylated CTP 
portion of somatrogon could increase the plasma half-life as a result of decreased renal clearance 
and/or reduced clearance via the asialoglycoprotein receptors. This was demonstrated in both  a single 
dose study, and the  repeat dose study. In the single-dose study, in rats somatrogon had a half-life of 
~ 7h compared to 1.5  h for somatropin. In the repeat dose study, in monkeys somatrogon had an 
average half-life of ~ 18h compared to  an average half-life of 4.5  h for somatropin. As expected, 
exposure of somatrogon was higher than  somatropin in rats and monkeys because of the significantly 
longer t½. 
The incidence of anti-somatrogon antibodies was higher in rats than  rhesus monkeys and antibodies 
were detected for both the hGH  and carboxy-terminal peptide (CTP) domain of somatrogon in  both 
species. ADAs were also detected in the control group in the rat study. Following  an investigation 
exposure of this  group to somatrogon could not be ruled out. The presence of ADA in the  control group 
did not impact the  conclusions drawn for the TK analysis in this study.  Neutralizing  antibodies were 
detected, however, exposure to somatrogon and the insulin-like growth  factor (IGF)-1  responses were 
not affected in these animals. The incidence of anti-drug  antibody (ADA) induction to  somatropin was 
similar to that observed with  somatrogon. 
No protein binding  studies have been conducted with  somatrogon. This is accepted. Based on the 
literature it is expected that binding of growth hormone, and by extension somatrogon to its  binding 
protein in plasma and the  circulating extracellular domain of growth hormone will be approximately 
50% (Baumann, 1988,  Baumann, 1990a,  and Baumann, 1990b). 
An EFD study conducted in gravid rats confirmed somatrogon exposure to the foetus. Foetal 
concentrations were much lower than maternal concentrations but  increased with  increasing maternal 
dose. Exposure of the foetus to  somatrogon resulted in the expected pharmacologic effect, namely that 
somatrogon elicited an increase in F1  mean body weights (both sexes). 
The expected consequence of the  metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the 
degradation to  small peptides and individual amino acids. Therefore, the metabolic and excretory 
pathways are generally understood. Highly glycosylated, negatively charged, heavily sialylated CTP 
residues prolong serum half-life as compared to somatropin. Literature evidence suggests that  this 
may be a result of decreased renal clearance and/or reduced clearance via the asialoglycoprotein 
receptor. Due to its high molecular weight, somatrogon is not  excreted in urine. Instead, it  is supposed 
to be primarily metabolised by proteolytic catabolism. For these reasons, no specific metabolism or 
excretion studies were conducted. The lack of metabolism and excretion studies is acceptable. 
Somatrogon and somatropin demonstrated comparable induction  profiles of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A4 under the conditions  of the  in vitro hepatocyte study. Primary human hepatocytes from three 
different donors were used. This study evaluated the  potential for somatrogon (with  Genotropin as a 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 28/127 
 
 
 
comparator) to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 mRNA expression and/or enzyme activity was 
conducted in 3 donors of human cryopreserved hepatocytes with somatrogon at concentrations of 100, 
500,  or 1000  ng/mL. The drug concentrations of somatrogon evaluated (100, 500,  and 1000 ng/mL) 
were consistent  with predicted steady-state drug concentrations based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis for study CP-P-004 in paediatric patients  to whom a dose of 0.66 
mg/kg/week somatrogon was administered. In this study, the Cmax for post-hoc estimate was 690 ± 
261 ng/mL  (range: 140  – 1410 ng/mL).  Somatrogon and somatropin are not considered to be inducers 
of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 but may be considered weak inducers of CYP3A4 enzyme. 
Considering the  extensive clinical experience with  rhGH in patients, somatrogon is expected to  act by 
the same pharmacological mechanism as hGH via binding to the  growth hormone receptor, no new 
DDI are expected beyond those already known for rhGH products. 
Considering all the  data available, concomitant  use is unlikely to require changes in  doses of a CYP3A 
metabolized drug when administered with  somatrogon. 
The pharmacokinetics of somatrogon was compared with  three lots of the drug. Similar concentration 
vs. time profiles for somatrogon and IGF-1 were observed. Samples were stored at -20 °C  and no data 
on stability of the test  item in rat serum at this  temperature has been provided. However, since the 
purpose of the study was to compare the pharmacokinetics for three lots  of somatrogon and the three 
lots were handled in the  same way, it is considered that  stability issues at  -20 °C had a low impact on 
the study conclusions.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two non-pivotal single dose toxicity studies were performed with  somatrogon, one in rats and one in 
monkeys. Neither study was GLP compliant. This is acceptable due to the availability of GLP-compliant 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in both species.  
In the rat study, cage-side observations and clinical signs were reported for a 7-day observation 
period, following  SC administration of 3.6,  36 or 180  mg/kg somatrogon and on day 7 animals were 
euthanized but no necropsy was performed. Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic evaluation 
pre-dose and a 1, 2, 4, 8, 24-  and 72-hours post-dose on day 1 only. All animals survived to end of 
study and there were no test article-related effects on clinical signs or body weights. In general, mean 
AUClast and Cmax increased with  increasing dose and no sex-related differences are reported. 
In the monkey study, cage-side observations and clinical signs were reported for a 14-day observation 
period, following  SC administration of 1.8  or 90 mg/kg somatrogon and at study termination  animals 
were returned to stock colony. Haematology/coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameters 
were evaluated (prior to initiation  of dosing, on Day 7, and prior to study termination). Blood samples 
were collected for toxicokinetic evaluation pre-dose and at 1,  2, 4, 8, 24,  48, and 72 hours post-dose 
on day 1 only. All animals survived to end of study and there were no test article-related effects on 
clinical signs, body weight  or clinical pathology. In general, mean AUClast and Cmax increased with 
increasing dose and there were no sex-related differences. 
In summary, somatrogon was well-tolerated following single SC injection  up to 180mg/kg in rats and 
up to 90mg/kg in monkeys based on cage-side observations, body weight and clinical pathology in 
monkeys.

2.5.4.2.  Repeat  dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats (4-weeks) and rhesus monkeys (4-weeks and 26-
weeks), both  are considered pharmacologically relevant species based on available pharmacology data 
and all 3 studies were GLP-compliant, with  somatrogon administered via the  SC route (the intended 
clinical route of administration).   
Rat 
In the  4-week rat study,  somatrogon was administered SC twice  weekly at  doses of 0,  3.6,  36,  or 180 
mg/kg.  All animals  survived to  terminal  euthanasia. There were  no adverse test  article-related effects 
on  clinical  signs,  coagulation,  urinalysis,  or  macroscopic  parameters.  Test-article  related  findings  of 
increased body  weight  gain and  increased food consumption  in  male and female rats were reported at 
≥36  mg/kg  somatrogon  and  attributed  to  anticipated  pharmacological  activity,  which  is  plausible.  A 
clinical  pathology  finding  of  slight  anaemia,  reported  at  180mg/kg  in  both  sexes, was  reversible and 
considered non-adverse.  Dose-dependent increased triglycerides  were  also  reported  in  both  sexes at 
≥36  mg/kg,  which  were mostly  reversible and  considered consistent  with  findings  reported  previously 
for  growth  hormone  and  non-adverse. Data  from  the  literature  indicate  that  the  reported  mammary 
gland changes (feminization  [males] and lobular hyperplasia [females]) have previously been reported 
in  rats administered rhGH  and  are therefore not  unique  to  somatrogon. Most  animals from the  control 
group  and  180  mg/kg  group  developed  antidrug  antibodies  that  were  specific  for  the  hGH  and  CTP 
domain of somatrogon and were neutralising. However, since these antibodies did not affect the exposure 
nor the biological responsiveness (weight gain and IGF-1) the issue was not further pursued. Aside from 
clinical and/or microscopic effects related to  local irritation at  the  site of  injection, all  the effects noted 
following  the  repeated  SC  administration  of  somatrogon  were  considered  to  be  directly  or  indirectly 
associated with  its anticipated  pharmacological activity and were partly or fully reversible following a 2-
week recovery phase. Therefore, doses up to 180  mg/kg were tolerated and the NOAEL  was 180  mg/kg 
and  was  associated with  mean Day  26  Cmax  and  AUC  last  values  of  95.7  μg/mL  and  3280  μg•h/mL, 
respectively.  
Monkey 
In the 4-week monkey study somatrogon was administered SC every 6 days (5 total  doses) at doses of 
0, 1.8,  18 and 90mg/kg. Mortality  in one high dose female was not associated with any clinical findings 
prior to death and no test article-related macroscopic or microscopic findings were evident at necropsy, 
this  death  was  not  considered  treatment-related.  All  remaining  animals  survived  to  scheduled 
termination. No adverse test article-related findings were observed in clinical observations, body weights, 
ophthalmic,  electrocardiographic,  clinical  pathology,  macroscopic,  or  organ  weight  parameters. 
Reversible minimal to mild  acute inflammation, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and fibroplasia 
at  injection  sites  at  ≥18mg/kg  were considered non-adverse. A  low  positive antibody  titer  to  only the 
hGH component of somatrogon was noted in a single male animal at 90 mg/kg; the antibodies were not 
neutralising  against  somatrogon  or  hGH.  No  antibodies  to  the  carboxy-terminal peptide  (CTP)  region 
were  formed.  The  NOAEL  was  the  high  dose  of  90  mg/kg,  associated  with  Day 19  mean  Cmax and 
AUClast values of 119 μg/mL  and 4100  μg•h/mL,  respectively. 
Chronic repeat-dose toxicity was assessed in only one species, rhesus monkey. This approach was 
agreed by the CHMP in a previous scientific advice. Rhesus monkey was chosen following concerns of a 
possible immune response developing in rats. These concerns are considered plausible on the  basis of 
the high incidence of neutralizing anti-somatrogon antibodies which occurred in the 4-week repeat 
dose toxicity study in  rats at  the high dose of 180mg/kg. The absence of a chronic toxicity study in a 
second species is acceptable.

EMA/15620/2022  
Page 30/127 
 
 
 
 
In the 26-week monkey study, somatrogon was administered SC every 5 days at  doses of 0, 1.5, 15  or 
30mg/kg  for 26  weeks. An  additional  comparator group was  also included  in  this  study,  to  which  Bio-
Tropin was administered SC once daily at a dose of 3.6mg/kg/day. The use of a daily use somatropin as 
comparator  is  endorsed  and  Bio-Tropin  is  an  identical  somatotropin  to  Genotropin,  an  authorised 
medicinal product in the EU used as a comparator in clinical studies.  
There were no test  article-related macroscopic findings or organ weight  changes. Microscopic 
evaluation revealed changes at the  injection site only. The primary finding  was minimal infiltration  of 
mixed cells in both the  somatropin and somatrogon groups, these effects were largely resolved after 
the recovery phase. The NOAEL  was considered to  be 30  mg/kg and was associated with  Day 1 mean 
Cmax and AUC last values of 50.9 μg/mL  and 1430  μg•h/mL,  respectively. It is notable that  no effect on 
body weight  is reported following SC administration of somatrogon to monkeys in both  the 4-week and 
26-week repeat-dose studies. Indeed, there were no toxicologically relevant effects related to the 
known action of growth hormone in the  chronic study. It  was questioned if the exposure levels in this 
study were adequate. However, the  doses of 180  and 30 mg/kg in the 4-week rat and 26-week 
monkey study provided exposure multiples of 234x and 71x, respectively based on Cav. While the 
exposure margins based on AUC are generally lower than that  for Cav, they are still considered 
acceptable as the mid-and high dosed animals from the 4-week rat and 4-week monkey study and the 
26-week monkey study exhibited exposures >10-fold higher than relevant clinical exposure, as 
recommended by ICH S6(R1). 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
A genotoxicity assessment has not been conducted for somatrogon. This is acceptable, in line with  ICH 
S6(R1) for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Standard carcinogenicity bioassays are also generally not indicated or required for biotechnology-
derived pharmaceuticals in accordance with  ICH S6(R1). In addition,  ICH S1A guideline states that 
carcinogenicity studies are not  generally needed for endogenous substances given essentially as 
replacement therapy (ie, physiological levels). However, somatrogon is a long acting  growth factor and 
to allay any concern regarding carcinogenicity, the applicant performed a carcinogenicity assessment.  
There were no findings  in the repeat dose toxicity studies with  somatrogon that  were indicative of 
carcinogenic potential.  There were no adverse effects observed in rats and rhesus monkeys given 
somatrogon. The findings noted in  the 4- and 26-week studies  were consistent with  the 
pharmacological activity of the  drug or related to local effects at the injection site. Although  it may be 
feasible to complete a study of longer duration, formation of ADA and injection site findings  may 
prevent completion of a traditional, 2-year carcinogenicity study.  The clinical studies evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of somatrogon that  support this marketing application included intensive monitoring 
of IGF-1 concentrations, including pre-defined criteria for dose reduction in the case of excessive IGF-1 
concentrations or adverse events. However, non-physiological tissue distribution  which may be an 
attribute  of somatrogon, is unknown as distribution studies were not carried out. The lack of 
carcinogenicity studies is acceptable.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental  toxicity 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies were conducted in only one species, an 
approach that  was agreed by CHMP  in the scientific advice received in 2011 and is considered 
acceptable. The pivotal reproductive and developmental studies included fertility and early embryonic 
development (FEED),  embryo foetal development (EFD) and pre- and post-natal  development (PPND) 
studies conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. All DART study reports include statements  of compliance 
with  OECD principles of GLP, with  the exception of the  toxicokinetics for the rat EFD study which was 
non-GLP. Pfizer conducted additional toxicokinetic analyses on the  EFD study that were not conducted 
with  OCED GLP but are FDA GLP-compliant,  which is acceptable. Toxicokinetic data is not reported for 
some studies, but  the TK available from the repeat-dose toxicology studies together with  the data from 
the EFD study are considered sufficient. A NOAEL  is reported at the high  dose in all pivotal DART 
studies of 30 mg/kg.  
A safety margin of 14x the  maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC is reported in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC regarding these EFD  data, which is acceptable. 
In the FEED study, somatrogon was administered via SC injection every 2 days to male and female 
Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0 (control), 3,  10, or 30  mg/kg. All animals survived to terminal 
euthanasia except for 3 males whose death was not  considered test article-related. Test-article related 
findings of increased mean body weight and food consumption were reported at  doses ≥ 10 mg/kg in 
males and ≥3 mg/kg in females, these findings are associated with anticipated  pharmacological 
activity of somatrogon and considered non-adverse. Oestrous cycle length and copulatory interval were 
significantly longer at 10 mg/kg and the number of oestrous cycles was significantly lower at ≥3 
mg/kg. However, there were no effects on mating,  fertility, and fecundity indices. Significantly higher 
number of corpora lutea at ≥10  mg/kg and implantation  sites at 30 mg/kg were observed and a slightly 
higher pre-implantation loss at ≥10 mg/kg were observed, but all other uterine parameters were 
similar to controls. These findings are reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  There were no test article-
related effects on the sperm parameters (motility,  concentration, and morphology). At necropsy, there 
were no test  article-related macroscopic findings. A few test  article-related higher organ weights  were 
observed at ≥10 mg/kg in females and at 30 mg/kg in males and were related to higher body weight. 
Based on the results, the NOAEL  for male and female systemic toxicity and for reproduction and 
fertility was 30 mg/kg. 
In the pivotal EFD study, somatrogon was administered via SC injection every 2 days from GD 6  to 18 
to time-mated female Sprague Dawley rats (25/group)  at doses of 0 (control), 3, 10,  or 30 mg/kg. 
Blood samples for determination of the serum test  article concentrations and toxicokinetic parameters 
were collected from an additional 9 animals/dose, pre-dose and at  1, 2, 4, 8, 24,  and 48 hours post-
dose on GDs 6  and 18;  blood samples were collected from 3 control animals on GDs 6 and 18 at 8 
hours post-dose. In addition,  blood was collected from the toxicokinetic foetuses at 24  hours post-dose 
on GD 18.  One 10 mg/kg female was found dead on GD 15, with  red discoloration of the adrenal 
glands, red fluid  in the oral cavity near the pharynx, and red discoloration of the lung  and mainstem 
bronchi reported at necropsy, in the absence of similar macroscopic findings in any of the other treated 
animals this was not considered test article-related. No test article-related clinical signs were noted. 
Test article-related, statistically  significant and dose-dependent higher mean body weight and body 
weight  gain were observed at ≥3  mg/kg and in food consumption at ≥10  mg/kg, compared with 
controls. These findings were associated with  the pharmacological activity of the test  article considered 
not adverse and are reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. There were no test  article-related effects on 
macroscopic findings, uterine parameters, foetal body weight, sex ratio, or external, skeletal, and 
visceral variations or malformations. Maternal exposure as assessed by Cmax and AUC generally 
increased with  increasing dose except for Cmax on GD 18 at 30 mg/kg, which was lower than 
Assessment report

Page 32/127 
 
 
 
anticipated. Pooled foetal serum samples collected at 24  hours post dose on GD 18 were 2.51, 5.09, 
and 14.9 ng/mL  at maternal doses of 3,  10, and 30 mg/kg/dose respectively, confirming somatrogon 
exposure to the foetus. Foetal concentrations were much lower than maternal concentrations and were 
dose-proportional, increasing with increasing maternal dose. The NOAEL  for maternal toxicity and the 
NOEL  for developmental toxicity was 30 mg/kg.  
In the PPND study, somatrogon was administered via SC injection in  the scapular region every 2 days 
from GD 6 to LD 20 to  time-mated female pregnant/lactating Sprague Dawley rats (25/group) at  doses 
of 0 (control), 3, 10,  or 30 mg/kg. Increased mean body weight, body weight change, and/or food 
consumption were observed in F0  females at ≥ 10 mg/kg during gestation and/or lactation, compared 
with  controls. Isolated, statistically significant  higher body weight  change was also observed at 3 
mg/kg. All F0 females survived to terminal euthanasia, with  the exception of one 30 mg/kg female, 
euthanized in moribund condition on LD 5, with  clinical signs of decreased activity, rapid breathing, 
right hind  limb impaired, pale and cold to  touch, and macroscopic observations including enlarged 
adrenal glands, liver, and spleen, and entire body icteric. Enlarged adrenal glands were also observed 
in other somatrogon-treated animals (n=1,  2, and 8 females at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, respectively), 
but  none of these animals exhibited adverse clinical signs and therefore the mortality of the 30  mg/kg 
female was not considered test  article-related, which is acceptable. No  test article-related clinical signs 
were observed in F0  females and the  findings of enlarged adrenal glands was considered related to the 
higher body weights  observed, which is associated with the  anticipated pharmacological activity of 
somatrogon and considered non-adverse. Dose-dependent higher mean F1  male and female pup body 
weights were observed beginning on LD 7 and through  post-natal day 28  at ≥10 mg/kg, compared with 
controls. This is consistent with  the anticipated pharmacological activity of somatrogon and appropriate 
wording has been included in section 5.3  of the SmPC. A slight  increase in stillborns was observed in 
the 10 and 30  mg/kg dose groups. Since the number of stillborn/litter  did not  exceed the historical 
control range, it  was concluded that  the higher stillborn index in the 10 and 30 mg/kg/dose groups is 
not somatrogon-related. At 30  mg/kg, the mean copulatory interval for F1 females was slightly higher 
at 4.5 days compared with controls; this  is consistent with  findings from the  EFD study and other 
growth hormone products. As there was no effect on mating indices, this  longer copulatory interval 
was not considered adverse, but wording has been included in section 5.3  of the  SmPC regarding this 
effect. However, exposure of the  F1 females occurred indirectly via transplacental and/or milk transfer. 
Furthermore, the investigation of potential effects on fertility and reproduction of somatrogon on the 
F1  generation were carried out  in F1 pups which  were at least 80 days of age and possible exposure 
via milk transfer might have occurred until  PND 21 at the latest.  This suggest a different mechanism of 
this effect in the F1  animals, possibly resulting from the higher body weight  observed in these animals 
due to the pharmacological action of somatrogon. The clinical relevance of these effects is likely to be 
low given that somatrogon is intended as a growth hormone replacement treatment in growth 
hormone deficient patients,  to bring them to normal physiological GH levels. 
The NOAEL for F0 maternal toxicity and for reproductive performance and evaluation of the F1 
offspring was reported as 30 mg/kg, the highest  dose tested. 
No juvenile toxicity studies were performed, this was considered acceptable in the absence of novel 
target organs of toxicity associated with  the CTP modifications and considering the extent of human 
use experience with GH therapies.

2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Single-dose PK and TK studies were conducted following SC administration of somatrogon in rats and 
rhesus monkeys (toxicology species). The TK and immunogenicity of somatrogon were evaluated as 
part of pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in  rats (4-week toxicity study) and rhesus monkeys (4-week 
and 26-week toxicity study)  following repeat SC administration. In rats, blood samples for 
determination of serum test article concentrations and toxicokinetic parameters were collected from 3 
animals/sex/dose/time point pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4,  8, 24, 48,  and 72  hours post-dose on Days 1 and 
26 (after the last dose). In monkeys, blood samples for determination of serum test article 
concentrations and toxicokinetic parameters were collected pre-dose and at 2, 4, 8, 24,  48, 72, and 96 
hours post-dose on Days 1 and 19. Exposure (as assessed by Cmax and AUC) increased in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner. In general, there were no apparent sex-related differences in 
systemic exposure.  
Three copies of the CTP (1 copy being fused at the N-terminus  and 2 copies at the  C-terminus) of the 
beta chain of the  human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are fused to the therapeutic protein hGH to 
form somatrogon. It is expected that  glycosylation of the negatively charged, heavily sialylated CTP 
portion of somatrogon could increase the plasma half-life as a result of decreased renal clearance 
and/or reduced clearance via the asialoglycoprotein receptors. In rats, somatrogon had a half-life of ~ 
7h compared to 1.5  h for somatropin. In monkeys, somatrogon had an average half-life of ~ 18h 
compared to an average half-life of 4.5 h for somatropin. As expected, exposure of somatrogon was 
higher than somatropin in rats and monkeys because of the significantly longer t½. 
The incidence of anti-somatrogon antibodies was higher in rats than  rhesus monkeys and antibodies 
were detected for both the hGH  and carboxy-terminal peptide (CTP) domain of somatrogon in  both 
species. ADAs were also detected in the control group in the rat study. Following  an investigation 
exposure of this  group to somatrogon could not be ruled out. The presence of ADA in the  control group 
did not impact the  conclusions drawn for the TK analysis in this study. Neutralizing  antibodies were 
detected, however, exposure to somatrogon and the insulin-like growth  factor (IGF)-1  responses were 
not affected in these animals. The incidence of anti-drug  antibody (ADA) induction to  somatropin was 
similar to that observed with  somatrogon. 
The safety margin from the NOAEL  in the rat repeat-dose toxicology study is acceptable at 116.7-fold 
the reported clinical exposures at 0.66 mg/kg/week, based on exposure (AUC∞). Although the binding 
affinity of somatrogon to GHR is approximately 2-fold lower in rhesus monkey in comparison to human 
receptors, the exposure margins from the NOAEL reported in the repeat-dose monkey studies are also 
considered sufficient at 149.8-fold  and 121-fold the clinical exposures at 0.66 mg/kg/week for the 4-
week and 26-week studies respectively, based on exposure (AUC∞).  
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Stand-alone local tolerance studies with  somatrogon have not been conducted, which is acceptable 
since local tolerance at  the site of injection was evaluated during the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
during routine clinical observations, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations. Some evidence of 
injection site reactions was reported, but these changes were reversible upon cessation of dosing and 
advice regarding rotation  of injections sites was included in the SmPC. In the  carcinogenicity 
assessment, the sponsor cites data from the literature indicating  repeated SC administration of rhGH 
and an hGH analogue to rats over a timeframe of 2 years can result in  marked fibrosis at the site of 
injection (Farris et al, 2007;  Bartholomew et al, 2014).  However, these were daily injections to rats 
(~700  administrations) and therefore may not be of relevance to the  intended weekly administration of 
Assessment report

somatrogon in  the clinical setting. 
2.5.4.8.  Other  toxicity studies 
Studies to address the presence of anti-somatrogon antibodies were performed in both rats and rhesus 
monkeys. The incidence of ADA was higher in  rats than  rhesus monkeys, and antibodies were detected 
for both the rhGH and CTP domain of somatrogon in both  species. Neutralizing antibodies were 
detected; however, exposure to somatrogon and IGF-1 responses were not  affected in these animals. 
No phototoxicity studies have been conducted with  somatrogon as protein biotherapeutics and their 
catabolites (peptides and amino acids) are not considered to  have phototoxic potential. Similarly, no 
studies on immunotoxicity, dependence, the catabolism of somatrogon or impurities were conducted. 
The CHMP found this  to be acceptable. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will  not alter the concentration or 
distribution  of the substance in  the environment. Therefore, somatrogon is not  expected to pose a risk 
to the environment and as per the EMA Q&A document on ERA (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.1), 
it is agreed that  the ERA can consist of a justification for not submitting  ERA studies. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacological effects of somatrogon were examined in both  in vitro and in vivo in the 
pharmacologically relevant species, rats and monkeys. A high degree of similarity in the aminoacid 
sequence between GHRs from rat and human and from monkey and human was reported. The 
essential residues of the  hGHR that interact  with the  hGH appear to be conserved in rhesus monkeys 
and four aminoacids out of six conserved in rats. The binding affinity of somatrogon to GHR is 
approximately 2-fold lower in  rhesus monkey in comparison to human receptors. Of note, the binding 
affinity of somatrogon is 8-13  fold lower than the  binding affinity of somatropin for hGHR. The 
potential clinical relevance of this  difference in in vitro activity between somatrogon and somatropin 
was not discussed, although seen in binding  affinity, induction  of cell-proliferation and STAT5b 
phosphorylation data.  However, in vivo data indicate similar weight gain in hypophysectomied rats 
following a single SC administration of 0.55  and 1.1 mg protein/ kg somatrogon (equivalent to 0.4 and 
0.8 mg/kg hGH) as compared to daily 0.1 mg/kg somatropin. The difference between in vitro potency 
and in vivo activity of somatrogon vs somatropin is attributed  to both exposure and differing binding 
parameters for the GHR.  While somatrogon has a slower association constant  in comparison to 
somatropin, the dissociation constants are more similar, therefore longer stimulation at the  receptor 
reduced the impact of the slower association rate in in vitro studies. Hence, the apparent difference in 
in vitro potency between somatropin and somatrogon is reduced as the treatment time in  cell-based 
assays is increased. In vivo, somatrogon induces a relatively high  Cmax with a prolonged half-life, 
leading to sustained activation of the receptors and translating into higher levels of IGF-I production 
and subsequent weight gain in non-clinical studies.

For better comparability between somatropin (Bio-Tropin) and somatrogon, the concentration of the 
latter was calculated based on its hGH content.  In some studies, the hGH  content of 72.6% was used 
for the total dose, that is related to the glycosylated product. In other studies, 72.6%  hGH was related 
to the protein backbone excluding glycans, which  is equal to 57.8%  hGH in the  glycosylated product 
(more appropriate as it  corresponds to equimolar doses), but  both methods reflect similar hGH content 
relative to somatrogon (72.6% of 30,469  Da or 57.8%  of 38,254  Da).  
Secondary pharmacodynamics were assessed with an in vitro assay, assessing the off-target receptor 
binding of somatrogon and comparing them to somatropin. From a panel of 70 receptors somatrogon 
showed no significant affinity to any of the  screened receptors except for the glutamate.  Because of 
the similar off target  binding profile seen with  somatropin, the applicant  concludes that  the fusion of 
CTP to rhGH does not affect the off-target binding  of somatrogon. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into  the repeat dose toxicity studies in line with  ICH 
S6. Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have also not been conducted. This is acceptable due to 
the nature of this biologic product and the specificity of its  pharmacological activity. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) studies were conducted following SC 
administration of somatrogon in  Sprague-Dawley rats and rhesus monkeys. Validated assays were 
used to support the quantification  of somatrogon and detection of antibodies to  somatrogon in the GLP 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and rhesus monkeys. 
A number of bioanalytical methods such as quantitative determination of somatrogon in  rat serum 
(incl. foetal and pregnant rat serum) and rhesus monkey serum, quantitative determination of 
somatropin in monkey serum, qualitative determination of antibodies to somatrogon, CTP and 
somatropin in rat and monkey serum and qualitative determination of neutralising  antibodies to 
somatrogon and somatropin in rat and rhesus monkey serum were developed and in general 
successfully validated.  
It is noted that  at the time these studies were carried out,  the Bioanalytical guideline was still under 
development and the applicant relied on the acceptance criteria for bioanalytical method validation as 
described in the scientific literature of that  time. Deviations from the currently accepted standards are 
acknowledged and accepted for this reason. 
Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used for the 
quantification  of IGF-1 in  rat and monkey serum to support the GLP repeat-dose studies in Sprague-
Dawley rats and rhesus monkeys. All IGF-1 measured was total IGF-1.  
Both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are biomarkers for GH treatment. IGFBP-3 was not measured in nonclinical 
studies but  was measured however in Phase I Clinical studies. IGFBP-3 was produced in response to 
somatrogon. Although  it was not measured in the  nonclinical studies is considered unlikely that  IGFBP-
3 would confound the interpretation  of the  nonclinical IGF-1  data. 
In the TK analysis of the repeat dose toxicity studies exposure to somatrogon (as assessed by Cmax 
and AUC) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner and there were no apparent sex-
related differences in systemic exposure. As expected, due to the three copies of CTP fused to hGH  to 
form somatrogon, exposure of somatrogon was higher than  somatropin in rats and monkeys because 
of the significantly longer t½. 
The incidence of anti-somatrogon antibodies was higher in rats than  rhesus monkeys and antibodies 
were detected for both the hGH  and carboxy-terminal peptide (CTP) domain of somatrogon in  both 
species. Neutralizing  antibodies were detected, however, exposure to somatrogon and the insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF)-1 responses were not  affected in these animals.

No distribution  or protein binding studies were conducted. Based on the literature, it  is expected that 
binding of growth hormone, and by extension somatrogon to its  binding protein in plasma and the 
circulating extracellular domain of growth  hormone will be approximately 50%.  
The results of an in vitro hepatocyte study  suggest that somatrogon and somatropin are not  inducers 
of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 but may be considered weak inducers of CYP3A4 enzyme. Considering the 
extensive clinical experience with rhGH in patients,  somatrogon is expected to act by the same 
pharmacological mechanism as hGH via binding  to the growth  hormone receptor, no new DDI are 
expected beyond those already known for rhGH products. 
Toxicology 
Somatrogon was well-tolerated following single and repeat dose SC injection up to 180mg/kg in  rats 
and up to 90mg/kg in monkeys. Chronic repeat dose toxicity was assessed in one species only, 
monkey, in agreement with  CHMP.    
Single-dose PK and TK studies were conducted following SC administration of somatrogon in rats and 
rhesus monkeys (toxicology species). Exposure (as assessed by Cmax and AUC) increased in  an 
approximately dose-proportional manner. In general, there were no apparent sex-related differences in 
systemic exposure.  
Developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies were conducted in only one species, an 
approach that  was agreed by CHMP.  The applicant  carried out FEED, EFD and PPND studies. In these 
studies, there were no unanticipated  toxicities that differ from what  is known about  GH. A NOAEL  is 
reported at the  high dose in all pivotal DART studies of 30 mg/kg. These reproduction and 
developmental studies with  somatrogon have some limitations, TK analysis was only performed in the 
pivotal EFD study, but  not in the FEED  and PPND studies. TK data from the  EFD study was used in the 
calculation of a safety margin to  human and in  section 5.3  of the SmPC the sponsor reports an 
exposure margin of 14x the maximum recommended human dose from the AUC reported at the 
30mg/kg dose in  the EFD study in rats, which is acceptable.  
Environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will  not alter the concentration or 
distribution  of the substance in  the environment. Therefore, somatrogon is not  expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology data to  support the registration for somatrogon were collected in 7 clinical 
studies. These included studies in  adults and children with  GHD and one on-going open-label extension 
(OLE) study in  children with  GHD. In addition to the  individual studies, 6 population PK and PK/PD 
analyses were conducted. 
Absorption  
The absorption PK parameters of somatrogon at the proposed SC dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week estimated 
from the  population PK analysis of 42  pre-pubertal GHD children are summarized below.

The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatrogon with  reference to the 
intravenous route has not been determined. In the population  PK analysis, the  relative bioavailability in 
GHD adults was ~44% of the relative bioavailability in GHD children.

A phase 1 randomised, double-blind placebo controlled, single dose, dose-escalation study in healthy 
adult male volunteers has been conducted. The study enrolled 24  subjects into  3 dose cohorts (4 mg, 7 
mg and 21 mg). 
Exposure expressed as Cmax and AUC (AUC0-t and AUC0-∞) increased with  increasing dose, but 
somewhat more than dose proportionally. The duration of exposure to somatrogon was dose related, 
and one or more values in  the arm dropped to BLQ at points beyond 48,  72, and 96 hr in the 4,  7, and 
21 mg dose arms, respectively. 
As somatrogon was only administered by SC injection in this  study, bioavailability (F)  was not 
determined. The mean time to reach peak concentrations ranged between 11-14  hours following SC 
injection. There was a dose-related, but more than dose proportional, increase in the serum 
concentrations of somatrogon after single SC doses of 4 mg, 7mg and 21 mg, which lasted for 48 to 96 
hrs. The mean half-life of somatrogon was dose independent ranging from 20.8  to 23.6  hours.  
Serum samples from all subjects prior to dosing and at 14 days and 30  days following administration of 
somatrogon were negative for anti-somatrogon antibodies. 
Another phase 1, single-centre, open-label randomised, 2×2  crossover (Ref Test |  Test Ref) study was 
conducted  in  healthy  male  volunteers  with  a  washout  of  two  weeks.  The  aim  was  to  establish 
bioequivalence between single SC (12 mg) doses of somatrogon, delivered via either the pen formulation 
proposed for marketing, or in  a vial delivered by a needle and syringe. The GeoMean AUCt  values were 
similar between the 2 treatment groups and Cmax was slightly lower in the pen relative to vial treatment 
groups.  The  median  t1/2  value  following  administration  in  pen  and  vial  groups  was  23.20  hours  and 
20.05  hours, respectively. 
A phase 2 open-label, randomised, multicenter, parallel group, dose-finding study enrolled fifty-three 
(36 males and 17 females) paediatric subjects with  GHD. Age ranged 3.0  to 11.2 years for male 
subjects and ranged 4.3 to 9.2  years for female subjects. 
Subjects were randomised to receive one of three doses of somatrogon once weekly (0.25,  0.48  or 
0.66  mg/kg) or somatropin (Genotropin 0.034  mg/kg daily). After administration of the second dose at 
the assigned dose level, 4 samples were collected per patient. 
In this phase 2 study, the PK of somatrogon was evaluated in 42 paediatric subjects with  GHD naïve to 
treatment with  rhGH. Somatrogon exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner. The mean T1/2 
for somatrogon for each dosing group, ranged between 18.3 to 36.1  hours, supportive of once weekly 
dosing. 
Distribution 
The distribution  PK parameters of somatrogon at the proposed dose of 0.66  mg/kg/week estimated 
from the  population PK analysis of 42  pre-pubertal GHD children are summarized below.

Protein binding of somatrogon was not investigated, this  was accepted by the  CHMP. 
Elimination 
The mean ± SD apparent clearance and effective t½ calculated from the  individual post hoc estimates 
of the population PK analysis of data from paediatric subjects were 0.0336 ± 0.0142  L/hr/kg and 28.3 
± 1.52  hour, respectively. 
No information on the route of excretion of somatrogon was provided and specific metabolism studies 
were not  conducted. This is acceptable. Somatrogon is expected to be primarily degraded by 
proteolytic catabolism (Lobo et al., 2004;  Mascelli et al., 2007). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In two studies conducted in healthy male subjects, following  SC injection of different somatrogon 
strengths, Cmax and AUCinf increased with  increasing dose, but was not strictly  dose proportionally. 
In another study, conducted in adults with  GHD, there was a dose-related increase in the mean serum 
concentrations and mean values of Cmax and AUCtau from Cohort 2 to  Cohort 3  to Cohort 1A 
representing 37%,  55.5%, and 123.4%  of the cumulative weekly dose required for daily rhGH. Log-log 
plots (power model) of the individual patient  values for Cmax and AUCtau were reasonably linear with 
slopes, i.e. the  exponents of the power model, close to 1.0  (1.159  ± 0.143 and 1.167  ± 0.122, 
respectively), indicating linear PK over a ~40-fold dose range. The mean values for CL/F,  Vz/F, and t½ 
were comparable for all three cohorts with  no apparent trends, further supporting the linearity of the 
PK of somatrogon. 
The mean half-lives observed for somatrogon in the clinical studies of children with  GHD ranged 
between 18.3 to  36.1 hours, which correspond to accumulation ratios of 1.001 to 1.04.  Based on the 
population PK analysis of somatrogon in GHD children, the mean ±  SD post hoc estimated 
accumulation ratio was 1.02 ± 0.004  and t½ was 28.3  ± 1.52 hours. Thus, there is minimal 
accumulation of somatrogon with  weekly dosing. 
Immunogenicity 
No subjects testing positive for hGH ADAs at screening entered the main study CP-4-004. During study 
period, the  overall ADA incidence was 23.8% (10/42)  for somatrogon. None of the subjects tested 
positive for NAb. The total  ADA incidence was reduced from the  initial 10  patients to five patients 
between six and 12 months,  indicating presence of transient anti-somatrogon Abs. The presence of 
ADAs did not affect the IGF-1 profiles. 
In the open label extension period, among 48 subjects who entered the OLE  to receive somatrogon, 18 
subjects (37.5%)  tested ADA+ for somatrogon. This included 10 subjects who had previously tested 
ADA+ in the  main study.  No subjects tested  positive for Nabs. Throughout OLE Years 1-3 
approximately 25% of subjects tested  ADA+ and in Year 4, 2 subjects (5.3%)  tested ADA+.  
ADA status did not  appear to have a significant effect on IGF-1 response in this study. IGF-1  SDS by 
treatment, year in the  OLE (including LT-OLE  and LT-OLE PEN).  In addition,  ADA status did not  appear 
to effect efficacy in terms of annualised height velocity or change in height SDS. 
In the other main study CP-4-006, no subjects testing positive for hGH ADAs at screening were 
enrolled. Of the 109  subjects in  the somatrogon group, 84 subjects (77%)  tested positive for ADA at 
any time  during the 12-month  treatment period. Median  time to the first ADA+ result was 6 months, 
Assessment report

and 83/84  subjects had persistent ADA+ results. Two subjects in the somatrogon group tested positive 
for NAb. Both subjects continued  to grow and tolerate treatment well. 
Among 115 somatropin-treated subjects, 12  subjects (10.4%)  tested ADA+ for hGH at 6 months 
(Week 26)  and 7  subjects (6.1%)  tested positive for hGH at  12 months (Week 52),  suggesting that 
transient anti-hGH  antibodies had developed. 
In the OLE period, among 38  subjects who received somatrogon in the  main study period, 26 subjects 
(68.4%)  tested ADA+ at Month  6 in the  LT-OLE, all of whom had previously tested ADA+ in the main 
study. Among 41 subjects who received somatropin in the main study period, 8 subjects (19.5%) 
tested ADA+ at Month  6.  No subjects tested  positive for NAb. ADA status did not  appear to have a 
significant effect on IGF-1 SDS or height SDS response in this study. 
Special populations 
Subjects with renal impairment were excluded from enrolling in either of the paediatric clinical studies.  
In the population PK analysis, which included data from adults with  GHD (CLcr 65 – 291.1 mL/min) 
and from children with  GHD and normal renal function,  baseline CLcr was not found to be a significant 
covariate on the PK of somatrogon. 
No data were provided on impaired renal function  and this was found acceptable to the CHMP,  since 
somatrogon is expected to  have a low renal clearance. 
Gender was not identified as a significant covariate in any of the population  PK analyses conducted. 
Simulations based on the popPK model of data from the  pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006)  in pre-
pubertal children with GHD indicated that  girls had slightly higher (~15%) somatrogon exposure 
(Cavg,ss) than  boys. 
The influence of race was studied during a phase 1  randomised, double-blind placebo controlled, 
parallel group, single dose trial in  42 healthy adult male Caucasian and Japanese volunteers. There 
was no apparent difference between Japanese and Caucasian subjects with respect to PK parameters 
for the 2.5 mg and 7.5 mg dose cohorts. For the 15  mg dose cohort, the geometric mean Cmax was 
lower and the  median Tmax longer in Japanese compared to Caucasian subjects but the  geometric 
mean values for AUCinf were comparable, possibly suggesting a slower rate of absorption. The 
geometric mean T1/2 was independent of ethnic group. Moreover, race was not  found to be a 
significant covariate in any of the population PK analyses performed. Simulations based on the popPK 
model of data from the pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006)  in pre-pubertal children with  GHD indicated 
that  White and Asian children had similar somatrogon exposure. 
Body weight  was included as a covariate on clearance and volume parameters in all paediatric 
population PK models. Based on a population PK analysis where simulations were conducted assuming 
all paediatric GHD patients  received 5 repeated weekly doses of somatrogon at  a 0.66  mg/kg dose, it 
has been found that  this   dose should provide reasonably consistent exposures over the anticipated 
weight  range in potential paediatric patients. 
In the population PK analyses of somatrogon concentration data collected in paediatric GHD subjects, 
after accounting for body weight effects, age was not identified as a clinically relevant covariate. 
Simulations based on the popPK model of data from the  pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006)  in pre-
pubertal children with GHD showed that  somatrogon exposure in children aged 6-12 years was ~35% 
lower than children aged <6 years, due to differences in body weight between the two  groups. 
As doses of somatrogon are administered on the  basis of weight, further dose adjustment based on 
age among paediatric patients  is not required.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
The effects of somatrogon and somatropin (Genotropin at  similar hGH content)  on  induction  of specific 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4) following exposure of human 
hepatocytes  to  test  articles  were  compared  with  those  of  prototypical  inducers  (omeprazole, 
phenobarbital and rifampicin). The ability of somatrogon (up to 1000 ng/mL) and somatropin (up to 726 
ng/mL)  to  induce  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  and  CYP3A4/5  was  determined  in  primary  cultures  of  human 
hepatocytes  and  compared  to  the  effects  of  prototypical  inducers.  Somatrogon  and  somatropin 
demonstrated  comparable induction  profiles  of  CYP1A2, CYP2B6,  and  CYP3A4  under  the  conditions  of 
the  study. Somatrogon and somatropin were not  considered to  be inducers of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 but 
may be considered weak inducers of CYP3A4. 
A  different  study  assessed somatrogon  cross  reactivity  and  interference  during  hCG  quantification  in 
blood and urine  pregnancy tests.  Serum samples containing  either hCG or somatrogon were evaluated 
for  hCG concentrations  in  order to  assess potential  interference using  a  quantitative  pregnancy  blood 
test. The results supported the conclusion that  somatrogon did not  cross react with  the  hCG antibodies 
used in  commonly used  pregnancy tests  to  product  false positive  responses and  did not  interfere  with 
the detection of hCG in blood or urine to produce a false negative result. 
In vivo 
Clinical DDI studies between somatrogon and co-administered drugs have not been performed and this 
was found acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Growth is regulated through complex mechanisms involving GH, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and their complexes. 
GHD is the consequence of low  or absent secretion of GH from the pituitary gland. In children, GHD 
results in inadequate circulating IGF-1 levels and abnormal linear growth. 
IGF-1 was the primary PD biomarker used in all clinical development studies. IGFBP-3 levels were also 
assessed. In addition  to statistical  analyses of these endpoints, population PK/PD analyses were 
performed to establish the exposure-response relationship. 
IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were converted to SDS (standard deviation score) values using the tables by 
Bidlingmaier et al, 2014.  The SDS reflects the number of standard deviations below or above a 
reference population mean and allows for comparison of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 data across gender and 
age. 
Mechanism  of action 
Somatrogon acts by the same pharmacological mechanism as hGH via binding  to the GHR, i.e. it 
stimulates production and release of IGF-1  into the systemic circulation and local milieu. hGH and IGF-
1 are instrumental  in the promotion of linear growth  in children and in the  control of metabolism and 
body composition in children and adults. These factors are regulated through complex feedback 
mechanisms involving hGH, IGFBP-3 and their complexes.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Study CP-4-004  
In this phase 2 study, 53 paediatric GHD patients, naïve to treatment  with rhGH,  were randomised to 
receive one of three doses of somatrogon once weekly (0.25,  0.48 or 0.66  mg/kg) or somatropin 
(Genotropin) 0.034 mg/kg daily. 
Somatrogon provided an IGF-1 response within  the normal range, reaching an optimal  average value 
of 0 SDS in Cohorts 2 and 3, and not exceeding +2 SDS when monitoring the  weekly profile on Day 3 
or 4 post-dosing or when monitoring  it on monthly basis through 12 months.  IGF-1 SDS levels 
increased gradually in a dose-dependent manner until an IGF-1 SDS ≈  0 was achieved, and then 
stabilized for the  duration of the  12 months of the study without  reaching excessive IGF-1 values (>+2 
SDS) for all, but one subject in 0.66 mg/kg/week dosing group, whose dose was reduced.  
IGFBP-3 increased in a dose-dependent manner following administration of somatrogon, reaching 
steady-state values around week 15. Mean concentration-time profiles of the IGFBP-3 weekly trend 
over 12 months are presented below.

Weeks of Study
In this Phase 3  study, the PD parameters of somatrogon and somatropin (Genotropin) were evaluated 
in 109  and 115  paediatric subjects with  GHD, respectively. Subjects were randomised to receive 
somatrogon 0.66  mg/kg once weekly or somatropin 0.034  mg/kg daily for 12 months. 
Mean absolute serum IGF-1 levels, relative to baseline, increased across post-baseline study  visits for 
both treatment  groups. Mean IGF-1 SDS values in the somatrogon group approached 0 as early as 1-
month post-baseline and remained above 0 up to 12 months  (0.65 SDS at 12  months). Mean IGF-1 
SDS values in the  somatropin group remained near 0 SDS at  all subsequent post-baseline visits, 
ranging from -0.69  SDS to -0.16  SDS.

Mean serum IGFBP-3 levels post-dose generally increased across study visits for both treatment 
groups. Mean IGFBP-3 SDS post-dose values for the somatrogon group approached 0 at 1-month  post-
baseline and remained close to  0 (ranging from -0.27  to -0.02  SDS) through 12 months.  Mean IGFBP-
3 SDS post-dose values for the  somatropin group reached values ranging from -0.84  to -0.53  SDS 
throughout  the post-baseline visits. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro, somatrogon exhibited a similar binding pattern  as rhGH suggesting that  fusion of CTP to  rhGH 
leading to the long-acting  nature of somatrogon did not affect the off-target binding profile of the test 
article as compared with  rhGH. 
Daily GH inhibits  11βHSD-1,  a microsomal enzyme that  catalyses the conversion of cortisone to 
cortisol, and also activates prednisone and prednisolone, resulting in lower cortisol concentrations and 
potentially unmasking central hypoadrenalism or causing exogenous glucocorticoid therapy to  be less 
effective. No studies have been performed to assess the potential impact of somatrogon co-
administration on blood sugar control in subjects with  diabetes, either type 1 or type 2, controlled with 
either insulin or oral glucose lowering drugs. However, GH is generally antagonistic to insulin.   
Further safety concerns known to be associated with  daily rhGH include thyroid function impairment.

PK/PD analyses   
•  Phase  2 study CP-4-004 
Two population PK/PD analyses were performed using data from paediatric GHD subjects enrolled in 
study CP-4-004.  One was based on the data collected during the main study, whereas the other 
included data collected in  the main study as well as data collected up to  4 years after the beginning of 
the study in the  OLE portion. 
The PD analysis was based on an indirect-response model developed by Sun et al. (1999), in which 
IGF-1 production is a function of the concentration of GH (or an analog); somatrogon increased 
production/release of IGF-1, described by a sigmoid Emax model.  
The PD model indicated that increasing somatrogon doses increases the IGF-1 response. Based on 
simulations, mean IGF-1 values for Cohort 3 (0.66  mg/kg/wk) were typically > 0 SDS, ~centered at 
zero for Cohort 2 (0.48 mg/kg/wk), and consistently much lower than < 0 for Cohort 1 (0.25 
mg/kg/wk).  
In a supplemental analysis, somatrogon and IGF-1 concentrations were simulated at intervals of 0.04 
days during a dosing interval at steady state. These showed that  predicted IGF-1  SDS on Day 2 (48 
hours post-dose) approximated peak values in many subjects. IGF-1 SDS on Day 4 (96 hours post-
dose) approximated mean values in many subjects.  
IGF-1 analysis  
Based on prior knowledge, an indirect response model was used to  describe the IGF-1 concentration 
time profile and it  was assumed that  somatrogon stimulates the IGF-1 production  in a concentration 
dependent manner described by a sigmoidal Emax model. The PK parameters were fixed to the 
individual Bayesian estimate values from a popPK analysis.  
Using the final model, individual IGF-1 SDS versus time profiles after 4 years of treatment were 
simulated for each patient. The frequency for IGF-1 SDS values ≥ -2 and IGF-1 SDS values ≤  +2 at 
trough IGF-1 SDS, peak IGF-1 SDS and 4 days post dose after 4 years of somatrogon administration 
were 77.4%,  58.1%  and 90.3%, respectively.

year treatment of pre-pubertal GHD children is presented below. No significant  effect of average 
somatrogon concentration on HV was observed, but a positive trend of HV did occur with  an increase in 
average somatrogon concentration.

The dataset included the IGF-1 observations and post hoc (individual) PK parameters for somatrogon 
obtained from the  optimal popPK model. The indirect-response Emax model developed by Sun et 
al,1999 fit  the data well. Two models, each with  two covariates, yielded nearly identical fits  and 
objective functions. 
Optimal  Model #1: Baseline IGF-1 increased with  age and with  BMI.  
In a supplemental analysis, post hoc (individual)  IGF-1 estimates at  intervals of 6 hours throughout 
each dosing interval in which a sample was obtained were simulated.  As shown in Figure 2,  the 
percentage of subjects with  IGF-1 SDS values > +2 increased over time and the incidence of IGF-1 
values > +2  was larger with observed values compared to modelled values. 
Figure 8 
Percent of subjects with IGF-1  SDS values  > +2 at  each post-dose visit 
This analysis confirmed that  IGF-1 samples obtained early (<72  hours) in the dosing interval do not 
represent mean IGF-1 SDS during the dosing interval; these early samples showed a positive bias and 
were more likely than samples obtained later in the dosing interval to yield an IGF-1  SDS > +2. 
Therefore, when the goal of monitoring clinical therapy is to estimate mean IGF-1 SDS value during 
the dosing interval, clinical samples should be obtained close to 96 hours post-dose. If a sample is 
obtained earlier than 72-hours post-dose, that  value should not be considered as representative of the 
mean IGF-1  SDS during the dosing interval. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics are mainly derived from HV and the 2 paediatric studies  and corresponding 
modelling. The main PK-relevant phase 2-study in children CP-4-004 utilised  a specific limited sampling 
scheme. Sparse PK data obtained in  the paediatric phase 3-study CP-4-006 were only used for popPK 
modelling. In view of the proposed indication  applied for (in children) and the weight-based dosing in 
the target population,  the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment focussed on the 
paediatric study data. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical  methods

EMA/15620/2022

PK assays  
The methods for determination of somatrogon serum levels are adequately described and for the  most 
part have been validated according to  EU guidance (Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009)  addressing precision, accuracy, dilutional linearity, selectivity, sample 
stability, specificity (tolerance to  endogenous hGH) and calibration curve performance. As per EU 
guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev. 1), the applicant demonstrated that  the reference 
material was well characterised and confirmed a link between the batches and batches dosed clinically.  
ADA and Nab assays 
The methods for anti-somatrogon/anti-hGH  ADA analysis follow the recommendations of the EMA 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006  Rev 
1) and have been appropriately validated addressing precision, sensitivity, drug tolerance, selectivity, 
sample stability  and robustness. For the anti-hGH  ADA assay, the applicant has justified that  the 
reagents used would detect either endogenous hGH  or somatropin (depending on the treatment arm 
during the study).   
In addition, differing approaches were used to derive cut-points across the  ADA assays. It is noted also 
that  all paediatric studies used the floating cut-point  approach which  is acceptable. Otherwise, an 
appropriate false positive rate (1%) was applied and the  number of individuals used to  derive cut-
points has been appropriately justified.   
For all ADA assays the applicant has confirmed that  the tolerance of the assay for somatrogon (or 
hGH) exceeds the actual levels of the therapeutic in the samples used for ADA testing.  
At low PC concentrations, the drug tolerance of the Nab assay is as low as 0.05  µg/mL. According to PK 
data,  Cmax of  somatrogon  is  between  ~690  ng/mL  to  ~  1µg/mL;  at  this  level,  interference with  the 
analysis of  neutralising potential  of ADAs would  be expected. It  has been clarified that  for most clinical 
samples,  somatrogon  (and  hGH)  drug  levels  were  below  the  assay  drug  tolerance.  The  response  in 
relation to hGH NAb drug tolerance is acceptable. In relation to somatrogon, it appears that the methods 
used would only be capable of detecting in the order of 50 µg/ml NAb given the established drug tolerance 
and  the  clinical  relevance of  this  detection  threshold  was  queried.  It  has  been  clarified that  all  ADA+ 
samples were  also  tested  for  NAb  activity  with  the  hGH  NAb  assay  which  has  sufficient  sensitivity  to 
detect  clinically meaningful levels of NAb  in the  presence of  somatrogon (detects 3.9  µg/ml  of  positive 
control (PC) in  the presence of 246  ng/ml  somatrogon). It  is confirmed that  only 5.5% (29  out  of 524) 
of NAb negative samples exceeded the drug tolerance of the hGH NAb assay. Thus,  the hGH NAb assay 
has sufficient  drug tolerance to  detect  clinically meaningful levels of NAb  in  the presence of circulating 
somatrogon drug levels for the majority of samples across the clinical development program. 
Bioanalytical methods for PD 
Samples to measure insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)  and insulin-like growth  factor binding  protein 
3 (IGFBP-3) were analysed using standard commercial kits.  
Population PK analyses based  on the  Phase 2 study CP-4-004 
Two popPK analyses were performed using somatrogon data from paediatric GHD subjects enrolled in 
the Phase 2 study  CP-4-004. The first analysis was based on concentration data collected in the  main 
study, with  the main purpose to develop a population PK model to  be used subsequently in the PK/PD 
modelling of IGF-1 data. A two-compartment  model appeared to describe the paediatric data 
adequately, although  the VPCs were difficult  to interpret. For children, the model in which the  systemic 
parameters were weight-normalized was preferred over non-normalized and allometric-scaled models. 
Simulations demonstrated the longer duration of systemic exposure with  somatrogon compared to r-

hGH, which  supports less frequent dosing. Further, a simulation of repeated weekly dosing in 
paediatric subjects showed that  somatrogon was not cumulative. 
The second analysis used drug concentration and ADA data collected in the main study and in the OLE 
portion as well. 
This analysis is considered important as PK parameter estimates from this  model are reported in 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC. The methods used for model development and evaluation are acceptable. 
Data exclusions were adequately detailed and considered acceptable. The pooling of data from adult 
and GHD paediatric patients is appropriate given the sparse PK sampling of paediatric subjects. 
The PK of somatrogon was characterised by a two-compartment  model with  a delayed first order 
absorption. All parameters, except Vp/F, were estimated with  good precision. The degree of shrinkage 
for IIV was acceptable. GOF plots and VPCs showed that  the model described the data reasonably well. 
The simulated steady-state estimates of t1/2  (~28 hours) and minimal accumulation (accumulation 
ratio 1.02) support the  proposed weekly dosing interval for somatrogon treatment. 
ETA on CL/F and Vc/F were highly correlated. As such, the condition  number of the final model was 
greater than  1000. Although  collinearity might  compromise accuracy and precision of the parameter 
estimates, in this analysis, the parameter estimates of eta on CL/F  and eta on Vc/F were reasonable 
and parameter estimates were relatively precise. Therefore, the high condition number did not seem to 
have a meaningful impact on the final model. 
The estimates for the allometric exponents in the model (1.26  and 1.74  for CL/F and V/F, respectively) 
were unusually high.  However, the deviation of the exponent for allometric scaling did not  invalidate 
the adequacy of the population PK model as shown in the various diagnostic plots  and visual predictive 
checks. 
Population PK analyses based  on the  Phase 3 study CP-4-006 
Two population PK analyses were performed using somatrogon data from paediatric GHD subjects 
enrolled in the  pivotal phase 3 study CP-4-006.  The first analysis was performed prior to  the 
availability of ADA results and its main purpose of was to develop a population PK model to be used 
subsequently in the PK/PD modelling of IGF-1 data. A two-compartment  linear model with  an 
absorption lag time  fit the data well. Consistent  with one of the popPK models based on study CP-4-
004,  the model with  clearance and volume parameters scaled by weight  was preferred over models 
with  allometric scaling. This supports the proposed weight-based dosing regimen for somatrogon.  
PK Parameter estimates for the  present study (CP-4-006)  differed from those for CP-4-004,  the phase 
2 study for somatrogon. The differences were considered likely due to the markedly different sampling 
regimens in these studies. This is accepted. 
The second analysis was performed after ADA results were available. 
The purpose of this analysis was to characterise the popPK of somatrogon in pre-pubertal GHD children 
participating in  the pivotal Phase 3 study CP-4-006, to  confirm covariates identified in the previous 
popPK analysis, and to  assess the impact of a change to the day of dosing. 
The goodness of fit plots suggested that  the final model described the data well with  no obvious bias. 
VPCs showed that  the final model described the central tendency and spread of the  data adequately. 
Consistent with  previous popPK studies,  the estimate of the  t1/2 (~33  hours) and minimal 
accumulation (accumulation ratio 1.03) supports the  weekly dosing interval for somatrogon treatment. 
The adequacy of the model was demonstrated in the  various diagnostic plots and visual predictive 
check. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 51/127 
 
 
 
Simulations showed that the  increase in somatrogon AUC168 caused by a one-time change in the day 
of dosing, either advancing or delaying dosing by up to  72 hours, will return to bioequivalence range 
(80 – 125%)  within  the 2nd  or 3rd dose after the change. As such, it  is agreed that a one-off change in 
the day of weekly administration  can be made as long as the  advance or delay is less than or equal to 
3 days. Similarly, if a dose is missed, as a one-off, it can be administered provided no more than  3 
days have elapsed since the missed dose. Accordingly, section 4.2 of the SmPC provides adequate 
directions.  
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatrogon with  reference to the 
intravenous route has not been determined. This was acceptable to the  CHMP. 
No immunogenic response was observed in any somatrogon cohort. 
Bioequivalence  in  terms  of  AUCt  and  AUC∞  between  the  two  formulations  (pen  and  vial)  was 
demonstrated in  a phase 1 study. The lower bound of the 90%  confidence interval for the ratio of Cmax 
was  below  80%  and  therefore  bioequivalence  for  this  parameter  was  not  demonstrated,  however 
bioequivalence analyses were performed on baseline normalised PD markers IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, which 
demonstrated bioequivalence. Use  of baseline corrected values for these  endogenous PD markers is in 
line with  the  relevant guidance. In general, safety was comparable between formulations, although  the 
limitations  in the comparisons of safety profiles in a crossover study design are acknowledged.  
As part of standard of care, injection sites are rotated for medications administered by SC injection to 
avoid potential  injection site reactions, including  lipoatrophy. Whilst  there are no comparative 
bioavailability data for describing somatrogon PK parameters after injection at different sites, there are 
data from studies of administration of rhGH, which  show no differences in IGF-1  levels following 
injection at different sites. Thus, any differences in bioavailability between the sites do not  appear to 
have clinical relevance. The instructions  for rotating  the injection site in Section 4.2 of the SmPC are 
considered acceptable. 
Elimination 
The applicant has presented no discussion on the metabolism or excretion of somatrogon, which is 
likely via proteolytic catabolism. This was accepted by the CHMP.   
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In healthy volunteers, somatrogon exposure increased more than proportionally to the increase in 
dose. However, in the phase 2 study in adult subjects with  GHD linear PK over a ~40-fold  dose range 
was shown. Further, sparse sampling in the  phase 2 study in paediatric subjects with  GHD suggested 
approximately dose proportional increases in exposure in terms of Cmax and AUCinf.  
Following  multiple weekly administrations of somatrogon, no relevant accumulation of somatrogon is 
expected in children with  GHD.  
Intra-  and inter-individual variability 
Intra-individual variability was not formally evaluated, and this was found acceptable by the CHMP. 
Inter-individual variability in somatrogon PK in paediatric GHD patients is moderate to high. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Somatrogon was not administered to healthy paediatric subjects and therefore no direct comparison 
with  paediatric GHD subjects included in studies CP-4-004 and CP-4-006  is possible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 52/127 
 
 
 
In the phase 2  study CP-4-004, the PK of somatrogon was evaluated in 42 paediatric subjects with 
GHD naïve to treatment  with rhGH.  Somatrogon exposure appeared to increase in a dose-dependent 
manner. The mean T1/2 for somatrogon for each dosing group, ranged between 18.3 to 36.1  hours, 
supportive of once weekly dosing. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data were collected throughout  the clinical development programme and the applicant 
has  submitted  an  integrated  summary  of  immunogenicity  discussing  results  from  pivotal  paediatric 
studies supporting the proposed indication.   
The  incidence of  ADAs appeared to  be  dose related  in  phase  II study  CP-4-004  in  paediatric  subjects 
with  GHD  with  no  ADAs reported  in  the  lowest  dose  (0.25  mg/kg  sc  QW)  cohort  and  a  comparable 
incidence in  the  0.48  mg/kg and  0.66  mg/kg  groups (33  and 35 %  respectively). They also  appeared 
transient in this study with lower incidence at 12 months relative to 6 months treatment (5/42 and 10/42 
respectively). A comparison of ADA positive and  negative groups in  terms of PD response (IGF-1  SDS) 
and efficacy in terms of annualised HV or change in height SDS did not indicate a relevant effect of ADAs.  
Higher incidence of ADAs was reported in paediatric relative to adult studies, with the majority of subjects 
(84  of 109;  ≈77 %)  testing  positive for ADAs over the  course of  the  pivotal phase III study  CP-4-006 
with incidence in adult studies ≈8-11 %. It is noted that this represents a higher incidence than observed 
in  the  CP-4-004  PII  DRF  study,  the  cause  of  the  apparent  heterogeneity  in  the  incidence  of 
immunogenicity is not clear. In general, these ADAs were specific for hGH rather than CTP, and very few 
were reported as neutralising (3 positive NAb test results, among the 397 somatrogon samples assessed 
for  neutralizing  antibody  activity  which  the  applicant  notes  fell  within  the  false  positive  range for  the 
neutralizing  assay. NAb  in  these  subjects  did  not  result  in  a  significant  effect of  IGF-1  SDS nor  mean 
height  velocity. Again, a comparison ADA positive and  negative groups in  terms of PD response (IGF-1 
SDS) and efficacy in  terms of annualised HV or change in  height  SDS did  not indicate  a relevant effect 
of ADAs.  ADAs were higher in the somatrogon treated group relative to somatropin (Genotropin) treated 
subjects (≈10% incidence).  
ADA positive subjects appear to exhibit a higher incidence of injection site reactions. See Clinical Safety 
for further discussion. 
The population PK analysis of Phase 3 paediatric data showed a proportional decrease of 25.8% in CL/F 
when subjects tested positive for ADA. The reduction in clearance can be explained because somatrogon 
is a protein with  a small molecular weight  (~30  kDa). As such, the ADA immune complexes are usually 
sustaining  in  nature  due to  neonatal Fc  receptor (FcRn)  mediated recycling, resulting  in  a  reduction in 
clearance (Wang  et  al.  2016).  The  reduction  in  CL/F  corresponded with  an  estimated 45%  increase in 
the average somatrogon concentration at steady state,  based on post hoc estimates.  
The  increased  somatrogon  concentrations  due  to  development  of  ADA  are  not  likely  to  be  clinically 
significant  as  there  were no  dose  related adverse reactions among  the  paediatric  subjects  enrolled in 
CP-4-004  and  there was no  apparent relationship  between the  average somatrogon concentration and 
height velocity after the  first year of treatment in  the same subjects. 
Special populations 
•  Renal impairment 
Given that  somatrogon is expected to be primarily degraded by proteolytic catabolism, the lack of 
specific studies in  patients with  renal impairment is considered acceptable. It is accepted that 
somatrogon is expected to  have low renal clearance and it is acknowledged that  there are no data on 
the use of somatrogon in paediatric patients with  renal impairment. Therefore, it is not possible to 
determine whether or not a dose adjustment  is necessary.

EMA/15620/2022  
Page 53/127 
 
 
 
•  Hepatic  impairment 
Given that  somatrogon is expected to be primarily degraded by proteolytic catabolism, the lack of 
specific studies in  patients with  hepatic impairment is considered acceptable. The applicant discussed 
that  liver cirrhosis/hepatic impairment is not a relevant concomitant  or secondary medical condition in 
the paediatric target population. As well, the degradation of somatrogon is expected to  be similar to 
proteins via ubiquitous  proteolytic catabolism. Therefore, no dedicated study to investigate PK in 
subjects with hepatic impairment was performed. This argumentation can be followed based on the 
intended indication in  paediatrics only. 
•  Gender 
It is agreed that  a dose adjustment based on gender is not  warranted in pre-pubertal children with 
GHD. 
•  Race 
Based on the existing data, it is agreed that  a dose adjustment based on race is not  warranted in  pre-
pubertal children with GHD. 
•  Weight 
Body weight  has a significant impact on somatrogon PK and the use of weight-based (mg/kg) dosing is 
endorsed for paediatric GHD patients. 
In the population PK analysis PMAR-EQDD-C031c-DP3-853, simulations for a weekly dose of 0.66 
mg/kg showed that  children with  lower BW had a higher exposure than children with  higher body 
weight.  Compared to a 15  kg child, the  exposure ratio was 1.1 for a 10 kg patient  and 0.7 for a 54  kg 
patient.  This level of variability is considered acceptable.  
•  Age 
Somatrogon is indicated for the treatment of children with GHD. At the  proposed dose of 0.66 
mg/kg/week, the Cavg,ss for children in 6 to 12 years age group is predicted to be approximately 35% 
lower than children from <6 years, due to difference in body weight between the two  groups. This 
variability in  exposure is considered acceptable.  
It is agreed that  additional dosing adjustment for age is not required over the range of 3  to 10 years.  
Interactions 
The  applicant has  conducted  an in  vitro  study,  which  aimed to  assess the  potential  for  somatrogon to 
act as an inducer of hepatic CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 mRNA. As well as standard positive controls, the 
induction potential of somatropin was also assessed. For CYP1A2, CYP2B6, the presented results suggest 
the  risk of  clinically relevant induction  is low  and  no  further in  vivo characterisation is  warranted.  The 
results that  are reported in the  submitted  study suggest  that  somatrogon is  a weak inducer of CYP3A4 
(>  2-fold  ≈  5-10  fold  vehicle  control  expression).  Although,  as  per  the  EMAs  ‘Guideline  on  the 
investigation  of  drug  interactions’  (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.  1  Corr.  2**),  this  positive  in  vitro  finding 
should be confirmed by an invivo study,  it  is considered that  given this  is  a known class related effect, 
this was adequately addressed through inclusion  of appropriate wording in  section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The applicant has conducted an in vitro assessment of the potential for the CTP component of somatrogon 
to  interact  with  commercial pregnancy tests  leading  to  a  potential  false  positive  result  or  to  interfere 
with  hCG detection  resulting  in  a  possible false negative  result.  Somatrogon was spiked  at  a range  of 
concentrations  in  serum  and  urine  samples  which  were  then  used  to  assess the  risk  of  positive  test 
results  in  a  blood  pregnancy  test  and  a  number  of  commercially  available  urine  pregnancy  kits 
respectively. The potential for interference with hCG was also assessed. No false positive or false negative 
Assessment report

results were recorded in the study. Although it is considered unlikely that unchanged somatrogon will be 
present in urine, no discussion has been provided on somatrogon metabolism or elimination and/or the 
potential effects of somatrogon subunits/metabolites which may be present in urine on urine pregnancy 
test  efficacy. There is  no  expectation  that  smaller polypeptide  portions  of  somatrogon would  interfere 
with  pregnancy  tests  and  this  is  considered  to  be  a  theoretical  risk only,  which  was  accepted  by  the 
CHMP.   
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
Study CP-4-004  
In this phase 2 study, the PD parameters of somatrogon and somatropin were evaluated in  42 and 11 
paediatric subjects with  GHD naïve to treatment  with rhGH, respectively. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 increased 
dose dependently following weekly somatrogon administration.  Mean peak IGF-1 concentrations were 
observed at 48 hours following SC administration  of somatrogon, which is consistent with  other 
studies. 
The IGF-1 profiles of subjects who received weekly somatrogon (0.48 and 0.66 mg/kg/week) were 
reasonably comparable to that  of subjects who received daily somatropin (Genotropin 0.034 
mg/kg/day). Considering that  patients did not receive a weight-based dose adjustment between weeks 
26 - 52,  the median IGF-1  levels did not point to  obvious differences between PD responses of the  0.48 
and the 0.66  mg/kg/week doses (neither did the IGF-1 SDS levels) over one year of treatment. It was 
noted that  the decision of recommending 0.66  mg/kg/wk for the phase III study was not solely based 
on the results gained from the phase II PK and PD results but also on the observed efficacy and safety. 
The somatrogon dose of 0.25  mg/kg/week failed to maintain  normal IGF-1 serum levels throughout 
the week, indicating that  IGF-1 levels will be at the lower part of the normal range or even below it 
with  the use of this  dose on a weekly basis. 
During the OLE portion, IGF-1 levels continuously  increased, with significant  increases in year 4 in 
some patients.  It is noted that  in year 4 all patients were switched to  the pen formulation. A broad 
range of individual IGF-1 levels was seen which  could probably be due to high  titers of developed ADAs 
in certain patients. As normal IGF-1 levels in adolescents are usually substantially higher than in 
younger children, it is supportive that  the relevant measure of IGF-1 SDS level was overall shown to 
be maintainable below the upper limit  of +2  SDS over time with  the proposed dose. Considering this, it 
is probably not the  pen formulation that  resulted in increased levels.   
Study CP-4-006  
In this phase 3 study, the PD parameters of somatrogon and somatropin (Genotropin 0.034 
mg/kg/day) were evaluated in 109 and 115  paediatric subjects with  GHD, respectively. Consistent with 
study CP-4-004,  mean IGF-1 SDS values were higher in  the somatrogon group than those in the 
somatropin group. Mean IGF-SDS levels in the somatrogon group also increased gradually over time. 
At the proposed somatrogon dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week, subjects transitioned from negative IGF-1 SDS 
values to positive IGF-1 SDS during the 12-month  treatment  period. IGF-1 SDS values in the 
somatropin group) approached 0 across the post-baseline visits. IGFBP-3 SDS values remained near 0 
SDS for both treatment groups. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical secondary pharmacology studies were conducted. This is acceptable since the secondary PD 
effects of rhGH are well known.  
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 55/127 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
It is acceptable that  no PD interaction studies were conducted. PD interactions with  regard to corticoids 
and insulin were expected as known from marketed daily GH products. 
Genetic  differences in PD response 
It is not to  be expected that  genetic differences modulate the  pharmacodynamic response in children 
with  growth hormone deficiency. 
Population PK/PD analyses  based on the Phase  2 study CP-4-004 
Two population PK/PD analyses were performed using data from paediatric GHD subjects enrolled in 
the Phase 2 study  CP-4-004.  
In the first analysis, the  indirect-response PD model previously developed by Sun et  al. was used to 
link somatrogon concentrations to IGF-1 production.  
The final paediatric model appeared to fit the paediatric data, although the VPCs were difficult to 
interpret. The PK/PD parameters support the positive effect of somatrogon on IGF-1 levels. Baseline 
IGF-1 was observed to increase with age, which is a known physiologic change.  
In a supplemental analysis, peak IGF-1 SDS over the dosing interval was well predicted by values 
obtained on Day 2 post dose, while  the mean IGF-1 SDS over the  dosing interval was well predicted by 
values obtained on Day 4 post dose. This is consistent  with  other analyses. 
In the second study, the  IGF-1 concentration data following administration of somatrogon was 
adequately characterized by an indirect response model, in which the  production rate of IGF-1 was 
stimulated by somatrogon. The diagnostic plots and VPCs for the final model indicate that the model 
describes the data reasonably well. The results demonstrate the positive effect of somatrogon on IGF-1 
levels. Baseline IGF-1 was observed to vary with time  since study start, which  is consistent with  other 
analyses. Baseline IGF-1 also varied with  height.  It was considered that the positive correlation 
between height and IGF-1 at baseline may be due to  the fact that  patients having higher IGF-1 
concentrations before treatment started had grown more up to that  point in  time.  
Based on simulations, the majority of paediatric GHD patients are predicted to remain within  the 
clinical target range of -2 to  +2 at trough IGF-1 SDS, peak IGF-1 SDS and 4 days post dose after 4 
years of somatrogon administration. Given that  IGF-1 SDS on Day 4 post dose approximates average 
values over the dosing interval, the findings provide support for the proposed somatrogon dose of 0.66 
mg/kg/wk for the treatment  of GHD in children.  
Efforts to link somatrogon concentrations with  height velocity were unsuccessful. This is consistent 
with  the primary efficacy endpoint analysis result for the main study of Study CP-4-004. 
Population PK/PD analysis based on the Phase  3 study CP-4-006 
Consistent with  previous analyses, an indirect-response Emax model fitted the  IGF-1 data well and the 
PK/PD parameters supported the positive effect of somatrogon on IGF-1 levels.  
Also consistent  with previous analyses, the EC50 was 56.6 ng/mL,  which is considerably lower than  the 
popPK-modelled Cmax of 690 ng/mL  in GHD children administered 0.66 mg/kg/wk (and provides 
support for the efficacy of the  proposed dose in GHD children. 
Mean and median of modelled mean IGF-1 values increased over time during the treatment  period, 
which emphasises the need for IGF-1  monitoring and dose adjustment of somatrogon if needed. 
The supplemental PD analyses confirmed that  the most representative time to assess the mean IGF-1 
SDS value over the weekly dosing interval was 96 hours after dosing. IGF-1 samples obtained early 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 56/127 
 
 
 
(<72  hours) in  the dosing interval may overestimate the mean IGF-1 SDS. This is consistent with  the 
previous analysis of IGF-1 values from study CP-4-004. As such, when the goal of monitoring  clinical 
therapy is to  estimate mean IGF-1 SDS value during the  dosing interval, clinical samples should be 
obtained close to 96  hours post-dose. 
In view of a lower frequency of expected safety concerns compared to daily rGH, no specific safety 
exposure-response analyses were performed. For the patients that  suffered from most severe injection 
site pain no consistent pattern for ADAs or the  somatrogon AUC could be established. This is 
acceptable. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that the  pharmacology of somatrogon has been investigated to  a satisfactory 
extent.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy

In treatment Period I, eligible patients  were to be randomised in a 1:1:1:1  ratio to one of three 
somatrogon cohorts, or to a somatropin cohort.   
During the Period II of a six months, open-label, continuous  dosing period, additional efficacy and 
safety data were to  be collected. Patients were to be kept on the originally allocated dose 
levels/dose. 
Period III and Period IV 
Patients who completed Periods I and II in the  Main Study were eligible to continue into  an 
ongoing, open-label extension (OLE) period (Period III) for 12 months  after completion of the Main 
Study and could also continue into a long-term OLE period (Period IV) after completing 12 months 
in Period III. The design of the  Period IV OLE trial is described later in this  report. 
Study participants 
Patients were to meet all inclusion criteria and not  meet any exclusion criteria to participate in 
this  study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to other studies in the development 
programme. 
Treatments  
Patients were to administer a weekly dose of one of the three different dose strengths of somatrogon 
based on equal molar conversion of the  weekly cumulative somatropin  dose. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was: 
1.  To compare the safety, efficacy and tolerability of three somatrogon doses to that  of a 
commercially available standard daily somatropin formulation (Genotropin), in pre-pubertal 
children with  growth failure due to insufficient  secretion of endogenous GH. 
The secondary objectives were: 
1.  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of three different 
doses of somatrogon in pre-pubertal GHD children. 
2.  To select the  optimal dose of somatrogon for the subsequent Phase 3 study on the basis of 
safety and efficacy.

Efficacy Evaluations 
Primary Efficacy endpoint 
•  Annualized HV at 12 months expressed in cm/year 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  HV at six months 
•  Change in HTSDS (ΔHTSDS) at six months  (from Screening) 
•  ΔHTSDS at 12  months (from Screening) 
Sample  Size 
A sample size of up to  14 patients per cohort was chosen for this  pilot investigation, to obtain  up 
to 10 patients  per cohort having ppGH stimulation  test levels ≤ 7 ng/ml  and up  to four patients  per 
cohort with  ppGH levels > 7 and ≤ 10 ng/ml.   The justifications  for this  sample size are based on 
feasibility, precision about the mean and variance, and regulatory considerations as previously 
described in the literature. 
Randomisation and  blinding 
This was an open-label study. Due to different dose frequencies and dosing techniques, it was not 
practical to  employ any blinding methods. A double-blind double-dummy design in this  indication 
was deemed to be unethical. The sponsor was not  blinded to the data at any time. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics, namely sample size (n), mean, SD, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and 
range for the continuous variables and counts  and percentages for the categorical variables, were to be 
computed. Statistical summaries were to  be reported by cohort. 
Results 
Disposition of Patients 
A total of 56 patients from 14 centres in seven countries were randomised in the study.  Three patients 
were randomised and withdrew consent prior to  receiving any study medication. Fifty-three patients 
(17 female and 36 male) were enrolled and received study investigational medication or somatropin 
(Genotropin).  No patients were removed or withdrew from participation  prematurely post dosing. The 
treatment groups were similar in their baseline characteristics. 
Summary of main  efficacy results 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the main study was the annual HV at 12 months.  A summary of HV 
data at 12 months  is presented below.  
At the 12 month  visit, mean HV in  the FAS population  for the MOD-4023  cohorts were 10.4  (95% CI: 
8.9, 12.0),  11.0  (95% CI: 9.7, 12.2),  and 11.4 (95%  CI: 9.2,  13.7) cm/year in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively.  The mean HV  for the Genotropin group was 12.5 cm/year (95% CI: 11.0-13.9  cm/year).  
HV does not  appear to differ substantially across MOD-4023  dose levels. Growth did however appear to 
increase with  the dose level.  The 95% CI for each of the MOD-4023  cohorts overlap with  the CI for

Genotropin, with the  highest MOD-4023  dose group (Cohort 3, 0.66 mg/kg/week) having the closest 
mean value.  Results for the PP population differ only for Cohort 3,  the assigned cohort for patient 
08003  who was determined to be ineligible following  study completion.  Mean HV  is higher with  the 
exclusion of this patient  (11.9 cm/year; 95% CI 9.8-14.1). 
Secondary Endpoints 
Height  Velocity (cm/year) at 6 months 
The mean HV at six months for the  Genotropin cohort was 15.0 (95% CI: 13.1,  16.9). Results in the 
MOD-4023  cohorts at six months were 11.8  (95% CI: 9.6, 13.9),  12.5 (95%  CI: 11.1,  13.8),  and 13.0 
(95% CI: 9.9, 16.0)  for Cohorts 1-3, respectively.  The 95% CI for all MOD-4023  cohorts overlaps the 
Genotropin CI.  Additionally, data from the MOD-4023  cohorts are further suggestive of a dose 
response trend. 
Change in  HTSDS at Six and 12  Months 
Mean change in  HTSDS improved from six months to  12 months in all cohorts.  In the  FAS Population, 
at 12 months,  the mean change in HTSDS for the Genotropin cohort was 1.51  (range 0.82,  2.38). 
Mean HTSDS change at the 12 Month  time point  for the  MOD-4023 cohorts was 1.09 (range 0.32, 
2.15),  1.19 (range 0.28, 2.05),  and 1.35 (range 0.06, 2.47)  for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Conclusion 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the annual HV at 12 months.  
At the 12  month visit, mean HV in the FAS population for the somatrogon cohorts were 10.4  (95% CI: 
8.9, 12.0),  11.0  (95% CI: 9.7, 12.2),  and 11.4 (95%  CI: 9.2,  13.7) cm/year in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively.  The mean HV for the  somatropin group was 12.5 cm/year (95% CI: 11.0-13.9  cm/year).  
HV does not  appear to differ substantially  across somatrogon dose levels. Growth  did however appear 
to increase with  the dose level.  The 95%  CI for each of the somatrogon cohorts overlap with  the CI for 
somatropin, with  the highest somatrogon dose group (cohort 3,  0.66 mg/kg/week) having the closest 
mean value.   
These results were confirmed in the sensitivity analyses and were also reflected in the results of the 
secondary efficacy outcomes, as described above. 
Based on the results of this study, the decision was made to use the 0.66mg/kg/day dose.  
2.6.5.2.  Main  study(ies) 
Study CP-4-006 
This was a phase 3, open-label, randomised, multicentre, 12 months,  efficacy and safety study of 
weekly MOD-4023  compared to daily Genotropin therapy in pre-pubertal children with  growth hormone 
deficiency.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Patients enrolled were pre-pubertal children aged ≥3  years old and <11  years for girls or <12  years for 
boys with  either isolated GHD, or GH insufficiency as part of multiple pituitary  hormone deficiencies. 
They were also treatment naïve. 
The diagnosis of GHD was confirmed by two  different growth hormone stimulation  tests, defined as a 
peak GH level of ≤10  ng/mL, determined with a validated assay. 
Additional criteria for enrolment were IGF-I SDS ≤‒1.0,  and delayed bone age (BA) was not older than 
chronological age (CA) and < 10  for females and < 11 for males. Annualized HV below the 25th 
percentile for CA (HV  < -0.7 SDS) and gender was assessed according to the  OPKO HV (Tanner, Prader 
and Hermanussen). Subjects born small for gestational age, with  idiopathic short stature,  or with  other 
causes of short stature were excluded. 
During the screening phase, patients had a head Magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) with  contrast if 
possible after two GH  stimulation tests,  to ensure the inclusion/exclusion criteria were met and to 
determine the  underlying GH cause. 
•  Treatments 
Somatrogon and somatropin were both administered SC. Somatrogon was given in the morning hours 
once weekly, using the delivery device (pen), somatropin was given in the evening/bedtime hours once 
daily, using the delivery device (Genotropin pen). Both treatments  were administered into  the upper 
arms, buttocks,  thighs, or abdomen (8 locations used, and these were rotated).  The doses of 
somatrogon and somatropin were assessed every 3 months  based on patient’s body weight. Doses 
were determined by the  IRT system and included an automatic rounding – either up or down. Doses 
could be decreased for safety reasons according to the pre-defined dose-adjustment criteria (based on 
the severity of AEs or repeated, elevated levels of IGF-1 SDS). 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that  weekly MOD-4023  administration is non-inferior to 
daily Genotropin administration at  52 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 62/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy objectives were: 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly MOD-4023  administration. 
To demonstrate successful operation (single injection) of the MOD-4023  single patient use, multi-dose, 
disposable pre-filled pen (PEN). 
• 
• 
Evaluation of participant and observer feedback on MOD-4023 device usability. 
To confirm the correct operation of devices returned for evaluation. 
Objective of the open-label extension (LT-OLE): 
To demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy of MOD-4023  in an OLE. 
Other objectives: 
To evaluate the effect of weekly MOD-4023  and daily somatropin (Genotropin) administration on QoL, 
as measured by the QoLISSY in a specific number of countries (determined by availability of validated 
translated tools) during the first 12  months of treatment. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint during the main study is the Annual HV in cm/year after 12 months of 
treatment. 
HV (cm/year) at Visit 8 (12  months) = (Ht  at Visit  8 ─ Ht  at Visit 2)/((Date  of Visit 8 ─ Date  of Visit 
2)/365.25); 
where Visit  2 is the Baseline visit. 
(Note:  HV at any other post-baseline Visit xx is also computed using formula above by replacing Visit 8 
with  Visit xx). 
The aim of the study was to demonstrate that  in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint,  Annual Height 
Velocity at 12  months, weekly somatrogon is non-inferior to daily somatropin by a non-inferiority 
margin of 1.8  cm/year. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Auxology/Clinical): 
•  Annualized HV after 6 months  of treatment; 
•  Change in Ht  SDS at 6 and 12 months, compared to Baseline; 
•  Change in bone maturation  (BM) at the end of 12 months, compared to Screening bone age 
(BM calculated as BA/CA). 
Biochemical Endpoints:   
•  Absolute IGF-1 and IGF-1 SDS levels on day 4(-1)  after MOD-4023  dosing across study visits; 
• 
IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 SDS levels at on day 4(-1) after MOD-4023 dosing across study visits. 
Safety endpoints: included adverse events, serious adverse events, incidence of anti-somatrogon 
antibodies. Biochemistry, lipids, thyroid function,  fundoscopy, ECG. 
During the LTE study the main endpoints were:

Auxology/Clinical Endpoints:

•  Change in height SDS every 12 months (compared to the previous values). 
•  Change in bone maturation  (BM) every 12 months, (compared to Week 52  BA) 
(calculated as BA/CA) at  completion of LT-OLE  year 1 and to  previous values from LT-OLE  year 
2 onwards). 
Biochemical Endpoints:   
• 
• 
IGF-1 and IGF-1 SDS levels on day 4  (-1) after MOD-4023 dosing across study visits. 
IGFBP-3 levels and IGFBP-3 SDS on day 4  (-1) after MOD-4023 dosing across study 
visits. 
•  Sample size 
The non-inferiority (NI)  margin for annual HV for was set at -1.8  cm/yr and detailed in the End of 
Phase 2 (Type B). This NI  was based on the following considerations: 
From historical data, HV response for the  first year of daily GH ranged from 10.2 cm/yr, SD= 2.5 
(Wilton  and Gunnarsson, 1988)  to 11.4 cm/yr, SD=2.5 (MacGillivray et al., 1996).  Using the standard 
deviation (SD) of 2.5 from these references, a non-inferiority NI margin of -1.8 cm/yr is well within  1 
SD of the expected results, and approximately 23% of the reference treatment response distribution 
would be below this value. 
Assuming the HV response for daily GH treatment is 11.5  cm/yr in the first year, a margin of -1.8 
cm/yr would  show that 84%  of the  growth rate from the reference daily GH treatment effect on the 
approved active control is retained. 
The use of -1.8  cm/yr is the more conservative value based on the precedent set with these other 
studies. 
The following assumptions were made in  the sample size calculation: 
•  2-sided alpha of 0.05.  80 % power. 
•  Between-patient SD of annual growth rate is 2.5 cm/year in all treatment  groups. 
•  Non-inferiority margin is -1.8 cm/year. 
• 
The true mean treatment difference (MOD-4023  – Genotropin) is -0.8 cm/year. 
With  these assumptions, 100  patients per group will  provide 80 % power for the non-inferiority test. 
To allow for an approximate 10 % dropout rate, 110 patients  were randomised to each treatment 
group (Total N=220  patients). 
•  Randomisation and  Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation: 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in  a 1:1  ratio (centralized randomization for each region as 
defined in the stratification factors) to 1 of 2 treatment groups, MOD-4023  or somatropin (Genotropin) 
reference therapy) for 12  months. 
Patients were stratified  based on: 
• 
Peak GH levels (≤3 ng/mL;  >3 to ≤7  ng/mL; and >7 to  ≤10a ng/mL) 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 64/127 
 
 
 
 
•  CA (≥3 years to ≤ 7 years, 0 days; and > 7  years, 0 days.) 
•  Regions: 1.  Western Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA; 2. Central and 
Eastern Europe, Greece, Turkey, Latin America and Asia except for India and Vietnam; 3. India 
and Vietnam 
Blinding 
Due to  different administration  frequencies for the treatment  arms (somatrogon was administered 
once-weekly versus somatropin administered daily), the  study was conducted in an open-label. 
The applicant had a detailed blinding  and unblinding  plan in place. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis of primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint, annualized height velocity at  week 52, was compared between somatrogon and 
daily somatropin by a non-inferiority comparison with  a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 cm/year. 
For the primary and secondary endpoint analyses performed by ANCOVA, multiple  imputation 
assuming missing not at random using SAS PROC MI was used to impute missing results. 
The imputation was by treatment group. The imputation model included the randomization 
stratification factors and baseline height standard deviation score (SDS). For the primary endpoint, 
annual HV, the imputed  value in the somatrogon group was reduced by 1.8 cm/yr, the non-inferiority 
margin to avoid imputing  to the common mean (Koch 2008). 
Non-inferiority was concluded if the  lower bound of the two-sided 95%  CI for the mean treatment 
difference "somatrogon – somatropin", in  the primary efficacy endpoint was ≥-1.8 cm/year. 
The CI for the difference of means between the two treatments  was derived from an ANCOVA. The 
ANCOVA model included classification terms for treatment,  age group, gender, peak GH levels, and 
region. The model also included baseline height SDS as a covariate. The determination of non-
inferiority was based on least squares means for the two  treatments from the  ANCOVA and the 95% CI 
of the differences between the  treatments. 
Descriptive statistics were reported for observed and change from baseline annual HV values at  12 
months. 
Once the  primary endpoint of non-inferiority of somatrogon in  comparison to Genotropin was met, an 
assessment of superiority of somatrogon over Genotropin at 12 months was performed. Superiority 
was achieved if the lower bound of the two-sided  95% CI for the mean HV difference of somatrogon – 
somatropin was ≥  0 cm/year. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses: 
A similar ANCOVA model as used for the primary endpoint was used to analyse: 
• 
• 
• 
annualized HV at 6 months 
change in height SDS at 6 months 
change in height SDS at 12  months 
Least square mean estimates for the two  treatments and the 95% CI of the  difference between the 
treatments were presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 65/127 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics were reported for each of these endpoints. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the  robustness of the result using a tipping  point approach 
with  the Full  Analysis Set. Specifically, a shift  parameter was used to incrementally adjust  the imputed 
values in the  somatrogon arm. 
Values were to be shifted  downwards in increments of 0.1 cm/year until  the analysis no longer 
supported comparability. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
536 patients  were screened, 308 were not randomised (263  screen failures). 228  Patients were 
randomised, 4 were not treated (3 withdrawn,  1 lost to follow up). 224  patients received 1 dose.  109 
received somatrogon, 115 somatropin; 1 patient  from each withdrew, leaving 108 and 114 completing 
the study respectively.

The study was initiated in April 2017.   First Subject First Visit  date was 19 April 2017.  The study 
Completion Date, as per Last  Subject Last  Visit: 23 August 2019. 
•  Conduct of the study 
There were a few protocol amendments that  were submitted  to regulatory authorities.  Some country-
specific amendments were developed in response to requests by a specific Health  Authority.  
This study was conducted in compliance with  the ethical principles originating in or derived from the 
Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with  all ICH GCP Guidelines. In addition,  all local regulatory 
requirements were followed. 
All analyses were carried out as detailed in the final SAP (Version 4.0,  14 June 2019),  with some 
exceptions, which  were justified. 
Minor protocol deviations were recorded for a few subjects for the LT-OLE laboratory data. The OLE 
laboratory data were excluded from the main study laboratory data and the main study laboratory data 
for the 12-month  visit were used for analyses. 
•  Baseline  data 
Baseline demographic and other characteristics were balanced across both treatment groups. 
The mean age was 7.72  years, 40.2 % were aged between 3 and 7 years, with  59.8% older than 7 
years of age. 71.9%  were males and 28.1 % females. 
The majority of patients were Caucasian 71.9% followed by Asians which accounted for 20.1%  with 
very small percentages from other races. 
At baseline height  cm was similar between both cohorts 109.8 cm for somatrogon, and 110.5  cm for 
somatropin. 
Peak GH level per group (≤3  ng/mL; >3  to ≤7 ng/mL;  and >7  to ≤10a ng/mL)  were similar. 
Bone age mean (SD) was 5.46 in somatrogon and 5.19  in somatropin, bone maturation  mean (ratio of 
BA to  CA) (SD) was 0.68  in somatrogon and 0.65  in somatropin.  Height (SDS) mean (SD) was -2.94 
in somatrogon and -2.78  in somatropin.

IGF-1  SDS 
IGF-1 SDS values approached 0 at 1-month  post-baseline in the somatrogon group and remained in 
the target range up to 12 months,  whereas in the somatropin group, IGF-1  SDS values remained near 
0 at all post-baseline visits. 
Serum IGF-1 concentrations were to  have been measured on Day 3 or 4 post-dose, as this  was 
determined to  represent the best estimate of the mean IGF-1 SDS over the  dosing interval. 
Throughout the study,  however, samples were obtained at variable timepoints  post-dose, including 
some on Day 2 or 3 post-dose and other samples obtained on Day 5 or 6 post-dose. In order to be 
able to interpret the IGF-1 results, a post-hoc modelling analysis was performed in order to  allow for 
the estimation of the mean IGF-1 SDS value over the dosing interval. 
Consequently, results for IGF-1 and IGF- 1 SDS values are presented as both  the raw study  data 
(below), and modelled IGF-1 SDS values were presented. 
Mean IGF-1 SDS values in the  somatrogon group approached 0 as early as 1-month post-baseline and 
remained above 0 up to 12  months. Mean IGF-1 SDS values in the  somatropin group remained near 0 
SDS at all post-baseline visits, ranging from -0.69  SDS to -0.16 SDS.

Change in Bone Age (BA) relative to the change in Chronological Age(CA) at month 12 is (BA at month 12 - BA at 
baseline) divided by (CA at month 12 - CA at baseline). Chronological age was determined based on the assessment 
date. Source Data: 16.2.6.4.1  
Other  Efficacy-Related Endpoints 
Quality  of Life 
QoL (as an exploratory endpoint) was assessed using the QoLISSY questionnaire. The raw scores were 
transformed to a scale of 0 to 100. 
The QoLISSY questionnaire was completed in 8 countries (determined by the availability of the 
validated translated tools) at  baseline and at 12 months.  Two versions of the QoLISSY were used in a 
dyadic approach to  assess the parent (children <  7 years) and child’s (>  7 years of age) assessment of 
QoL. 
Both the QoLISSY-CHILD and QoLISSY-PARENT demonstrated that  both  treatment groups had similar 
increases in core total  scores and subscale scores from baseline at 12 months,  indicating similar 
improvements in QoL following treatment  with somatrogon administered once weekly or somatropin 
administered once daily. 
Long-term efficacy 
212 of 222  subjects who completed 12 months of the CP-4-006  main study period continued into  the 
OLE period. As of the cut-off date of 01 November 2019,  efficacy data was available for 94 subjects at 
Month  18 (6 months  of OLE),  and 9 subjects at  Month 24  in the OLE period (12 months of OLE).

Patients who were receiving somatropin (Genotropin) were switched  to weekly somatrogon.  
Annualized HV with once weekly somatrogon treatment  remained above baseline through the OLE 
period. The annualized HV for subjects who switched from somatropin to somatrogon at the  beginning 
of the OLE period was consistent  with subjects who received somatrogon during the main study and 
throughout  the OLE period. 
Given the cut-off  date, no subject in the  CP-4-006 OLE had achieved final height. as of the data cut-off 
date of 01 November 2019.

HT SDS values also improved with  weekly somatrogon treatment in  the main study period, and this 
trend was maintained over time in the OLE period.  Improvements in change in HT  SDS from baseline 
and HT SDS for subjects who  switched from somatropin to somatrogon at  the beginning of the OLE 
period were consistent with  subjects who  received somatrogon during the main study and throughout 
the OLE period. 
IGF-1 SDS values with  weekly somatrogon treatment  approached 0 early in the main study period and 
remained in the target  therapeutic range through the OLE  period. 
The trend in IGF-1 SDS values in subjects who switched from somatropin to  somatrogon at the

Study CP-4-004 OLE 
This was a safety and dose finding study of different MOD-4023 dose levels compared to daily r-hGH 
therapy in  pre-pubertal growth hormone deficient children – open label extension. 
Methods 
This was a phase 2, open label, randomised, multi-centre, dose finding,  and safety study of different 
somatrogon dose levels in pre-pubertal GHD paediatric subjects with  yearly extension until 
marketing approval.  The study consisted of a 6-week screening period, 2 active-controlled 
treatment periods, and 3 OLE periods. 
The main study (Periods I and II) assessed treatment with  3 dose levels of somatrogon (0.25,  0.48, or 
0.66  mg/kg/week) administered weekly via SC injection compared to the active control, daily SC 
injection of rhGH therapy (Genotropin 0.034  mg/kg/day) for up to  12 months. 
Figure 13 
Study diagram for CP-4-004  OLE and  PEN periods 
Subjects who  completed 12 months  of active treatment  in the main study period, remained eligible 
for inclusion in the study, and consented to  participate in the OLE  Study continued  with open label 
treatment until  marketing approval.  There were 3  defined OLE study periods: 
-  OLE period (Period III [Year 1 OLE]):  This period lasted for 12 months  post-completion of the 
main study.  Subjects continued dosing with  the 3 originally assigned dose levels of 
somatrogon (0.25,  0.48,  and 0.66  mg/kg/week).  Subjects originally assigned to daily 
somatropin in the main study were randomly re-assigned to 1 of the 3 somatrogon dose 
levels. 
- 
LT-OLE period (Period IV [Years 2-4  OLE]): This  LT-OLE period was planned to follow the 12 
months in Period III (i.e., to  start from second year of OLE and third  year of the overall 
study).  All eligible subjects were transitioned to  receive somatrogon at a dose of 0.66 
mg/kg/week.

EMA/15620/2022  
Page 75/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
LT-OLE-PEN  period (Period V [PEN]):  Subjects were transitioned to somatrogon 0.66 
mg/kg/week SC administration  using a single subject, multi-dose, disposable pre-filled pen 
device and formulation.  The Period V [PEN]  duration will last until  marketing approval.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
The secondary objective of the OLE Study was to evaluate the growth outcome of somatrogon LT 
treatment beyond the initial  12 months  of the main study, including  following the transition to PEN. 
Annual Height  Velocity 
A summary of the annual HV at the  end of Period III (Year 1 OLE) is provided in Table 6.   The mean 
observed annual HV was similar between the  0.25 mg/kg/week and 0.48 mg/kg/week treatment 
groups but  was higher in the  0.66 mg/kg/week treatment group.

The mean annual HV was the greatest during Year 1 OLE and decreased with every subsequent year 
thereafter.  The mean annual HV for subjects who received somatropin during the main study and 
were switched  to somatrogon during Year 1 OLE  was consistent  with subjects who received 
somatrogon during the main study. 
Annual Height  SDS and Change  in Height  SDS 
The observed mean annual height  SDS was consistent across treatment groups. In general, the mean 
height SDS progressively increased from Year 1 through PEN.

The number of patients who  transitioned from Genotropin to somatrogon was quite low, 
however, it  was overall shown that  patients treated with  somatrogon maintained growth 
velocities in line with  what  would have been expected in this population taking other similar 
medicines. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
In CP-4-006, results of pre-specified subpopulation analyses comparing somatrogon and somatropin 
for the primary efficacy endpoint were generally consistent with  the overall results of the primary 
efficacy endpoint analysis for: 
Age group, Gender, Race, Ethnicity,  Peak GH levels Region; and ADA status.

The available evidence suggests that  the presence of ADAs in somatrogon-treated subjects does not 
compromise the efficacy of somatrogon with  regard to IGF-1 levels or growth normalization. 
Overall, somatrogon administered SC at a dose of 0.66  mg/kg/wk in  a paediatric GHD population did 
not produce immunogenic effects that  interfered with  efficacy outcomes.

Primary Analysis  
All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, defined as subjects who were randomised 
and have received at least one dose of study medication. Subjects were analysed 
according to  the randomised treatment group for all efficacy endpoints. 
The aim of the study was to demonstrate that,  in terms of the  primary efficacy endpoint 
(Annual HV at 12 months),  weekly somatrogon is non-inferior to daily somatropin 
(Genotropin) by a non-inferiority margin of 1.8  cm/year. Non-inferiority was to be 
concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided  95% CI for the mean treatment difference 
"somatrogon – somatropin", in the primary efficacy endpoint is ≥-1.8  cm/year.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
The clinical effects of somatrogon were evaluated in paediatric patients  with growth  hormone 
deficiency. No particular analyses were conducted in study patients  with concomitant  renal or hepatic 
impairment. This was found to be acceptable. 
2.6.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses  and meta-analysis) 
No pooled analysis or meta-analyses were conducted for efficacy. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.6.5.5.  Supportive study 
A phase 3, randomised, multicentre,  open-label, crossover study assessing subject perception of 
treatment burden with  use of weekly growth hormone (somatrogon) versus daily growth hormone 
(Genotropin) injections in children with growth  hormone deficiency. This name of this  study was 
“Patient Perception of Treatment Burden in Weekly Versus Daily Growth Hormone Injections in 
Children With GHD”. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a benefit, defined as superior adherence 
and acceptance, of a once weekly injection schedule to support the benefit/risk profile of somatrogon, 
a long-acting rhGH for SC administration.

Subjects had been stable on treatment with  daily somatropin for a minimum of 3 months prior to 
enrolment. They were then  randomised in a 1:1  ratio to one of 2 sequences, either 12 weeks of 
treatment with  daily somatropin followed by 12 weeks of treatment  with once weekly somatrogon, or 
12 weeks of treatment with  once weekly somatrogon followed by 12  weeks of treatment  with daily 
somatropin. 
Control group 
The active comparator (daily somatropin) and crossover study design were selected in  order to test 
the hypothesis that, for children with GHD, a once weekly treatment  schedule (once weekly 
somatrogon) has a treatment burden that  is less than a daily treatment schedule (somatropin). There 
was no treatment washout period because these participants  must take growth  hormone continually. 
The primary endpoint was treatment burden assessed as the difference in mean overall life 
interference total scores between weekly injection schedule and daily injection schedule as assessed 
by patient life Interference Questionnaire (DCOA) completed by the  subject caregiver at baseline and 
after each treatment schedule experience. 
The DCOA is a COA questionnaire specifically designed for self- or dyad-administration to measure the 
experiences of patients taking rhGH GHD injections in order to  demonstrate significant benefit (in 
terms of better adherence and acceptance) of the weekly injection schedule compared with the daily 
schedule. 
87 subjects were enrolled in the study. The number of participants who were randomised to both 
treatment sequences was comparable. All but 2 participants completed the study.

This study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating the  treatment burden, as evaluated by the 
Patient Life Interference questionnaire, of the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule was lower 
than that  of the once daily somatropin injection schedule. 
-  The least squares mean of the Overall Life Interference total score was lower for the once weekly 
somatrogon injection schedule than for the once daily somatropin injection schedule. 
-  All scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100  scale.  Lower scores 
represent less life interference (better outcome). 
-  The mean difference (somatrogon-somatropin) was -15.49  (95% CI: -19.71,  -11.27)  (range 0-
100). 
-  The difference in mean Overall Life Interference scores for somatrogon once weekly for 12 weeks, 
compared with  administration of somatropin once daily for 12 weeks, was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001).

The estimated mean score differences for most variables within  the DCOA 1 questionnaire showed an 
improvement (i.e., negative estimated mean difference) during the once weekly somatrogon injection 
schedule compared with  the once daily somatropin injection schedule and these differences were 
statistically significant, except for the  following: 
- 
The point estimate of the mean satisfaction with  the overall treatment  experience score was 
lower (ie, improved) for participants in the  once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than 
for participants in the once daily somatropin injection schedule; however, the estimated mean 
difference was not significant (p=0.0739). 
-  Overall mean scores for injection signs and symptoms (for participants 8 years and above) 
and the assessment of signs (as reported by the caregiver for the children aged <8  years) 
were similar between both injection schedules. 
Proportion of Participant/Caregiver Dyads  Responding to the DCOA  2 Questionnaires  at 
Week  24 
The majority of participant/caregiver dyads preferred the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule 
compared with  those who preferred the once daily somatropin injection schedule or expressed no 
difference/no preference between injection schedules for most variables within  the DCOA 2 
questionnaire, except for: 
-  Pen ease of use : Although the  majority of participant/caregiver dyads reported the 
somatrogon pen was easier to use based on preparing the pen, less than half of them 
indicated the somatrogon pen was easier to use for setting  the dose, injecting the medicine, 
and storing the pen. 
-  Most  of the  participant/caregiver dyads responded it would be extremely or very beneficial to 
take injections less often. 
Patient  Global Impression at Week  12 and Week  24 
The once weekly somatrogon injection schedule had less impact on the daily activities than the  once 
daily somatropin injection schedule based on the lower overall mean PGIS-IDA score. 
Overall  conclusion on efficacy 
The results of study C0311002  indicate a preference for weekly injection schedule, based on the 
patient reported outcomes gathered in this study.  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of somatrogon  in  paediatric patients with  growth  hormone deficiency (GHD) was 
evaluated in one phase 2 dose-finding study (CP-4-004  + OLE), a pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006 
+OLE)  and an additional phase 3 patient preference study (C0311002). 
The applicant also submitted  studies in adult patients  with  GHD, however as an indication in this 
population is not requested, these were not further discussed. The dose finding study, which  is 
described in detail in the  above sections, showed that  the 0.66 mg/kg/week selected was appropriate 
to bring forward for phase 3  development.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CP-4-006 was a pivotal, 52-week, randomised, open-label, phase 3  clinical study in  paediatric 
GHD patients. The study was designed to test  that  somatrogon 0.66 mg/kg/wk was non-inferior to 
daily treatment with  somatropin (Genotropin) 0.034  mg/kg/day at 52 weeks.  The applicant received 
advice from the SAWP on the development programme, which was followed for the  most part. Patients 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified based on GH  level, chronological age (CA) 
and region. 
Both the phase 2 study (CP-4-004) and the pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006) had OLE  periods 
designed to  gather further safety and efficacy data. 
The second phase 3  study (C0311002)  was a randomised, multicentre,  open label cross over study. It 
was designed to assess subject perception of treatment  burden with  use of weekly growth hormone 
compared to daily Genotropin in children with  GHD.  
Study population 
In the pivotal study, the patients  enrolled were prepubertal aged 3 to <11  years (females) and < 12 
years (males). The patients had either isolated GHD, or GH insufficiency as part of multiple pituitary 
hormone deficiencies. They were also treatment naïve. Similar to the phase 2  dose finding study, 
subjects had a HV below the 25th percentile for CA and gender. Baseline IGF-1 levels were at least 1 
SD below the mean IGF-1 standardised for age and sex. 
In the additional phase 3 study (C0311002),  children aged ≥3 years old and <18 years were enrolled 
and were currently on either Genotropin Pen, Genotropin GoQuick Pen, HumatroPen (USA only), or 
Omnitrope Pen (USA only) ≥3 months and complaint. They were also required to have an IGF-I SDS 
<2. 
Comparator 
In the phase 2,  and pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006),  Genotropin was included as a comparator arm 
at a dose of 0.034  mg/kg/day which is in line with  the posology licensed for its  use. 
Endpoints 
For the pivotal phase 3  study, the primary efficacy endpoint was annualised HV at  12 months cm/year. 
The key secondary endpoints were HV at 6 months, change in HT SDS at  6 and 12 months compared 
to baseline. Change in BM at  12 months compared to screening BA. Absolute IGF-1 and IGF-1  SDS 
levels on day 4 and IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 SDS on day 4 were also measured. These were considered 
by the CHMP to  be appropriate endpoints  and they were previously endorsed by the SAWP advice and 
are also in line with  similar applications. 
Primary endpoint results 
The aim of the study was to demonstrate that,  in terms of the  primary efficacy endpoint (Annual HV at 
12 months),  weekly somatrogon is non-inferior to  daily somatropin by a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 
cm/year. Non-inferiority was to be concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the  mean 
treatment difference "somatrogon – somatropin", in the primary efficacy endpoint is ≥-1.8  cm/year. 
Somatrogon demonstrated a HV  of 10.1  cm/year compared to somatropin 9.78  cm/year at 12 months.  
The LS mean difference -0.33  (-0.24-0.89)  was in favour of somatrogon.  
Secondary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 93/127 
 
 
 
HV at 6 months  was 10.59  cm/year for somatrogon and 10.04 cm/year for somatropin, LS mean 
difference 0.55 (-0.13,  1.23).  Change in  HT SDS at 12 months  was 0.92  and 0,87 and 0.54  and 0.48 
at 6 months  for somatrogon and somatropin respectively. 
Change in BM at 12 months was mean 0.72 (SD 0.17) and 0.72  (SD 0.17)  for somatrogon and 
somatropin respectively. 
Absolute IGF-1 levels on Day 4(-1) mean (SD) 263.76  (124.77)  and 154.56  (80.75)  for somatrogon 
and somatropin respectively. This translated into a change from baseline of 183.66  (104.35)  and 
183.66  (104.35)  respectively. 
IGF-1 SDS (Z) at 12 months  were 0.65  (1.32) for somatrogon and -0.69  (1.09) for somatropin.  The 
change form baseline was 2.60  (1.26) and 2.60  (1.26) for somatrogon and somatropin respectively. 
Absolute IGFBP-3 levels on Day 4(-1)  after somatrogon at month 12  was observed mean 3879.29 
(837.55)  and 3262.40  (954.64)  for somatrogon and somatropin. The change from baseline was 
1420.80  (888.77)  and 688.45  (615.34)  respectively. 
IGFBP-3 SDS (Z) change from baseline at 12 months was reported as 1.62  (1.15 SD) and 0.74  (0.77 
SD) for somatrogon and somatropin respectively. 
Therefore, it was demonstrated that  the effects of somatrogon are not inferior to somatropin for the 
secondary endpoints. In some respects, even higher numerical results were shown. BM was similar 
between both medicinal products. 
Subgroup analyses 
Results of the prespecified subgroup analyses comparing somatrogon and somatropin based on 
stratification factors (age group, gender, peak GH levels, and region) were generally consistent with 
the overall results of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The change in bone age relative to the change in chronological age from baseline to the  12-month visit 
was comparable between both  treatment groups. 
In both the phase 2 study (CP-4-004)  and phase 3 study (CP-4-006),  the overall clinical findings for 
paediatric subjects who tested somatrogon ADA+ were generally indistinguishable  from those who 
tested ADA. This suggests that  the presence of ADAs in somatrogon-treated subjects does not 
compromise the efficacy of somatrogon with  regard to IGF-1 levels or growth normalization. 
Longer term efficacy 
Both the phase 2 and pivotal phase 3 studies had OLE periods.  
In the pivotal phase 3 study, 212  of 222 subjects who completed 12  months of the CP-4-006 main 
study period continued  into the OLE period. As of the cut-off  date of 01 November 2019,  efficacy data 
was available for 94 subjects at month  18 (6 months of OLE),  and 9 subjects at month  24 in the OLE 
period (12  months of OLE). The Annualised HV for patients on somatrogon at months 18 and 24 were 
slightly lower to the results reported at  month 12, however demonstrated continual effect on growth. 
The annualized HV for subjects who switched from somatropin to somatrogon at the beginning of the 
OLE period was consistent  with subjects who received somatrogon during the main study and 
throughout  the OLE period. 
Change in HT SDS from baseline demonstrated sustained improvement with  weekly somatrogon in the 
main study period, and this  improvement continued over the OLE period. Improvements in change in 
HT SDS from baseline and HT SDS for subjects who switched from somatropin to somatrogon at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 94/127 
 
 
 
beginning of the OLE period were consistent with  subjects who received somatrogon during the main 
study and throughout  the OLE period.  
The results from the OLE part of study CP-4-004  were broadly in line with  those seen in the  Phase 3 
pivotal study. Patients were initially  either maintained on their  initially assigned treatment  dose, with 
patients receiving somatropin being randomised to one of the  three cohorts. Following  the assessment 
of the initial  phase data, all patients were transitioned onto the final dose of 0.66mg/kg/day, where 
they remained for the  remaining periods. 
The  height  velocity profiles of  patients  who  were  initially  assigned to  the  lower dose cohorts  but  later 
transitioned  to  the  final  0.66mg/kg/day  dose were  similar  to  those  in  patients  who  had  received that 
dose from the beginning,  although  it is  unclear whether  patients  experienced a catch-up  phase in their 
growth once the dose change occurred.  
A comparative analysis between the  OLE phase of study CP-4-004  and historical data was  requested in 
a Scientific Advice. The applicant has presented an analysis of the data generated as part of their clinical 
development,  compared  with  matched  historical  controls  from  disease  registries.  This  supports  the 
conclusion  that  the  final  height  anticipated  for  the  patients  treated  with  somatrogon  are  likely  to  be 
similar to other similar treatments already on the market.  
The analysis lends support to the applicant’s claim of efficacy for their product.  
Treatment  burden 
Treatment burden was studied in  a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, open-label, crossover study 
assessing subject perception of treatment burden with  use of weekly growth  hormone (somatrogon) 
versus daily growth hormone (Genotropin) injections in children with  growth hormone deficiency 
(study C0311002). 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a benefit, defined as superior 
adherence and acceptance, of a once weekly injection schedule to  support the benefit/risk profile 
of somatrogon. 
The primary endpoint of treatment  burden was assessed using the Patient Life Interference 
Questionnaire component of DCOA 1 and was completed by the participant/caregiver (dyad 
questionnaire) as an ePRO using a computer tablet.  
87 patients  were enrolled (43  somatropin, 44  somatrogon) 85 patients  completed the study (97.7% 
completion). 
The least squares mean of the Overall Life Interference total score was lower for the once weekly 
somatrogon injection schedule than for the once daily somatropin injection schedule. The mean 
difference (somatrogon-somatropin) was -15.49  (95%  CI: -19.71,  -11.27). 
The difference in mean Overall Life Interference scores for somatrogon once weekly for 12 weeks, 
compared with  administration of somatropin once daily for 12 weeks, was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Submitted clinical studies support that somatrogon is non inferior to somatropin in  the treatment of 
paediatric GHD patients  who have or have not received prior growth hormone treatment.

As the population included in the main studies was limited from 3 years to prepubertal, additional longer-
term efficacy data was provided by the applicant to allow for extrapolation of data into older population. 
This  was  also  in  line  with  previously  authorised  medicinal  products  used  for  the  treatment  of  this 
condition. CHMP  agreed with  an indication for use from 3 years to adolescents with  GHD.  
Overall, the applicant has provided a comprehensive clinical efficacy package, and, in addition, long-
term efficacy data will be collected as secondary endpoints in  the non-interventional study to be 
performed in the post-authorisation setting. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient  exposure 
Two hundred and sixty-nine (269)  paediatric subjects were exposed to somatrogon (vial and prefilled 
pen presentations). 257 subjects were exposed to the dose and pen presentation of somatrogon 
intended for registration of whom 147  subjects were treated for >12  months and 5 were treated for 
>24 months.  Limited long-term exposure up to 5 years is available for children (n=35)  who were 
treated with  the vial formulation. These subjects then  switched to somatrogon in  the pen presentation 
(n = 35)  for 12  months and additional exposure up to  01 November 2019  in Period V of the phase 2 
OLE. No safety data are available for children <3 years of age.   
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
In the controlled phase 3 pivotal study CP-4-006,  the most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs that 
occurred in both somatrogon and somatropin treatment  group were: injection site pain (39.4% vs 
25.2%),  nasopharyngitis (22.9%  vs 25.2%),  headache (16.5%  vs 21.7%),  pyrexia (16.5%  vs 13.9%). 
There was some variability in the incidence of AEs between the somatrogon and somatropin group. 
However, differences were generally small apart from increased reports of TEAEs in the General 
Disorders and Administration  Site Conditions  SOC in the somatrogon vs the somatropin group (46.8% 
vs 33%  respectively). 
Injection site pain (39.4% vs 25.2%),  injection site erythema (8.3% vs 0.0%),  injection site pruritus 
(5.0%  vs 0.0%),  injection site swelling (4.6% vs 0.0%)  and injection site induration  (3.7% vs 0.0%) 
were all reported more frequently in the  somatrogon group compared to the somatropin treated group.  
Most  of the  AEs were mild  to moderate in severity. Of note, there were more reports of severe injection 
site pain in the somatrogon group (4.6%)  compared with  the somatropin group (2.6%  subjects). In 
addition, there was one report each of severe injection site erythema and severe injection site 
haemorrhage in the somatrogon group.  
Common treatment-related AEs by PT that  occurred in ≥2%  of subjects in the somatrogon treatment 
group were: injection site pain (39.4%),  injection site erythema (8.3%),  injection site pruritus (5.5%), 
injection site swelling (4.6%),  injection site induration (3.7%),  hypoinsulinemia (3.7%), headache 
(3.7%)  and anaemia (3.7%). 
In the CP-4-006 OLE  period, 58% of study subjects reported AEs. The overall incidence of TEAEs was 
lower than in the main study period. Subjects who were originally randomised to somatropin in the 
main study experienced a higher incidence of TEAEs than subjects originally randomised to somatrogon 
(68.5  vs 47.1%)  respectively.  The TEAES reported in the open label arm were similar to the main 
study. The most common TEAEs were injection site pain (22.6%),  nasopharyngitis (13.7%),  pyrexia 
(7.1%),  and headache (7.5%). All of these TEAEs were similar to  or more commonly reported in 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 96/127 
 
 
 
subjects who were previously treated with  somatrogon, apart from injection site pain which  was 
reported by 33% of subjects originally randomised to somatropin, compared to 18.3%  of subjects 
treated with  somatrogon. In this OLE,  four subjects reported increased levels of IGF-1 as AEs (all 
previously treated with somatropin). Six subjects (2.8%)  had treatment related severe TEAEs. There 
were five reports of severe injection site pain and 1 report of injection  site deformation. Five of the 
reports were in subjects who received somatropin in the main study period and switched  to 
somatrogon in  the OLE. 
Adverse event (AE) data from phase 2 CP-4-004 supports a similar short-term safety profile of 
somatrogon with  that  reported in CP-4-006.  No new safety concerns were identified in the AE longer-
term safety data from the extension study CP-4-004  OLE other than one report of serious scoliosis. 
This was reported as related to study drug but  is likely to be due to  exacerbation of existing scoliosis 
due to a rapid phase of growth  and has been previously described with GH  therapy. 
In  the  follow-on  open  label  extension,  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  the  study  population  (81.3%) 
reported AEs. Most were mild or moderate in intensity and were considered unrelated to study treatment. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were identified.  Of note two reports of scoliosis (1  in year 3 and 1 
in  year  4)  and  2  reports of  insulin  like  growth  factor increased  (1  in  year 2  and  one  with  PEN)  were 
reported as  related to  study  drug.  One  subject each  had  dose reductions  due  to  Scoliosis and  Keeled 
chest acquired during Period IV (Year 4  OLE). All were considered to be possibly or definitely related to 
study  treatment.  Two  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  Osteochondrosis  during  Period  V  (pen)  and 
Scoliosis during Period IV (Year 4). These AEs were reported after long-term treatment with somatrogon. 
These conditions are most  common in adolescence but could  have been exacerbated during rapid bone 
growth with  GH treatment. 
The applicant has provided updated tabulated summaries of TEAEs, (all cause and treatment  related) 
SAEs and AESIs according to  treatment exposure and ADA status  up to the data cut-off  date of 21 
December 2020. These data are presented according to initial  randomization groups i.e. those 
originally randomised to somatrogon and for those originally randomised to somatropin. The safety 
profile of the pooled safety data is similar to the safety data described for the individual studies in the 
original application. Injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, headache and pyrexia were the most common 
all causality reported TEAEs reported in the pooled analysis. Injection site pain was the most frequently 
reported TEAE overall (5.0/PY). The rate of injection  site pain reported per patient  year was slightly 
lower in subjects originally randomised to somatrogon vs those originally randomised to  somatropin 
(adjusted Rate/PYs 4.75  vs 5.25  respectively). In patients  originally treated with  somatrogon TEAEs 
were reported more frequently in  the ADA+ subgroup. However, in subjects originally randomised to 
somatropin, TEAEs were more frequently reported in the ADA- subgroup. There is no clear pattern of 
association between the TEAEs reported and the ADA status.    
The most commonly reported treatment related TEAEs were injection site reactions: injection site pain, 
pruritus, swelling and erythema. 
The applicant has identified   a number of additional  TEAEs that  may be causally linked to treatment 
with  somatrogon which  have been added to the SmPC Section 4.8 as adverse drug reactions (anaemia, 
eosinophilia, arthralgia, pain in extremities, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, headache, pyrexia, 
conjunctivitis allergic, rash generalized). Other TEAEs of interest that were reported as being treatment 
related were 4 reports of eosinophilia in the group originally randomised to somatrogon and 3 in the 
group originally randomised to somatropin.  
Although it  is recognised that a number of adverse reactions related to growth hormone class effects 
(i.e.  diabetes mellitus type 2, paraesthesia, benign intracranial hypertension, pancreatitis) have not 
been identified  in this clinical development program, these are well-described side effects and were 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 97/127 
 
 
 
also included in  Section 4.8  as class effects under the subheading ‘Description of selected adverse 
reactions’. 
Overall, apart from increased reports of local injection site reactions and concerns regarding increased 
levels of IGF-1 (see AESI ISR and IGF-1  discussed below), the short-term safety profile suggests that 
the safety of somatrogon is comparable to daily hGH therapy. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were based primarily on the class-based important potential  identified risks associated with 
treatment with  somatropin-containing products. Injection site reactions, glucose metabolism 
impairment, thyroid function impairment, immunogenicity, elevated pancreatic enzymes (e.g. amylase 
or lipase) or diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis, cortisol changes, intracranial hypertension, 
malignant neoplasia, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial aneurysm, and slipped capital femoral 
epiphysis and other musculoskeletal, nonserious adverse events, were evaluated as adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs).  With regard to  the AESIs, the incidences in most of the categories were low 
and similar between treatment  groups in the CP-4-006  and CP-4-004 main study periods, and in the 
respective OLE periods, apart from the  categories of injections site reactions and immunogenicity (see 
section on immunogenicity). 
In the Phase 3 main study, injection site reactions AEs were more commonly reported with  somatrogon 
compared to somatropin. (43.1%  during somatrogon treatment vs. 25.2% during  somatropin 
treatment). Injection site pain was the most frequent injection site reaction. Other reported injection 
site reactions (erythema, pruritus, swelling, induration,  bruising) was also higher in the somatrogon 
group than the somatropin group. There were no reports of lipoatrophy. Five subjects treated with 
somatrogon reported severe injection site pain. 
In the OLE 26.9%  of subjects reported ISRs. 12.5% in the  group originally randomised to somatrogon 
compared with  40.7% in the  group originally randomised to somatropin.  The most frequently reported 
AE was injection site pain (22.6%%)  the incidence was higher in the group originally randomised to 
somatropin (33.3%) compared to  the group originally randomised to somatrogon (11.5%).  Other 
injection site reactions reported were injection site erythema and injection site pruritus,  both reported 
at higher incidences in subjects originally randomised to somatropin than subjects originally 
randomised to somatrogon. There were 5 reports (2.4%) of severe injection site pain and one severe 
report of injection site deformation. 
One  patient  discontinued  from  phase 3  study  due  to  AEs of  Injection  site  erythema and injection  site 
induration.  In  the  phase  3  OLE,  4  subjects  had  study  drug  withdrawn  due  to  moderate  injection  site 
reactions of pain, erythema and pruritus. 
In a heat map analysis of severity and duration of injection site pain, injections site pain were most 
commonly reported in  the first 6 months of treatment  but  most subjects reported multiple episodes of  
injection site pain with   4 subjects treated with  somatrogon reporting between 22 to  51 painful 
injection events. Injection site pain including  severe events was most commonly reported for injections 
to the arm (left and right).  The incidence rate for injection site pain was higher in males compared to 
females and in Asian subjects compared to White.   
An analysis of all injection site reactions by self-reported patient assessment (regardless of whether 
they met the criteria for an AE as determined by the  investigator) indicated 89.0%  of the subjects (97 
of 109) in the  somatrogon group and 88.7% of the subjects (102 of 115)  in the somatropin group 
experienced at least one injection site reaction. The incidence of subjects with  the most severe (self-
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 98/127 
 
 
 
 
reported) pain score (5=  ”hurts worse”) was 29.9% in the  somatrogon group compared with 13.7%  in 
the somatropin group. 
In the Phase 2 CP-4-004  Main Study Period one subject in the 0.66 mg/kg/week dose group 
experienced 5 moderate injection site reactions (injection site erythema, injection site  hematoma, 
injection site pain, injection site pruritus,  and injection site swelling).  No subject reported an AE of 
injection site reaction during years 1-4 of the OLE period. 7.5%  (3 subjects) reported injection site 
reactions during  Period V (pen). 
In the pooled safety analysis, a review of AESIs based primarily on the class-based important potential 
identified risks relating to  somatropin-containing products is presented by PT and SOC rather than 
grouped together under specific headings like ‘injection site reactions’. Nonetheless, it  is apparent that 
similar to the original safety analysis, injection site reactions are the most frequently reported AESI 
category in both  treatment groups (subjects originally randomised to somatrogon and somatropin).  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse  event/deaths/other  significant events 
No fatal cases were reported during the clinical development plan for somatrogon. 
In the phase 3  study, 2.2% (5 subjects) in the somatrogon group reported serious adverse events, 
none are considered related to  the drug trial. None led to permanent discontinuation  from study 
treatment. In the phase 3 OLE, 3.3%  (seven) subjects reported 10 SAEs. None of these SAEs was 
related to  study medication. There were no subjects that discontinued  due to  an SAE. In phase 2 CP-4-
004 study;  there were no reports of SAEs in either the somatrogon group or somatropin group. In CP-
4-004  OLE Period, 3 subjects (6.3%)  reported at least 1 SAE. One serious case of idiopathic scoliosis 
was considered to be related to study medication by the investigator but not by the applicant. 
In the analysis of pooled data, 10  subjects in the  group originally randomised to somatrogon reported 
SAEs compared to 5 subjects originally randomised to somatropin. The only SAE reported in more than 
one subject in  the group originally randomised to somatrogon is pneumonia which  is reported twice. 
Two other SAEs of note in this subgroup were one serious report of Schwannoma and one serious 
reaction of urticaria.There was one report of Kawasaki disease. There were no serious injection  site 
reactions. None  of the SAEs were reported in  the ‘related to study treatment’  analysis.  
The only SAE reported in more than  one subject in the  group originally randomised to somatropin was 
appendicitis which was reported twice.  Overall, 10 subjects in the group originally randomised to 
somatrogon reported SAEs compared to 5 subjects originally randomised to  somatropin.  
The only SAE reported in more than  one subject in the  group originally randomised to somatrogon is 
pneumonia which is reported twice. Two other SAEs of note in this  subgroup were one serious report of 
Schwannoma and one serious reaction of urticaria. 
There was one report of Kawasaki disease. There were no serious injection site  reactions. None of the 
SAEs were reported in the ‘related to study treatment’ analysis.  
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
The haematology parameters for the majority of subjects were generally within  normal limits during 
the main study period in  CP-4-006. A majority of the clinically significant haematology shifts to  out of 
range values were mild and transient and were not  considered treatment related. There were 7 reports 
of clinically significant  anaemia. There were 2  reports of eosinophilia. None of the events required any 
dose modifications.  Overall, none of these deviations in hematologic parameters from normal were 
considered clinically significant. A similar trend in hematologic were noted during  the CP-4-006 OLE

period. During the phase 2 study, CP-4-004  e8 subjects had anaemia recorded as an AE, 11 subjects 
(26.2%)  receiving somatrogon had absolute eosinophil counts  above the normal range. 
Clinical laboratory including glycaemic, hormonal, and lipid parameters were generally stable 
throughout  somatrogon treatment. The clinical laboratory profile in  CP-4-006 showed no glucose 
metabolism abnormalities in the somatrogon treatment group. There was no new onset of diabetes or 
hyperglycaemia in any subject treated with  somatrogon. No clinically meaningful differences between 
treatment groups were observed for thyroid function  or lipids.  
IGF-1 
Twenty-two  (22)  subjects  had  at  least  1  out-of-range  IGF-1  value.  Clinically  significant  IGF-1  values 
were only recorded as an AE if the change in IGF-1 was associated with  signs or symptoms. 
CP-4-006 main study period: 29 subjects (26 in somatrogon and 3 in somatropin) had an IGF-1 SDS >2 
at  any time  during study  CP-4-006.    The proportion  of somatrogon treated  patients  with  IGF-1>2SDS 
increased from 4.7% at month 1 to 13.1% at month 12.  14 subjects experienced persistent IGF-1 levels 
>2  SDS  (i.e.,  2  consecutive  SDS>2  measurements),  resulting  in  dose  modification  for  12  of  these 
subjects.  Eight  of  these  subjects  reported  other  AESIs  (injection  site  reactions  n=8,  vomiting  n=4, 
nausea n=1,  abdominal pain n=3  hypothyroidism n=1). 
A post hoc population PK/PD analysis was performed using 535 post dose IGF-1 samples collected from 
109  subjects in  the  somatrogon group to  determine and  evaluate individual  mean IGF-1  SDS over the 
dosing  interval.  The  incidence  of  individual  observed IGF-1  SDS  values  >2  was  larger  compared  to 
individual modelled IGF-1 SDS values. At 1  month, the IGF-1 SDS modelled mean [SD] over the dosing 
interval was -0.32 [0.94] (median: -0.3) and observed IGF-1 SDS mean was 0.00 [1.38] (median: 0.07). 
At  12  months,  the  IGF-1 SDS modelled mean [SD] over the  dosing interval  was 0.25  [0.97]  (median: 
0.28)  and observed IGF-1 SDS mean was 0.66  [1.30])  (median: 0.77). 
CP-4-006  OLE  period:  18  subjects  (8.5%)  with  levels  of  IGF-1  >2.0  SDS  had  protocol-specified 
somatrogon dose reductions.   Two  IGF-1 related AEs  were reported. One subject had  an increase that 
required a dose reduction, was mild in severity and related to study treatment. Another subject reported 
an AE of headache. 
Study CP-4-004:  No  subjects in 0.25  mg/kg/week group or 0.48  mg/kg group had levels of IGF-1 SDS 
>2  at any time  point  during  the 12  months  safety analysis period. Only  1 subject  in 0.66  mg/kg/week 
had levels of IGF-1 SDS >2 at 5  visits that  required dose reduction. In the OLE  mean IGF-1 SDS for all 
cohorts in  Year 1  and subjects  in Year 2  were similar and  increased at  Year 3  and the  end of  Period V 
(pen). A total  of 7 subjects ( 15.9% ) in year 2,  7 ( 16.3%) in year 3 and  1 ( 2.6%)  in year 4 had IGF-
1  SDS (Z)  >2  of whom    2 subjects  (  4.5%),   2  subjects  ( 4.7%)  and 2  subjects (  5.3 %)  respectively 
required dose reduction. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test  for patient selection for safety 
No such tests were performed, which is acceptable. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety  in special populations 
There were no remarkable differences between the various age groups, genders or regions with  respect 
to demographics, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, or laboratory test results. It should

be  kept  in  mind  that  the  indication  applied  for  is  for  children  only.  Therefore, no  information  on  the 
elderly (over the age of 65)  was included in this assessment. 
Animal  reproduction  studies  have  not  shown  evidence  of  harmful  effects  on  the  foetus.  There  are, 
however, no  adequate and  well  controlled  studies in  pregnant women.  There have been  no  studies  of 
somatrogon in  pregnant or lactating  women.  
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
The  total  incidence  of  subjects  with  AEs  related  to  immunogenicity/hypersensitivity  was  18.3%  (20 
subjects) in  the somatrogon group and  7.8%  (9 subjects) in  the  somatropin group. In the  somatrogon 
group, the most frequent events were conjunctivitis allergic (2.8%), rash generalized (2.8%), and rhinitis 
allergic (2.8%).  In the somatropin group, the most frequent event was rash (2.6%).  All other individual 
PTs were reported in  <2%  (≤  2  subjects)  in  each treatment  group. Two  events of  eyelid oedema in  1 
subject in the somatrogon group and 1  event of urticaria in a subject in  the somatropin were treatment 
related. In the  OLE 5.2% of subject reported AEs related to immunogenicity/hypersensitivity.  
In the updated pooled analysis, AESIs relating to immunogenicity/hypersensitivity are presented by SOC 
rather  than  as  grouping  of  immunogenicity  related  AEs.  Similar  to  the  original  analysis,  most  of  the 
immunogenicity  related  AESIs  are reported  in  the skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders SOC.  The  overall 
safety profile is similar to that  reported in  the original analysis of studies CP-4-004  and CP-4-006.  Only 
one report of idiopathic urticaria is reported as treatment  related.  
During  the  OLE  period  of  the  main  study,  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  related  to 
immunogenicity/hypersensitivity was  lower than  the  main  Phase 3  study  at  5.3%.  Eczema, which  had 
an incidence of 1.9%, was the only AE reported in more than one subject.  There were increased reports 
of Immunogenicity AESIs in  the 3-7 years age group, in male and Asian children. 
In  the  supportive  Phase 2  study  the  incidence of  TEAEs  related to  immunogenicity/hypersensitivity in 
the  somatrogon groups  were  low  and  comparable across  the  treatment  groups.    In  the  phase  2  OLE 
(37.5%)  tested  ADA+ for  somatrogon at  any  time  during  the  OLE  period.  Three somatrogon  subjects 
were newly reported ADA+ in the OLE period. 
In  the  phase 3  study  CP-4-006,  77.1%  subjects  tested  ADA+ for somatrogon compared to  15.7%  for 
somatropin treated subjects at any time during the main study. Two somatrogon-treated subjects tested 
positive for NAbs:  1  subject at  month  6 (Week 26)  and  both  subjects at month  12  (Week 52).  Median 
time  to the  first  ADA+ result  was 6  months,  and 98.8%  had  persistent ADA+ results. The  incidence of 
injection  site  reactions was  numerically higher  in  ADA+ subjects  compared to  ADA- subjects  and 6  of 
the  7  subjects with  severe injection  site  reactions in the  somatrogon group,  tested ADA+.   In the  OLE 
65.8%  tested ADA+ at Month  6  in the OLE.  Most  subjects who tested ADA+ showed specificity to  hGH, 
5 subjects showed specificity to CTP.   
Within  the phase 2 study CP-4-004 among 42 somatrogon-treated subjects, 10 subjects (23.8%) tested 
ADA+  for  somatrogon  at  6  months  (Week  26),  and  5  of  these  subjects  (11.9%)  tested  ADA+ at  12 
months  (Week  52),  suggesting  that  transient  anti-somatrogon  antibodies  had developed. No  subjects 
receiving the  lowest  dose (0.25  mg/kg/week) developed ADAs. Testing  ADA+ for  somatrogon had  no 
overall  effect  on  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  during  the  12-month  main  study 
period. In the  registration study CP-4-006, 84/109  patients  (77.1%) were tested ADA+ for somatrogon 
at any time during the main study. The applicant stated that  median time to the first ADA+ result was 6 
months,  and  83/84  subjects had  persistent  ADA+ results.  The  tolerability  of somatrogon seems to  be 
partially  better  in  patients  tested  negative  for  ADA,  particular  regarding  immunogenicity  (21.4%  vs 
Assessment report

8.0%),  injection  site  reactions (46.4%  vs 32.0%)  and abdominal  symptoms. (13.1%  vs  4.0%).  Some 
have been further discussed by the applicant (see the discussion on clinical safety).  
2.6.8.8.  Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal drug-drug interaction  studies have been conducted  with  somatrogon. This is  acceptable and 
no AEs were reported related to drug-drug interactions. Literature reports were used to describe potential 
interactions. Somatrogon may be considered a weak inducer of CYP3A4.   
The impact of GH  on insulin  activity is complex but is generally antagonistic to insulin.  Studies have not 
been performed to  assess the  effects of  somatrogon on  blood sugar  control in  subjects  with  diabetes, 
either type 1 or type 2, controlled with  either insulin or oral glucose lowering drugs. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse  events 
In the phase 3 study, 2.8% (3  subjects) of subjects treated with  somatrogon had their study drug dose 
reduced or temporary discontinuations due  to an AE. All events were mild to  moderate in  intensity and 
resolved (pyrexia, synovitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura). Only 1 event synovitis (somatrogon treatment 
group), was considered by the Investigator to be possibly treatment related. 
One subject  from the  somatrogon group permanently discontinued  the  study  drug  and from the  study 
due to injection site erythema and injection site induration.  
In the CP-4-006 OLE period, 1.4% (3 subjects) experienced TEAEs that led to either a dose reduction or 
dose interruption.  2.4%  (5 subjects) had  TEAEs that  led to  study drug withdrawal  and discontinuation, 
4 subjects withdrew  due to injection site reactions (erythema, pruritus,  2 cases of injection site pain; all 
related to  study drug). One subject withdrew due to increasing anxiety, not considered related to study 
drug. 
In CP-4-004  OLE Period, 4 subjects (8.3%)  had dose reductions due to a TEAE.  Two subjects had dose 
reductions due to IGF-1 increase. One subject each had dose reductions due to scoliosis and keeled chest 
acquired during  Period IV (Year 4 OLE).  All were considered to be possibly or definitely related to study 
treatment.  Two  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  osteochondrosis during  Period  V  (pen)  and  scoliosis 
during Period IV (Year 4). 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Somatrogon  was  approved  in  Canada  on  27  October  2021  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  paediatric 
patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (growth 
hormone deficiency). This approval occurred after the cut-off  date for the  safety report included in  this 
application, and no post-marketing data are yet available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
The safety assessment information comprised data from a single-phase three study, a supportive phase 
2 study with  their respective OLEs in children with GHD (CP-4-006 and CP-4-004 and their OLE periods). 
Some  additional  safety  data  regarding  injection  site  reactions  was  provided  from  a  ‘Perception  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 102/127 
 
 
 
 
Treatment  Burden’ study  C0311002.  GH  treatment  naive children  between  the  ages of 3  and  11  were 
recruited to  the phase 2 and 3 studies.  
The  safety  assessment is  mainly  focussed on studies  CP-4-006  and  CP-4-004  and  their  OLE  periods. 
Safety data  has  not  been  integrated  so  studies  have been  reviewed separately. Across these  studies, 
269  subjects  were  exposed  to  the  vial  and  pen  presentations  of  somatrogon  at  all  dose  levels.  The 
combined total exposure to somatrogon in these studies was 476.8  patient-years. The median duration 
of exposure was 14.9 months. Of these 269, 257 subjects were treated using the PEN presentation (0.66 
mg/kg/week) intended for commercialisation with a total exposure of 272.4 patient  years and a median 
duration of exposure of approximately 14.7 months. Of these 147 subjects were treated for > 12 months 
and  5  were treated  for ≥  24  -30  months.   37  subjects received 0.66  mg/kg/week (vial presentation), 
the dose intended for registration of somatrogon for up to 5 years. 119 subjects who were initially treated 
with  somatropin  switched  over to  somatrogon  in  the  OLE  phases of  CP-4-006  (n=108)  and  CP-4-004 
(n=11). 
The applicant has provided a pooled safety analysis with  exposure adjusted analyses for patients across 
Phase 2 (CP-4-004)  and Phase 3 studies (CP-4-006)  along with  their ongoing OLE periodsup to the data 
cut-off date of 21 December 2020The  mean weekly dosage of somatrogon in the main treatment period 
for the  pivotal  study CP-4-006  (using  the  pen  presentation) tended  to  be higher compared to  patients 
treated  with  somatropin (0.65  mg/kg/week for somatrogon  vs. 0.24  mg/kg/week  somatropin). In  the 
extension treatment period, mean study treatment doses of somatrogon in patients who were previously 
treated  with  somatrogon  and  those  previously  treated  with  Genotropin  were  comparable 
(0.63mg/kg/week  and  0.66mg/kg/week).  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  observed  increase  in  weekly 
exposure between the somatrogon and somatropin treated patients  with  respect to  long-term safety of 
paediatric GHD treatment  is unclear and further supports the  need for the proposed PASS.   
The  exposure data  partially  fulfils  the  requirements  of  ICH-E1  guideline  on  the  extent  of  population 
exposure to  assess clinical  safety (CPMP/ICH/375/95).  However, GH  is  a well-known  active  substance 
and  the  safety  population  could  be  sufficient  to  determine  the  short  comparative  safety  profile  with 
somatropin over 1 year.  
The potential impact from the novel molecular structure needs to be carefully evaluated over longer term 
exposure. The safety  of long  acting  somatropin  (the  mechanism by  which  GH  action  is  prolonged and 
the  duration of  prolongation) will  be further  evaluated in a  post marketing safety study  to  address the 
long-term safety of somatrogon.  
IGF-1 SDS >2 
Most subjects in both study CP-4-006 and CP-4-004, main and OLE periods, had IGF-1 SDS values within 
normal limits.  The proportion of  study participants  reporting an IGF-1  level >2 SDs at  any time during 
the  CP-4-006  main study was  noticeably higher in  the somatrogon group compared to somatropin and 
the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  somatrogon  group  with  IGF-1  level  >2  SDs  increased  across  all 
treatment cycles. A total of 14 Subjects had sustained levels (>2 consecutive visits which lasted at least 
13  weeks).  Twelve of  these subjects  required dose  modification.  Eight  subjects  reported other  AESIs. 
However,  none  was  attributed  to  the  high  IGF-1  levels.  Only  two  AEs  were  considered  related  to 
somatrogon  (ISR  and  hypothyroidism)  and  are  expected  with  hGH  therapy.  No  subjects  reported 
IGF>3SDS.  
One explanation of the high levels (IGF-1 SDS >2) was that  samples were collected earlier in the dosing 
interval than  outlined  in  the protocol (before 72  hours post  dose, rather than  at  the  suggested 4  days 
post  dose).  Post  hoc  population  PK/PD  modelling  showed  that  although  the  mean  and  median  IGF-1 
levels were<  2SDS,  there  was  a  trend  towards  increased levels  across  the  repeat  doses  in  the  main 
study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 103/127 
 
 
 
In  the  phase  2  study  CP-4-004  OLE  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  IGF-1  >2  was  significant  and 
fluctuated  over the  5-year period of the  study. (15.9%  in  year 2,  16.3%  in  year 3  2.6%  in year 4 and 
27.5%  in PEN (year 5).  
There were no  reports of malignancy in  the  phase 2  study.  No clinically meaningful changes in  glucose 
metabolism, including insulin sensitivity, were observed in the phase 2 OLE. Although the observed mean 
blood glucose values and HbA1c remained within  normal, mean blood glucose values did tend to increase 
during the PEN  phase. 
Out-of-range IGF-1  laboratory results  that  were deemed clinically significant  without  an  associated AE 
were  not  recorded  as  an  AE  because  IGF-1  values  were  not  intended  to  be  monitored  for  clinical 
significance nor  as an  AE,  unless the  change in  IGF-1  was  associated with  signs or  symptoms. Serum 
IGF-I levels in themselves are a measure of safety. The sustained  high level of IGF-1  (IGF-1 SDS > 2) 
above the physiological range in patients treated with somatrogon compared to daily dose of somatropin 
in  study CP-4-006  is  a concern.   High normal  IGF-I levels have been associated with  an  increased risk 
of multiple forms of cancer. IGF-1 has been associated with  glucose intolerance and may have a role in 
tumorigenesis.  The  risks  related  to  non-pulsatile  physiological levels  and  sustained  high  IGF-1  levels 
above  the  physiological  range  over  longer-term  exposure  with  somatrogon  needs  to  be  carefully 
evaluated. The applicant  has provided details of a  suitable PASS to  address this  issue. Malignancy and 
glucose intolerance (type  2  diabetes) have been included  as  important  potential  risks in  the  RMP.  The 
SmPC has  been updated  to  include  information regarding IGF-1  monitoring  and  the  need  for GH  dose 
adjustments.  
Adverse events 
In the integrated summary of TEAEs of pooled safety data from studies 004 and 006 up to 21  Dec 2020 
(main study  period and OLE  for both studies)  a total  of 216  subjects reported an adverse event in  this 
analysis.   
The  safety  profile  of  the  pooled  safety  data  is  similar  to  the  safety  data  described for  the  individual 
studies.  Injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, headache and pyrexia, are the most common all causality 
reported TEAEs reported in the pooled analysis. Injection site pain is the most frequently reported TEAE 
overall  (overall  adjusted  rate  5.0/PY).  There  is  no  clear  pattern  of  association  between  the  TEAEs 
reported and ADA status.    
The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low across all studies.  All were considered unlikely 
to be related to study treatment except one report of scoliosis.It is agreed with the applicant that this is 
more likely to  have been caused by a  good growth response to somatrogon, which  potentially  resulted 
in  worsening of  the  scoliosis. The adjusted  rates for SAEs are similar  across both  groups  (somatrogon 
and somatropin originally randomised treatment groups,) and in each strata (ADA+ and ADA-). None of 
the SAEs were related to  study treatment.  
With consideration of possible class effects, a number of additional ADRs have been identified. In addition 
to the    ADR of ‘injection site reaction’ which  includes reports of injection site pain,  erythema, pruritus, 
swelling,  induration,  bruising,  haemorrhage,  warmth,  hypertrophy,  inflammation,  deformation  and 
urticaria, a number of additional  TEAEs were identified. These may be causally linked to treatment with 
somatrogon  (anaemia,  eosinophilia,  arthralgia,  pain 
in  extremities,  hypothyroidism,  adrenal 
insufficiency, headache, pyrexia, conjunctivitis allergic, rash generalized). These have been added to the 
SmPC Section 4.8 as adverse drug reactions.  
As somatrogon has a similar side effect profile to somatropin, it is also anticipated that it will share many 
of the known side effects of daily rhGH. GH therapy class effects have been added as adverse reactions 
in  Section  4.8  under  the  sub-heading  ‘Description  of  selected  adverse  reactions’.  Adverse  reactions 
Assessment report

described in  section  4.4  or known  to  result  from  conditions  mentioned  here  have also  be  included  in 
section 4.8.  
The overall incidence of AESIs was higher in the somatrogon group compared to somatropin in both the 
phase 3  and  phase 2  studies.  In most  of  the  categories, the  incidences of AESIs were low  and  similar 
between somatrogon and somatropin treatment groups across all studies. Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) 
and Immunogenicity had  the  highest incidence of  any AESI categories in  both treatment  groups in  the 
phase 3  Study CP-4-006  main  study  period. In  regard to  the  pooled  safety data  review, the  adjusted 
rates  for  AESIs  were  similar  across  both  groups  (somatrogon  and  somatropin  originally  randomised 
treatment groups,) and in each strata (ADA+ and ADA-). 
Injection site reactions  
In  the  phase  3  Study  CP-4-006  main  study  period,  almost  twice  as  many patients  in  the  somatrogon 
group vs somatropin (43.1% vs 25.2%)  reported injection site reactions as AESIs. Over the OLE, 26.9% 
reported ISRs. However, of note in the OLE the proportion of subjects previously treated with somatropin 
had a much higher rate of ISRs (51.9%) compared with subjects previously treated somatrogon (12.5%). 
Injection site  pain was the  most common injection  site reaction.  These reactions were mainly reported 
as mild to  moderate in severity, but 5 cases of severe AEs were reported in the  main phase 3 study and 
a  further  5  in  the  OLE.  Reports  of  painful  injections  were  consistently  more  frequently  reported  for 
somatrogon  compared  to  somatropin,  despite  the  fact  that  one  was  weekly  and  the  other  a  daily 
injection. The methodology for assessing and recording injection site reaction AEs in  particular injection 
site  pain  impacted  on  the  interpretation  of  the  results  from  the  various  studies,  and  the  incidence  of 
injection site pain between the two treatment  groups is thus  difficult to  compare.  
The  higher rate  of painful  injection  site  reactions in  the  somatrogon group  did  not  result  in  significant 
levels of withdrawal of treatment (13 patients overall) or dose adjustments.Injections into the arms were 
more painful than  other  sites in  the  body. Severe reactions were most  commonly reported in  the  arm. 
There was a disparity between the  number of reports of injection  site pain  reported as  AEs and severe 
AEs across the different  analyses in  the Phase 2  and Phase 3 paediatric GHD  studies, asa result  of the 
difference in how AEs were recorded in the two  studies.  
Children who  switched  from Genotropin treatment  to  somatrogon treatment  experienced rates of ISRs 
similar to starting  somatrogon treatment de novo, which  could be due to the way in which  ISR AEs were 
reported or could suggest that the  ISRs experienced with somatrogon were more painful.  
Further  information on  injection site  reactions was also collected in  the  tolerability  study  (C0311002).. 
All reported Injection site reactions were recorded as AEs. There was no minimum severity score required 
for  these injection  site  reactions and  there  was  no  limit  to  the  number  of  injection  site  reactions  that 
could  be recorded as AEs  per week. In  this  study  21.8  %  of the  somatrogon  group vs  16.3%  of  once 
daily somatropin group reported ISR AEs. However, the  different reporting methodology and crossover 
study design makes it difficult  to interpret this data.   
Although  injection  site  reactions were  commonly reported with  somatrogon,  and  in  some cases these 
reactions  persisted  over  longer-term  treatment,  it  is  not  possible  to  accurately  compare  the  rate  of 
injection site reactions with somatrogon and somatropin. The relative tolerability of these treatments in 
terms  of ISRs is  difficult  to  determine, due  tothe  difference in  how  AEs were recorded across studies. 
The reason for the  increase in injection  site pain observed with  somatrogon compared to somatropin is 
not  clear,  althoughseveral possible causes were explored: needle features,  injection  volume, injection 
solution  temperature,  injection  site,  osmolality,  pH,  excipients  and  injection  technique.  The  only 
difference of note was that subjects administering somatrogon injected an average volume 4-5x that  of 
somatropin. However, the severity of pain does not appear to correlate with an increasing volume within

each  cohort.  The  wording  in  section  4.2  of  SmPC  thus  recommends rotating  the  site  of  injections  to 
minimise the risk of a painful injection.    
The information provided in  the subsection on injection  site reactions under the  heading ‘Description of 
selected adverse reactions’ in section 4.8 has been expanded to provide information on the time to onset, 
duration of and persistence of injection site reactions with  somatrogon treatment.   
With  the  expectation  of  better  tolerability  of weekly somatrogon  over daily  hGH  dosing,  the applicant 
was requested to  further discuss the clinical implications of the  observed high reporting rates of painful 
injections.  No  literature  evidence  has  been  identified  by  the  applicant  that  suggests  repeated painful 
injections have a lasting impact on the child’s pain responses. Although there are no  reports  in patients 
following  daily growth  hormone injections,  reports of needle procedures in  other settings  (vaccination, 
hospital settings) report that  injections are highly feared by many children (Hart & Bossert, 1994; Taddio 
2012)  and are  often accompanied by  significant  pain  and  distress for  both  children  and  their  parents, 
which,  in turn,  can lead to  the development of significant needle fears which  can persist into  adulthood 
(McMurtry  2015b).  This can contribute to  medical non
adherence (Pate 1996).     
Immunological events 
‐
Most  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  most  events  were  grade  as  not  related  to  study 
treatment  by  the  investigators.  There  were  no  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  (anaphylaxis, 
angioedema, and immune  complex disorders). The applicant has further discussed the immunogenicity 
AEs  in  more detail,  particular  the  relatedness to  treatment  and has added  conjunctivitis  allergic,  rash 
generalized  (local  to  injection  site  reaction),  pyrexia,  and  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  was  informed 
accordingly. There are no  reports of  severe systemic hypersensitivity in  the  somatrogon clinical  trials. 
Side  effects due  to  the  presence of  the  C-terminal  peptide  (CTP)  of  the  hCG  beta-subunit  have  been 
discussed by the applicant. No  new side effects or concerns relating to  immunogenicity associated with 
the CTP have been identified. 
In relation to the anti somatrogon antibodies, it  seems that  not all patients have complied with all visits 
respectively  blood  sampling  for  antibody  titres.  The  original  protocol  for  the  CP-4-006  main  study 
included  testing  for ADA not  earlier as 6  and 12  months  after study  start.  This  was amended later on, 
but  by the  time of implementation at  all study sites, many subjects had already completed the  Day 10, 
Month  1, and Month 3 visits per the original Protocol.  In addition, samples were collected at Visits 3 and 
4, which  were close in  timing, and all results were negative for ADA, so that it  is agreed that combining 
both groups does not  change the outcome of the findings or report. 
In  relation to  the  presence and  impact  of the  ADA status  on the  safety profile of somatrogon, there is 
not  a  temporal  relationship  with  onset  of  injection  site  reactions  and  ADA.  Although  injection  site 
reactions  may persist,  most  occur early in  treatment  and  subside  as  the  study  continues.  In  contrast 
(temporary), although  some individuals tested  positive for  ADA at  3  months  after study  start,  most  of 
those who  ultimately  tested  positive among treatment  naïve individuals tested  positive 6  months  after 
study start. 
There was  no  clear pattern  of  ADA positivity  being  associated with  severe injection  site  reactions and 
immunogenicity is included as an important  potential risk in  the safety specification of the  RMP. 
Almost all individuals who tested positive for ADA showed persistent ADA. As almost all individuals who 
tested positive for ADA showed persistent ADA, no further comparison of patient characterises based on 
persistent ADA response is possible (age, sex, weight, GHD severity, dose adjustments and final dose of 
somatrogon as well  as number and timing  of the  blood samplings for antibody titres,  titre values in the 
course of the study as well as the  incidence /severity of related adverse events and IGF-1 level). 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

Reports of injection site reactions was numerically higher in ADA+ subjects compared to ADA- subjects 
and 6 subjects with severe injection site reactions in the somatrogon group, tested ADA+. The applicant 
states that  a higher rate of injection site reactions within  the first few months of treatment, prior to the 
emergence of ADAs at  6  months undermines a potential  relationship  between ISRs and  ADA positivity. 
However high rates of ISRs were reported throughout  the main study. Further details of the ADA profile 
of these  cases of  severe ISR have been provided for  review. In  all cases of  severe ISR, ADA positivity 
was  first detected  at  6  months.  In  three cases ADA positivity was  sustained  across 24  + months.  The 
ADA titres  fluctuated  across all time  points  with  titres  ranging  from 250  to  >6250  detected at  varying 
time points. There was no clear pattern of ADA positivity identified in these cases of severe ISR   including 
time to onset of ADA positivity, duration of positivity, ADA titres.  
The  long-term  clinical  relevance  of  sustained  ADA  positivity  needs  to  be  carefully  evaluated. 
“Immunogenicity  specifically  related  to  the  long-term  clinical  impact  on  lack  of  efficacy  and  safety 
(especially in  relation to  severe injections site reactions)” has  been included as a safety concern in  the 
RMP.  
Further events of special interest 
The  incidence  of AEs  related  to  potential  signs  and symptoms of  abdominal  pain  was  low  overall and 
similar  across  the  somatrogon  and  somatropin  groups.    No  subjects  had  AEs  related  to  elevated 
pancreatic enzymes. Additionally,  no  subjects  had AEs  indicative  of a  diagnosis  of pancreatitis.  In  the 
somatrogon group, the most frequent events were vomiting (7.3%),  abdominal pain (3.7%)  and nausea 
(2.8).   A warning has been included in the SmPC somatrogon regarding severe abdominal pain and the 
risk of pancreatitis during treatment.  
Although the effect was small in the paediatric population the data presented confirmed that somatrogon 
might  impair  the  glucose  tolerance as well  as  the  thyroid  and  adrenal cortical function.  As the  clinical 
experience of somatrogon is low, a warning was included section 4.4 of the  SmPC, in line with the other 
growth  hormone medicinal  products.  More  data  on  the  long-term  safety  is  to  conclude  on  a  possible 
induction  of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
With  regard to  the  data provided until  now,  no AEs related  to intracranial  haemorrhage, aneurysm, or 
hypertension as well as to epiphyseal disorders were reported. As the clinical experience with somatrogon 
is limited, the warnings in the SmPC were adapted to those of other growth hormone medicinal products. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  benign  neoplasia  was  low  overall,  similar  in  the  somatrogon  and 
somatropin  groups,  and  limited  to  the  events  of  skin  papilloma  and  melanocytic  naevus.  A  warning 
regarding the risk of neoplasia has been added to section 4.4. In addition, it should be kept in mind that, 
the data  for the  long-term safety is  considered insufficient, as there is an ongoing discussion of a long-
term carcinogenic effect of GH (and/or IGF-I).  
The potential  impact on glycaemic control and tumorigenesis in children will  be evaluated in a phase 4, 
open-label post marketing safety study. Malignancy and diabetes mellitus type 2 have been included as 
important potential  risk information in the safety specification of the RMP. 
Most  TEAEs  that  were  reported were  mild  to  moderate in  severity and  were  graded as  not  related  to 
study  treatment. Following  a review of  TEAEs arthralgia, pain in  extremity have been added to section 
4.8 as ADRs. 
Subgroups  
There  were  some  differences  between  the  various  age  groups,  genders  or  regions  with  respect  to 
incidence of TEAEs.  Immunogenicity reactions was reported in the somatrogon subgroup: >3 years =<7 
compared  to  >7  years.  (30.2%  vs  10.6%).  The  immunogenicity  events  reported  by  more  than  one 
subject were rash,  rash generalised and  conjunctivitis  allergic. The incidence of  injection site  pain was 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 107/127 
 
 
 
higher in males (34.8%)  than females (25.4%) and White subjects (30.2%)  compared to Asian subjects 
(4.8%).    The  higher  number  of  reports  of  immunogenicity  reactions  in  the  younger age  group  in  the 
somatrogon cohort has not been clearly explained. Immunogenicity is included as  an important potential 
risk  in  the  safety  specification    It  is  agreed that    the  higher  reporting  of  injection  site  pain  in  White 
subjects vs Asian subjects administering somatrogon and somatropin most likely relates to  geographical 
variation and does not appear to carry any clinical meaningfulness. 
Laboratory findings 
Two significant errors regarding reporting and data handling of laboratory results were identified Further 
clarification regarding the extent, root cause and resolution of these errors has been provided.  and GCP 
inspections  were conducted  for the  somatrogon clinical  CP-4-006  by  the  FDA  in  2021.  Six clinical  trial 
sites, 4 in the US and 2 in the European Union,  namely Spain and Poland were inspected. There were no 
findings  of note. In view of the  existing information it  is agreed that  it  is unlikely that  the  omitted data 
would have impacted the safety evaluation. 
Glucose metabolism, thyroid function and cortisol levels 
Laboratory parameters related to  glucose metabolism,  thyroid function  and  cortisol levels, all  of which 
were AESIs, were generally within  normal limits. 
However, glucose intolerance  is a  well-described side effect of  growth  hormone treatment  and section 
4.4 of the SmPC includes a warning to that  effect.  
Mean  FT4  and  TSH  levels  remained consistent  over  time  and  comparable  for  both  treatment  groups 
during the main period and OLE periods. No significant change from baseline of the mean values of FT4, 
T3 or TSH parameters was observed in somatrogon or somatropin treated patients  although there were 
occasional increases or decreases noted for individual subjects.  
In  the  phase  3  study,  6.4%  of  the  somatrogon  group  compared with  2.6%  of  the  somatropin  group 
reported AEs of hypothyroidism. Two subjects reported an AE of Thyroxine free decreased. None of these 
events was considered related to study  medication. Treatment with  daily rhGH may unmask previously 
undiagnosed  or  subclinical  central  hypothyroidism.  Growth  hormone  replacement  therapies  are  well 
known  to  be  associated  with  potential  decreased levels  of  FT4.  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  includes  a 
warning regarding suboptimal response to GH treatment with undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism. A 
warning  regarding  impact  of  GH  on  conversion  of  T4  to  T3  has  been  included  in  section  4.4. 
Hypothyroidism has also been included as an ADR in section 4.8.  
The incidence of AEs related to cortisol changes in study CP-4-006 and study CP-4-004 (main study and 
OLE periods) was low, the  events were mild or moderate, and none was reported as possibly related to 
study treatment.  
The potential for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism 
has been described for patients  on  daily growth  hormone therapy who have or are at  risk for pituitary 
hormone  deficiency(s).  Patients  with  known  hypoadrenalism  may  need  to  adjust  their  dose  of 
glucocorticoid.  Section  4.4  includes  a  warning  to  this  effect.  The  need  for  careful  monitoring  of 
glucocorticoid dosing is also included as a warning in section 4.5.  Adrenal insufficiency is included as an 
ADR in section 4.8. 
Haematology &  blood chemistry 
Haematology parameters for majority  of subjects  were generally within  normal limits  during  the  main 
study period in CP-4-006. Most  were mild  and transient  and were not  considered treatment related and 
no  new safety  concerns identified.   increased blood creatine  phosphokinase levels were found,  even if 
however, there was no clinical impact of increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) and this shift had 
Assessment report

Page 108/127 
 
 
 
a  higher  incidence  in  the  somatropin  group  ,  and  this  information  was  not  listed  as  ADR,  which  was 
agreed on..A  higher proportion of  subjects treated with  somatrogon compared with  somatropin shifted 
from  normal  to  high  eosinophils  levels  in  the  phase  3  study  (29.4%  somatrogon  group  vs  12.2% 
somatropin  group).The  majority  of  these  also  had  above  normal  eosinophil  readings  at 
screening/baseline visits. Many were transient. Eosinophilia was included as an ADR in the SmPC section 
4.8. 
Most  of the  mean blood chemistry values were within  normal limits  and  showed no significant  changes 
during the  course of the study. Of note, a higher proportion of the somatrogon population  had clinically 
significant  out-of-range  IGF-1  value compared to  somatropin  (see discussion of  IGF-1  levels). Change 
from baseline of  increase of phosphate levels, a known effect of GH therapy, was more common in the 
somatrogon group compared to daily somatropin. A shift from normal to high values of phosphate (known 
effects of GH therapy) was reported for more subjects in the somatrogon group than in the somatropin 
group.  There was  no  clinical  impact  of the  shift  from normal  to  high  values  of the  phosphate  and  the 
observed shift is consistent with  the  known effect of GH therapy. Further details of the case of elevated 
LDH >600  for subject (226-134)  including a causality assessment has been provided for review.  
The changes in the lipid parameters (cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, HDL cholesterol, and LDL 
cholesterol) were generally small and consistent between both  treatment groups. 
Drug-drug interactions 
There were  no  clinical  trials  conducted  with  somatrogon to  directly  test  for drug-drug  interactions.  In 
study  CP-4-006,  CP-4-004,  and  their  respective  OLE  no  AEs  were  reported  related  to  drug-drug 
interactions. However, regarding glucose metabolism (insulin sensitivity) and different endocrine aspects 
(adrenal  function,  thyroid  function,  oestrogens)  respectively  the  according  concomitant  hormonal 
therapies, there are some known interactions and section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated in line with 
other GH products. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the most notable safety findings from the review of the adverse event data  were the increased 
reports  of  painful  injection  site  reactions  in  subjects  treated  with  somatrogon  and  in  subjects  that 
switched from somatropin to somatrogon and increased immunogenicity reactions (all mild to moderate 
local hypersensitivity reactions). The  percentage of  study participants  testing  ADA+ for somatrogon at 
any time  during  the  CP-4-006  main  study  was considerably higher  compared with  somatropin treated 
subjects.  The proportion  of study  participants  reporting an  IGF-1  level >2  SDs at  any time  during  the 
CP-4-006  main study  was noticeably higher in  the  somatrogon group  compared to  somatropin and the 
proportion of subjects in the  somatrogon group with  IGF-1 level >2  SDs increased across all treatment 
cycles. 
Otherwise,  weekly  dosing  of  somatrogon  administration  across  over  the  short  to  medium  term  was 
generally well tolerated and similar to somatropin.  
The CHMP considers the  following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
A category 3 PASS is planned for the post-authorisation setting.  This will be an active surveillance 
study to monitor the  real-world long-term safety of somatrogon among paediatric patients in Europe

The CHMP considers that  the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion.  The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with  the international birth  date (IBD). The IBD is 27.10.2021  The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that  the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in  the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Ngenla (somatrogon) is included in  the 
additional monitoring list  as it  contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011,  was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.   
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Somatrogon (Ngenla) is indicated for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients with  growth 
disturbance due to  insufficient secretion of growth hormone. 
In children, GHD is primarily manifested as abnormal linear growth.  GHD also impacts bone, lipid, 
protein, and glucose metabolism in children, with  findings that  include decreased bone mineral density, 
decreased lean body mass, and increased fat mass. The incidence of growth failure associated with 
GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4000 to 1:10.000. 
Childhood GHD can be congenital, acquired, or idiopathic. Underlying causes for congenital 
malformation include pituitary  dysfunction due to abnormal neurodevelopment in utero of certain brain 
regions and genetic abnormalities. Aetiology for acquired GHD includes brain tumours in the 
hypothalamic region, traumatic brain injury, infiltrative disease, cranial irradiation and surgical 
intervention.  
In children the growth attenuation  and short stature resulting from GHD begins in early childhood and 
continues through attainment  of final adult height,  which can lead to  a reduced QoL. This is 
confounded by delayed puberty and deficits in  facial, dental and (in males) genital development. 
Approximately 5% of children with  GHD have episodes of hypoglycaemia, particularly in infancy. The 
inability to achieve normal growth and attainment  of age and gender appropriate height  can lead to 
early onset of severe psychosocial problems directly related to short stature including  behavioural and 
cognitive disturbances. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for paediatric GHD is daily SC injection of rhGH.  
hGH replacement therapy of recombinant DNA origin (somatropin) has been used for over 30 years. 
Treatment response is assessed by measurements of height  and growth velocity and is generally 
continued until  final height,  epiphyseal closure, or both  have been recorded.  
Early intervention produces the most optimal outcome as growth potential  decreases overtime. 
For the currently available rhGH products, daily SC injections are necessary to achieve efficacy and 
maintain IGF-1 blood levels within  the target therapeutic window,  in the normal age and sex-adjusted 
range for safety reasons. Injection frequency has been found to be positively correlated with  growth 
response and final height among children with  idiopathic GHD treated with  rhGH. 
Non-compliance/ non-adherence with treatment  is a common problem. Non-adherence rates vary 
widely depending on study methodology and non-adherence/ compliance definitions but  have been 
reported to be 36% to  49% across a variety of studies. 
One approach to improving adherence to treatment  has been the development of long-acting GH 
formulations that would  require less frequent injections.   
Several different technological approaches have been evaluated including  sustained-release 
preparations that  utilize microsphere encapsulation (Nutropin Depot, LB03002),  pegylated formulations 
(Jintrolong),  non-covalent albumin binding  (somapacitan), prodrugs (TransCon31), and Fc  GH fusion 
formulations (GX-H9, albutropin). There are currently no approved long-acting GH  formulations on the

market in EU. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant conducted a phase 2 dose finding  study (CP-4-004).  This study investigated three dose 
levels of somatrogon 0.25  mg/kg/week, 0.48mg/kg/week and 0.66  mg/kg/week. In the fourth arm 
patients were administered somatropin 0.034 mg/kg/day. Patients were randomised 1:1:1:1.  The trial 
had 4 periods. Patients who  completed periods I and II were enrolled into an OLE for 12 months 
(period 3), to continue into  a longer term OLE period (period 4), and ultimately into  a period where 
patients used the final pre-filled pen formulation (Period 5). 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is from a single 52-week, phase III multicentre, randomised, 
open-label study (CP-4-006).  Patients were randomised in  1:1 ratio to somatrogon 0.66  mg/kg/week 
or somatropin 0.034  mg/kg/day.  
Patients enrolled were prepubertal (Tanner stage 1)  and were aged 3 to  <11 years (females) and < 12 
years (males). The patients had either isolated GHD, or GH insufficiency as part of multiple pituitary 
hormone deficiencies and were naïve to GH treatment. 
224 patients  were treated, 109 received somatrogon and 115  somatropin. There was a high 
completion rate of 99.1%  of subjects. The mean age was 7.72 years, 40.2 % were aged between 3 
and 7 years, with  59.8% older than 7 years of age. 71.9%  were males and 28.1 % females. The 
majority of patients were Caucasian (71.9%)  followed by Asians (20.1%)  with  very small percentages 
from other races. 
During the open label extension period, patients receiving somatropin were switched  to somatrogon 
and continued weekly SC administration of somatrogon 0.66 mg/kg/week. The study is still  ongoing. 
An additional 24-week phase study (C0311002) was conducted, this was a cross over design study to 
examine perception of treatment burden with  use of weekly growth  hormone (somatrogon) versus 
daily growth hormone (Genotropin) injections in children with  growth hormone deficiency. 87  patients 
were enrolled (43 somatropin, 44 somatrogon) 85  patients completed the study (97.7%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Phase 2 dose finding study (CP-4-004) 
At 12 months  the mean HV in  the FAS population for somatrogon 0.66 mg/kg/week was 11.4  (95% CI: 
9.2, 13.7)  cm/year. The mean HV for the Genotropin group was 12.5  cm/year (95% CI: 11.0-13.9 
cm/year). 
The mean HV at six months for somatrogon 0.66  mg/kg/week was 13.0  (95% CI: 9.9,  16.0) cm/year 
and for the  somatropin cohort was 15.0 (95%  CI: 13.1,  16.9).   The 95%  CI for all MOD-4023 cohorts 
overlaps the somatropin CI. 
At 12 months,  the mean change in HT SDS for the somatropin cohort was 1.51  (range 0.82,  2.38).  and 
1.35  (range 0.06,  2.47) for 0.66 mg/kg/week.  Therefore, it is agreed that  the 0.66  mg/kg/week 
selected was appropriate to bring forward for phase 3 development.  
Open-label extension (OLE) phase of study CP-4-004 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022

The mean observed annual HV at the end of Year 1 was similar between the 0.25  mg/kg/week and 
0.48  mg/kg/week treatment groups but  was higher in the 0.66 mg/kg/week treatment  group. The 
mean annual HV was the greatest during Year 1 OLE  and decreased with  every subsequent year 
thereafter. 
The observed mean annual height SDS was consistent across treatment groups.  The analysis of mean 
height SDS at  the end of PEN  Year 1 revealed no clinically meaningful differences by initial  cohort 
assignment in the main study, including  subjects initially  randomised to somatropin treatment. 
The small number of patients transitioned from somatropin were initially insufficient to  support the use 
of somatrogon as a substitution  treatment for somatropin. However, additional supportive data from 
patient registries have supported the longer-term efficacy profile of the  product. The assessment of 
long-term efficacy was added to the non-interventional PASS as a secondary endpoint, as 
recommended by PRAC and supported by the  CHMP.  
Pivotal phase 3 study (CP-4-006)   
Somatrogon demonstrated a HV  of 10.1  cm/year compared to somatropin 9.78  cm/year at 12 months.  
The LS mean difference -0.33  (-0.24-0.89)  was in favour of somatrogon. 
HV at 6 months  was 10.59  cm/year for somatrogon and 10.04 cm/year for somatropin. LS mean 
difference 0.55 (-0.13,  1.23). 
Change in HT SDS at 12 months  was 0.92  and 0.87 and at 6 months  it was 0.54 and 0.48  for 
somatrogon and somatropin respectively. 
Change in BM at 12 months was mean 0.72 (SD 0.17) and 0.72  (SD 0.17)  for somatrogon and 
somatropin, respectively. 
IGF-1 SDS (Z) at 12 months  were 0.65  (1.32) for somatrogon and -0.69  (1.09) for somatropin.  The 
change form baseline was 2.60  (1.26) and 2.60  (1.26) for somatrogon and somatropin, respectively. 
IGFBP-3 SDS (Z) change from baseline at 12 months was reported as 1.62  (1.15 SD) and 0.74  (0.77 
SD) for somatrogon and somatropin, respectively. 
The pivotal phase 3 study demonstrated that somatrogon was non-inferior to daily somatropin at  12 
months in terms of HV, HT SDS or change in  BM.  
24-week phase study (C0311002)  examining perception of treatment burden 
The least squares mean of the Overall Life Interference total score was lower for the once weekly 
somatrogon injection schedule than for the once daily somatropin injection schedule.  
The difference in mean Overall Life Interference scores for somatrogon once weekly for 12  weeks, 
compared with  administration of somatropin once daily for 12 weeks, was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The results of HV in  the somatropin arm in the pivotal study seem to be lower than that  reported in the 
phase 2  CP-4-004 study, however it  was agreed that  non-inferiority was demonstrated. 
The applicant was initially seeking a broad indication for long-term treatment of paediatric patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 115/127 
 
 
 
 
 
with  growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth  hormone. However, the  population 
enrolled were prepubertal, treatment naïve and aged > 3 years.  
There was no efficacy seen in patients  < 3 years, in treatment experienced patients and only limited 
efficacy seen in older patients > 12 years of age.  Furthermore, there is very limited data with  longer 
term treatment which is considered insufficient  to support the indication.   Accordingly, the applicant 
has amended the indication to  be restricted to children and adolescents > 3 years of age. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events 
In the pivotal phase 3 study TEAEs overall were reported more frequently in the somatrogon group 
compared to the somatropin treated group (84.45  vs 78.3%). The most frequently reported AEs that 
occurred in both somatrogon and somatropin treatment  groups respectively were  injection site pain 
(39.4%  vs 25.2%),  nasopharyngitis (22.9%  vs 25.2%), headache (16.5%  vs 21.7%) and pyrexia 
(16.5%  vs 13.9%).  Most  of the  AEs reported in  the somatrogon and somatropin groups were of mild to 
moderate severity. In the CP-4-006  OLE period, 58%  of study subjects in the OLE  reported similar AEs 
to the main study. The overall incidence of AEs was lower than  in the main study period. Injection site 
pain, nasopharyngitis, headache and pyrexia, were the  most common all causality reported TEAEs 
reported in the  pooled analysis. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported TEAE overall. 
Other treatment related adverse events of note in somatrogon vs. somatropin treated subjects were: 
hypoinsulinemia (3.7% vs 2.6%), headache (3.7%  vs 2.6%),  anaemia (3.7%  vs 1.7%),  free fatty 
acids increased (3.7% vs 0.9%),  blood creatine phosphokinase increased (1.8%  vs 2.6%),  and pain in 
extremity (2.8  vs 0.9%).  These AEs are associated with  GH replacement therapy. The majority of 
these treatment related adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were reported more 
frequently in the somatrogon group compared to the somatropin treated group. 
After review of the  pooled safety analysis and review of the additional  open-label extension data with 
data cut-off of 21 December 2020, all relevant TEAEs have been added to the SmPC Section 4.8.  It is 
expected that  somotrogon will  share all of the  known risks of daily rhGH and section 4.8 ‘Description of 
selected adverse reactions’ has been updated with  known class effects of growth therapy.  
In the pivotal phase 3 study, 3  subjects had TEAES leading to  study drug reduction or interruption 
(pyrexia, Henoch-Schönlein Purpura, synovitis). All events were mild to  moderate in severity. Only 
synovitis was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug. 
AESIs  
The percentage of subjects reporting AESIs was higher during treatment with  somatrogon 
administered once weekly (26.4%)  than during treatment with  somatropin administered once daily 
(18.6%).  This difference was mainly due to increased incidence of injections site reactions and 
immunogenicity reactions in  the somatrogon group.  
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reaction was the most commonly reported AESI. Injection site pain was the  most 
frequently reported event, 39.4%  in the somatrogon group compared with 25.2%  in the somatropin 
group. Injection site erythema and injection  site pruritus were the next most frequently reported ISRs 
in the somatrogon group. Severe injection site reactions were reported more frequently in the 
somatrogon compared to the  somatropin group (6.4%  vs 3.5%).   The incidence of ISR in the OLE was 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 116/127 
 
 
 
 
26.9%.  Subjects previously treated with  somatropin reported a higher rate of ISRs (40.7%)  compared 
with  subjects previously treated with  somatrogon (16.3%). 
Injections site pain were most commonly reported in  the first 6 months of treatment, but  most 
subjects reported multiple episodes of injection site pain. The incidence rate for injection site pain was 
higher in males compared to females and in Asian subjects compared to White subjects and in  younger 
patients (>3  years to =<7) and across peak GH level categories in the somatrogon group compared to 
somatropin Section 4.8  has been updated to include this information on time to  onset and duration of 
injection site reaction.  
Immunogenicity 
In the Phase 3 main study 18.3%  in the somatrogon group and 7.8%  in the somatropin group reported 
AEs related to immunogenicity/hypersensitivity. In the somatrogon group, the most frequent events 
were conjunctivitis  allergic (2.8%),  rash generalized (2.8%),  and rhinitis allergic (2.8%). Most  events 
were mild or moderate in severity. Two reports eyelid oedema and 1 report of idiopathic urticaria were 
related to  somatrogon. 
In somatrogon treated patients, the  incidence of AESIs in the immunogenicity category were higher 
overall in the Asian population compared to the White  population, in the male population compared to 
the female population  in the subgroup: >3 years to =<7  w compared to the somatropin treated 
populations. 
Within  the phase 2 study CP-4-004 among 42 somatrogon-treated subjects, 10 subjects (23.8%) 
tested ADA+ for somatrogon at 6 months  (Week 26), and 5 of these subjects (11.9%) tested ADA+ at 
12 months  (Week 52), suggesting that  transient anti-somatrogon antibodies had developed. No 
subjects receiving the lowest dose (0.25  mg/kg/week) developed ADAs. Regarding the data presented 
so far for the phase 2 study (CP-4-004),  testing  ADA+ for somatrogon does not  seem to have an 
overall effect on the  incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, or AESIs throughout the  study.  
In the registration study CP-4-006, 84/109  patients  (77.1%) tested  ADA+ for somatrogon at any time 
during the main study. Median time  to the first ADA+ result was 6 months, and 83/84  subjects had 
persistent ADA+ results. The tolerability of somatrogon seems to be partially better in  patients tested 
negative for ADA, particular regarding immunogenicity (21.4%  vs 8.0%),  injection site reactions 
(46.4%  vs 32.0%)  and abdominal symptoms (13.1%  vs 4.0%). 
The incidence of injection site reactions was numerically higher in ADA+ subjects compared to ADA- 
subjects and 6 of the  7 subjects with  severe injection site reactions in the somatrogon group, tested 
ADA+. Most  subjects who tested ADA+ showed specificity to rhGH.  Four subjects who  tested ADA+ 
showed specificity to CTP. Two somatrogon-treated subjects tested positive for somatrogon NAbs 
during the main study. 
Further adverse  event  of special interest 
Although the  effect was small in the paediatric population,  the data presented confirmed that 
somatrogon might  affect the glucose tolerance as well as the thyroid and adrenal cortical function. 
The incidence of AEs related to benign neoplasia was low overall, similar in the somatrogon and 
somatropin groups, and limited to  the events of skin papilloma and melanocytic naevus.   
Other AESI categories for which events were reported, included adrenal cortical hypofunction, 
arthralgia and pain in extremity. No subjects reported elevated pancreatic enzymes (eg, amylase or 
lipase) or had a diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis.  
In the Phase 3 OLE,  34.4% of subjects reported AESIs. Events were more commonly reported in 
subjects originally randomised to somatropin. Most  were mild to moderate in severity and were not

related to  study medication. The incidences in most of the categories were low and similar in   CP-4-
004 main study period and OLE periods as well. 
IGF-1   
During the main study period of the phase 2 study CP-4-004, no subjects in the 0.25  mg/kg/week 
group or 0.48  mg/kg group had levels of IGF-1 SDS >2 at any time point during  the 12 months safety 
analysis period.  Only one subject in 0.66 mg/kg/week group had levels of IGF-1 SDS >2 at 5 visits.  
At Visit 12,  the subject’s IGF-1  values tested within  normal range.  The subject’s dose was reduced 
from 0.66  mg/kg/week (Cohort 3 dose) to 0.48 mg/kg/week prior to Visit 6 (Week 14).   No other AEs 
were reported in this subject, including  those known to  be related to high IGF-1 levels in  adult subjects 
(such as headache or oedema). 
In the pivotal phase 3 study the  proportion of study participants reporting an IGF-1 level >2 SDs was 
higher in the somatrogon group compared to somatropin and increased across all treatment  cycles. 
12.8%  of somatrogon treated compared with 0.9%  treated with  somatropin had sustained levels (>2 
consecutive visits which lasted at least ~ 13  weeks). The incidence of subjects in the somatrogon 
group with  IGF-1 SDS >2 increased over the time. Of the 26 subjects in the somatrogon group with 
elevated IGF-1 SDS>2, twenty-three (23) subjects had at least 1 of their IGF-1 samples obtained 2- or 
3-days post dose, rather than 4 days post dose. In the somatrogon group, 14 subjects experienced 
persistent IGF-1 levels >2 SDS (ie,2  consecutive SDS>2 measurements) resulting in dose modification 
for 12 of these subjects. The other 2 subjects had their persistent IGF-1 levels above 2  SDS at 9 and 
12 months;  therefore, their dose was not reduced during  the 12-month  study). Eight  of these subjects 
reported other AESIs (injection site reaction, vomiting/nausea, abdominal pain, hypothyroidism).  
Modelled mean and median values although falling below the >2SDS threshold increased over the 12-
month duration  of the phase 3 pivotal study. In the phase 2 OLE  the proportion of subjects with  IGF-1 
>2 fluctuated  (15.9% in  year 2, 16.3% in year 3,  2.6% in year 4.  
Scoliosis 
Two subjects reported scoliosis, 1 subject reported mild scoliosis during Period IV (Year 3 of OLE) that 
was deemed possibly related to the study treatment and 1 subject reported an SAE of severe scoliosis 
during Period IV (Year 4 of OLE), which was considered probably related to study treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology test  results were generally stable and comparable between the treatment  groups. 
However, the  number of subjects who shifted from normal to high eosinophils at 12 months  was higher 
for the somatrogon group than for the somatropin one. In addition, clinically relevant mild to  moderate 
anaemia was reported. Chemistry test results were generally stable and comparable between the 
treatment groups as well.  However, a shift from normal to high  values of phosphate (known effects of 
GH therapy) was reported for more subjects in the  somatrogon group than in the somatropin group. 
The changes in the lipid  parameters (cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, HDL cholesterol and 
LDL cholesterol) were generally small and consistent  between both  treatment groups.  
Vital  Signs 
Subjects treated with  somatrogon reported an increase in BMI across repeat treatment cycles, 
however those treated with somatropin showed a reduction in  BMI during  the main period of both 
studies followed by increases in BMI after switching to  somatrogon during the OLE periods.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of patients (N=269)  is limited for a safety database and does not fully fulfil the 
requirements of the ICH-E1.  However, the safety profile of somatropin in  the paediatric population is 
well described in the literature and in other GH formulations approved for use in this  population. The 
safety database is considered sufficient  to compare the short-term safety profile with the  known profile 
of GH. The applicant has also provided an updated pooled safety analysis up to the data cut-off date of 
21 December 2020, with  exposure adjusted analyses for patients across Phase 2 (CP-4-004)  and Phase 
3 studies (CP-4-006)  along with their ongoing OLE  periods.  
Although 35  subjects have been treated with  somatrogon for up  to 5 years, the safety database is 
insufficient to  fully characterise the long-term safety of non-physiological GH profile. The mean and 
median levels of IGF-1  levels (observed and modelled) although  within  normal range increased over 
the 12 months  of the  phase 3 study. The proportion of subjects with  IGF values>2 also increased over 
this period. A higher proportion of the somatrogon population  had clinically significant out-of-range 
IGF-1 value compared to somatropin.  
Some subjects may have had IGF-1 SDS >2  because the samples were collected earlier in the dosing 
interval than the optimal 96-hour  timepoint outlined in  the protocol. The SmPC states that  dosage may 
be adjusted as necessary, based on growth velocity, body weight and serum insulin-like  growth factor 
1 (IGF-1) concentrations,  and additional guidance on how to titrate  somatrogon in response to an 
IGF-1 level that  falls outside the target range (upper normal range not exceeding 2 SDS) was also 
included. 
For patients with  IGF-1>2SDS a tabulated  summary of demographic details, actual dose administered 
dose of somatrogon and extent of dose adjustment,  duration of IGF-1 >2SDS, due high level of IGF 
has been presented by the applicant. No  obvious pattern is identifiable in terms of dose administration, 
time to onset of elevated IGF-1 value, incidence /severity of related adverse events or ADA status that 
would help characterise patients with  IGF-1 > 2SDS. The rationale presented by the applicant in 
support of measurement of mean instead of peak IGF-1 levels is accepted.  
The applicant’s comment that  the transient increase in IGF-1 is not associated with  an adverse safety 
profile and therefore does not merit inclusion of IGF-1 as an ADR in  section 4.8  is accepted.  
The tumorigenic potential of IGF-1, a key mediator of GH activity and secreted in response to GH 
receptor activation is well established. The impact of higher IGF-1 levels on long term safety profile of 
somatrogon has not been fully evaluated. The applicant has proposed a non-interventional 10yr PASS 
study as an additional  pharmacovigilance measure to further characterize malignancy and diabetes. 
Risk of malignancy and diabetogenic potential have also been included as important potential  risks in 
the RMP.  
With  the expectation of better tolerability of weekly somatrogon over daily hGH dosing the clinical 
implications of the observed high reporting rates of painful injections in the somatrogon group is a 
concern. The different methodologies used for collecting injection site reactions in somatrogon and 
somatropin treated populations  makes it difficult to  compare the incidence of ISRs across treatment 
groups. 
Severe ISRs were reported more frequently in the somatrogon treated population (mostly ADA+). 
There was no clear pattern of ADA positivity identified in these cases of severe ISR. The disparity 
between the number of  reports of injection site pain reported as a severe AEs across different 
analyses (e.g. AESI ISR and Injection site reactions by site of injection  analyses)  and the high 
numbers of patients  self-reporting  pain score above or equal 4 which  described  the highest  level of 
pain experienced by children is a concern. The validity of the injection site assessment (local reactions) 
Assessment report  
EMA/15620/2022  
Page 119/127 
 
 
 
has not been discussed by the  applicant. The pain assessment scale, the FACES Pain Rating Scale is 
based on the established Wong-Baker FACES scale and is a widely accepted and reliable tool used in 
routine practice and clinical research. The applicant has reviewed and discussed any risk factors that 
could have contributed to  the incidence of ISR. No  other measures other than rotating  the site of 
injection can be recommended to reduce the  pain. Advice to users regarding rotation  of injection sites 
is included in section 4.2. The wording in Section 4.2 has been revised to be consistent with  the 
language in Section 6.6  (Special precautions for disposal and other handling). 
Two significant anomalies regarding reporting laboratory results were identified  but further details 
including root causes analyses have been provided regarding these errors. Details of an FDA GCP 
inspection that  took place during the Phase 3 studies has also been provided for review, with  no 
findings of note. 
The laboratory parameters were stable and were mainly in the  normal range. Abnormal values for 
several parameters were revaluated by the applicant.  Anaemia and eosinophilia have been added to 
section 4.8 as ADRs. 
There is a tendency for greater weight  gain and increase in BMI in subjects treated with  somatrogon 
compared to those treated with somatropin.  Subject treated with somatropin reported   a decrease in 
BMI during the main period of both  studies followed by increases in BMI after switching  to somatrogon 
during the OLE periods.  
These changes, particularly for somatrogon, likely represent increases in weight  and BMI related to the 
changes in  body composition associated with  increases in HV and Height SDS. 
The incidence of anti-hGH  antibody formation was noticeably higher in the  somatrogon compared to 
the somatropin population in both  studies.  Antibody formation was more persistent in patients  treated 
with  somatrogon. A small number of antibodies to somatrogon were identified as nAbs. AEs related to 
immunogenicity/hypersensitivity were reported in 18.3%  in the somatrogon group and 7.8% in  the 
somatropin group. 
There were considerable inconsistencies regarding immunological events within  the  dossier, however 
the applicant has provided information to show that  this does not change the  outcome of the findings 
or report.  
Within  the ADA-positive subgroup exposure ranges were huge with  up to 96-fold for Cmin and 
prolonged half-life up to 56  hours. ADA impact  on PK has not yet been sufficiently investigated and 
several issues are raised: e.g. to  detail whether also PD markers such as IFG-1,  IGF 1 SDS were 
differently affected by different ADA titers,  to simulate how PK parameter develop after change to pen 
for both ADA positive and negative patients. “Worst case scenarios” for exposure and PD considering 
combined intrinsic factors, like light  young female patient  with  ADAs vs. older heavier male without 
ADAs, are requested.  In summary, Immunogenicity particularly in  relation to  severe injections site 
reactions will  be further characterised in the post  authorisation setting. Immunogenicity was included 
as an important  potential risk in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The aim of treatment is replacement of GH in patients  with  GDH deficiency, to enable normal adult 
height.  Furthermore, GHD also impacts on bone, lipid, protein and glucose metabolism in children, with 
findings that  include decreased bone mineral density, decreased lean body mass and increased fat 
mass. 
Currently the treatment is rhGH therapy administered by daily SC injections. The rationale for 
developing long lasting GH  formulations is that  patients would  require less frequent injections which 
may improve compliance. 
Two paediatric studies,  a phase 3 registration study (CP-4-006) and a supportive Phase 2  dose finding 
study (CP-4-004),  were conducted in support of long-term treatment of paediatric patients  with  GHD. 
Both studies enrolled similar patient populations  prepubertal, GH treatment-naive children with a 
verified diagnosis of GHD. The applicant received CHMP SA and followed this in their development 
programme for the most  part. 
The phase 3 study demonstrated that  the annual 12-month HV  with somatrogon administered once 
weekly in the Phase 3 registration study  was non-inferior to Genotropin administered once daily. The 
study met its primary objective.

Weekly somatrogon treatment  produces catch-up growth and height  normalization, as reflected by HV, 
change in HT SDS and HT SDS. The change in HT SDS in the Phase 3 registration study was 
numerically higher compared to daily somatropin. 
Bone maturation  values demonstrated that  growth improvement was not  associated with accelerated 
BA advancement relative to CA. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that  over 12 months, treatment with  somatrogon was not  inferior to 
daily somatropin therapy.  
Additional guidance is given in section 4.2 of the SmPC on how to titrate somatrogon in response to an 
IGF-1 level outside the  target range. In patients whose serum IGF-1 concentrations exceed the mean 
reference value for their age and sex by more than 2 standard deviation score (SDS), the dose of 
somatrogon should be reduced by 15%.  More than one dose reduction may be required in  some 
patients.  Routine monitoring  of serum IGF 1 SDS levels throughout  the course of treatment is 
recommended, especially during puberty. 
The supportive Phase 2 dose finding study (CP-4-004)  was conducted in two parts, an initial dose 
finding part which  confirmed the appropriateness of the 0.66mg/Kg/day dose, and a subsequent Open 
Label Extension (OLE) part. Of the two,  the OLE part is more significant, as it  provided some evidence 
regarding the efficacy profile of the  medicine when used over an extended period (3  years). The data 
from the  OLE were similar to growth profiles for patients  treated with  other GH products for whom data 
was captured in  patient registries. 
The overall safety database is small. From the data available the short-term safety profile of 
somatrogon is generally in line with  the safety profile of the comparator somatropin with two 
exceptions, Injection site reactions, and antibody formation. Long term safety, particularly with  the 
pen presentation intended for authorisation,  is limited.  The incidence of subjects in  the somatrogon 
group with  IGF-1 SDS >2 increased over time. The impact of transient  elevations of serum IGF-I and 
supra-physiological IGF-I levels between injections over the  longer term is unclear. IGF-1 has been 
associated with  glucose intolerance and may have a role in tumorigenesis.  The risks related to  non-
pulsatile physiological levels and sustained high IGF-1  levels above the physiological range over longer 
term exposure with somatrogon will be evaluated in a non-interventional PASS. Other known adverse 
events associated with GH treatment  will also be evaluated in the post authorisation safety study. 
Long-term efficacy of somatrogon, specifically height  velocity (HV), height  SDS (Ht  SDS), change in Ht 
SDS and final height have been included as secondary endpoints in the active surveillance study to 
monitor the real-world long-term safety of somatrogon among paediatric patients in  Europe. 
Reports of treatment related TEAES generally were higher in  somatrogon compared to somatropin 
treatment groups. This was mainly due to reports of injection site  reactions (ISRs) in particular 
injection site pain. The majority of the reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Severe reactions 
were reported more frequently with  somatrogon. These reactions decreased over subsequent months 
but  a number of children in  the studies reported multiple painful  injections. Switching from somatropin 
to somatrogon in the phase 3 OLE  was also associated with  an increase report of painful ISRs.  The 
methodologies used to collect data on ISRs makes it difficult  to compare rates of ISRs across 
treatment groups. Uncertainties remain regarding the rates of injections site reactions, in particular in 
regard to the determination of severity of injection site pain between patients treated with  somatrogon 
and somatropin. The majority of severe ISRs (6/7) were ADA+, although the  applicant argues that 
most ISRs occurred within  6 months of treatment and ADA positivity wasn’t  established until  around 6 
months after treatment started. In three cases ADA positivity was sustained across 24  + months.  Five 
subjects withdrew from pivotal study/OLE  because of an ISR (pain, erythema, induration, pruritus). 
The development of long-acting HGH  analogues that allow for decreased injection frequency come with

the expectation of better  tolerability of weekly over daily HGH dosing. The clinical implications of the 
observed higher reporting rates of painful injections in the  somatrogon group is a concern. Painful 
invasive procedures in young children are associated with  stress, and anxiety and can affect 
compliance with  treatment.  
No measures have been identified other than injection site rotation that  can reduce the pain associated 
with  injection.   
Immunogenicity of somatrogon is clearly increased compared to daily somatropin and appears to  lead 
to increased exposure to somatrogon and consequently IGF-1 levels and may also be associated with 
immune-mediated adverse effects. Indeed, IGF-1 levels increased over time. Recommendations for 
IGF-1 monitoring 96  hours after injection of somatrogon along with  a recommendation that   dose 
adjustments should be  made as necessary, based on growth  velocity, body weight  and serum insulin-
like growth  factor 1  (IGF-1) concentrations  have been substantiated  by the  applicant and additional 
wording has been included in section 4.2.  A target IGF-1 SDS in  the upper normal range not  exceeding 
2 SDS is also included in  section 4.2.    
The impact of persistent high  levels of antibodies on the clinical effects of somatrogon is unclear. 
Although there were no reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, there were more reports of local 
skin, eye and upper respiratory hypersensitivity reactions in the somatrogon group. Of note the 
majority of subjects with  sever ISRs were ADA+. The ADA titres fluctuated across all time points  with 
titres ranging from 250 to >6250  detected at varying time points.  There was no clear pattern of ADA 
positivity identified in these cases of severe ISR.  ‘immunogenicity specifically related to long term 
clinical impact on lack of efficacy and safety (especially in relation to severe injections site reactions)’. 
is included as an important  potential risk in  the safety specification of the  RMP.  
A number of laboratory data handling and processing errors were identified during the  conduct of the 
pivotal phase 3 study. This is an application with  one pivotal trial and both  these errors occurred in the 
pivotal trial. 7 sites were involved in the second error which suggest a systemic failure rather than  just 
difficulty at one site. The applicant has provided further information, including root cause analyses for 
the laboratory data handling and processing errors. This has addressed any concerns relating to the 
conduct of the trial and data integrity. The applicant has also indicated that  GCP inspections were 
conducted for the  somatrogon clinical CP-006 and there were no findings of note. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  study  results  of  conducted  clinical  studies  supports  that  efficacy  of  once-weekly  somatrogon  in 
treatment naïve prepubertal GHD children (3-11  years) is non inferior to daily somatropin treatment. 
Patients treated up to 5 years showed that somatrogon was effective and further data should be available 
in relation to longer term use in the planned non interventional PASS. Patients switched from somatropin 
to  somatrogon in  the  OLE  phase (after 12  months  in  the  phase 3  DBP) showed that  patients  achieved 
benefit.  
The treatment burden study conducted demonstrated that the majority of patients preferred once-weekly 
treatment  compared to  daily  injections.    Therefore, beneficial  effects have  been  demonstrated  in  the 
population enrolled into the clinical development programme. 
The applicant  has provided   an updated  analysis of  pooled data  (TEAEs, SAEs, AESIs, ADA status  etc.) 
with exposure adjusted analyses for patients across Phase 2 (CP-4-004) and Phase 3 studies (CP-4-006) 
along  with  their  ongoing  OLE  periods,  including  data  collected  following  the  initial  submission  cut-off

point  of 01 November 2019  up  to the  data cut-off date of 21  December 2020. Integration of the  safety 
data from the four studies has resulted in a more robust estimate of the AE frequency and identification 
of  a  number  of  additional  ADRs.    .  Concerns  remain  regarding  the  long-term  safety  implications  of 
increased  levels  of  IGF-1  including  the  potential  for  neoplasia  (benign  and  malignant)  and  impaired 
glucose tolerance. The  impact of  immunogenicity over the  longer term  is also a  concern. These issues 
will  be followed-up in  a planned active surveillance study to  monitor the  real-world long-term  safety of 
somatrogon in  paediatric patients. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Somatropin  Biopartners  was  another  long-acting  growth  hormone-containing  product  approved  by 
CHMP.  Post authorisation safety studies were agreed to characterise the  long-term risks of exposure to 
non-physiological growth hormone and IGF-I.  The marketing authorisation ceased to be valid due to the 
sunset clause.  
A  PASS is  proposed  to  assess  long-term  safety  (neoplasm,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  other  known  side 
effects of GH  treatment) of somatrogon in  children with growth  hormone deficiency. Long-term efficacy 
of somatrogon, specifically height velocity (HV), height SDS (Ht SDS), change in Ht SDS and final height 
have been included as secondary endpoints in the PASS. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Ngenla is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that  Ngenla is not similar to Sogroya within the  meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Ngenla is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Ngenla is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents from 3 years of age with  growth 
disturbance due to  insufficient secretion of growth hormone. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other  conditions and requirements of the  marketing  authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety  Update  Reports 
Assessment report

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this  product 
within  6 months following  authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the  safe and effective  use of the  medicinal product 
•  Risk Management  Plan  (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH)  shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module  1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important  (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation)  milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the  safe and effective  use of the  medicinal product 
to be implemented by  the Member  States 
Not  applicable. 
New  Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP  review of the  available data, the CHMP considers that  somatrogon is to  be qualified 
as a new active substance in  itself as it  is not a constituent  of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within  the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

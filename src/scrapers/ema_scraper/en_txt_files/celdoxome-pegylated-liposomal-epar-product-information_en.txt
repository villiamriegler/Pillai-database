1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion contains 2 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride in a 
pegylated liposomal formulation. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal concentrate for dispersion for infusion, a liposome formulation, is 
doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in liposomes with surface-bound methoxypolyethylene glycol 
(MPEG). This process is known as pegylation and protects liposomes from detection by the 
mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which increases blood circulation time. 
Excipients with known effect 
Each mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion contains 9.6 mg fully hydrogenated soy 
phosphatidylcholine (from soybean) (see section 4.3). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is indicated in adults: 
- 
- 
- 
as monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased 
cardiac risk. 
for treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy regimen. 
in combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are 
unsuitable for bone marrow transplant. 
for treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts 
(< 200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line 
chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, 
prior combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca 
alkaloid, bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified 
oncologist specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents.

Celdoxome pegylated liposomal exhibits unique pharmacokinetic properties and must not be used 
interchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
Posology 
Breast cancer/ovarian cancer 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should be administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m2 once 
every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate 
treatment. 
Multiple myeloma 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should be administered at 30 mg/m2 on Day 4 of the bortezomib 
3 week regimen as a 1 hour infusion administered immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The 
bortezomib regimen consists of 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks. The dose should be 
repeated as long as patients respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. Day 4 dosing of both 
medicinal products may be delayed up to 48 hours as medically necessary. Doses of bortezomib 
should be at least 72 hours apart. 
AIDS-related KS 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should be administered intravenously at 20 mg/m2 every two-to-three 
weeks. Intervals shorter than 10 days should be avoided as medicinal product accumulation and 
increased toxicity cannot be ruled out. Treatment of patients for two-to-three months is recommended 
to achieve a therapeutic response. Treatment should be continued as needed to maintain a therapeutic 
response. 
For all patients 
If the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction (see sections 4.4 and 4.8), the 
infusion must be discontinued immediately, appropriate premedications should be given 
(antihistamine and/or short acting corticosteroid) and treatment restarted at a slower rate. 
Guidelines for Celdoxome pegylated liposomal dose modification 
To manage adverse reactions such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), stomatitis or 
haematological toxicity, the dose may be reduced or delayed. Guidelines for Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal dose modification secondary to these adverse reactions are provided in the tables below. 
The toxicity grading in these tables is based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria (NCI-CTC). 
The tables for PPE (Table 1) and stomatitis (Table 2) provide the schedule followed for dose 
modification in clinical trials in the treatment of breast or ovarian cancer (modification of the 
recommended 4-week treatment cycle): if these toxicities occur in patients with AIDS-related KS, the 
recommended 2 to 3 week treatment cycle can be modified in a similar manner. 
The table for haematological toxicity (Table 3) provides the schedule followed for dose modification 
in clinical trials in the treatment of patients with breast or ovarian cancer only. Dose modification in 
patients with AIDS-KS is provided following Table 4.

For multiple myeloma patients treated with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal in combination with 
bortezomib who experience PPE or stomatitis, the Celdoxome pegylated liposomal dose should be 
modified as described in Table 1 and 2 above respectively. Table 4, below provides the schedule 
followed for other dose modifications in the clinical trial in the treatment of patients with multiple 
myeloma receiving Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and bortezomib combination therapy. For more 
detailed information on bortezomib dosing and dose adjustments, see the SmPC for bortezomib.

For AIDS-KS patients treated with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal, haematological toxicity may 
require dose reduction or suspension or delay of therapy. Treatment with liposomal doxorubicin 
should be temporarily suspended in patients when the ANC count is < 1 000/mm3 and/or the platelet 
count is < 50 000/mm3. G-CSF (or GM-CSF) may be given as concomitant therapy to support the 
blood count when the ANC count is < 1 000/mm3 in subsequent cycles. 
Hepatic impairment  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liposomal doxorubicin pharmacokinetics determined in a small number of patients with elevated total 
bilirubin levels do not differ from patients with normal total bilirubin; however, until further 
experience is gained, the Celdoxome pegylated liposomal dose in patients with impaired hepatic 
function should be reduced based on the experience from the breast and ovarian clinical trial programs 
as follows: at initiation of therapy, if the bilirubin is between 1.2-3.0 mg/dL, the first dose is reduced 
by 25%. If the bilirubin is > 3.0 mg/dL, the first dose is reduced by 50%. If the patient tolerates the 
first dose without an increase in serum bilirubin or liver enzymes, the dose for cycle 2 can be 
increased to the next dose level, i.e., if reduced by 25% for the first dose, dose can be increased to full 
dose for cycle 2; if reduced by 50% for the first dose, dose can be increased to 75% of full dose for 
cycle 2. The dose can be increased to full dose for subsequent cycles if tolerated. Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal can be administered to patients with liver metastases with concurrent elevation of 
bilirubin and liver enzymes up to 4 x the upper limit of the normal range. Prior to Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal administration, hepatic function must be evaluated using conventional clinical 
laboratory tests such as ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. 
Renal impairment  
As doxorubicin is metabolised by the liver and excreted in the bile, dose modification should not be 
required. Population pharmacokinetic data (in the range of creatinine clearance tested of 30-
156 mL/min) demonstrate that liposomal doxorubicin clearance is not influenced by renal function. No 
pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. 
AIDS-related KS patients with splenectomy  
As there is no experience with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal in patients who have had splenectomy, 
treatment with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is not recommended. 
Paediatric population  
The experience in children is limited. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is not recommended in patients 
below 18 years of age. 
Elderly  
Population based analysis demonstrates that age across the range tested (21–75 years) does not 
significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. 
Method of administration  
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be administered as an intravenous infusion. For further 
instructions on preparation and special precautions for handling see section 6.6. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must not be administered as a bolus injection or undiluted dispersion. 
It is recommended that the Celdoxome pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the 
side port of an intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose to achieve further dilution and 
minimise the risk of thrombosis and extravasation. The infusion may be given through a peripheral 
vein. In-line filters must not be used. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must not be given by the 
intramuscular or subcutaneous route (see section 6.6). 
For doses < 90 mg: Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 250 mL 5% (50 mg/mL) 
glucose solution for infusion. 
For doses ≥ 90 mg: Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 500 mL 5% (50 mg/mL) 
glucose solution for infusion.

Breast cancer/ovarian cancer/multiple myeloma 
To minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose should be administered at a rate not greater 
than 1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent infusions of Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal may be administered over a 60-minute period. 
In those patients who experience an infusion reaction, the method of infusion should be modified as 
follows: 
5% of the total dose should be infused slowly over the first 15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, 
the infusion rate may then be doubled for the next 15 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be 
completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. 
AIDS-related KS 
The dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 250 mL 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose 
solution for infusion and administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must not be used to treat AIDS-KS that may be treated effectively 
with local therapy or systemic alfa-interferon. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Given the difference in pharmacokinetic profiles and dosing schedules, Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal should not be used interchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
Cardiac toxicity  
It is recommended that all patients receiving liposomal doxorubicin routinely undergo frequent ECG 
monitoring. Transient ECG changes such as T-wave flattening, S-T segment depression and benign 
arrhythmias are not considered mandatory indications for the suspension of a liposomal doxorubicin 
therapy. However, reduction of the QRS complex is considered more indicative of cardiac toxicity. If 
this change occurs, the most definitive test for anthracycline myocardial injury, i.e., endomyocardial 
biopsy, must be considered. 
More specific methods for the evaluation and monitoring of cardiac functions as compared to ECG are 
a measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography or preferably by Multigated 
Angiography (MUGA). These methods must be applied routinely before the initiation of a liposomal 
doxorubicin therapy and repeated periodically during treatment. The evaluation of left ventricular 
function is considered to be mandatory before each additional administration of liposomal doxorubicin 
that exceeds a lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose of 450 mg/m2. 
The evaluation tests and methods mentioned above concerning the monitoring of cardiac performance 
during anthracycline therapy are to be employed in the following order: ECG monitoring, 
measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction, endomyocardial biopsy. If a test result indicates 
possible cardiac injury associated with liposomal doxorubicin therapy, the benefit of continued 
therapy must be carefully weighed against the risk of myocardial injury. 
In patients with cardiac disease requiring treatment, liposomal doxorubicin should only be 
administered when the benefit outweighs the risk to the patient. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with impaired cardiac function who receive liposomal 
doxorubicin. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whenever cardiomyopathy is suspected, i.e., the left ventricular ejection fraction has substantially 
decreased relative to pre-treatment values and/or left ventricular ejection fraction is lower than a 
prognostically relevant value (e.g., < 45%), endomyocardial biopsy may be considered and the benefit 
of continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of developing irreversible cardiac 
damage. 
Congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, without prior ECG changes and 
may also be encountered several weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Caution must be observed in patients who have received other anthracyclines. The total dose of 
doxorubicin hydrochloride must also take into account any previous (or concomitant) therapy with 
cardiotoxic compounds such as other anthracyclines/anthraquinones or e.g., 5-fluorouracil. Cardiac 
toxicity also may occur at cumulative anthracycline doses lower than 450 mg/m2 in patients with prior 
mediastinal irradiation or in those receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy. 
The cardiac safety profile for the dosing schedule recommended for both breast and ovarian cancer 
(50 mg/m2) is similar to the 20 mg/m2 profile in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8). 
Myelosuppression  
Many patients treated with liposomal doxorubicin have baseline myelosuppression due to such factors 
as their pre-existing HIV disease or numerous concomitant or previous medicinal product, or tumours 
involving bone marrow. In the pivotal trial in patients with ovarian cancer treated at a dose of 
50 mg/m2, myelosuppression was generally mild to moderate, reversible, and was not associated with 
episodes of neutropaenic infection or sepsis. Moreover, in a controlled clinical trial of liposomal 
doxorubicin vs. topotecan, the incidence of treatment related sepsis was substantially less in the 
liposomal doxorubicin-treated ovarian cancer patients as compared to the topotecan treatment group. 
A similar low incidence of myelosuppression was seen in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
receiving liposomal doxorubicin in a first-line clinical trial. In contrast to the experience in patients 
with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, myelosuppression appears to be the dose-limiting adverse event 
in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8). Because of the potential for bone marrow suppression, 
periodic blood counts must be performed frequently during the course of a liposomal doxorubicin 
therapy, and at a minimum, prior to each dose of liposomal doxorubicin. 
Persistent severe myelosuppression may result in superinfection or haemorrhage. 
In controlled clinical trials in patients with AIDS-KS against a bleomycin/vincristine regimen, 
opportunistic infections were apparently more frequent during treatment with liposomal doxorubicin. 
Patients and doctors must be aware of this higher incidence and take action as appropriate. 
Secondary haematological malignancies  
As with other DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, secondary acute myeloid leukemias and 
myelodysplasias have been reported in patients having received combined treatment with doxorubicin. 
Therefore, any patient treated with doxorubicin should be kept under haematological supervision. 
Secondary oral neoplasms  
Very rare cases of secondary oral cancer have been reported in patients with long-term (more than one 
year) exposure to liposomal doxorubicin or those receiving a cumulative liposomal doxorubicin dose 
greater than 720 mg/m2. Cases of secondary oral cancer were diagnosed both, during treatment with 
liposomal doxorubicin, and up to 6 years after the last dose. Patients should be examined at regular 
intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary 
oral cancer. 
Infusion-associated reactions  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious and sometimes life-threatening infusion reactions, which are characterised by allergic-like or 
anaphylactoid-like reactions, with symptoms including asthma, flushing, urticarial rash, chest pain, 
fever, hypertension, tachycardia, pruritus, sweating, shortness of breath, facial oedema, chills, back 
pain, tightness in the chest and throat and/or hypotension may occur within minutes of starting the 
infusion of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. Very rarely, convulsions also have been observed in 
relation to infusion reactions. Temporarily stopping the infusion usually resolves these symptoms 
without further therapy. However, medications to treat these symptoms (e.g., antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, adrenaline, and anticonvulsants), as well as emergency equipment should be available 
for immediate use. In most patients treatment can be resumed after all symptoms have resolved, 
without recurrence. Infusion reactions rarely recur after the first treatment cycle. To minimise the risk 
of infusion reactions, the initial dose should be administered at a rate no greater than 1 mg/minute (see 
section 4.2). 
Palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE) 
PPE is characterised by painful, macular reddening skin eruptions. In patients experiencing this event, 
it is generally seen after two or three cycles of treatment. Improvement usually occurs in 1 – 2 weeks, 
and in some cases, may take up to 4 weeks or longer for complete resolution. Pyridoxine at a dose of 
50-150 mg per day and corticosteroids have been used for the prophylaxis and treatment of PPE, 
however, these therapies have not been evaluated in phase III trials. Other strategies to prevent and 
treat PPE include keeping hands and feet cool, by exposing them to cool water (soaks, baths, or 
swimming), avoiding excessive heat/hot water and keeping them unrestricted (no socks, gloves, or 
shoes that are tight fitting). PPE appears to be primarily related to the dose schedule and can be 
reduced by extending the dose interval 1-2 weeks (see section 4.2). However, this reaction can be 
severe and debilitating in some patients and may require discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.8). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which may have an acute onset, has been observed in patients receiving 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, including fatal cases (see section 4.8). If patients experience 
worsening of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever, Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal should be interrupted and the patient should be promptly investigated. If ILD is confirmed, 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
Extravasation 
Although local necrosis following extravasation has been reported very rarely, Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal is considered to be an irritant. Animal studies indicate that administration of doxorubicin 
hydrochloride as a liposomal formulation reduces the potential for extravasation injury. If any signs or 
symptoms of extravasation occur (e.g., stinging, erythema) the infusion must be terminated 
immediately and restarted in another vein. The application of ice over the site of extravasation for 
approximately 30 minutes may be helpful in alleviating the local reaction. Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal must not be given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. 
Diabetic patients  
Please note that each vial of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains sucrose and the dose is 
administered in 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose solution for infusion. 
For common adverse events which required dose modification or discontinuation see section 4.8. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that  is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal medicinal product interaction studies have been performed with liposomal doxorubicin, 
although phase II combination trials with conventional chemotherapy agents have been conducted in 
patients with gynaecological malignancies. Caution in the concomitant use of medicinal products 
known to interact with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride must be exercised. Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal, like other doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations, may potentiate the toxicity of other anti-
cancer therapies. During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (including breast and ovarian 
cancer) who have received concomitant cyclophosphamide or taxanes, no new additive toxicities were 
noted. In patients with AIDS, exacerbation of cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis and 
enhancement of the hepatotoxicity of 6-mercaptopurine have been reported with standard doxorubicin 
hydrochloride. Caution must be exercised when giving any other cytotoxic agents, especially 
myelotoxic agents, at the same time. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child-bearing potential 
Women of child-bearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while they or their male partner 
are receiving Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and in the six months following discontinuation of 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal therapy (see section 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
Doxorubicin hydrochloride is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during 
pregnancy. Therefore, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless 
clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether doxorubicin hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many 
medicinal products, including anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, therefore mothers must discontinue breast-feeding 
prior to beginning doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment. Health experts recommend that HIV infected 
women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. 
Fertility 
The effect of doxorubicin hydrochloride on human fertility has not been evaluated (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Doxorubicin hydrochloride has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, in clinical trials to date, dizziness and somnolence were associated infrequently (< 5%) with 
the administration of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Patients who suffer from these effects must avoid 
driving and operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were neutropaenia, nausea, leukopaenia, anaemia, and 
fatigue. 
Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3/4 adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients) were 
neutropaenia, PPE, leukopaenia, lymphopaenia, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, stomatitis, fatigue, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, pyrexia, dyspnoea, and pneumonia. Less frequently reported severe

The most common undesirable effect reported in breast/ovarian clinical trials was palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE). The overall incidence of PPE reported was 41.3% and 51.1% in the ovarian 
and breast clinical trials, respectively. These effects were mostly mild, with severe (grade 3) cases 
reported in 16.3% and 19.6% of patients. The reported incidence of life-threatening (grade 4) cases 
was < 1%. PPE infrequently resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation (1.9% and 10.8%). PPE 
was reported in 16% of multiple myeloma patients treated with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal plus 
bortezomib combination therapy. Grade 3 PPE was reported in 5% of patients. No grade 4 PPE was 
reported. The rate of PPE was substantially lower in the AIDS-KS population (1.3% all grade, 0.4% 
grade 3 PPE, no grade 4 PPE). See section 4.4. 
Opportunistic infections 
Respiratory undesirable effects commonly occurred in clinical trials of liposomal doxorubicin and may 
be related to opportunistic infections (OI's) in the AIDS population. Opportunistic infections are 
observed in KS patients after administration of liposomal doxorubicin, and are frequently observed in 
patients with HIV-induced immunodeficiency. The most frequently observed OI's in clinical trials 
were candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and 
mycobacterium avium complex. 
Cardiac toxicity 
An increased incidence of congestive heart failure is associated with doxorubicin therapy at 
cumulative lifetime doses > 450 mg/m2 or at lower doses for patients with cardiac risk factors. 
Endomyocardial biopsies on nine of ten AIDS-KS patients receiving cumulative doses of liposomal 
doxorubicin greater than 460 mg/m2 indicate no evidence of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 
The recommended dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal for AIDS-KS patients is 20 mg/m2 every 
two-to-three weeks. The cumulative dose at which cardiotoxicity would become a concern for these 
AIDS-KS patients (> 400 mg/m2) would require more than 20 courses of Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal therapy over 40 to 60 weeks. 
In addition, endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 8 solid tumour patients with cumulative 
anthracycline doses of 509 mg/m2–1,680 mg/m2. The range of Billingham cardiotoxicity scores was 
grades 0-1.5. These grading scores are consistent with no or mild cardiac toxicity. 
In the pivotal phase III trial versus doxorubicin, 58/509 (11.4%) randomised subjects (10 treated with 
liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2/every 4 weeks versus 48 treated with doxorubicin at a 
dose of 60 mg/m2/every 3 weeks) met the protocol-defined criteria for cardiac toxicity during 
treatment and/or follow-up. Cardiac toxicity was defined as a decrease of 20 points or greater from 
baseline if the resting LVEF remained in the normal range or a decrease of 10 points or greater if the 
LVEF became abnormal (less than the lower limit for normal). None of the 10 liposomal doxorubicin-
treated subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria developed signs and symptoms of CHF. In 
contrast, 10 of 48 doxorubicin subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria also developed 
signs and symptoms of CHF. 
In patients with solid tumours, including a subset of patients with breast and ovarian cancers, treated at 
a dose of 50 mg/m2/cycle with lifetime cumulative anthracycline doses up to 1 532 mg/m2, the 
incidence of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction was low. Of the 418 patients treated with 
liposomal doxorubicin 50 mg/m2/cycle, and having a baseline measurement of left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) and at least one follow-up measurement assessed by MUGA scan, 88 patients had a 
cumulative anthracycline dose of > 400 mg/m2, an exposure level associated with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular toxicity with conventional doxorubicin. Only 13 of these 88 patients (15%) had at least 
one clinically significant change in their LVEF, defined as an LVEF value less than 45% or a decrease 
of at least 20 points from baseline. Furthermore, only 1 patient (cumulative anthracycline dose of 
944 mg/m2), discontinued study treatment because of clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure. 
Radiation recall phenomenon 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recall of skin reaction due to prior radiotherapy has occurred uncommonly with liposomal 
doxorubicin administration. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Acute overdosing with doxorubicin hydrochloride worsens the toxic effects of mucositis, leukopaenia 
and thrombocytopaenia. Treatment of acute overdose of the severely myelosuppressed patient consists 
of hospitalisation, antibiotics, platelet and granulocyte transfusions and symptomatic treatment of 
mucositis. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Cytotoxic antibiotics and related substances, anthracyclines and related 
substances, ATC code: L01DB01. 
Mechanism of action  
The active substance of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin hydrochloride, a cytotoxic 
anthracycline antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. The exact mechanism of 
the antitumour activity of doxorubicin is not known. It is generally believed that inhibition of DNA, 
RNA and protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic effects. This is probably the 
result of intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double helix thus 
preventing their unwinding for replication. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
A phase III randomised study of liposomal doxorubicin versus doxorubicin in patients with metastatic 
breast cancer was completed in 509 patients. The protocol-specified objective of demonstrating non-
inferiority between liposomal doxorubicin and doxorubicin was met, the hazard ratio (HR) for 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.00 (95% CI for HR=0.82-1.22). The treatment HR for PFS 
when adjusted for prognostic variables was consistent with PFS for the ITT population. 
The primary analysis of cardiac toxicity showed the risk of developing a cardiac event as a function of 
cumulative anthracycline dose was significantly lower with liposomal doxorubicin than with 
doxorubicin (HR=3.16, p < 0.001). At cumulative doses greater than 450 mg/m2 there were no cardiac 
events with liposomal doxorubicin. 
A phase III comparative study of liposomal doxorubicin versus topotecan in patients with epithelial 
ovarian cancer following the failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy was completed in 
474 patients. There was a benefit in overall survival (OS) for liposomal doxorubicin-treated patients 
over topotecan-treated patients as indicated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.216 (95% CI: 1.000; 1.478), 
p=0.050. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 56.3%, 34.7% and 20.2% respectively on 
liposomal doxorubicin, compared to 54.0%, 23.6% and 13.2% on topotecan. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the sub-group of patients with platinum-sensitive disease the difference was greater: HR of 1.432 
(95% CI: 1.066; 1.923), p=0.017. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 74.1%, 51.2% and 28.4% 
respectively on liposomal doxorubicin, compared to 66.2%, 31.0% and 17.5% on topotecan. 
The treatments were similar in the sub-group of patients with platinum-refractory disease: HR of 1.069 
(95% CI: 0.823; 1.387), p=0.618. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 41.5%, 21.1% and 13.8% 
respectively on liposomal doxorubicin, compared to 43.2%, 17.2% and 9.5% on topotecan. 
A phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study comparing the safety and 
efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib combination therapy with bortezomib monotherapy 
in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who did not progress 
while receiving anthracycline-based therapy, was conducted in 646 patients. There was a significant 
improvement in the primary endpoint of time to progression (TTP) for patients treated with 
combination therapy of liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib compared to patients treated with 
bortezomib monotherapy as indicated by a risk reduction (RR) of 35% (95% CI: 21-47%), p < 0.0001, 
based on 407 TTP events. The median TTP was 6.9 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients 
compared with 8.9 months for the liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib combination therapy 
patients. A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study 
termination for efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI: 29-
57%), p < 0.0001. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients 
compared with 9.3 months for the liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib combination therapy 
patients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis. The final 
analysis for overall survival (OS) performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no 
significant difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% 
CI; 25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 28.9-
37.1 months) for the liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib combination therapy patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is a long-circulating pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin 
hydrochloride. Pegylated liposomes contain surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer 
methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG). These linear MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface 
creating a protective coating that reduces interactions between the lipid bilayer membrane and the 
plasma components. This allows the Celdoxome pegylated liposomal liposomes to circulate for 
prolonged periods in the blood stream. Pegylated liposomes are small enough (average diameter of 
approximately 100 nm) to pass intact (extravasate) through defective blood vessels supplying tumours. 
Evidence of penetration of pegylated liposomes from blood vessels and their entry and accumulation 
in tumours has been seen in mice with C-26 colon carcinoma tumours and in transgenic mice with KS-
like lesions. The pegylated liposomes also have a low permeability lipid matrix and internal aqueous 
buffer system that combine to keep doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated during liposome 
residence time in circulation. 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in humans differ significantly 
from those reported in the literature for standard doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. At lower 
doses (10 mg/m2–20 mg/m2) liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride displayed linear pharmacokinetics. 
Over the dose range of 10 mg/m2–60 mg/m2 liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride displayed non-
linear pharmacokinetics. Standard doxorubicin hydrochloride displays extensive tissue distribution 
(volume of distribution: 700 to 1,100 L/m2) and a rapid elimination clearance (24 to 73 L/h/m2). In 
contrast, the pharmacokinetic profile of liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride indicates it is confined 
mostly to the vascular fluid volume and that the clearance of doxorubicin from the blood is dependent 
upon the liposomal carrier. Doxorubicin becomes available after the liposomes are extravasated and 
enter the tissue compartment. 
At equivalent doses, the plasma concentration and AUC values of liposomal doxorubicin 
hydrochloride which represent mostly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (containing 
90% to 95% of the measured doxorubicin) are significantly higher than those achieved with standard 
doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. 
17 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should not be used interchangeably with other formulations of 
doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
Population pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin was evaluated in 120 patients from 10 different 
clinical trials using the population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of liposomal 
doxorubicin over the dose range of 10 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m2 was best described by a two-compartment 
non-linear model with zero order input and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The mean intrinsic 
clearance of liposomal doxorubicin was 0.030 L/h/m2 (range 0.008 to 0.152 L/h/m2) and the mean 
central volume of distribution was 1.93 L/m2 (range 0.96-3.85 L/m2) approximating the plasma 
volume. The apparent half-life ranged from 24-231 hours, with a mean of 73.9 hours. 
Breast cancer patients  
The pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin determined in 18 patients with breast carcinoma were 
similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various 
cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.016 L/h/m2 (range 0.008-0.027 L/h/m2), the mean central 
volume of distribution was 1.46 L/m2 (range 1.10-1.64 L/m2). The mean apparent half-life was 
71.5 hours (range 45.2-98.5 hours). 
Ovarian cancer patients  
The pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin determined in 11 patients with ovarian carcinoma 
were similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various 
cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.021 L/h/m2 (range 0.009–0.041 L/h/m2), the mean central 
volume of distribution was 1.95 L/m2 (range 1.67–2.40 L/m2). The mean apparent half-life was 
75.0 hours (range 36.1–125 hours). 
AIDS-related KS patients  
The plasma pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin were evaluated in 23 patients with KS who 
received single doses of 20 mg/m2 administered by a 30-minute infusion. The pharmacokinetic 
parameters of liposomal doxorubicin (primarily representing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
hydrochloride and low levels of unencapsulated doxorubicin hydrochloride) observed after the 
20 mg/m2 doses are presented in Table 6.

In repeat dose studies conducted in animals, the toxicity profile of liposomal doxorubicin appears very 
similar to that reported in humans who receive long-term infusions of standard doxorubicin 
hydrochloride. With liposomal doxorubicin, the encapsulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride in 
pegylated liposomes results in these effects having a differing strength, as follows. 
Cardiotoxicity 
Studies in rabbits have shown that the cardiotoxicity of liposomal doxorubicin is reduced compared 
with conventional doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. 
Dermal toxicity 
In studies performed after the repeated administration of liposomal doxorubicin to rats and dogs, 
serious dermal inflammations and ulcer formations were observed at clinically relevant doses. In the 
study in dogs, the occurrence and severity of these lesions was reduced by lowering the dose or 
prolonging the intervals between doses. Similar dermal lesions, which are described as palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia were also observed in patients after long-term intravenous infusion (see 
section 4.8). 
Anaphylactoid response 
During repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs, an acute response characterised by hypotension, pale 
mucous membranes, salivation, emesis and periods of hyperactivity followed by hypoactivity and 
lethargy was observed following administration of pegylated liposomes (placebo). A similar, but less 
severe response was also noted in dogs treated with liposomal doxorubicin and standard doxorubicin. 
The hypotensive response was reduced in magnitude by pretreatment with antihistamines. However, 
the response was not life-threatening and the dogs recovered quickly upon discontinuation of 
treatment. 
Local toxicity 
Subcutaneous tolerance studies indicate that liposomal doxorubicin, as against standard doxorubicin 
hydrochloride, causes slighter local irritation or damage to the tissue after a possible extravasation. 
Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 
Although no studies have been conducted with liposomal doxorubicin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, the 
pharmacologically active ingredient of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal, is mutagenic and 
carcinogenic. Pegylated placebo liposomes are neither mutagenic nor genotoxic. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Liposomal doxorubicin resulted in mild to moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after a 
single dose of 36 mg/kg. Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were present in rats after 
repeat doses ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked 
decrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6). 
Nephrotoxicity 
A study has shown that liposomal doxorubicin at a single intravenous dose of over twice the clinical 
dose produces renal toxicity in monkeys. Renal toxicity has been observed with even lower single 
doses of doxorubicin hydrochloride in rats and rabbits. Since an evaluation of the post-marketing 
safety database for liposomal doxorubicin in patients has not suggested a significant nephrotoxicity 
liability of liposomal doxorubicin, these findings in monkeys may not have relevance to patient risk 
assessment.

Do not use material that shows evidence of precipitation or any other particulate matter. 
Caution must be exercised in handling Celdoxome pegylated liposomal dispersion. The use of gloves 
is required. If Celdoxome pegylated liposomal comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it must be 
immediately and thoroughly washed with soap and water. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be 
handled and disposed of in a manner consistent with that of other anticancer medicinal products in 
accordance with local requirements. 
The dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal to be administered should be determined (based upon the 
recommended dose and the patient's body surface area). The appropriate volume of Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal should be taken up into a sterile syringe. Aseptic technique must be strictly 
observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. 
The appropriate dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose 
solution for infusion prior to administration. For doses < 90 mg, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must 
be diluted in 250 mL, and for doses ≥ 90 mg, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 
500 mL. This can be infused over 60 or 90 minutes as detailed in section 4.2. 
The use of any diluent other than 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose solution for infusion, or the presence of any 
bacteriostatic agent such as benzyl alcohol may cause precipitation of Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal. 
It is recommended that the Celdoxome pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the 
side port of an intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose. Infusion may be given through a 
peripheral vein. Do not use with in-line filters. 
Partially used vials must be discarded.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is an antitumour agent. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is used to treat cancer of the breast in patients at risk for heart 
problems. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill 
cancer cells, shrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to 
treat multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi’s sarcoma 
including flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way 
as to selectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is 
enclosed in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal product from 
the blood stream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
Do not use Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
- 
if you are allergic to doxorubicin hydrochloride, peanut or soya, or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before receiving Celdoxome pegylated liposomal: 
- 
- 
if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease 
if you are diabetic, because Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  contains sugar which may require 
an adjustment to the treatment of your diabetes 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  
-  
if you have Kaposi’s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed 
if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth. 
The cases of Interstitial lung diseases have been observed in patients receiving pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin including fatal cases. The symptoms of Interstitial lung disease are cough and shortness of 
breath sometimes with fever which are not caused by physical activity. Seek immediate medical 
attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of Interstitial lung disease. 
Children and adolescents 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them. 
Other medicines and Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
-  
-  
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be 
taken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further 
reduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have 
received or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Because the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may 
cause birth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant. Avoid becoming 
pregnant while you or your partner are taking Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and in the six months 
following discontinuation of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal treatment. 
Because doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue 
breast-feeding before starting treatment with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. Health experts 
recommend that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order 
to avoid transmission of HIV. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains soya oil. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this 
medicine. See “Do not use Celdoxome pegylated liposomal”. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
‘essentially sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is a unique formulation. It must not be used interchangeably with 
other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
How much Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is given 
If you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be 
administered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and 
weight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are 
able to tolerate the treatment. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your 
body surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on Day 4 of the 
bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as 
you respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. 
If you are being treated for Kaposi’s sarcoma, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be administered at 
a dose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The 
dose is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an 
improvement in your condition. 
How Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is given 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. 
Depending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., 
90 minutes). 
If you use more Celdoxome pegylated liposomal than you should 
Acute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood 
cells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell 
transfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment 
of mouth sores. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

This leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only (see section 3): 
Caution must be exercised in handling Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. The use of gloves is required. 
If Celdoxome pegylated liposomal comes into contact with skin or mucosa, wash immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be handled and disposed of in a 
manner consistent with that of other anticancer medicinal products. 
Determine the dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal to be administered (based upon the 
recommended dose and the patient's body surface area). Take the appropriate volume of Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal up into a sterile syringe. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no 
preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. The appropriate dose 
of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal must be diluted in 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose solution for infusion 
prior to administration. For doses <90 mg, dilute Celdoxome pegylated liposomal in 250 mL, and for 
doses ≥90 mg, dilute Celdoxome pegylated liposomal in 500 mL. 
To minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than 
1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent infusions of Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal may be administered over a 60-minute period. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the breast cancer trial program, modification of the infusion was permitted for those patients 
experiencing an infusion reaction as follows: 5% of the total dose was infused slowly over the first 
15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, the infusion rate was doubled for the next 15 minutes. If 
tolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes.  
If the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction, immediately discontinue the 
infusion, give appropriate premedications (antihistamine and/or short acting corticosteroid) and restart 
at a slower rate. 
The use of any diluent other than 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose solution for infusion, or the presence of any 
bacteriostatic agent such as benzyl alcohol may cause precipitation of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. 
It is recommended that the infusion line of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal be connected through the 
side port of an intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/mL) glucose. Infusion may be given through a 
peripheral vein. Do not use with in-line filters.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for doxorubicin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on interstitial lung disease from the literature and spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers a causal relationship 
between pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and interstitial lung disease is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for doxorubicin the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing doxorubicin is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

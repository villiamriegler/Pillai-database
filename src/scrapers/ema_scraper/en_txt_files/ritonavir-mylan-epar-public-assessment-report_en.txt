2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Current treatment for HIV infection consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART. This has 
been highly beneficial to many HIV-infected individuals since its introduction in 1996 when the 
protease inhibitor-based HAART initially became available. Current optimal HAART options consist of 
combinations of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or "classes," of antiretroviral 
agents. 
Ritonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases. 
Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein 
precursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to 
initiate new rounds of infection. Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little 
inhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases. 
Ritonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study 
with clinical endpoints. However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical 
practice 
Coadministration of low dose ritonavir can increase the total area under the concentration-versus time 
curve (AUC) of most other PIs, as well as the minimum concentration (Cmin). Boosting with ritonavir 
also increases the maximum drug concentration (Cmax), although to a lesser extent than the AUC or 
Cmin. P-glycoprotein is expressed in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and blood–brain 
barrier, as well as in CD4+ lymphocytes. Its inhibition by ritonavir may thus not only help retain PI 
levels intracellularly but also increase the oral bioavailability, systemic exposure, and central-nervous-
system penetration of the primary PI and decrease the secretion of circulating drug into the intestinal 
lumen. 
This application is for a generic form of Ritonavir film-coated tablets in the strength of 100 mg. The 
active ingredient and the route of administration are the same for both products.

2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 100 mg of ritonavir as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: copovidone, sorbitan laurate, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium chloride, sodium stearyl 
fumarate. 
Film-coating: hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogols, hydroxypropylcellulose, talc, iron 
oxide yellow (E172), colloidal anhydrous silica, polysorbate 80. 
The product is available in pack sizes of 30, 90 and 100 film-coated tablets in HDPE bottle with 
polypropylene screw cap with inbuilt desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of ritonavir is thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(1S,2S,4S)-1-benzyl-2-hydroxy-4-[[(2S)-3-
methyl-2-[[methyl[[2-(1-methylethyl)thiazol-4-yl]methyl]carbamoyl]amino]butanoyl]amino]-5-
phenylpentyl]carbamate corresponding to the molecular formula C37H48N6O5S2. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 721 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1.  Active substance structure 
Ritonavir is a white or almost white powder, non-hygroscopic, practically insoluble in water, freely 
soluble in methanol and in methylene chloride, very slightly soluble in acetonitrile.  
Ritonavir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. The active substance 
manufacturer consistently produces the S-isomer of ritonavir.  
Polymorphism has been observed for ritonavir. Two forms are observed, designated Form-l and Form-
ll. The polymorphic form of three consecutive batches of ritonavir active substance has been tested by 
XRD. It has been confirmed that the process consistently produces Form-ll.

As there is a monograph of Ritonavir in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
Ritonavir which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification 
(IR), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (KF) and sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.) in line 
with  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  of  ritonavir  and  identification  of  polymorph  (PXRD),  residual  solvents 
(GC) and phenol impurity (LC-MS/MS) in line with the Certificate of Suitability. 
The  control  tests  were  carried out to  comply  with  the  specifications  and  test methods of  the  Ph.  Eur. 
Monograph  and  Certificate  of  Suitability.  All  additional  methods  have  been  adequately  validated  and 
described  according  to  ICH  Q2.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for 
assay and related substance testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
The relevant supporting information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of 
Suitability. The re-test period of the active substance as stated in the Certificate of Suitability is 60 
months if stored in double polyethylene bags (outer black) placed in a polyethylene container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Ritonavir 100mg film-coated tablets are immediate release, yellow coloured, film-coated, capsule 
shape tablets debossed with “M163” on one side and plain on other side with dimensions 
approximately 19.10 mm x 10.20 mm (Length x Width). 
The purpose of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic version of ritonavir 100 mg 
film-coated tablets which can be demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the EU reference product, Norvir 
100 mg film-coated tablets  
The early formulation development was performed with reference to the US reference product, Norvir 
100 mg soft gelatin capsules however, the comparative in-vivo (bioequivalence studies) and in-vitro 
(comparative dissolution and impurity profile studies) studies presented to support this application 
have been performed between the test product and the EU reference product, i.e. Norvir 100 mg film-
coated tablets  
Since the ritonavir active substance is insoluble in water, tablets prepared in a conventional way 
resulted in incomplete bioavailability. In order to enhance its bioavailability from the tablet dosage 
form, it was concluded that ritonavir must be present in the form of solid dispersion in the tablet. A 
solid dispersion can be prepared by using any of the following techniques; melt granulation, melt 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/749789/2017  
Page 9/24 
 
 
 
 
extrusion, solvent evaporation or spray drying. Based on past experience, the applicant decided to 
explore solvent evaporation techniques for making the solid dispersion during development trials. 
The applicant selected the excipients for product development studies taking into consideration the 
requirement of disintegration time in the range of 35 to 45 minutes, past experience, literature search 
and pre-formulation studies. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility studies 
between the active substance and chosen excipients have been performed to support the choice of 
excipients. 
A number of pilot scale formulation studies were performed to evaluate the effect of different 
concentrations of excipients on tablet characteristics. The resulting tablets were compared by physical 
evaluation and in vitro dissolution testing to Norvir 100 mg soft capsules, and the formulation was 
optimised taking account of these test results. 
The final proposed formulation of ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets is qualitatively similar to that of 
the reference product, Norvir 100 mg film-coated tablets, with the exception the proposed formulation 
contains sodium chloride and does not contain calcium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous.

The optimisation and scale-up of the manufacturing process has been adequately performed and was 
supported by relevant physicochemical and stability testing. 
The polymorphic form of ritonavir has been monitored and tested in the active substance, ritonavir 
premix and finished product by XRD testing. The active substance manufacturer consistently produces 
the same polymorphic form ritonavir. The applicant has characterised the polymorphic form throughout 
the various manufacturing steps and has demonstrated that the form of ritonavir is maintained in the 
finished product at release and throughout the shelf life. 
The applicant performed a comparative bio-equivalence study between ritonavir 100 mg film-coated 
tablets {Manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Limited, Nashik, India} and Norvir 100 mg film-coated 
Assessment report

tablets (Abbott Laboratories Limited, UK) in order to demonstrate bioequivalence of the test and 
reference products. The composition and manufacturing process of the test batch used in the bio-
equivalence study are identical to that proposed for commercial supply. 
In addition, the applicant presented the results of comparative dissolution studies and comparative 
impurity profiles as supportive data. 
Due to the poor solubility of ritonavir in three standard dissolution media, i.e. 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 
acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, the applicant proposed to use a surfactant in the 
dissolution medium to be used for routine quality control. The selection of dissolution medium, choice 
of surfactant, agitation speed and volume were supported by relevant development studies. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated by testing finished product 
with quantitative changes in excipients and significant manufacturing process changes. The 
specifications for release and shelf-life have been derived from the dissolution profile of the test 
product batch that was found to be bioequivalent to the reference product and considering the 
principles of the CHMP/CVMP Reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic solid oral 
immediate release products with systemic action (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017).  
Bulk tablets can be packaged and stored in Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) bags placed in an outer 
triple  laminated  bag  along  with  desiccant  (silica  gel)  bags  in  between  the  LDPE  bag  and  outer  triple 
laminated bag and sealed. The triple laminated bags are then placed in a suitable tertiary pack (HDPE 
drum). 
The  primary  packaging  for  placing  on  the  market  is  HDPE  bottle  with  polypropylene  screw  cap  with 
inbuilt desiccant. The materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  four  main  steps:  preparation  of  ritonavir-excipient  premix 
(mixing, distillation, drying, milling), blending with remaining excipients, compression and film-coating. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
An appropriate specification for ritonavir excipient premix including tests for description, identification 
(HPLC), methylene chloride (GC), water content (KF), assay (HPLC) and X-ray diffraction is applied by 
the manufacturer. 
The critical steps in the manufacturing process are the preparation of powder blend and compression of 
tablets (before coating). The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process 
and pharmaceutical form. These steps have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  TLC),  colour  identification  (visual),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  water  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report

The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and related substances testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches of finished product are identical to 
those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing 
(HDPE bottle). Stability data from studies of finished product packed in simulated bulk pack (LDPE bag) 
for 12 months at long term conditions (30°C / 75% RH) have also been provided. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  related  substances,  dissolution,  water  content  and 
microbiological  purity.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  All  results  were  within 
specification limits and no trends were observed (apart from a single out of specification result for an 
impurity  in  one  batch  on  accelerated  conditions).  The  applicant  presented  additional  data 
demonstrating that polymorphic form and enantiomeric purity of ritonavir does not change on storage 
of the tablets.  
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances  and  Products.  The  study  results  indicated  that  there  was  no  significant  change  in  assay, 
related substances and dissolution. Thus, it can be concluded that ritonavir 100 mg film-coated tablets 
are not photosensitive. 
An in-use stability study was performed up to 100 days at long term storage conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) with simulated opening and removing of one tablet each day. 
Forced  degradation  /  stress  studies  were  performed  by  exposing  ritonavir  to  acidic,  basic,  oxidative, 
high temperature, UV light and high humidity conditions. The main impurity formed was impurity F (a 
heat-dependant degradant). 
The  applicant  also  commits  to  perform  stability  studies  on  the  first  three  larger  production  scale 
batches at accelerated stability conditions (i.e. 40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH) for 6 months and at long-term 
stability conditions (i.e. 25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH), till the end of the proposed shelf life. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months when stored below 30°C, with 
an in-use shelf life after opening of 100 days when stored below 30°C in the original bottle in order to 
protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
Assessment report

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. 
The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of ritonavir are well known. As 
ritonavir is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional 
studies and further studies are not required.  
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Ritonavir Mylan is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all ritonavir containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the environmental exposure is expected to be similar and not increased 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical documentation submitted in support of this application is adequate for the purpose of 
a generic product authorisation. The active substance pharmacological and toxicological properties are 
well known. Impurities associated with this product do not pose any untoward risk to health and 
therefore no additional studies will be requested. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Ritonavir Mylan including a description 
of impurities expected and their acceptability thresholds which is acceptable. The non-clinical data are 
reflected in the appropriate sections of the SmPC and in line with the requirements for generic

Norvir (Ritonavir) 100mg film coated tablets (MAH: Abbott GmbH and Co. Germany) in 54 healthy, 
adult human subjects under fed conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the rate and 
extent of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety of the 
subjects. 
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours subjects 
received a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to drug administration.  
Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast, a single dose of the assigned formulation was 
administered with approximately 240 ml of water at ambient temperature, starting at 08:30, to one 
subject per minute. Water was allowed ad libitum until 1 hour pre-dose and beginning 1 hour after 
drug administration. 
Subjects received a standard meal at about 4, 8 and 12 hours after dosing in each period. During 
housing, all meal plans were identical for all periods.  
Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 10 hours prior to dosing of the 
investigational product until after the 24-hour blood sample collection in each study period. Subjects 
were to report to the clinical facility again for the 36 and 48 hour ambulatory blood sample. The two 
periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 7 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.00, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 
2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00 and

Population studied 
54 healthy adult human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol whilst 47 subjects completed both 
study periods.  
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (both inclusive). 
•  Subjects' weight within normal range according to normal values for Body Mass Index (18.5 to 
24.9 kg/m2) with minimum of 50 kg weight. 
•  Subjects with normal health as determined by personal medical and medication history, clinical 
examination and laboratory examinations within the clinically acceptable reference range. 
•  Subjects having normal12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). 
•  Only non-smokers (no history of smoking) were eligible to participate in the study. 
•  Subjects having normal chest X-Ray (PIA view) whose X-Ray was taken within 6 months prior 
to the dosing of Period 01. 
•  Subjects having negative urine screen for drugs of abuse (including amphetamines, 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, marijuana, cocaine, and morphine). 
•  Subjects having negative alcohol breath test. 
•  Subjects willing to adhere to the protocol requirements and to provide written informed 
consent. 
Analytical methods  
Analysis of ritonavir was performed using HPLC/MS/MS. 
This method involved the extraction of ritonavir and abacavir together with the respective internal 
standards from human plasma.  
Storage period of study samples  
Samples were stored at the clinical facility in a deep freezer under frozen conditions at a set 
temperature of below -20°C till the completion of the periods and then at -78°±8°C till their shipment 
to the analytical site. During transit the temperature was maintained below -79°C. Upon receipt the 
samples were then stored in a deep freezer at -70°±15°C at the bioanalytical lab from the date of their 
receipt until they were analysed.  
Dosing started on the 11 January 2011 and the bioanalysis was performed between 18 February 2011 
to 14 March 2011 (63 days of storage). 
The long-term stability of Ritonavir in human plasma covers 116 days at -70°C and -20°C nominal.  
2268 samples were expected according to the protocol however 2088 blood samples were received 
(180 missing samples). The missing samples are accounted for in the dossier (samples of persons who 
had not completed the study).1985 samples were deemed valid and analysed. 8 samples were re-
assayed and the reason for their repeats was documented and presented.

Bioanalytical report 
The bioanalytical report was submitted with 20% of the subject chromatograms presented as well as 
the method SOPs. Certificates of analysis for the reference and internal standards have been provided 
and were acceptable.  
Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
200 samples of Ritonavir were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 94.50% is the percentage of 
samples where the difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for 
chromatographic assays or less than 30% for the ligand binding assays.  
Validation of the test method 
The method has been validated and the limits of the assessed parameters were justified.  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary parameters:  Cmax, AUC0-T,  
Secondary parameters: AUC0-∞, Tmax, AUC0-T/ AUC0-∞, Kel and T1/2. 
Bioequivalence criteria: The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUC 0-t and Cmax of the 
test and reference product should be at least 80.00% and not more than 125.00% for log-transformed 
data. 
Statistical methods 
The mean, standard deviation (S.D.) and coefficient of variation (C.V.) were calculated for plasma 
concentrations at each individual time point as well as for the pharmacokinetic parameters. ANOVA 
was performed on the ln-transformed data of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. ANOVA was performed with 
the PROC GLM of SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). ANOVA model include sequence, subject 
nested into sequence, period and formulation effects. Subject nested into sequence was used as error 
term for checking the significance of Sequence. 
The sequence effect was tested at the 0.10 level of significance and all other main effects were tested 
at the 0.05 level of significance. 
Criteria for Bioequivalence 
Statistical inference of ritonavir was based on a bioequivalence approach using the following 
standards: 
The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from the 
exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference product for the ln-transformed 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-T were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range.

Safety data 
Blood pressure and radial pulse rate were measured before dosing of investigational products (in the 
morning of the day of dosing) and at 1, 3, 6 and 13 hours after dosing in each period. Post-dose blood 
pressure and radial pulse rate were measured within 45 minutes of the scheduled time. 
Clinical examination (vital signs (sitting blood pressure, oral temperature, radial pulse rate and 
respiratory rate), physical examination and systemic examination) was done at the time of admission 
and before discharge in each period and at the end of study. Subjects were questioned for well-being 
at the time of recording sitting blood pressure, radial pulse rate and during clinical examination and at 
the time of ambulatory blood sample collection. 
Post study safety assessment (Haematology and Biochemical parameters - SGOT, SGPT, Bilirubin, 
Creatinine and Urea) was done at the end of study (after collecting last blood sample).  
Two adverse events were reported in two subjects during the entire duration of the study. AE were 
mild in Intensity.

Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study the test formulation Ritonavir 100mg film coated tablet 
(MAH: Mylan Laboratories) is considered bioequivalent with the reference product Norvir 100mg film 
coated tablet ((ritonavir) manufactured by Abbott Germany,  MAH: Abbott UK). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The 90% confidence intervals calculated for the primary parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for Ritonavir fall 
within the 80.00 – 125.00% acceptance range after single dose administration under fed conditions. 
This is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr **. 
The two treatments were well tolerated by the subjects (in both periods) enrolled in the study. The 
adverse events mentioned above are all included in the SmPC and there are no new concerns arising 
from this study. The two products had similar safety profiles. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of ritonavir was provided which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. In addition, in the pivotal bioequivalence study the test 
formulation Ritonavir 100mg film coated tablet (Applicant: Mylan S.A.S) was considered bioequivalent 
with the reference product Norvir 100mg film coated tablet ((ritonavir) manufactured by Abbott 
Germany, MAH: Abbott UK). This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical 
studies were not considered necessary.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of ritonavir film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Norvir is indicated for the treatment of HIV infection. No nonclinical studies have been provided for 
this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active 
substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does 
not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and 
safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, two-treatment, two- period, 
two-sequence, single centre, balanced, single dose, crossover design under fed conditions. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/749789/2017  
Page 22/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
line with the respective European requirements. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Ritonavir Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the reference product Norvir. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals 
for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Ritonavir Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV 1 
infected patients (adults and children of 2 years of age and older). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the

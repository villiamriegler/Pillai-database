1. 
Introduction 
Myocet  is  a  liposome  formulation  of  a  clinically  well-established  drug,  doxorubicin  hydrochloride 
(HCl),  and  an  anthracycline  cytotoxic  agent.  Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  is 
indicated for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women. The product is presented as 
a three-vial system; Myocet doxorubicin HCl, Myocet liposomes and Myocet buffer. At constitution, 
the  doxorubicin  HCl  is  dissolved  in  20  ml  0.9%  sodium  chloride  for  injection  and  heated  before  a 
mixture of the liposomes and the buffer is added to form a liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin-citrate 
complex. The resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml 
of concentrate for liposomal dispersion for infusion (2 mg/ml). The recommended initial dose is 60-75 
mg/m2  every  3  weeks  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide  (600  mg/m2).  Myocet  should  be 
constituted  and  diluted  prior  to  administration  and  should  be  administered  by  intravenous  (i.v.) 
infusion over a period of one hour. 
Anthracyclines 
Anthracyclines  still  belong  to  the  most  commonly  used  cytotoxic  agents  against  haematological  as 
well  as  solid  tumours. Since their introduction  in  cancer treatment in the late  1960’s, anthracyclines 
have been associated with cardiotoxicity. 
Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy appears to result from free radical damage to the myocardium. 
Free  radicals,  in  turn,  cause  damage  to  multiple  intracellular  sites  including  the  cell  membrane, 
mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and DNA. In the presence of iron, a Fe3+ -doxorubicin chelate 
complex forms. This complex accelerates the reaction leading to increased production of free radicals 
with increased myocardial damage. 
In  solid  tumours,  doxorubicin  has  been  the  dominating  anthracycline  but  has  increasingly  been 
substituted  in  Europe  by  the  analogue  epirubicin.  Doxorubicin  may  exert  its  antitumour  and  toxic 
effects by a number of mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II, intercalation with DNA 
and RNA polymerases, free radical formation and membrane binding. 
Several  analogues  of  doxorubicin  and  other  anthracyclines  have  been  studied  aiming  at  lessened 
cardiac  toxicity.  Epirubicin  (4’-epidoxorubicin)  demonstrates  a  small  but  statistically  significant 
decrease  in  cardiac  toxicity,  compared  with  doxorubicin  given  by  rapid  infusion.  Preliminary  data 
concerning pirarubicin suggest this analogue of doxorubicin  may have significant less cardiotoxicity 
than  doxorubicin  given  standard  infusion  schedules.  Idarubicin  (demethoxy  daunorubicin),  when 
given in amounts of equivalent myelotoxicity to daunorubicin, has cardiotoxicity similar to this drug. 
Anyway, cardiotoxicity from these agents is cumulative and crossing over from one agent to another 
does not offer protection. 
Encapsulation  of  doxorubicin  within  liposomes  has  been  another  way  of  trying  to  reduce  cardiac 
toxicity.  Preclinical  studies  have  shown  that  liposomes  reduce  the  peak  distribution  of  doxorubicin, 
apparently linked to cardiac toxicity, while favouring the distribution of encapsulated drug to reticulo-
endothelial organs and to areas of inflammation or of fenestrated endothelium as in tumour tissue. 
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
In  breast  cancer,  anthracycline  based  combination  chemotherapy  has  been  found  superior  to 
previously  used  regimens  without  anthracyclines,  both  in  the  adjuvant  and  in  the  metastatic  setting. 
Although the use of newly introduced taxanes is increasing, anthracycline-based combinations could 
still  be  considered  standard  of  care  in  chemotherapy  of  breast  cancer  (BC).  Doxorubicin  is  usually 
used  in  combination  with  one  or  two  cytotoxic  drugs  of  other  classes  to  improve  the  benefit/risk 
balance.

The  risk  of  irreversible  cardiomyopathy  is  the  most  important  treatment-limiting  factor  in  the  long-
term.  The  clinical  presentation  of  anthracycline-induced  cardiomyopathy  is  congestive  heart  failure 
(CHF).  At  a  cumulative  doxorubicin  dose  of  500  mg/m2  the  risk  for  CHF  is  approximately  5%  and 
thereafter it increases exponentially. It may lead to CHF in 1-10% of the patients at a cumulative dose 
of >550 mg/m2. Although acute myopericarditis may occur following doxorubicin administration, the 
later  occurring  cardiomyopathy  is  of  greater  concern.  The  late  presentation  of  anthracycline 
cardiomyopathy has been described to occur up to several years after completion of the treatment. It is 
observed  in  patients  who  had  recovered  from  subacute  cardiac  symptoms  or  in  patients  with  no 
previous symptoms. 
There  is  considerable  individual  difference  in  sensitivity  to  doxorubicin-induced  cardiomyopathy, 
which sometimes occurs after a very low cumulated dose. Combination of doxorubicin with 5-FU and 
cyclophosphamide in the CAF regimen seems to increase the risk for CHF many fold.  
The  current  standard  strategy  to  decrease  the  risk  for  doxorubicin  induced  CHF  is  to  limit  the 
cumulative  dose  to  approximately  550  mg/m2  and/or  to  pursue  therapy  under  regular  cardiac 
monitoring until a significant decrease in LVEF is observed.  
Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for assessment of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 
Histopathology  correlates  reasonably  well  to  multigated  radionuclide  angiography  (MUGA)  scan 
based  measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) which could be considered a routine 
standard  for  the  assessment  of  anthracycline  induced  cardiac  effects.  LVEF  measurement  based  on 
echocardiography is generally considered to be less accurate.  
Doxorubicin has so far been administered as i.v. bolus injection or as short 30 min to 1 h i.v. infusion. 
Prolonged infusion  over  up to 96  h  has been  described to  decrease the risk for doxorubicin  induced 
CHF,  seemingly  without  compromising  the  antitumour  activity.  However,  despite  the  promising 
results prolonged infusion of doxorubicin is not in routine use in the treatment of BC. 
Among many compounds that have been studied to evaluate possible protection from anthracycline-
associated  cardiomyopathy,  dexrazoxane,  a  bisdiketopiperazine,  is  the  most  interesting.  This  drug 
demonstrated  significant  cardioprotection  in  a  trial  where  patients  where  randomised  to  receive 
doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  with  or  without  dexrazoxane  and  in  subsequent  trials.  However, 
experimental  data concerning a  putative  decrease  of anti-tumour activity of doxorubicin  when given 
with dexrazoxane are still equivocal. 
2.   Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Myocet is presented as a three-vial system; Myocet doxorubicin HCl, Myocet liposomes and Myocet 
buffer.  In  addition  a  small  amount  of  0.9%  sodium  chloride  for  injection  is  needed,  which  is  not 
provided  in  the  package.  The  constituted  product  is  a  liposome-encapsulated  doxorubicin-citrate 
complex. 
The formulation contains doxorubicin HCl, lactose and methyl parahydroxybenzoate (methylparaben). 
The  constituted  liposomes  are  stable  pluri-lamellar  liposomes  composed  of  egg  phosphatidylcholine 
(EPC) and cholesterol and with an aqueous core. It is important to follow the avian encephalitis (AE) 
situation  in  countries  used  for  EPC  production  and  report  changes  to  the  CPMP  and  national 
authorities. A protocol on how this is accomplished should be submitted. 
Doxorubicin HCl is provided in 50 ml type I (Ph. Eur.) glass vials sealed with butyl rubber stoppers 
and aluminium flip-off seals. The liposomes are filled in 2 ml type I flint glass tubing vial with grey 
stoppers siliconised with dimethicone and a flip-off seal. The buffer is filled in 5 ml type I moulded 
glass  vials  with  grey  stoppers  siliconised  with  dimeticone  and  a  flip-off  seal.  After  constitution  the 
finished product is in the vial, which originally contained the doxorubicin HCl powder. 
Active substance 
Doxorubicin  HCl is an antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces 
peucetius  var.  caesius.  It  is  described  in  Ph.  Eur.  During  the  manufacture,  Daunorubicin  HCl  is 
2/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
converted into 14-bromodaunorubicin and the next step yields doxorubicin HCl. The following main 
related substances are identified in an HPLC method: doxorubicinone, 11-deoxydoxorubicin HCl, 13-
dihydrodaunorubicin  HCl,  13-dihydrocarminomycin  HCl,  daunorubicin  HCl.  Typically,  batches 
contain between 0.14% and 0.30% total related substances. 
The active ingredient manufacturer controls doxorubicin HCl according Ph. Eur. with the TLC method 
for  related  substances  replaced  by  the  HPLC-method  used  for  assay.  This  is  acceptable.  Individual 
impurities are controlled in the active substance specifications of Pharmacia & Upjohn. However, as 
individual  impurities  are  not  included  in  their  release  specifications  for  the  lyophilised  doxorubicin, 
there  is  no  need  for  the  applicant  to  include  individual  impurities  in  their  release  specifications. 
Doxorubicin HCl complies with the main pharmacopoeias including Ph. Eur. and USP. Results of  4 
batches have been presented. All batches meet the specifications. 
Stability data of three batches in amber glass bottles with a polypropylene closure and a polyethylene 
inner  stopper  over  6  months  at  25  °C/60%  RH  and  6  months  at  40  °C/70%  RH  are  presented.  The 
results support a retest period of one year. 
Other ingredients 
Myocet  liposomes:  Citric  acid,  nitrogen,  sodium  hydroxide  and  water  for  injections  are  controlled 
according to Ph. Eur. Cholesterol is controlled according to Ph. Eur. and NF with an additional test for 
purity of not less than 95.0% by HPLC. EPC is obtained by purifying egg yolk through extractions and 
chromatography. In view of a potential for contamination of the phosphatidylcholine with aflatoxins, 
suitable  upper  limits  for  aflatoxins  need  to  be  included  in  the  specification.  Therefore,  the  applicant 
agreed  to  submit  a  variation  addressing  aflatoxin  control  during  the  manufacturing  process  The 
remaining lipids other than phosphatidylcholine are sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine.  
Myocet buffer: Sodium carbonate and water for injections are controlled according to Ph. Eur. 
Product development and finished product 
Product development 
The  objective of the development program was to obtain an effective but less cardiotoxic  parenteral 
dosage form of doxorubicin using liposome technology.  
The  constituted  liposomes  are  stable  pluri-lamellar  liposomes,  with  an  aqueous  core,  comprised  of 
EPC and cholesterol. The drug is entrapped into the liposomes during the constitution of the ready to 
use liposomal formulation. During constitution, doxorubicin is driven across the liposome membrane 
by  a  pH  gradient.  A  pH  of  4-5  is  maintained  inside  the  liposomes  by  citric  acid  and  outside  the 
liposomes a pH of 7-8 is obtained by adding sodium carbonate buffer. Dissolved doxorubicin HCl is 
added and the  membrane-permeable  neutral  form (in excess at  pH 7.5)  crosses the liposome bilayer 
into  the  aqueous  core  where  it  is  protonated  and,  as  such,  forms  a  complex  with  citric  acid.  The 
complex is in the form of flexible fibres comprised of stacked doxorubicin molecules cross-linked into 
bundles  by  the  citrate  anions.  The  complexing  with  citrate  aids  the  retention  of  the  doxorubicin 
molecules within the liposome.  
The loading efficiency as well as the biological activity of liposomal doxorubicin was used to establish 
the  optimal  lipid/drug  ratio,  EPC/cholesterol  ratio,  liposome  size  and  concentration  of  the  citrate 
buffer.  Larger  liposomes  had  less  acute  toxicity  while  smaller  liposomes  had  a  higher  anti-tumour 
efficacy. Taken together, the mean survival time in a murine leukemia model increased with smaller 
liposomes. Based on these studies it was decided to have a mean diameter of 100-230 nm. In the same 
study the drug to lipid ratio was investigated. It was found that a higher drug  to lipid ratio was less 
toxic than a lower drug to lipid ratio. This is suggested to result from a more stable complex between 
doxorubicin  and  citrate  at  the  higher  drug  to  lipid  ratio,  resulting  in  a  slower  deaggregation  and 
subsequent  release  of  doxorubicin  from  the  liposomes.  The  highest  drug  to  lipid  ratio  studied  was 
0.28:1. This ratio showed the lowest acute toxicity and was selected for the final composition.  
The development studies are thoroughly performed and described, and are considered to support the 
chosen formulation. The clinical trial formulation was identical to the formulation to be used for the 
market.

Manufacturing process 
Myocet  doxorubicin  HCl:  the  applicant  purchases  Doxorubicin  HCl  as  a  finished  product.  The  vials 
are relabelled. During manufacture the product is sterilised using a 0.22 µm filter.  
Myocet liposomes: The citric acid buffer is prepared, the pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide solution, 
and filtered through a 0.2 µm nominal filter into a reactor.  
The  liposomes  are  clarified  by  filtration  and  subsequently  filtered  through  a  0.22 µm  filter 
(sterilisation  process)  and  stored  under  nitrogen  pressure  at  2-8°C  before  filling.  The  vials  are 
sterilised using dry heat and the stoppers are autoclaved. The particle size distribution is measured as 
an important part of the in-process controls. 
Myocet buffer: Sodium carbonate is added to water for injections, the solution is  mixed and filtered 
through a 0.22 µm filter into sterile tank and stored at room temperature prior to filling.  
Validation 
The validation results for Myocet liposomes are satisfactory. 
Myocet  buffer:  Twelve  stability  and  clinical  batches  produced  during  the  last  8  years  with  different 
batch  sizes  and  equipment  gave  products  within  specifications.  The  buffer  is  sterilised  by  filtration 
since autoclaving the high pH solution results in the formation of glass related particles in the solution. 
Constitution:  Several  validation  studies  were  conducted  on  the  constitution  procedure  and  all 
constituted products were found to be acceptable supporting the ruggedness of the procedure. GMP 
The product is being manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary Manufacturing Authorisation 
(see Annex II of the Opinion). 
Specifications 
The  finished  product  specifications  for  the  constituted  liposomal  doxorubicin  include  tests  for 
appearance, pH, particle size, ‘entrapment’, i.e. the percentage of active substance encapsulated in the 
liposome interior which is also an indicator of ‘free’ doxorubicin, and assay. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results of 2 batches were presented. Both batches comply with the specifications. 
Stability of the product 
The  results  of stability  studies indicate  that  a shelf life of 18  months  for the finished  product,  when 
stored  at  2-8  °C,  is  acceptable.  Protection  from  light  is  not  necessary.  The  constituted  drug  product 
was shown to be chemically and physically stable when stored at 2-8°C for 8 days and for 24 hours at 
room temperature.  From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If 
not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2οC - 8οC, unless reconstitution and dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
3.  
Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Introduction 
The pharmacology and toxicology of doxorubicin (Dox) are well established and, thus, the preclinical 
file for Myocet aimed  mainly at comparing liposome-encapsulated Dox with conventional Dox with 
respect to efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In vitro and in vivo studies 
Antitumour  activity  of  liposomal  and  conventional  Dox  in  vivo  was  compared  in  murine  tumour 
models  using  a  range  of  murine  and  human  xenograft  tumour  types.  The  drug  formulations  were 
administered  via  the  i.v.  route.  At  similar  doses,  liposomal  Dox  appeared  to  be  as  effective  as 
conventional Dox in these models, possibly with the exception of the melanoma model, and was better 
4/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tolerated. Survival was recorded until day 60. Therapeutic response was based on the median day of 
death and expressed as the percent increased life span compared with untreated controls. The change 
in viable tumour cell population was also assessed. The results indicate that the liposome formulation 
permitted  delivery  of  higher  Dox  doses  and  the  more  intensive  treatment  resulted  in  apparent  cures 
that  were  not  achieved  with  the  conventional  Dox.  Clear  dose-response  relationships  were  seen  for 
both  formulations,  up  to  the  optimal  dose  (the  highest  dose  without  drug-induced  deaths).  Although 
direct comparisons at similar doses were not made, no apparent decrease in efficacy of liposomal Dox 
compared with conventional Dox was observed. 
No  antitumour  activity  studies  using  BC  models  were  performed.  However,  there  is  a  long-term 
clinical experience of Dox in this disease and it would not be expected that liposome-encapsulation of 
the  drug  affects  possible  disease-specificity  that  is  due  to  mechanism  of  cytotoxic  action.  Thus,  the 
results from other tumour types, indicating that liposomal Dox is at least as effective as conventional 
Dox, may most likely be extrapolated also to BC models.  
No  preclinical  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  liposomal  Dox  in  cytotoxic  drug 
combinations. Liposomal Dox did not increase the drug sensitivity of Dox-resistant cancer cell lines, 
neither in vitro nor in vivo. 
The  equal  or improved survival of animals receiving  Myocet compared with  conventional  Dox  may 
indicate  that  liposome-encapsulation  of  Dox  does  not  decrease  its  activity  against  metastases. 
However,  from  these  data  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  long-term  protection  against  micrometastases 
because  of  lack  of  long-term  follow-up  of  survivors  (the  animals  were  observed  for  60  days).  This 
issue is not considered critical in the palliative setting of MBC. However, further investigations would 
be  needed  in  order  to  clarify  the  issue  with  respect  to  the  adjuvant  setting  (see  SPC  4.4,  Special 
warnings and special precautions for use). 
Interaction studies 
The  effect  of  liposomal  Dox  or  free  Dox  formulations  on  the  single  dose  toxicity  (lethality)  of 
cyclophosphamide (CPA), 5-FU or CPA + 5-FU was compared showing similar toxicological profiles 
when combined with each of the drugs individually or with both. 
General and safety pharmacology programme 
The  effects  of  liposomal  Dox  on  CNS,  cardiovascular  and  reproductive  system  have  not  been 
investigated in pharmacology studies. This is considered acceptable, due to the vast clinical experience 
with Dox, and since results in the toxicology studies indicate qualitatively similar toxicity of free and 
liposome-encapsulated  Dox.  The  distribution  study  in  dogs  indicates  that  liposome-encapsulation  of 
Dox  does  not  increase  the  uptake  of  drug  into  CNS.  In  a  temperature  response  study  in  rabbit, 
liposomal  Dox  induced  temperature  increases  of  1.0  to  2.1  ºC  at  5  to  9  hr  post-dose  while  no 
temperature increases were seen in animals treated with conventional Dox. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  dogs,  at  the  same  dose  (1.5  mg/kg)  the  liposomal  formulation  resulted  in  higher  plasma 
concentrations  and  >80  times  higher  exposure  (AUC)  for  total  Dox  (encapsulated+free)  than  did 
conventional  Dox.  The  liposomal  formulation  gave  somewhat  lower  Cmax  but  higher  systemic 
exposures of free (unencapsulated) Dox than did conventional Dox. However, there are doubts on the 
validity of the assay to measure free Dox, due to methodological difficulties. 
Administration of liposomal  14C-doxorubicin to dogs resulted in lower concentrations of Dox-related 
radioactivity  in  the  myocardium  and  gastrointestinal  tissues,  but  higher  concentrations  in  the  liver, 
spleen and bone marrow, compared with conventional 14C-doxorubicin. This is in agreement with the 
observed reduction in cardiomyopathy and increased bone marrow toxicity for liposomal Dox.  
In mice with subcutaneously growing human breast carcinoma cells, the Dox-related fluorescence in 
tumour tissue seemed to be higher after administration of liposomal Dox than after administration of 
conventional  Dox.  Taken  together  with  clinical  efficacy  data,  the  results  indicate  that  liposome-
encapsulated  Dox  is  distributed  to  and  effective  against  BC  cells  to  at  least  a  similar  extent  as 
conventional Dox. 
5/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
The  metabolism  of  Dox  from  liposomal  formulations  was  not  investigated.  The  main  metabolite  of 
Dox is doxorubicinol. Metabolism in man is reported to be similar to rabbit and mouse. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  of  liposomal  Dox,  conventional  Dox  and  empty  liposomes  was  evaluated  in 
mouse  and  dog.  In  acute  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  dog,  liposomal  Dox  and  conventional  Dox 
induced  similar  toxicity  profiles,  but  toxicity  was  less  severe  or  occurred  at  higher  doses  for  the 
liposome-encapsulated  drug.  Female  mice  appeared  less  susceptible  than  males  to  liposomal  Dox. 
This sex difference was not seen for other species. 
Single dose toxicity of conventional Dox or liposomal Dox in combination with 5-FU or CPA in mice 
was  evaluated  indicating  that  also  in  combination  the  acute  toxicity  of  liposomal  Dox  is  lower  than 
that of conventional Dox. 
The  potential  for  liposomal  Dox  to  induce  thrombi  was  studied  in  rabbits.  There  were  no  signs  of 
thrombi or emboli in rabbits receiving a high single dose of liposomal Dox. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In chronic toxicity studies, where dogs were administered 1.5 mg/kg Dox once every three weeks for 
8-12 cycles, the toxicity profiles were qualitatively similar between the two preparations. Liposomal 
Dox  appeared  better  tolerated,  inducing  less  severe  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and  fewer  unscheduled 
deaths compared with conventional Dox, although histopathological data indicated more severe bone 
marrow atrophy in liposomal Dox treated dogs. 
The  only  effect  specific  for  liposomal  Dox  but  not  seen  with  conventional  Dox  in  the  toxicology 
studies  was  an  increase  in  body  temperature  in  dogs,  generally  occurring  around  24  hr  post-dose, 
whereas no temperature increases were seen in animals treated with conventional Dox. Although it is 
not  possible  to  draw  definite  conclusions,  one  possible  explanation  for  the  Myocet-induced 
temperature increase is that liposome-encapsulation of Dox results in a greater uptake of Dox by the 
phagocytic  cells  of  the  reticulo-endothelial  system  (RES),  and  thus,  mediators  of  inflammation 
become responsible for the observed temperature increase. 
A blood compatibility test of liposomal Dox and empty liposomes was performed as part of the two 
acute toxicity studies. The results from the two studies were similar and indicated a low haemolytic 
potential of the liposome formulations. 
Cardiotoxicity 
Apparently,  liposome-encapsulation  of  Dox  did  not  prevent  cardiac  toxicity  but  delayed  it.  In  one 
study, histopathological evidence of cardiac toxicity was noted in all dogs that received eight doses of 
conventional Dox at 1.5 mg/kg but in none of the dogs treated with the same dose of liposomal Dox. 
In  a  second  study,  all  dogs  receiving  8-10  cycles  of  conventional  Dox  had  lesions  consistent  with 
myocardial toxicity and heart failure, and none of these animals survived more than 10 doses. After 8 
doses,  cardiac lesions  were  also seen in liposomal  Dox-treated  animals, but  were  graded  less severe 
than in the conventional-Dox group. In the animals receiving 12 doses of liposomal Dox there were 
signs  of  cardiotoxicity  in  most  animals,  at  a  similar  grade  of  severity  as  in  the  conventional  Dox-
treated  animals  after  8  doses.  The  more  severe  toxicity  observed  in  preclinical  studies  after 
administration of conventional Dox may partly have been due to very high peak concentrations of free 
drug that would not have been obtained if the treatment had been given as slow infusion. Nevertheless, 
the  difference  between  the  infusion  time  used  in  preclinical  studies  and  that  recommended  for  the 
clinical administration is probably not of concern regarding relevance for the myocardial effect. 
Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity 
Studies to evaluate genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of liposomal Dox were not performed and are not 
considered necessary, due to the known mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Dox.  
Reproduction toxicity 
Dox per se is known to be teratogenic in animals and humans and to induce abortions (rabbits). 
6/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
Local tolerance 
Local  macroscopic  reactions  in  rabbit  after  a  single  perivascular  or  subcutaneous  bolus  injection  of 
liposomal  Dox  and  conventional  Dox  were  similar  but  were  graded  slightly  less  severe  in  the 
liposomal Dox-treated animals. No ulceration was observed in the liposomal Dox-treated animals. 
Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
Based  on  the  pattern  of  use  and  disposal  of  Myocet  coupled  to  the  predicted  annual  usage  and  low 
estimates for concentrations in the environment it has been considered that no immediate risk for the 
environment is associated to the therapeutic use of Myocet. 
Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
The  antitumour  activity  of  Myocet  has  been  investigated  in  several  murine  tumour  models  and 
compared  with  that  of  free  Dox.  Myocet  allowed  the  administration  of  higher  (or  at  least  similar) 
doses of Dox without increased toxicity. Myocet seemed to display a different pharmacokinetic profile 
compared to the free Dox formulation. Some increased therapeutic benefit expressed by increased life 
span was shown by the liposomal formulation in most (but not all) studies performed.  
The  claimed reduction of toxicity on the formulation has been shown in some studies, in relation to 
cardiotoxicity  (dog)  after  repeated  administration,  but  on  the  other  side  increased  bone  marrow 
suppression was observed when compared to the free Dox one.  
From the preclinical data it is difficult to assess the long-term protection against micrometastases due 
to  the  lack  of  long-term  follow-up.  This  issue  is  not  considered  critical  in  the  metastatic  setting  but 
further  investigations  would  be  needed  in  order  to  evaluate  this  possible  effect  with  respect  to  less 
advanced stages of the disease (see SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use). 
4.   Clinical aspects 
Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide  (CPA),  is  indicated  for  the  first  line  treatment  of 
MBC in women. The clinical database comprises data from 3 pivotal phase III trials (studies 1-3), 4 
supportive  phase  II  trials  in  MBC  (studies  4-7)  and  11  phase  I/II  trials  (8-18)  in  solid  tumours,  non 
small-cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  acute  nonlymphocytic  leukaemia  (ANLL),  AIDS-related  Kaposi’s 
sarcoma (AIDS-KS) and brain metastases (Table 1).

Clinical pharmacology 
Six single dose studies were conducted. One was conducted as a pharmacokinetic substudy of a phase 
III  study  (study  1),  in  which  both  Myocet  and  conventional  Dox  were  administered  in  combination 
with CPA. Three single-arm studies (8, 9 and 13) with Myocet were conducted and two other studies 
(12  and  18)  compared  Myocet  with  conventional  Dox.  In  studies  12  and  9,  attempt  was  made  to 
separate free Dox from encapsulated substance. The main metabolite doxorubicinol was measured in 
studies 1 and 12. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Dox is a well-known cytotoxic agent, with a very broad spectrum of clinical anticancer activity and is 
one  of  the  most  frequently  prescribed  anti-neoplastic  agents.  Against  BC,  Dox  presents  curative 
potential  when  it  is  included  in  multimodality  regimens,  and  has  an  established  value  in  palliative 
treatment of patients with advanced tumors. 
Cardiomyopathy  is  limiting  with  respect  to  cumulative  dose  and  this  liposomal  formulation  was 
developed having in view the reduction in the risk of cardiotoxicity. 
The choice of using the same dose of Myocet as of conventional Dox in phase III trials is justified by 
the results of preclinical studies and the phase I and phase II trials (see Dose-response studies) where 
comparable efficacy and reduced cardiac and gastrointestinal toxicity were apparent. 
Pharmacokinetics 
As long as Dox is associated with its carrier, the  pharmacokinetics of the drug is  determined by the 
pharmacokinetics of the liposome. Liposomes of the size of Myocet are generally cleared from blood 
by uptake by the RES-cells. There is a gradual release of drug from the liposome, dependent on factors 
such  as  drug  properties,  liposome  composition,  pH  or  osmotic  gradients  and  the  liposome 
environment.  Since  released  Dox  displays  the  same  elimination  pathway  as  conventional  Dox,  the 
pharmacokinetic behaviour of Myocet is a mixture of the behaviour of encapsulated and free Dox.

The  variability  in  all  pharmacokinetic  parameters  is  markedly  higher  for  liposomal  drug  compared 
with  conventional  dosing.  This  may  to  some  extent  be  due  to  the  poor  performance  of  the  assay 
procedure so that kinetic data should be interpreted with caution. 
The clearance of total doxorubicin was 5.1±4.8 l/h and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vd) 
was 56.6 l, while after conventional doxorubicin, clearance and Vd were 46.7±9.6 l/h and 1,451±258 l, 
respectively. With Myocet given over 1 hour, the total Dox peak plasma level is very high (~ 9-fold 
greater  than  that  seen  with  conventional  Dox)  but  since  most  of  the  drug  is  encapsulated,  the  peak 
level of free drug is likely to be very low, mimicking a continuous infusion. The AUC of total Dox in 
patients receiving Myocet is also very high (~ 20 fold greater than that in patients receiving the same 
dose of conventional Dox) but, again, most of the circulating drug is encapsulated. The precise plasma 
AUC of released Dox in patients receiving Myocet is unknown due to analytical difficulties, however, 
the exposure to free Dox after administration of Myocet appears similar to the exposure to Dox after 
administration of the same dose of conventional drug. 
When Dox is given as a continuous infusion, the peak plasma levels are much reduced compared with 
the  usual  slow  bolus  administration  while  the  plasma  AUC  is  the  same.  Clinical  trial  data  from  the 
literature  support  the  hypothesis  that  chronic  cardiotoxicity  is  related  primarily  to  peak  drug 
concentration,  whereas  anti-tumour  effect  is  more  dependent  on  the  total  drug  exposure  (AUC). 
Mucositis and the potential for extravasation injury are however increased with prolonged infusions of 
conventional  Dox.  A  similarity  between  the  formulations  as  regards  the  general  toxicity  profile 
(excluding  cardiac  toxicity)  and  the  antitumour  activity  suggest  the  concept  that  liposome-
encapsulation  provides  an  “intravenous  slow-release  formulation”.  However,  based  on  an  observed 
difference in incidence and severity of mucositis and diarrhoea it is possible to speculate that Myocet 
does not merely mimic infusional Dox. 
For  conventional  Dox  a  relationship  between  AUC  and  dose-limiting  granulocytopenia  is  observed. 
Preclinical  studies  in  dogs  have  shown  that  bone  marrow  atrophy  was  somewhat  more  pronounced 
after  treatment  with  liposome-encapsulated  compared  with  conventional  Dox.  However,  no 
differences between Myocet and conventional Dox regarding haematological parameters (neutropenia, 
anaemia,  thrombocytopenia)  were  observed  either  in  the  preclinical  or  clinical  studies.  No  definite 
conclusion  regarding  the  relationship  between  AUC  and  myelotoxicity  can  be  drawn  from  available 
data. As dose adjustment for Myocet is not based on AUC levels but on haematological monitoring, 
the issue is not considered critical. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  one  of  the  metabolites,  doxorubicinol,  is  similar  after  liposomal  and 
conventional Dox, with the exception of a slower formation rate after liposomal Dox. Doxorubicinol is 
formed in the liver via aldo-keto-reductase enzymes. It appears in the plasma later with Myocet than 
with conventional Dox.  
No  pharmacokinetic studies were  performed with respect  to  age, impaired renal or  hepatic function. 
The  available  data  from  patients  with  impaired  liver  function  is  too  limited  to  be  a  basis  for  a  dose 
recommendation in these patients. Therefore, the Marketing Authorisation  Holder agreed to perform 
further  post-marketing investigations  on  the  pharmacokinetics and safety of  Myocet in  patients  with 
impaired  liver  function.  Until  these  further  data  become  available,  conservative  dose  reduction 
recommendations are necessary (see SPC 4.2, Posology and method of administration). 
Clinically  significant  drug  interactions  between  Dox  and  cytochrome  3A4  substrates  have  been 
described for agents, which also interact with P-glycoprotein (PgP), e.g., cyclosporin and paclitaxel. It 
appears  as  if  PgP-inhibitors  increase  the  exposure  to  both  Dox  and  its  metabolite.  No  formal 
interaction studies were performed for Myocet. However, the interaction potential for Myocet might 
be even higher due to a more pronounced distribution to the liver compared to conventional Dox. A 
warning considering concomitant treatment with PgP-inhibitors has been included in the SPC. Also, 
concomitant treatment with other substances reported to be cardiotoxic or with cardiologically active 
substances  (e.g.  calcium  antagonists)  may  increase  the  risk  for  cardiotoxicity.  Concomitant  therapy 
with other liposomal or lipid-complexed drugs or i.v. fat emulsions could change the pharmacokinetic 
profile of Myocet (see SPC 4.5, Interactions with other medicaments and other forms of interactions). 
Myocet should be used in combination with CPA. CPA is metabolised mainly by CYP2B6. No formal 
interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  CPA  and  Dox.  However,  no  changes  in  Dox  or  CPA 
9/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics were evident when compared with other studies, although the variability was very 
high. 
In  conclusion,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  liposomal  Dox  in  plasma  have  been  characterised  in 
cancer  patients,  confirming  the  expected  behaviour  of  a  liposomal  formulation.  From  the 
pharmacokinetic  documentation  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any  conclusions  regarding  specific 
liposomal  tumour  targeting.  Liposomal  Dox  and  conventional  Dox  essentially  show  similar  efficacy 
and,  except  for  the  cardiac  toxicity,  also  similar  toxicity  profiles.  This  might  be  explained  by  the 
exposure to free Dox after liposomal compared to conventional dosing of Dox being of the same range 
but with different time characteristics. 
Clinical efficacy 
Pivotal  data  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Myocet  derive  from  3  phase  III  trials,  studies  1,  2  and  3. 
Supportive data in MBC were obtained from 4 phase II trials, studies 4 – 7. 
Dose-response studies 
Results from 11 phase I/II clinical trials in 242 patients with a diverse range of tumours were reported. 
The results showed that the dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia. In dose-ranging studies, the MTD 
was  75 - 90 mg/m2  without G-CSF support. With G-CSF, a subsequent phase II trial showed that a 
dose of 135 mg/m2 was associated with unacceptable toxicity. With the exception of cardiac toxicity, 
the  adverse  events  seen  in  the  phase  I/II  studies  of  Myocet  were  similar  in  type  to  those  seen  with 
conventional  Dox.  Although  the  numbers  of  patients  at  the  various  dose  levels  are  relatively  small, 
there is a rough correlation with the dose of Myocet and frequency of adverse events commonly seen 
with Dox.  
Bolus administration of Myocet was associated with an acute syndrome of infusion-related side effects 
and  there  is  very  limited  experience  from  other  schedules  for  administration  of  Myocet.  For 
monotherapy trials, a dose of 75 mg/m2 administered every three weeks was selected. 
The recommended dose of Myocet is 60-75 mg/m2 in combination with CPA (600 mg/m2), every three 
weeks. The administration is by i.v. infusion over a period of one hour.  
Main studies 
Three  pivotal  trials  with  similar  designs  were  performed.  All  studies  were  randomised  multicentre, 
parallel group, open-label studies. Treatment was assigned using blocked randomisation (block size of 
2 for studies 1 and 2, size unknown to the investigators), which was stratified according to centre and 
in studies 1 and 2 also according to prior adjuvant Dox. 
Study  1  compared  Myocet,  60  mg/m2,  in  combination  with  CPA,  versus  Dox,  60  mg/m2,  in 
combination with CPA. Study 2 compared Myocet, 75 mg/m2 (with dose escalation up to 105 mg/m2), 
monotherapy,  versus  Dox,  75  mg/m2,  monotherapy  and  study  3  compared  Myocet,  75  mg/m2,  in 
combination with CPA versus epirubicin (Epi) 75  mg/m2 in combination with CPA. Regimens were 
administered every three weeks and in all combination regimens, CPA, 600 mg/m2 was given as i.v. 
bolus injections or short infusions prior to Myocet or Dox. 
The main selection criteria were histologically or cytologically proven MBC, adequate bone marrow, 
liver and renal function and resting LVEF ≥ 50%. Prior radiotherapy (RT) to the mediastinum >35 Gy 
was  an  exclusion  criterion.  In  studies  1  and  3,  G-CSF  was  permitted  in  the  case  of  pronounced 
myelotoxicity whereas in study 2, and later in study 1, it was started routinely 48 h after Myocet was 
administered.  Dexrazoxane  was  permitted,  at  the  discretion  of  the  physician  in  trials  1  and  2  in 
patients with a lifetime cumulative dose of Dox of >300 mg/m2 but never came to use in any patient.  
Endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints 
Response  rate  according  to  WHO  criteria  with  confirmation  after  6  weeks  was  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint in all three studies. An independent blinded response review of radiology imaging was not 
carried out. Although an independent blinded review of all tumour imaging would have been optimal, 
a procedure involving a “blinded” core radiologist in each site was used in trials 1 and 2 and this is 
10/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
considered  to  be  acceptable  from  a  data  quality  point  of  view.  In  general,  progression-free-survival 
(PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS)  are  considered  more  clinically  relevant  endpoints  in  advanced  BC. 
However, it is possible that in direct comparison between two Dox formulations response rate could 
be  a  sensitive  endpoint  for  detection  of  a  difference.  Furthermore,  provided  reliable  results  in  other 
relevant endpoints are obtained, it seems reasonable to give relative weight to various endpoints based 
on  scientific  reasoning.  Thus,  response  rate  can  be  considered  as  an  adequate  endpoint  as  long  as 
findings are supported by reliable data on PFS and OS, which were also interpreted in the light of any 
subsequent treatments administered. 
Safety endpoints 
in  studies  1  and  2. 
Reduction  of  cardiotoxicity  was  an  additional  primary  objective 
Independent/blinded  evaluation  of  CHF  was  not  required  in  any  protocol  but  was  used  for  the  final 
establishment of CHF. LVEF assessment was blinded in all trials. A cardiac toxicity event was defined 
as the occurrence of one or more of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
Type I: decrease in resting LVEF of ≥20 points from baseline, to a final value ≥50%; 
Type II: decrease in resting LVEF of ≥10 points to a final value <50%;  
Clinical evidence of CHF. 
Patients  experiencing  a  cardiotoxicity  event  were  discontinued  from  study  treatment.  Additional 
criteria  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  were  patient  refusal,  SAE,  surgical  removal  of  target 
lesions,  RT  to  target  lesions,  progressive  disease  and,  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  investigator, 
stable disease after 4 courses. 
Cardiac  evaluation  was  performed  by  ECG  and  by  MUGA  scans    (study  1  and  2)  or  by 
echocardiography (study 3). Irrespective of method, evaluation was to be performed: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
at baseline; 
prior to the next cycle after reaching a lifetime cumulative Dox or Epi dose of 300 mg/m2 and 
400 mg/m2; 
prior  to  each  subsequent  cycle  after  reaching  a  lifetime  cumulative  Dox  or  Epi  dose  of  500 
mg/m2; 
three months after the last dose of study medication (post study discontinuation); 
at the end of treatment visit, if a patient had received a lifetime cumulative Dox or Epi dose of 
≥300 mg/m2 and a MUGA scan had not been performed within the previous 3 weeks; 
any other time clinically indicated. 
For  cardiotoxicity,  a  significant  decrease,  as  defined  in  the  protocols,  in  LVEF  blindly  and 
prospectively  assessed  by  MUGA  scans  seems  to  be  an  established  surrogate  endpoint  of  clinical 
relevance for the later occurrence of CHF. Evaluation by echocardiography is considered less accurate 
but is  considered acceptable because evaluation was  blinded. CHF is not considered to be a reliable 
measure  due  to  the  fact  that  only  those  cases  selected  by  the  unblinded  investigator  were  reviewed 
independently.  Thus,  for  cardiotoxicity  the  main  outcome  measure  is  suggested  to  be  changes  in 
LVEF. 
Secondary  endpoints  were  time  to  progression,  overall  survival,  change  in  performance  status  and 
disease  related  symptoms  and,  in  studies  1  and  3,  quality  of  life  (QoL)  assessed  using  the  EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (BR23) questionnaire. 
Statistical design 
With  respect  to  response  rate,  all  trials  were  designed  to  show  non-inferiority.  Non-inferiority  was 
defined  so  as  to  rule  out  a  reduction  in  response  rate  for  Myocet  of  15%  or  more  (∆=15%).  The 
antitumour  efficacy  data  are  presented  according  ITT  (all  randomised  patients  according  to 
randomised treatment). Confirmatory analyses were carried out on the per protocol population (PPP). 
With  respect  to  cardiotoxicity,  treatment  arms  were  compared  using  the  logrank  test  stratified  by 
adjuvant  doxorubicin,  with  a  two-sided  type  I  error  of  0.05.  The  patient  population  for  the 
11/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiotoxicity  endpoint  was  all  randomised  patients  who  started  treatment,  according  to  treatment 
actually received. 
Results 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients included in the main efficacy analysis as well as 
the  primary  analyses  for  antitumour  efficacy  are  reported  in  the  following  sections  whereas  patient 
exposure and primary analyses for cardiotoxicity are reported under Clinical Safety. 
Patient Population 
The most notable differences in baseline characteristics (Table 2) were a higher proportion of patients 
in  the  Myocet  group  with  visceral  involvement  in  study  1  (72%  versus  60%),  and  a  significantly 
higher proportion of patients receiving Myocet with negative progesterone-receptor status in study 2 
(43% versus 29%). Study-drug exposure was comparable between treatment groups within each study. 
The median number of cycles per patient was six for both combination-regimen studies (studies 1 and 
3),  and  four  for  the  single-agent  study.  Study  3  was  planned  for  300  patients  but  was  terminated 
prematurely due to cost and rate of enrolment. 
Study-drug  exposure  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  within  each  study.  The  median 
number of cycles per patient was six for both combination-regimen studies (studies 1 and 3), and four 
for the single-agent study as detailed in table 3. 
The  main  reasons  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  for  study  1  were  (Myocet/CPA  versus 
Dox/CPA):  progressive  disease  (31  versus  25%),  maximum  response  achieved  (25  versus  27%), 
institutional  practice (11 versus  10%),  refusal (8  versus 5%),  cardiotoxicity (5 versus  10%), adverse 
event (5 versus 8%), risk of cardiotoxicity (1 versus 5%) and death (5 versus 1%). For study 2 these 
were  (Myocet  versus  Dox):  progressive  disease  (52  versus  28%),  maximum  response  achieved  (12 
versus 14%), refusal (9 versus 7%), cardiotoxicity (10 versus 25%), adverse event (3 versus 7%), risk 
of cardiotoxicity (2 versus 8%) and death (0 versus 2%). For study 3 these were (Myocet/CPA versus 
Epi/CPA): progressive disease (18 versus 24%), maximum response achieved (9 versus 4%), refusal 
(9  versus  12%),  cardiotoxicity  (4  versus  5%),  adverse  event  (4  versus  7%),  risk  of  cardiotoxicity  (1 
versus 0%) and death (4 versus 5%).

Antitumour efficacy 
According  to  the  predefined  criterion,  Myocet  in  combination  with  CPA  showed  non-inferiority  in 
response rate compared to Dox (Table 4). Generally, the predefined ∆ of 15% for response rate would 
be considered to be too large, nevertheless the results shown in terms of confidence intervals allows to 
rule  out  smaller  differences.  Particularly,  Myocet  in  combination  with  CPA  showed  non-inferiority 
with  respect  to  an  a  posteriori  defined  ∆  of  10%.  In  all  three  studies  the  majority  of  patients  were 
assessed using objective imaging techniques (75 – 91%). The results of the analyses performed in the 
PPP (data not shown) were consistent with those performed in the ITT population. Response rate in 
patients  with  prior  adjuvant  Dox  treatment  was  50  versus  20%  (combination)  and  17  versus  5% 
(monotherapy),  for  Myocet  and  Dox  respectively.  In  patients  with  no  prior  Dox  treatment  response 
rate  was  42  versus  45%  (combination)  and  28  versus  31%  (monotherapy),  for  Myocet  and  Dox 
respectively. 
The  observed  response  rate  in  the  monotherapy  study  was  low  in  both  arms,  compared  to  what  has 
been  seen  in  trials  with  single-agent  Dox.  Nevertheless,  the  difficulties  of  comparisons  between 
studies, particularly with respect to response rates, make the similar relative efficacy of the treatment 
arms  more relevant. In addition, the monotherapy study by itself is of limited value in assessing the 
role of Myocet in combination with CPA. 
Outcome with respect to PFS and OS are summarised in Table 5. The data are considered reasonably 
mature. For study 1, in a 24-month period, 108 of 142 patients (76%) in the Myocet arm progressed 
(median PFS 5.1  months) compared to  126  of 154 patients (82%) on the Dox  arm (median  PFS 5.5 
months). 
In  study  2,  Myocet  was  found  to  have  worse  OS  although  the  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant at the 5% level (logrank p-value=0.076). A multiple regression analysis for response rate, 
PFS and OS exploring the importance of baseline covariates was performed for study 2. Adjustment 
for  baseline  prognostic  factors  did  not  result  in  any important  changes  in  response  rate,  PFS  or  OS. 
Based on the response rate and all other efficacy data from the 3 pivotal trials and taking into account

that study 2 was a single-agent study, the observed tendency for worse survival for Myocet compared 
with Dox seems of limited concern. The survival difference in favour of Dox is likely to be related to 
events  after  treatment  or  to  differences  in  unknown  prognostic  factors.  Furthermore,  although 
comparison with historical data is hazardous, it might be concluded that survival for the Myocet arm 
was not significantly compromised.

With respect to changes in performance status, body weight, pain and other symptoms in study 1 there 
were  no  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  There  were  minor  changes  to  the  advantage  of 
Myocet in patient-reported symptoms at cycles 2, 3 and 4 but not when comparing changes throughout 
the  study.  Mean  changes  for  most  QoL  parameters  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  Minor 
differences  in  a  few  parameters  to  the  advantage  of  either  arm  were  observed.  In  study  2,  no 
differences in weight, pain or other symptoms were observed. The Dox group improved slightly, but 
significantly more than the Myocet arm in performance status. 
Supportive studies 
The supportive phase II trials (study 4, 5, 6 and 7) do not provide any critical data for this assessment 
but rather confirm the feasibility of Myocet administration with respect to efficacy and safety.  
Study  6-combined  Myocet  with  CPA  and  5-FU,  resulting  in  a  high  response  rate  without  obviously 
increased cardiotoxicity but with a tendency for more pronounced other toxicity. Study 7 (single-agent 
Myocet with a starting dose of 135 mg/m2 as a 1 h infusion every three weeks, with G-CSF), on the 
other  hand,  confirmed  the  fairly  modest  advantage  from  Myocet  since  the  high  dose  used  clearly 
produced unacceptable cardiotoxicity. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The choice of treatment in the control and the experimental groups in trials 1 is considered relevant. 
Dox/CPA  is  still  regarded  as  a  clinically  relevant  combination  although  the  inclusion  also  of  5-FU 
(CAF regimen) is more commonly used. Single-agent Dox at conventional doses is probably mostly 
not  accepted  as  a  clinical  standard  but  for  the  purpose  of  elucidating  differences  in  the  therapeutic 
ratios for Myocet and Dox, the comparison is relevant. 
The Myocet versus Epi comparison at identical doses in study 3 is more problematic with respect to 
antitumour  efficacy  due  to  the  comparison  at  identical  doses  with  Epi,  which  might  have  a  better 
therapeutic  index  than  Dox.  Based  on  prior  experience  Epi  seems  to  be  less  cardiotoxic,  with  an 
incidence of CHF at 900 mg/m2 approximately similar to that of 550 mg/m2 Dox. Although equivalent 
antitumour  efficacy  is  suggested  from  randomised  comparisons  using  identical  doses,  this  is  not  yet 
fully accepted. Currently, many clinicians would probably suggest that 75 mg/m2 of Epi correlates to 
approximately 60 mg/m2 of Dox with respect to toxicity and efficacy. 
Unfortunately,  very  precise  data  on  the  effect  of  chemotherapy  on  OS  in  MBC  are  missing  but 
retrospective  cohort  data indicate  a survival  benefit  from  non-anthracycline chemotherapy  versus  no 
treatment in the range 6 – 9 months. A somewhat better effect might be expected from anthracycline-
based  treatment.  Against  this  background,  a  non-inferiority  requirement  for  the  lower  bound  95% 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio for PFS and OS in the range 0.7 – 0.8 was considered relevant. 
With respect to antitumour efficacy, some of the data presented are not fully satisfactory, notably the 
survival data from study 2 as well as choice of tumour response rate as primary endpoint in the phase 
III trials. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that the survival difference in study 2 is unlikely 
to be due to different antitumour activity of Myocet versus Dox. Based on a global assessment of all 
efficacy data from the phase III trials, it seems reasonable to conclude that Myocet is non-inferior to 
Dox and, thus, an active drug for the treatment of MBC. 
Clinical safety 
Adverse events were graded according to NCI CTC criteria. Safety data were presented according to 
treatment actually received. 
15/21

Patient exposure 
Three hundred and twenty-three patients were actually exposed to Myocet in studies 1 – 3. Fourteen 
and  13%  of  Myocet  and  Dox  cycles,  respectively,  were  delayed  in  study  1  and  the  corresponding 
figures for study 2 were 16 and  14% and  17  and  15%  for study 3. The fraction  of cycles with dose 
reductions was 4 and 9% for Myocet and Dox, respectively, in study 1, 28 and 25% in study 2 and 11 
and  4%  in  study  3.  The  main  reason  for  dose  delays/reductions  was  myelosuppression.  G-CSF  use 
between treatment arms was 38 and 45% of cycles for Myocet and Dox, respectively in study 1, with 
corresponding figures of 56 and 68% in study 2 and 39 and 29% in study 3.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
In study 1, there were 10 patients on the Myocet/CPA arm who died within 30 days of study treatment 
administration. Four of these deaths occurred after one cycle of therapy; 3 were considered to be due 
to  progressive  disease  and  1  death  was  due  to  sepsis  in  the  setting  of  grade  4  neutropenia.  Four 
Myocet/CPA patients died after their second cycle of study therapy; 3 died of progressive disease and 
1 of the four died of complications related to coronary artery disease. One patient died due to a pre-
existing  radiation-induced  constrictive  pericarditis  and  the  tenth  Myocet/CPA  death  was  observed 
after six cycles due to grade 4 neutropenic sepsis. Two Dox/CPA patients died within 30 days of their 
last dose of study therapy, one of unknown causality after one cycle. The second patient died after two 
cycles, due to progressive disease. In study 2, two Dox patients died while on the study, both due to 
progressive  disease.  There  were  no  deaths  on  the  Myocet  arm.  In  study  3,  3  Myocet/CPA  and  4 
Epi/CPA patients died within 30 days of study treatment administration. All cases were considered to 
be due to progressive disease. 
The  observed  SAEs  in  studies  1  and  3  did  not  present  any  unexpected  findings  with  respect  to 
incidence or type of SAEs, nor in the comparisons across treatment arms. In study 2, SAEs other than 
deaths  were reported for  41 and 40% of patients in the Myocet and Dox arms, respectively. Eighty-
nine  and  94%,  respectively,  of  these  SAEs  were  of  grade  3  or  4  and  are  partly  also  covered  in  the 
adverse events section below. The overall incidence of grade 3 – 4 SAEs according to organ system 
was fairly balanced (including types of events). 
Cardiotoxicity 
Cardiotoxicity results for studies 1 and 2 in which MUGA scans were used, are summarised in Table 
6. A total of 9 versus 32 cardiotoxic events were observed in the Myocet and Dox arms, respectively, 
in study 1. The corresponding figures for study 2 were 18 and 44. The 5 confirmed cases of CHF in 
study  1  had  lifetime  Dox  exposures  in  the  range  360  –  480  mg/m2  with  1  patient  having  received  a 
cumulative dose of adjuvant Dox of 240 mg/m2. The 2 patients with CHF in the Myocet arm in study 2 
had life-time Dox exposure of 1100 and 785 mg/m2 (290 mg/m2 adjuvant), respectively. The 9 patients 
with CHF in the Dox  arm  had lifetime Dox exposure in the range 525 –  765  mg/m2 with 2 patients 
having a cumulative dose of adjuvant Dox of 195 and 300 mg/m2, respectively.  
In study 2, cardiac biopsies were performed in the initial phase of the study, for patients with lifetime 
Dox  exposure  of  >400  mg/m2.  Thirty-six  patients  (19  Myocet  and  17  Dox)  had  biopsies  that  were 
blindly  evaluated  and  scored  according  to  Billingham.  None  of  the  patients  in  the  Myocet  arm 
compared with 7 in the Dox arm showed the highest score,  i.e.,  3.0, whereas 5 patients in  each arm 
had a score of 2.5. Nevertheless, although an important selection bias is unlikely, the data for the 36 
patients with a biopsy need to be assessed with caution. 
Cardiotoxicity  was  not  a  primary  endpoint  in  study  3  and  a  less  reproducible  method  for  LVEF 
monitoring, i.e., echocardiography, was used. The  maximal cumulative dose of Myocet and Epi was 
600 mg/m2. Nine patients (12%; 5 type I and 4 type II) in the Myocet arm and 8 patients (10%; 5 type 
I and 3 type II) in the Epi arm developed reductions on LVEF. There were no cases of CHF. 
Three hundred and seventy-nine anthracycline-naive patients with solid tumours treated with Myocet 
at starting doses of <100 mg/m2 in all clinical studies were included in the assessment of risk of CHF. 
Two patients (0.5%) developed CHF. The cumulative risk of developing CHF was 3% at 650 mg/m2 
and  9%  at  750  mg/m2.  Exploratory  analyses  indicated  that  the  cardiotoxicity  advantage  of  Myocet 
over  Dox  was  observed  in  subgroups  seemingly  at  higher  risk  for  cardiotoxicity  (by  age,  prior  Dox 
and radiation to the chest) as well as in remaining lower-risk subgroup. 
16/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
Follow-up  with  respect  to  LVEF  changes  was  similar  between  treatment  arms  and  generally  most 
events occurred within the study periods. With respect to CHF, 6 of the 16 total cases were reported 
>3 months after the last study treatment administration. Thus, the majority of CHF cases were reported 
close  to  the  trials,  which  increase  the  reliability  of  these  data.  However,  CHF  might  occur  very  late 
after therapy and there is probably a risk for underreporting since events might be attributed to 2nd line 
or other therapy, part of natural ageing, etc. Thus, with respect to CHF there remains uncertainty about 
the  quality  of  the  data  due  the  procedure  for  data  collection,  i.e.,  spontaneous  reporting  from  the 
investigators.

Clinical adverse events and laboratory findings 
In  study  2  the  median  duration  of  thrombocytopenia  was  6  and  5  days  for  Myocet  and  Dox, 
respectively. In study 3 the median duration of thrombocytopenia was 9 and 5  days for Myocet and 
Epi. In study 3 median duration of neutropenia was 7 and 10 days for Myocet and Epi, respectively. 
Otherwise there were no differences in the duration or degree of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.  
There was generally little skin toxicity. With respect to palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, 1 Dox/CPA 
patient developed a grade 1 reaction whereas in study 2, there were 2 grade 2 cases in the Dox arm and 
1  grade  2  cases  in  the  Myocet  arm.  This  toxicity  was  not  detailed  for  study  3. Pronounced  alopecia 
was observed in approximately 80 – 90% of patients in both arms in all studies. Injection site reactions 
were  more  common  in  the  Dox  arm  but  significantly  so  only  in  study  3.  Experience  of  9  cases  of 
extravasation of Myocet was reported. Ulcerative lesions or necrosis were not observed. 
There were no apparent differences between the treatment arms in events considered less relevant for 
chemotherapy  or  with  incidences  <5%.  Table  7  summarises  the  non-cardiac  clinical  and 
haematological  adverse  events  considered  to  be  relevant  for  chemotherapy  and  with  a  frequency  of 
>5% in either arm.

There was no indication of apparent different safety profiles in patients below and above 65 years of 
age.  There  is  no  experience  reported  on  the  safety  profile  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  or  liver 
function. 
Drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported for the Myocet but not for the Dox arm in study 1 
included  bronchospasm,  emotional  lability,  pain,  pneumonia  and  supraventricular  tachycardia  (1 
patient each). Corresponding  observations for  study 2 were folliculitis, glossitis, pericardial  effusion 
and  pruritus  (1  patient  each)  and  for  study  3  stomatitis  (5  patients),  gastric  ulcer  (2  patients), 
somnolence  (2  patients),  bronchitis,  haemorrhagic  cystitis,  dizziness,  dysphonia,  abnormal  gait,

gingivitis,  herpes  zoster,  melena,  muscle  weakness,  palpitation  and  supraventricular  tachycardia  (1 
patient each). 
Other  laboratory  parameters  measured  included  transaminases,  alkaline  phosphatase,  bilirubin, 
sodium,  potassium,  urea,  creatinine,  albumin,  urate,  calcium,  phosphate,  glucose,  chloride  in  blood 
and renal toxicity was also investigated by dipsticks/microscopy for erythrocytes, leukocytes, protein, 
glucose  and  casts.  There  were  essentially  no  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  these 
parameters. 
Twenty  and  18%  of  Myocet  and  Dox  patients,  respectively,  in  study  1  had  at  least  one  grade  3 
toxicity.  The corresponding figures for study 2 were 18 and 11% and for study 3, 5 and 10%. 
Grade 3 and 4 hepatic laboratory abnormalities ranged 0 – 4% and 0 – 1%, respectively, in trials 1 – 3, 
with no apparent differences between treatment arms. There was 1 patient in each arm of trial 1 with 
creatinine elevation of grade 3 and a few cases in both arms of grades 3 – 4 electrolyte and mineral 
abnormalities in trials 1 and 3. In study 3, there were 4 patients in each arm with serum urea elevation 
of grade 3. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
With respect to cardiotoxicity, Myocet compared to Dox (studies 1 and 2) clearly reduced the risk for 
a  significant  decrease  in  LVEF  although  the  absolute  differences  were  small.  There  was  also  a 
difference  in  the  incidence  in  CHF  although  this  observation  is  less  convincing  given  the  unblinded 
procedures for reporting this event. Differences in LVEF changes or incidence of CHF did not appear 
to be due to differences in post-study therapy. Based on the seemingly acceptable surrogate value of a 
decreased LVEF for the future development of CHF it is concluded that the cardiac safety profile for 
Myocet is better than that of Dox. 
Myocet  by  no  means  completely  relieves  the  risk  of  significant  cardiotoxicity  from  Dox  based 
chemotherapy. Thus, LVEF changes were observed also in the Myocet groups and seemed to be dose-
dependent, as evidenced by comparing studies 1 and 2. In both trials the relative Myocet/Dox dose to 
produce similar frequencies of LVEF changes approximately ranged 1.2 – 1.5/1. This is a modest but 
clinically relevant achievement that  might improve cardiac safety and/or the  possibility to prolong a 
putatively beneficial treatment in MBC patients. 
Most  observed  cases  of  CHF  occurred  quite  early  after  treatment  and  there  remains  a  risk  for 
underreporting  of  very  late  occurring  events.  It  seems  unlikely  that  poor  or  biased  reporting  of  late 
CHF  would  change  the  overall  conclusion  regarding  cardiac  safety  of  Myocet  compared  to  Dox. 
Nevertheless,  late  onset  cardiotoxicity  is  known  to  occur  with  anthracyclines  and  the  comparison  of 
cardiotoxic  events  after  long-term  follow-up  needs  to  be  considered.  Thus,  it  will  be  necessary  to 
perform  future  surveillance  in  order  to  assess  the  long-term  cardiotoxicity  for  patients  who  have 
received Myocet. 
The profiles for Myocet and Dox were similar with a trend for Myocet to be less myelotoxic and to 
produce less stomatitis. Particularly, Myocet was associated with less frequent anaemia (85% versus 
96% in study 2), infection (36% versus 58% in study 2), and stomatitis / mucositis (40% versus 56%, 
in  study  1).  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  these  differences  concern  all  grades  of  those  events, 
while  statistically  significant  differences  are  not  attained  for  the  higher  intensities  of  the  same 
manifestations.  Furthermore,  the  assessment  of  myelotoxicity  is  obscured  by  the  frequent  use  of  G-
CSF.  
Compared  to  Epi,  Myocet  was  associated  with  significantly  more  frequent  haematological  adverse 
events  and  mucositis  but,  as  Epi  was  probably  underdosed,  evidence  of  definitive  inferiority  of  the 
safety profile of Myocet cannot be retained. In study 3, cardiotoxicity was not a primary endpoint and 
was  less  accurately  assessed.  Cardiotoxicity  seemed  to  be  similar  between  the  treatment  groups. 
Tentatively,  and  based  on  the  experience  of  lower  cardiotoxicity  of  Epi  compared  with  Dox  at 
identical doses, this would also suggest a favourable cardiac safety profile for Myocet. The favourable 
cardiotoxic profile of Myocet also seemed to hold for patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity.

5.   Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The  quality  of  Myocet  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Aflatoxin  control,  the  risk  assessment  of  virological  inactivation  and  validation  of  use  of  a  dry  heat 
block in the preparation of the final constituted product will be addressed as a Follow-up Measures. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The antitumour activity of Myocet has been investigated in animal models and compared with that of 
free  Dox.  Myocet  allowed  the  administration  of  higher  doses  of  Dox,  which  seemed  to  display  a 
different pharmacokinetic profile compared to the free Dox formulation.  
The  equal  or  improved  survival  that  was  observed  in  short-term  animal  studies  of  Myocet  versus 
conventional  Dox  allows  speculating  that  Myocet  might  maintain  its  activity  also  against  the 
development  of  metastases.  However,  the  actual  long-term  protection  against  the  effect  of 
micrometastases  cannot  be  determined  from  the  data.  This  issue  is  not  considered  critical  in  the 
palliative setting of MBC whereas it would need further investigations in earlier stages of the disease. 
In summary, the preclinical data for Myocet are satisfactory. 
Efficacy 
Although  pharmacokinetic  data  may  be  somewhat  unreliable,  it  appears  that  liposome-encapsulation 
of  Dox  results  in  lower  peak  plasma  concentrations  (thus  mimicking  continuous  infusion)  while  the 
AUC for free drug may be approximately similar for the two treatments. This could explain why the 
efficacy and toxicity profiles are similar for Myocet and conventional Dox, whereas cardiotoxicity is 
somewhat reduced for Myocet. 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  in  patients  with  impaired  liver  function  will  be  addressed  as  a 
follow-up measure. 
The  choice  of  the  combination  Dox/CPA  in  the  control  and  the  experimental  groups  in  one  pivotal 
trial is considered relevant although the  CAF regimen  is  more  commonly used. Single-agent Dox at 
conventional  doses,  as  was  used  in  the  second  pivotal  trial,  although  generally  not  accepted  as  a 
clinical  standard,  is  considered  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  elucidating  differences  in  the  therapeutic 
ratios for Myocet and Dox. 
In  general,  PFS  and  OS  are  considered  more  clinically  relevant  endpoints  than  response  rate  in 
advanced  BC.  However,  in  direct  comparison  between  two  Dox  formulations,  response  rate  was 
considered to be a sensitive endpoint for detection of a difference, if adequately supported by reliable 
PFS and OS data. 
The  pivotal  trials  show  that  Myocet  is  non-inferior  to  Dox  on  a  mg  per  mg  basis  with  respect  to 
antitumour  efficacy.  It  is  acknowledged  that  there  are  some  efficacy  concerns,  notably  the  inferior 
survival  data  observed  for  Myocet  in  study  2.  However,  it  appears  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the 
survival difference in study 2 is unlikely to be due to different antitumour activity of Myocet versus 
Dox. In addition, this study is less relevant for the approved indication.  
Based on the assessment of all efficacy data from the pivotal trials it seems reasonable to conclude that 
Myocet is an active drug for the treatment of MBC and that its activity is non-inferior to that of Dox. 
Concerns  were  raised  about  the  real  added  value  of  the  liposomal  formulation  compared  to 
conventional Dox. 
It should be noted that demonstrated differences in pharmacokinetics between Myocet and Dox might 
be of importance for the eradication of  micrometastasis. Myocet should therefore not be used in the 
adjuvant treatment of BC.  
Safety 
With respect to cardiotoxicity, both in combination or single-agent studies, Myocet reduced the risk of 
a  decrease  in  LVEF  compared  to  Dox  although  the  absolute  differences  were  small.  The  observed 
20/21 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difference  in  the  incidence  in  CHF  in  favour  of  Myocet  is  less  convincing  given  the  unblinded 
reporting of cases. Based on the acceptable surrogate value of a decrease in LVEF for the development 
of CHF it is concluded that the cardiac safety profile for Myocet is better than for Dox.  
Most  observed  cases  of  CHF  occurred  quite  early  after  treatment  and  there  remains  a  risk  for 
underreporting  of  very  late  occurring  events.  Late  onset  cardiotoxicity  is  known  to  occur  with 
anthracyclines  and  the  comparison  of  cardiotoxic  events  after  long-term  follow-up  needs  to  be 
considered. 
Excluding  cardiotoxicity,  the  combination  and  single-agent  trials  of  Myocet/CPM  versus  Dox/CPM 
and Myocet versus Dox showed comparable toxicity profiles. Experimental safety data are insufficient 
to allow a comparison of Myocet with Epi. 
Myocet  does  not  completely  relieve  the  risk  for  significant  cardiotoxicity.  LVEF  changes  were 
observed also with Myocet and seemed to be dose-intensity dependent. The relative Myocet/Dox dose 
to produce similar frequencies of LVEF changes was approximately 1.2 to 1.5 times that of Dox. For 
MBC  patients,  this  is  a  modest  but  still  clinically  relevant  achievement  that  might  provide  an 
improved cardiac safety and/or the possibility to prolong treatment. 
The  evaluation  of  left  ventricular  function  is  considered  mandatory  before  each  additional 
administration  of  Myocet  once  a  patient  exceeds  a  lifetime  cumulative  anthracycline  dose  of  550 
mg/m2  or  whenever  cardiomyopathy  is  suspected  (see  SPC  4.4,  Special  warnings  and  special 
precautions for use). 
It will be necessary to monitor the long-term cardiotoxicity for patients who have received Myocet. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Overall  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  Myocet  lowers  the  risk  of  cardiotoxicity  compared  with 
conventional  Dox  in  dosages  clinically  equipotent  with  respect  to  antitumour  activity.  The  absolute 
benefit  from  this,  however,  appears  modest  in  patients  with  MBC.  With  respect  to  other  aspects  of 
toxicity, the safety profiles of Myocet and Dox are clinically similar. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by majority 
decision  that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  in  the  first 
line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women was favourable.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC of 
the fixed-dose combination products Combivir, 
Dovato, Kivexa, Triumeq and Trizivir to include new 
information about use of the products in patients 
with renal impairment. Furthermore, minor editorial 
changes have been implemented throughout the 
Product Information and the lists of local 
representatives have been updated for all products.

data 
mL/min receiving Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ 
Trizivir may experience a 1.6-to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine 
exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, 
controlled trials comparing Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to 
neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30

and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components 
administration for safety reasons.

As part of a previous type II variation (II-104), section 4.2 
the posology in paediatric patients with renal 
impairment weighing less than 25 kg and aged at 
of the SmPC of Epivir oral solution was updated to

months of age and weighing less than 25 kg. This update 
was based on interactions with sorbitol-containing 
antiretroviral drugs which may be co-administered with 
Epivir.  
The current dosing recommendations for children aged at 
least 3 months and weighing less than 25 kg with renal 
impairment are not based on clinical data, but on PK 
extrapolations. Applying the same method of dose 
estimation, the CHMP considered that the doses in children 
with renal insufficiency should also be increased by 25%. 
In order to provide additional guidance to the prescriber, 
the MAH also introduced a statement indicating that 
patients changing between oral solution and tablets should 
follow the dosing recommendations that are specific to the 
respective formulation.

concluded that concomitant use of lamivudine with chronic 
administration of sorbitol containing medicines may reduce 
the exposure of lamivudine, possibly resulting in reduced 
virologic suppression or viral resistance. 
When possible, avoid chronic coadministration of Epivir with 
medicinal products containing sorbitol or other osmotic 
acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. 
xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, maltitol). Consider more frequent 
monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when chronic 
coadministration cannot be avoided. 
Whenever possible in children, an all-tablet regimen should 
preferably be used. Epivir oral solution given concomitantly 
with sorbitol-containing medicines should be used only 
when an all-tablet regimen cannot be used and the benefits 
of treatment outweigh possible risks including lower 
virological suppression. Consider more frequent monitoring 
of HIV-1 viral load when Epivir is used with chronically-
administered, sorbitol-containing medicines [e.g. Ziagen 
oral solution]. Although not studied, the same effect would 
be expected with other osmotic acting poly-alcohols or 
monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, 
maltitol.

to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment 
with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.

dosing compared to adults. 
In a pharmacokinetic study (PENTA 15), four virologically

controlled subjects less than 12 months of age switched 
from abacavir plus lamivudine oral solution twice daily to a 
once daily regimen. Three subjects had undetectable viral 
load and one had plasmatic HIV-RNA of 900 copies/ml at 
Week 48. No safety concerns were observed in these 
subjects. 
The abacavir + lamivudine once daily dosing group was 
demonstrated to be non-inferior to the twice daily group 
according to the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -
12%, for the primary endpoint of <80 c/mL at Week 48 as 
well as at Week 96 (secondary endpoint) and all other 
thresholds tested (<200c/mL, <400c/mL, <1000c/mL), 
which all fell well within this non-inferiority margin. 
Subgroup analyses testing for heterogeneity of once vs 
twice daily demonstrated no significant effect of sex, age, 
or viral load at randomisation. Conclusions supported non-
inferiority regardless of analysis method. 
In a separate study comparing the unblinded NRTI 
combinations (with or without blinded nelfinavir) in 
children, a greater proportion treated with abacavir and 
lamivudine (71%) or abacavir and zidovudine (60%) had 
HIV-1 RNA  400 copies/ml at 48 weeks, compared with 
those treated with lamivudine and zidovudine (47%)[ 
p=0.09, intention to treat analysis]. Similarly, greater 
proportions of children treated with the abacavir containing 
combinations had HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/ml at 48 weeks 
(53%, 42% and 28% respectively, p=0.07).

the treatment of HIV-1 in pregnant women. In 
addition, the MAH took this opportunity to include a 
warning in section 4.5 of the SmPC regarding drug 
interaction with cytidine analogues and other 
medicinal products containing lamivudine, in line 
with the existing warning in section 4.4. Moreover, 
the SmPC and the Package Leaflet are updated in 
line with the latest QRD template (version 9.0) and 
Registry) to gather additional safety data about the use of 
lamivudine in pregnant women. Overall, these data 
confirmed the lack of impact on birth defects, birth weight 
and prematurity when a lamivudine-containing regimen is 
used compared to other ARV regimen. This supports the 
lamivudine product information about HIV-infected 
pregnant women, which states that lamivudine can be used 
during pregnancy if clinically needed. The benefit/risk 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
balance of Epivir remains unchanged. 
is also updated.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to reflect a potential drug-drug interaction between 
lamivudine and cladribine. This labelling update has 
been assessed via a separate Type II variation 
procedure (Zeffix; EMEA/H/C/242/II/53) with

cladribine (CdA) was assessed in a type II variation of 
Zeffix (EMEA/H/C/242/II/53) based on a publication by 
Chtioui et al (Concomitant treatment with lamivudine 
renders cladribine inactive by inhibition of its 
phosphorylation. Br.J.Haematology. 2008; 144: 136-137). 
This article described a patient with chronic lymphoid 
leukaemia who was treated with CdA and Zeffix. No 
decrease of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count was 
observed after the first cycle of CdA. Zeffix was 
discontinued and the lymphocyte count decreased following 
the second and third cycles of CdA. The authors suspected 
a potential interaction based on intracellular 
phosphorylation when both medicines are administered 
concomitantly. In addition, an in vitro study was carried out 
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a 
healthy volunteer. This in vitro study showed that 
phosphorylated CdA levels were decreased with increasing 
3TC concentrations.

polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Still’s syndrome and 
myasthenia gravis. Cases involving zidovudine, lamivudine, 
abacavir and fosamprenavir were identified. These 
disorders all developed when CD4 count was increased or 
increasing and viral load undetectable. The autoimmune 
disorders resolved (or improved) spontaneously or with 
specific therapy and while Anti-Retroviral Therapy was 
continued. Most of cases had a relatively late onset 
following Anti-Retroviral Therapy initiation except cases of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and adult onset Still’s disease. The 
time to onset ranged from 2 weeks to 37 months. 
While it was recognised that the number of cases is small, 
the long and variable time to onset probably causes 
underreporting of such adverse reactions and therefore 
little is known on the exact pathogenesis and the risk 
factors. The CHMP agreed that information about 
autoimmune disorders occurring in the context of immune 
reconstitution should be reflected in the product 
information.

children (<6 years old) when compared to older children 
(?6 years old) in pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 
children together with data from re-analysis of a clinical 
trial in HIV infected children tend to show that a better 
virologic suppression was achieved in children aged ?6 
years old. The CHMP acknowledges that no statistically 
significant difference was observed in this clinical study. 
However, the results are not so far from statistical 
significance and the small sample size should be taken into

account. 
Overall these data cannot be regarded as reassuring for the 
lamivudine recommended regimens in children aged from 3 
months to 6 years. The CHMP considers that these data 
should prompt a cautious attitude with regard to the clinical 
impact of the lower lamivudine exposure identified in 
younger children (<6 years old) when compared to older 
children. Therefore, the CHMP requested in September 
2006 that section 5.2 of the SPC should be updated to 
include some additional wording illustrating this finding.

the cause of this disease could be due to multi factors 
(including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has 
occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease 
and/or in patients with long term use of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all 
available data the CHMP agreed that this information 
should now be included in the SPC and PL of all 
antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be 
warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint 
stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement.

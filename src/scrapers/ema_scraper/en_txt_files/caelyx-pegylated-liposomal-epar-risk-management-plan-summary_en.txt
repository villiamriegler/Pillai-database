information 
Indication(s) in the EEA 
Chemical class: 
The active ingredient of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is 
doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCl), a cytotoxic anthracycline 
antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. 
Summary of mode of action: 
The exact mechanism of the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin is 
not known. It is generally believed that inhibition of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and 
protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic 
effects. This is probably the result of intercalation of the 
anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double 
helix thus preventing their unwinding for replication. 
Important information about its composition: 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin HCl encapsulated in 
liposomes with surface-bound methoxypolyethylene glycol 
(MPEG). This process is known as pegylation and protects 
liposomes from detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system 
(MPS), which increases blood circulation time. 
Excipients with known effect include fully hydrogenated soy 
phosphatidylcholine (from soyabean); use of Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal is contraindicated in patients with a known 
hypersensitivity.

• 
In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of 
progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have 
received at least one prior therapy and who have already 
undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplant, 
•  For treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS)-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low 
Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts (< 200 CD4 
lymphocytes/cubic millimeter (mm3)) and extensive 
mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic 
chemotherapy, or as second line chemotherapy in AIDS-KS 
patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients 
intolerant to, prior combination systemic chemotherapy 
comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, 
bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). 
Proposed:  
Not applicable; there are no proposed changes to the currently 
approved indications. 
Current: 
Breast cancer/Ovarian cancer 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is administered intravenously (IV) at 
a dose of 50 milligrams (mg)/square meter (m2) once every four 
weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and the patient 
continues to tolerate treatment. 
Multiple myeloma 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is administered at 30 mg/m² on day 4 
of a bortezomib 3-week regimen as a one-hour infusion 
administered immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The 
bortezomib regimen consists of 1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 
every three weeks. The dose should be repeated as long as 
patients respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. Day 4 
dosing of both medicinal products may be delayed up to 48 hours 
as medically necessary. Doses of bortezomib should be at least 72 
hours apart. 
AIDS-related KS 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is administered IV at 20 mg/m2 every 
2-3 weeks. Avoid intervals shorter than 10 days as medicinal 
product accumulation and increased toxicity cannot be ruled out. 
Treatment of patients for 2-3 months is recommended to achieve a 
therapeutic response. Continue treatment as needed to maintain a 
therapeutic response.

Incidence 
Breast cancer 
According to the European Cancer Information System, breast cancer continues to be the 
most common female cancer, with the incidence in the EU accounting for 29.2% of all 
cancers in women (Dafni 2019). In the EU, a total of 404,920 new female breast cancer 
cases were estimated to occur in 2018, corresponding to an age-adjusted standardized rate 
(ASR) of 144.9/100,000. The incidence is highest in the high economic European 
countries, which include most of Northern and Western Europe, along with Italy and 
Malta from Southern Europe (Dafni 2019). Incidence trends in the EU are mainly 
increasing. Breast cancer in males is more rare, however, similar to female breast cancer, 
the incidence rate continues to rise. The age-adjusted incidence rate has increased to 1.32 
per 100,000 men in 2017, from 0.90 per 100,000 in 1980 as outlined by the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) (Howlader 2017). Multiple factors explain these

changes, including reproductive factors, increasing obesity and physical inactivity as well 
as increased screening intensity (European Commission 2020). 
Ovarian cancer 
Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common malignancy worldwide and the most lethal 
gynecological malignancy. The ASR of ovarian cancer incidence ranged from 3.0 to 
11.4/100,000 women worldwide in 2012. The highest ASR was observed in Central and 
Eastern Europe, with 11.4/100,000 women in 2012 (Zhang 2019, ESGO 2018). A more 
recent study has found the highest incidence still found in Central and Eastern Europe 
(ASR = 10.7/100,000), followed by Northern Europe (ASR = 8.8/100,000), Polynesia 
(ASR = 8.8/100,000), North America (ASR = 8.1/100,000), and South East Asia (ASR = 
8.1/100,000). The lowest incidence was observed in Central Africa (ASR = 4.4/100,000), 
the Caribbean (ASR = 4.6/100,000), and Southern Africa (ASR = 4.9/100,000) (Huang 
2022).  
Multiple myeloma 
The global ASR for multiple myeloma varies between 0.54 and 5.3/100,000 population 
(Ludwig 2020). In the Western world (including Europe), the ASR has been reported to 
be approximately 5/100,000 (Kazandijan 2016). The lowest incidence rates were noted in 
Asia (0.54-1/100,000), and highest in New Zealand (5.3/100,000), followed by Australia 
(5.0/100,000), the United Kingdom (4.3/100,000), Israel, and Norway (both 4.2/100,000) 
(Ludwig 2020).  
AIDS-related KS 
A meta-analysis of publications found the crude overall KS incidence for Europe to be 
589.84/100,000 person-years. When the study start time and participants were confined to 
post-1996 and adults, the KS incidence in Europe and North America decreased to 
241.13 and 171.86/100,000, respectively (Liu 2018). A 2017 study based on over 
200,000 patients reported raw KS incidence per 100,000 person-years in 42 cohorts from 
57 countries, including North America (237/100,000), Latin America (244/100,000 
person-years), Europe (180 per 100,000 person-years), Asia-Pacific (52 per 100,000 
person-years) and South Africa (280 per 100,000 person-years) (The AIDS-defining 
Cancer Project Working Group 2017).

Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
Globally, as of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed 
with breast cancer in the past 5 years, making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. Breast 
cancer in males is more rare in that makes up only approximately 1% of all breast cancers 
in the United States and worldwide (Zheng 2022). It is estimated that breast cancer 
accounts for 13.3% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in the EU in 2020 (WHO 2021).  
Ovarian cancer 
In 2020, a total of 313,959 new cases of ovarian cancer were recorded globally, and there 
were more than three quarters of a million women living within five years of their 
diagnosis (Reid 2023).  Although ovarian cancer has a lower prevalence in comparison 
with breast cancer, it is more lethal due to asymptomatic and secret growth of the tumor, 
delayed onset of symptoms, and lack of proper screening that result in its diagnosis in the 
advanced stages (Bray 2018).  
Multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all cancers and is the second most common 
hematologic malignancy after lymphoma (Palumbo 2011, Teras 2016, Siegal 2016). The 
estimated worldwide 5-year prevalence is approximately 230,000 patients (Kazandjian 
2016). Its prevalence is expected to rise in Western countries in light of the aging 
population (Padala 2021).  
AIDS-related KS 
In the United States, KS was reported to be 20,000 times more frequent in patients with 
AIDS than in the general population and to be 300 times more frequent in patients with 
AIDS than in other immune-suppressed patient groups (Beral 1990). Similar patterns of 
KS risk were reported in Europe and Australia (Hermans 1996, Elford 1993). However, 
subsequent studies have shown that the rate of AIDS-related KS decreased significantly 
since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1990s (Cesarman 2019). 
Data from the EuroSIDA study, a prospective study of Human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-1 infected patients that includes over 70 centers across Europe, was used to 
estimate the incidence of KS over time among HIV/AIDS patients. The incidence of KS 
decreased an estimated 39% annually between 1994 and 2003 (Mocroft 2004). In the 
United States, at the end of 2015, 1,904 persons with HIV (0.20%) had been diagnosed 
with KS in the previous 5 years (Peprah 2021).

Demographics of the population in the authorized indications and risk factors for 
the diseases 
Breast and ovarian cancer 
Approximately half of breast cancers develop in women who have no identifiable breast 
cancer risk factor other than gender (female) and age (over 40 years). Other factors that 
increase the risk of breast cancer include obesity, harmful use of alcohol/tobacco, family 
history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure, reproductive history (such as age 
that menstrual periods began and age at first pregnancy), and postmenopausal hormone 
therapy (WHO 2021). 
Risk factors associated with ovarian cancer include age (post-menopausal), race and 
socioeconomic status (usually found to be higher in White, affluent, and better-educated 
societies), nulliparity, family history of ovarian cancer, history of endometrial or breast 
cancer, use of hormone replacement therapy, and genetics (patients with BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 gene mutations) (Komodiki 2006).

Risk factors for multiple myeloma include age, family history, sex and race. It is a 
neoplasm of older adults, and 1.5 times more common among men than women globally 
(Padala 2021). It is more than twice as common among African Americans with an 
incidence of 16.5/100,000 among African American men and 12.0/100,000 among 
African American women (compared to 8.2 and 5.0, respectively, for Caucasians) 
(Waxman 2010). Although the mutations that cause myeloma are acquired and not 
inherited, family history is a known risk factor for multiple myeloma. First-degree 
relatives of people with multiple myeloma have a 2 to 3 times higher risk of developing 
the disease (ASCO 2023). 
AIDS-related KS 
In patients with AIDS-related KS, the CD4 count appears to be an important factor 
associated with the development of the condition. For patients who presented with a new 
diagnosis of KS while on treatment with combined ART, the rate ratios for developing 
KS for patients with CD4 counts <200, 200 to 349, and 350 to 499 cells/mm3 were 18.9, 
3.6, and 4.1, compared with those with ≥500 cells/mm3 (Lodi 2010). Additional risk 
factors include sex (AIDS-related KS is predominantly a disease of males), concomitant 
infections (e.g., human herpesvirus-8 and other opportunistic infections) and concomitant

treatments (corticosteroid therapy has been associated with the induction of KS and the 
exacerbation of preexisting KS in persons living with HIV) (Groopman 2023a) 
Main existing treatment options 
Breast Cancer 
The main treatment options for breast cancer include (National Cancer Institute 2023a) 
•  Hormone therapy - Depending on whether the patient is pre- or post-menopausal, 
treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor 
positive may include Tamoxifen therapy, aromatase inhibitor therapy, cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor therapy, megestrol acetate, estrogen or androgen 
therapy, or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant. 
•  Targeted therapy - Treatment that uses drugs or other substances targeting 
specific proteins on cancer cells without harming normal cells, such as 
monoclonal antibody therapy, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab, 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lapatinib, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) 
inhibitors. 
•  Chemotherapy – Treatment can be administered orally, IV, intramuscularly, or 
placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ or a body cavity; the 
administration method depends on the type and stage of the cancer. 
Chemotherapy may also be combined with immunotherapy. 
•  Surgery - Most patients with breast cancer have surgery to remove the cancer 
from the breast or other areas of the body where the cancer has spread. Treatment 
may be combined with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or hormone therapy. 
•  Radiation therapy - External radiation and internal radiation may be used; the 
manner of administration depends on the type and stage of the cancer. 
Ovarian cancer 
Similar to treatment for breast cancer, treatment for ovarian cancer includes one or more 
of the following: surgery (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 
omentectomy), chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and/or radiation 
therapy. Choice of therapy depends largely on the stage of disease as well as general state 
of health, whether the patient plans to have children and other personal considerations 
(American Cancer Society 2018). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Multiple myeloma 
Version 6.3 
Treatment for people with symptomatic myeloma includes both measures to control the 
disease as well as supportive care to improve quality of life, such as symptom relief and 
maintaining good nutrition. Standard treatments, which may be combined, include 
(ASCO 2023): 
•  Chemotherapy - Common drugs are melphalan, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
etoposide, cisplatin and bendamustine. 
•  Targeted therapy - Treatments include proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib), 
histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and nuclear export 
inhibitors.  
•  Immunomodulatory drugs - Thalidomide, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and 
pomalidomide (Pomalyst), which stimulate the immune system to keep new blood 
vessels from forming and feeding myeloma cells.  
•  Corticosteroids - Steroids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone, are very 
effective at reducing the burden of plasma cells, but this effect is only temporary. 
•  Immunotherapy - Cellular immunotherapies approved to treat multiple myeloma 
are idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti). 
These are chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies that target B-cell maturation 
antigens (a protein on the surface of myeloma cells).  
•  Stem cell transplant - The treatment involves using high-dose chemotherapy along 
with transfusion of previously collected immature blood cells (from patient or 
donor) to replace diseased or damaged marrow. 
•  Radiation therapy: This therapy may be used to quickly shrink myeloma cells in a 
specific area. 
Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib can also be effectively used as maintenance 
therapy to extend the disease's response to the initial therapy or after a bone marrow/stem 
cell transplant. 
AIDS-related KS 
KS patients are first treated with ART and then either a local and/or systemic therapy. 
The need for treatment beyond ART and the choice among the various options depend 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
upon the extent of disease, rapidity of tumor growth, HIV-1 viral load, CD4 cell count, 
and the patient's overall medical condition. Local therapies include radiation therapy, 
intralesional chemotherapy, cryotherapy, and topical retinoids. Systemic therapies 
include interferons and cytotoxic chemotherapy (single agent or combination regimens) 
(Groopman 2023b). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
Breast cancer 
Breast cancer was the leading cause of death from cancer in women (16.2% of cancer 
deaths) among 40 European countries in 2018 (Dafni 2019). Despite this statistic, studies 
have shown the mortality rate in the EU has declined from 15.0 in 2012 to 14.4 per 
100,000 women in 2017 (-3.9%). Mortality rate predictions across Europe are expected to 
reach relatively uniform levels in 2025 (Wojtyla 2021).  
Ovarian cancer 
Ovarian cancer is more frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, when its prognosis is 
poor, making this cancer the most lethal gynecological malignancy (Zhang 2019). There 
is wide variation in survival between histological groups, and stage at diagnosis remains 
an important factor in ovarian cancer survival. Survival from type I epithelial ovarian 
tumors for women diagnosed during 2005-2009 ranged from 40 to 70%, while survival 
from type II epithelial tumors was much lower (20-45%) (Matz 2017). Survival from 
germ cell tumors and sex-cord stromal tumors was higher than that of type II epithelial 
tumors. Survival from localized tumors was much higher than for advanced disease (80% 
vs. 30%) (Matz 2017). In Europe, ovarian cancer mortality declined over the past decade 
in all considered countries; reported rates were 4.3/100,000 (-13%) for all ages, 
1.2/100,000 (-26%) at 20-49 years, 15.3/100,000 (-11%) at 50-69 years and 32.3/100,000 
(-11%) at 70-79 years (Dalmartello 2022). 
Multiple myeloma 
In the past decade survival rates for multiple myeloma have improved significantly for 
the general population most likely due to the availability of effective therapy (Kristinsson 
2007, Turesson 2010). It has been reported that median survival in patients with relapsed 
multiple myeloma prior to 2000 was 12 months compared to 24 months after 2000 
(Kumar 2008). In another study, 5-year relative survival was found to increase from 34% 
in 1989-1992 to 56% in 2001-2005 periods of diagnosis (Schaapveld 2010). Siegal et al. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
(2016) reported that 5-year relative survival rates in multiple myeloma improved to 49% 
for the 2005-2011 year period compared to 25% for 1975-1977 and 27% for 1987-
1989.19 (Kazandjian 2016). 
AIDS-related KS 
The introduction of ART has led to a reduced incidence and improved survival of KS 
globally (Groopman 2023a, Groopman 2023b). The prognosis of patients with HIV or 
AIDS-related KS since the introduction of ART is illustrated by a consecutive series of 
469 cases treated since 1998 at a single center (Bower 2014). Of these, 303 presented 
with T0 disease (65%) and 166 had T1 involvement (35%). Those with T0 disease 
generally were treated with ART alone, unless there was a need for symptomatic 
treatment of localized lesions, while those with T1 disease were managed with 
chemotherapy plus ART. For those with T0 disease, the overall five-year survival was 
92% and for those with T1 disease the five-year survival was 83%. 
Important co-morbidities 
For the above indicated conditions, there are common comorbidities in the patient 
populations which may influence treatment, disease progression and prognosis. Common 
co-morbidities include: 
•  Breast and ovarian cancer - Cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, 
pain/inflammation, and renal disease (National Cancer Institute 2023b) 
•  Multiple myeloma - Cardiovascular conditions, renal disease, diabetes and 
hypertension (Sverrisdóttir 2021) 
•  AIDS-related KS – HIV/AIDS. As more people living with HIV and AIDS are 
accessing effective ART and living longer, as they age, they develop chronic age-
related illnesses including cardiovascular conditions, diabetes and chronic kidney 
disease (Morales 2022). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
PART II: MODULE SII – NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal (also marketed under Doxil trade name) was first approved 
in the United States on 17 NOV 1995. It differs from conventional doxorubicin (CD) due 
to the encapsulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride (the active pharmacological 
ingredient) in pegylated liposomes, which protects liposomes from detection by the MPS, 
consequently increasing its blood circulation time.  
Non-clinical studies were conducted by previous MAHs; however, the safety 
pharmacology and toxicity profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is well-established as it 
has been marketed for over two decades. Historical data show the non-clinical safety 
profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal has been characterized in single- and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rodents, dogs, and monkeys, as well as developmental toxicity and 
local tolerance studies. In most of these studies the effects of Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
were compared with those of CD. 
On 23 DEC 2020 Baxter Healthcare Corporation entered into an agreement with Cilag 
GmbH International to acquire the global MA rights for Caelyx pegylated liposomal. The 
application for MA transfer to Baxter Holding B.V. in the EEA was approved by the 
EMA on 20 AUG 2021. As there have been no new non-clinical studies conducted by 
Baxter, the summary below presents historical non-clinical findings included in the 
previous RMP (version 5.0 issued 16 SEP 2013; prepared by Janssen-Cilag International 
NV), as well as relevant literature available in the public domain.

Key safety findings/Relevance to human usage 
Toxicity 
Single-dose or acute toxicity  Major findings in single-dose studies include 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and dermal 
toxicity. In a single-dose IV toxicity study conducted 
with Caelyx in rats, no mortality was observed at the 
dose of 8 mg/kg (EMA 2019).   
Major findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies were 
myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, 
nephrotoxicity, dermal toxicity, and cardiotoxicity. 
These toxicities were less severe and at lower 
incidence compared with an equivalent dose of CD. 
In repeat-dose studies conducted in animals, the 
toxicity profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
appears very similar to that reported in humans who 
receive long-term infusions of CD. However, the 
encapsulation of doxorubicin HCl in pegylated

liposomes results in the toxicity effects having 
differing strengths compared to CD. 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal resulted in mild to 
moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after 
a single dose of 36 mg/kilogram (kg). Decreased 
testicular weights and hypospermia were present in 
rats after repeat doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day and diffuse 
degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a 
marked decrease in spermatogenesis were observed in 
dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/kg/day. Findings in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies indicate that Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal is likely to have a potential effect 
on human fertility. 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is teratogenic and 
embryotoxic in rats, and embryotoxic and 
abortifacient in rabbits. In humans, Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal is suspected to cause fetal harm when 
administered during pregnancy.  
Although no studies have been conducted with 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal, doxorubicin HCl (the 
pharmacologically active ingredient of Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal) is known to be mutagenic and 
clastogenic (IARC 1987).  
Reported mutagenic activities of doxorubicin HCl 
include DNA damage induced in rabbit spermatozoa 
and dominant lethal mutations in mice. 
Like doxorubicin HCl, Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
may potentially induce chromosomal damage in 
human spermatozoa. 
Pegylated placebo liposomes are neither mutagenic 
nor genotoxic. 
Although no studies have been conducted with 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal, doxorubicin HCl is 
mutagenic and carcinogenic (IARC 1987).  
Local toxicity 
The results of local tolerance studies suggest that 
extravasated Caelyx pegylated liposomal may be less 
irritating than CD. 
A local tolerance study, performed in a non-rodent 
species receiving Caelyx by IV injection revealed no 
treatment-related injection-site intolerance. However, 
after subcutaneous administration, dose dependent 
inflammatory reactions have been observed indicating 
that Caelyx may provoke an inflammatory response 
after accidental perivenous administration (EMA 
2019).

Key safety findings/Relevance to human usage 
A study has shown that Caelyx pegylated liposomal at 
a single IV dose of over twice the clinical dose 
produces renal toxicity in monkeys. Renal toxicity 
has been observed with even lower single doses of 
doxorubicin HCl in rats and rabbits.  
Dermal toxicity 
After repeated administration of Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal to rats and dogs, serious dermal 
inflammations and ulcer formations were observed at 
clinically relevant dosages. In a study in dogs, the 
occurrence and severity of these lesions was reduced 
by lowering the dose or prolonging the intervals 
between doses. Similar dermal lesions, which are 
described as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, have 
also been observed in patients after long-term IV 
infusion. 
Studies in rabbits have shown that the cardiotoxicity 
of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is reduced compared 
with CD preparations. In a repeat-dose toxicity study, 
no pathology changes were seen in the heart of Wistar 
rats dosed with Caelyx pegylated liposomal at 2 
mg/kg, once weekly for 7 weeks (EMA 2019). 
No specific safety pharmacology studies looking at 
the nervous system were performed. 
Anaphylactoid response 
During repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs, an 
acute response characterized by hypotension, pale 
mucous membranes, salivation, emesis and periods of 
hyperactivity followed by hypoactivity and lethargy 
was observed following administration of pegylated 
liposomes (placebo). A similar, but less severe 
response was also noted in dogs treated with Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal and CD. 
The hypotensive response was reduced in magnitude 
by pre-treatment with antihistamines. However, the 
response was not life-threatening and the dogs 
recovered quickly upon discontinuation of treatment. 
The hemolytic potential of Caelyx and placebo 
liposomes in human blood was assessed in vitro, as 
well as compatibility with human serum and plasma. 
Neither Caelyx nor the empty liposomes caused any 
hemolysis of human red blood cells or any 
coagulation or precipitation of human serum or 
plasma (EMA 2019).

Other toxicity-related information or data  
Overall, the toxicity profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal in animals is similar across 
species, and target organs of toxicity in animals have been predictive of human toxicity.  
Safety concerns relevant to use in humans include cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, 
dermal toxicity (cutaneous lesions) and fetal toxicity. These risks are not included in the 
RMP as important safety concerns as they are considered fully characterized and 
appropriately managed with routine risk minimization measures in the product 
information which are part of standard clinical practice (see Part II, Module SVII).

PART II: MODULE SIII – CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal has been marketed since 17 NOV 1995. It was marketed 
initially by Schering-Plough Ltd (Kenilworth, New Jersey, United States) until January 
2011 when Janssen-Cilag International, N.V. assumed all responsibilities for safety 
reporting, distribution, and marketing worldwide. The application for MA transfer to 
Baxter Holding B.V. in the EEA was approved on 20 AUG 2021. 
The clinical development program included subjects exposed to Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal in studies conducted by previous MAHs and their partners. The drug product 
was clinically developed by Cilag GmbH (Janssen). Within the clinical development 
program, this compound had also a co-development partner, Merck Sharp & Dohme 
Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Therefore, the presentation of the overall 
cumulative estimate of subjects in the compound development program is a best estimate 
based on the documentation received following MA transfer. An estimated 4,644 subjects 
were exposed to Caelyx pegylated liposomal during clinical development. There are no 
new data with regards to clinical trial exposure since the acquisition of this product by 
Baxter.  
The calculation of cumulative exposure is limited by the unavailability of historical 
clinical trial data. Due to the age of the studies as well as the lack of availability of raw 
data through MA transfers, not all data could be integrated for stratification by duration, 
age/gender, dose or ethnicity. Some data regarding the demographics of clinical trial 
exposure was extracted from final clinical study reports (CSRs). The data from final 
CSRs and the integrated data are presented separately for clarity and transparency.  
Of the 4,644 subjects exposed to Caelyx pegylated liposomal in the clinical development 
program, demographic data was not available for 325 subjects. 
It is important to note this is the first update to the EU-RMP prepared by Baxter since 
version 5.0, submitted in October 2013 by Janssen-Cilag International NV. Therefore, the 
presentation and format of the data and text differ from the previous EU RMP due in part 
to the updated EMA template guidance as well as lack of availability of raw data. The 
tables below outline the information available for clinical trial exposure.

PART II: MODULE SIV – POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
Due to the age of studies, not all exclusion criteria were available or they were limited 
based on information presented in final CSRs. Additionally, the exclusion criteria were 
not applicable to all studies, as they differed depending on the indication and study 
parameters. 
SIV.1 Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development program 
Exclusion criterion: Pregnant or breastfeeding (all studies) 
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No)  
No 
Reason for exclusion 
Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals were 
excluded from the clinical development 
program to avoid harm to the subject. 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is suspected to 
cause serious birth defects when 
administered during pregnancy. It is not 
known whether Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal is excreted in human milk. 
Because many medicinal products, 
including anthracyclines, are excreted in 
human milk, the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants cannot 
be excluded. 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Use of Caelyx pegylated liposomal during 
pregnancy and lactation is discussed in 
the SmPC. Due to the potential for serious 
adverse events, Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal should not be used during 
pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Warning language that mothers must 
discontinue nursing prior to beginning 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment is 
also included in the SmPC. Additionally, 
as stated in the SmPC, women of child-
bearing potential should use effective 
contraceptive measures while being 
treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
and for eight months following 
completion of treatment. Men are 
recommended to use effective 
contraceptive measures and to not father a 
child while receiving Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal and for six months following 
completion of treatment. 
Exclusion criterion: Hypersensitivity to doxorubicin HCl, other components of Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal, or history of hypersensitivity to other anthracyclines (all studies) 
Reason for exclusion 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No) 
Individuals with known hypersensitivity to 
doxorubicin HCl, other components of 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal, or other 
No 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, 
peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients

anthracyclines were excluded from the 
clinical development program to avoid 
harm to the subject.  
of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is a 
labeled contraindication in the SmPC.  
Exclusion criterion: Subjects treated with local therapy or systemic alfa-interferon (studies 
supporting AIDS-related KS indication) 
Reason for exclusion 
Individuals treated with local therapy or 
system alfa-interferon for AIDS-related KS 
were excluded from the clinical 
development program to avoid harm to the 
subject. Local therapy (e.g., injection of 
vincristine into subcutaneous lesions) or 
systemic alfa-interferon plus Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal may cause increased 
toxicity. 
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No) 
No 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Use of Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 
patients with AIDS-related KS that may 
be treated effectively with local therapy 
or systemic alfa-interferon is a labeled 
contraindication in the SmPC. 
Exclusion criterion: Clinically significant cardiac disease or a history or cardiac impairment (all 
studies) 
Reason for exclusion 
Individuals with clinically significant 
cardiac disease or a history of cardiac 
impairment were excluded from the 
clinical development program to avoid 
harm to the subject. Cardiac toxicity is 
known side effect of anthracycline 
treatment.  
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No) 
No 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Baxter does not anticipate the safety 
profile to differ from that characterized so 
far in this patient population, if 
appropriately managed. The SmPC 
contains warning language regarding 
cardiac toxicity with use of this product. 
Additionally, clinical guidance on use of 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal in patients 
with cardiac disease requiring treatment is 
provided. The prescribing clinician must 
consider the benefits and risks of using 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal in each 
individual patient. 
Exclusion criterion: Patients with other clinically significant conditions including: 
•  Malignant disease (except basal or squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the 
cervix) within five years of randomization (studies supporting breast cancer indication) 
•  Abnormal hematological parameters: platelets <100,000, ANC <1,500, or hemoglobin <9 
g/dl (studies supporting breast cancer indication) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
•  Abnormal renal function: creatinine greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal range (studies 
supporting breast cancer indication) or clinically significant kidney disease (studies 
supporting AIDS-related KS and multiple myeloma indications) 
•  Abnormal liver function (studies supporting breast cancer indication) or clinically 
significant liver disease (studies supporting AIDS-related KS and multiple myeloma 
indications) 
•  Uncontrolled systemic infection (studies supporting multiple myeloma, breast cancer and 
ovarian cancer indications) 
•  Uncontrolled diabetes (studies supporting multiple myeloma indication) 
•  Patients with central nervous system involvement (studies supporting multiple myeloma, 
breast cancer and ovarian cancer indications) 
•  Peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher severity as defined by the National Cancer 
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (studies 
supporting multiple myeloma indication) 
•  Active opportunistic infection with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, P. carinii 
or other microorganism if under treatment with myelotoxic drugs (studies supporting 
AIDS-related KS indication) 
Reason for exclusion 
Patients with the above clinically 
significant conditions were excluded from 
the clinical trial development program (as 
described) to prevent further harm to the 
subject. Treatment with Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal could worsen the described 
conditions. Additionally, the above-
described conditions may confound the 
assessment of Caelyx-emergent adverse 
events, and potentially interfere with 
interpretation of study results. 
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No) 
No 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Baxter does not anticipate the safety 
profile to differ from that characterized so 
far in this patient population, if 
appropriately managed. Use of Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal in patients with pre-
existing disease including diabetic 
patients, patients with AIDS, and patients 
with hepatic or renal impairment is 
described in the SmPC. The prescribing 
clinician must consider the benefits and 
risks of using Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
in each individual patient. 
Exclusion criterion: Concomitant treatments including the following: 
•  Treatment with radiation or electron beam therapy within the preceding 3 weeks (studies 
supporting AIDS-related KS indication) 
•  Prior radiotherapy to an area greater than one-third of the skeleton or prior local 
radiotherapy within 1 week of treatment (studies supporting multiple myeloma indication) 
•  Radiation to disease areas within 3 weeks of study treatment initiation (studies supporting 
breast cancer indication) 
•  Prior mediastinal or whole pelvic radiation (studies supporting ovarian cancer indication)

•  Prior neoplasms treated with extensive chemotherapy, which in the investigator's opinion 
had led to an irreversible compromise of bone marrow function (studies supporting AIDS-
related KS indication) 
•  Prior chemotherapy within 28 days of first dose of Doxil (studies supporting breast cancer 
and ovarian cancer indications) or prior chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma  
•  Prior single-agent dexamethasone (or another corticosteroid) to treat multiple myeloma 
•  Treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers from at least 4 
weeks before the first dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal (all studies) 
Is it 
included as 
missing 
information 
in the RMP? 
(Yes/No) 
No 
Rationale if not included as missing 
information 
Baxter does not anticipate the safety 
profile to differ from that characterized so 
far in this patient population, if 
appropriately managed. The SmPC 
provides dose modifications and warning 
language regarding concomitant use of 
medicinal products known to interact with 
standard doxorubicin HCl. The 
prescribing clinician must consider the 
benefits and risks of using Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal in each individual 
patient. 
Reason for exclusion 
Individuals who had the concomitant 
treatments described above were excluded 
from the clinical development program to 
avoid harm to the subject as well as 
prevent interference with interpretation of 
study results. Doxorubicin HCl 
preparations may potentiate the toxicity of 
other anti-cancer therapies (e.g., increased 
risk of cardiac toxicity in patients with 
prior mediastinal irradiation or those 
receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide 
therapy). Prior radiotherapy may also 
result in radiation recall phenomenon upon 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
administration. Further, subjects with these 
treatments may require a Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal dose and monitoring different 
than what was used during the study. 
SIV.2 Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programs 
With an overall exposure of an estimated 4,644 subjects, and varying study parameters 
(e.g., duration of exposure, follow-up after study drug exposure) the clinical development 
program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions, such as rare adverse 
reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure. Though there were limitations in the clinical trial development 
program, it is important to note that the safety profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal has 
been established with over two decades of post-marketing use. The SmPC provides 
warning language regarding adverse reactions that occur with prolonged and cumulative 
exposure.

polymorphisms 
Not included in the clinical trial development program. 
Not included in the clinical trial development program. 
Patients with clinically significant cardiac, hepatic and 
renal disease were not included in the clinical trial 
development program.  
The medical histories (level of hepatic impairment, renal 
impairment and immune status) of the 4,644 subjects 
exposed to Caelyx pegylated liposomal in the clinical 
development program varied. In general, many patients 
treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal had co-
morbidities due to their disease state or baseline 
myelosuppression (due to factors such as pre-existing HIV 
disease, numerous concomitant or previous medications, 
or tumors involving bone marrow). 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is used for treatment of 
multiple conditions and therapy is titrated to effect, so 
different disease severity is accounted for in product 
dosing. 
Racial or ethnic origin was not collected from all clinical 
trials. Of the subjects for which data was collected, 77% 
were White, 5% were Black or African-American, 6% 
were Hispanic/Latino, and 2% were of other racial 
background. 
No race-based efficacy evaluation was performed across 
subjects for whom race was known. 
In study DOXIL-BCA-3001, a pharmacogenomic analysis 
was done on subjects with advanced breast cancer. The 
purpose of the pharmacogenomic analysis was to test 
whether polymorphisms (i.e., g.4812A>C,M35T, H63C, 
S65C, E168Q, and C282Y) in the hemochromatosis gene 
are associated with increased susceptibility to 
doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity when receiving 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal+docetaxel (n=207) vs. 
docetaxel monotherapy only (n=219). No significant 
association (p < 0.05) with any of the genotypes tested 
was found.

SVII.1 Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission 
 The initial RMP was prepared by Schering-Plough; the approval date is unavailable. The 
following safety concerns were included in the initial RMP (version 1.0 issued 01 JUN 
2007):  
Important Potential Risks 
•  Cardiotoxicity 
•  Renal Failure 
•  Interstitial Lung Disease 
SVII.2 New safety concerns and reclassification with submission of an updated 
RMP 
There are no safety concerns included in this RMP; previous safety concerns included in 
version 5.0 of the EU RMP (issued 16 SEP 2013) have been reclassified based on EMA 
GVP Module V Revision 2 guidelines. 
The following have been removed as important identified risks and important potential 
risks with this RMP update, as they are known risks that require no further 
characterization and are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance, namely through 
signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for which the risk minimization 
messages in the product information are adhered to by prescribers (e.g., actions being part 
of standard clinical practice):  
Important identified risks: 
•  Cardiotoxicity 
•  Cutaneous Lesions 
•  Secondary Oral Neoplasms

are known potential risks that are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance, namely 
through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for which the risk 
minimization messages in the product information are sufficient to minimize the risk: 
•  Renal Failure  
•  Foetal Toxicity  
Use in Paediatric Patients has been removed from the list of safety concerns as an item of 
missing information as the safety profile is not expected to differ from that characterized 
so far in this patient population. Use of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is not recommended 
in patients below 18 years of age. However, limited Phase I safety data indicate that 
doses up to 60 mg/m2 every 4 weeks are well tolerated in pediatric patients, though 
effectiveness in patients under 18 years of age has not been established.

Summary of Risk Management Plan for Caelyx pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
hydrochloride) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
2 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion (hereafter Caelyx pegylated liposomal). The 
RMP provides details on the important risks of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, how these 
risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about the important 
risks.  
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL) for Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal provide essential information to healthcare professionals and 
patients on how Caelyx pegylated liposomal should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Caelyx pegylated liposomal should be read in the context 
of all other related information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its 
plain-language summary, all of which are part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR).  
New safety concerns and/or changes to the current safety concerns will be included in 
future updates of the RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal is authorized for monotherapy for patients with metastatic 
breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac risk, for treatment of advanced ovarian 
cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, in 
combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or 
are unsuitable for bone marrow transplant, and for treatment of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low Cluster 
of Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts (< 200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive 
mucocutaneous or visceral disease; refer to the SmPC for complete indication wording. It 
contains pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride as the active substance, and it is 
given intravenously. 
Further information about the evaluation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal’s benefits can be 
found in the EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website under the medicine’s webpage: <>. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 6.3 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks 
There are no important risks included in the RMP for Caelyx pegylated liposomal; 
however, measures to minimize the risks for any medicinal products may be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription). 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of medicinal products are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of medicinal 
products. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of the 
medicinal product is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs to be further monitored. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and further 
information may need to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).  
There are no important risks or missing information included in the RMP for Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zydelig (idelalisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of the catalytic subunit p110δ isoform of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that targets a key pathway implicated in the pathobiology of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Zydelig was approved by the European Commission on 18 
September 2014 as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab. Rituximab is a chimeric anti-
CD20 monoclonal antibody which binds primarily the large extracellular loop of CD20. It is from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 6/94 
 
 
 
 
same class of type I anti-CD20 antibodies as ofatumumab, a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that 
binds to a distinct epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 
molecule. Thus, while both rituximab and ofatumumab bind to CD20, they recognise and bind to 
different epitopes on the CD20 molecule. The binding of rituximab and ofatumumab is thought to 
induce cell death of CD20 positive cells, primarily through complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and less by apoptosis. Type I and type II 
anti-CD20 have different molecular properties and are thought to act through different mechanisms of 
action. While Type I anti-CD20 antibodies, which include rituximab, ofatumumab, ublituxumab, 
ocaratuzumab are insoluble in lipid rafts, and binding to ligand mainly leads to clustering and efficient 
complement -dependent cell death (CDC) and ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity), 
Type II anti-CD20 antibodies, such as tositumomab and obinutuzumab, are found in detergent soluble 
fractions and are thought to act by recruiting effector FcR expressing cells which will then mediate 
ADCC and phagocytosis. 
The combination of idelalisib with rituximab was shown to be superior to rituximab alone for PFS and 
OS in frail patients with advanced CLL. Subjects with cytogenetic factors associated with poor 
prognosis, including 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, also had significant improvement in PFS and 
OS. Hence, the combination of idelalisib + ofatumumab, another anti-CD20 antibody, was investigated 
in study GS-US-312-0119, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of patients treated with idelalisib + ofatumumab compared to ofatumumab 
treatment in previously treated CLL patients. 
Zydelig was approved in the EU for the following indications: 
•  Zydelig is indicated in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL: 
o  who have received at least 1 prior therapy, or 
o  as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients 
unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. 
•  Zydelig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular 
lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to 2 prior lines of treatment. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
•  Zydelig is indicated in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab or 
ofatumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL: 
o  who have received at least 1 prior therapy, or 
o  as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients 
unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was not submitted in the context of this variation. The applicant justified the lack of an ERA as 
the proposed indication is for a new combination within the currently approved CLL patient population. 
Therefore, it is not anticipated that there would be a significant increase in the extent of use and thus, 
unlikely to lead to an increase in environmental exposure.

Page 7/94 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the lack of non-clinical studies in the submission is acceptable as non-clinical 
data for ofatumumab has been characterised since it has been previously approved for a CLL 
indication. In addition, the patient population is a subset of CLL patients as the one already indicated 
with rituximab+ idelalisib. There were no changes made to section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The justification for not submitting an ERA in this application is acceptable as the data suggest that 
there will be no significant increase in environmental exposure to idelalisib as the target population in 
the indication is the same as previously. Hence, idelalisib is not expected to pose an increased risk to 
the environment. The lack of non-clinical studies is considered justified. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As the idelalisib PK profile has been well characterized in Phase 1 studies, limited plasma sampling was 
performed in study GS-US-312-0119. 
Table 1: 
 Idelalisib plasma concentrations following idelalisib 150 mg twice daily in 
combination therapy with ofatumumab  for previously treated CLL subjects –  
Study GS-US-312-0119 
Idelalisib and the major oxidative metabolite GS-563117,  plasma concentrations were comparable to 
each other at predose or 1.5 hours post-dose between Week 3 and Week 24. Mean trough 
concentrations of idelalisib were comparable to those observed in other studies (eg, monotherapy 
Study 101-02).  
The PK of idelalisib and GS-563117, were characterised using post-hoc Bayesian forecasting utilising 
previous knowledge about the population PK.  Resulting parameter estimates were similar to the 
results obtained from the population PK analysis in the original application. 
The impact of various intrinsic factors on idelalisib and GS-563117 exposures was evaluated within the 
framework of the population PK analyses. The factors included age, gender, race, body weight, 
baseline creatinine clearance, AST, ALT, and background treatment. No significant effects of the 
evaluated factors on the PK of idealisib and GS-563117 were identified.  
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Relationship for Efficacy Parameters 
Exposure efficacy analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between idelalisib exposures 
(derived from population PK modeling) and various efficacy endpoints, including change in tumour size 
(sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of index lesions), best overall response, 
duration of response (DOR), PFS, and lymph node response (LNR).  
The analysis did not show a relationship between idelalisib exposure and various efficacy endpoints.  
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Relationship for Safety Parameters 
Idelalisib and GS-563117 (primary metabolite) exposure-safety relationships were evaluated for 
subjects with CLL who received idelalisib 150 mg BID in combination with ofatumumab in Study GS-
US-312-0119 and included laboratory abnormalities of AST and ALT and ≥ Grade 3 AEs including 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016

neutropenia, diarrhoea, skin rash, infection, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and colitis. The analysis did not 
show a relationship between idelalisib/GS-563117 plasma exposures (AUC0-24h and Cmax) and 
analysed safety parameters. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Idelalisib exposures from subjects in Study GS-US-312 0119 with ofatumumab cotreatment were 
comparable to the exposures following idelalisib monotherapy (Study 101-02), indicating the lack of 
effect of ofatumumab coadministration on idelalisib. 
Population PK modeling, assessment of the effect of intrinsic factors and exposure-response analyses 
(efficacy based on idelalisib exposures, safety based on idelalisib and GS-563117 exposures) were 
performed in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL following administration of idelalisib 150 mg BID in 
combination with ofatumumab (Study GS-US-312-0119). The covariates evaluated had no clinically 
relevant effect on idelalisib plasma exposures. No relevant exposure-efficacy or exposure-safety 
relationships were noted. These results are consistent with the results from exposure-efficacy analyses 
reported previously for patients with CLL and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology studies for the combination of idelalisib with ofatumumab in CLL patients show 
consistent findings with data on exposure with idelalisib in combination with rituximab. The studies are 
considered adequate and acceptable to support the proposed indication.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomised with a 2:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups: Group A: idelalisib + 
ofatumumab and Group B: ofatumumab alone.  
Before administration of ofatumumab, subjects were premedicated to reduce the incidence and 
severity of infusion reactions. In Group A, idelalisib was administered together with the premedication 
approximately 30 to 60 minutes before the ofatumumab infusions. For both treatments the first 
infusion of ofatumumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg. At each of Visits 3 through 13, 
subjects on both groups were given the recommended premedications, and ofatumumab was infused 
at a dose of 1000 mg (Group A) or 2000 mg (Group B).  
Idelalisib was taken orally, twice daily, continuously. Tablets of 150-mg were used for initial therapy; 
the 100-mg tablets were provided for use by those subjects who required a dose reduction.

Sample size 
Based on data from the Phase 2 pivotal study of ofatumumab and considering the population of 
subjects to be enrolled in this study, it was assumed that administration of ofatumumab to subjects 
with previously treated CLL in the ofatumumab single-agent group of this study would result in a 
median PFS of approximately 8 months. 
An improvement in median PFS from 8 months to 14 months due to the addition of idelalisib to 
ofatumumab in Group A of the study corresponded to a benefit ratio of 1.75 (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57). 
It was assumed that PFS times were exponentially distributed in each of the 2 groups. With a HR equal 
to 1 under the null hypothesis of no difference between the 2 treatment groups and a HR of 0.57 under 
the alternative hypothesis of superiority of the idelalisib–containing combination, 129 events (definitive 
CLL progressions or deaths) were required to achieve a power of approximately 0.85 based on a log-
rank test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Further assumptions included a planned accrual 
period of 12 months (with approximately half of the subjects enrolled during the initial 60% of the 
accrual period, and the remaining half of the subjects enrolled during the last 40% of the accrual 
period); a minimum follow-up period of 12 months; and an expectation that 10% of subjects would be 
lost to follow-up (5% during the accrual period and 5% during the follow-up period). 
Given these assumptions, in order to ensure that the primary analysis on PFS would be performed 
before or at the planned minimum 12-month follow-up period, approximately 170 subjects were to be 
enrolled into the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and approximately 85 subjects were to be enrolled 
into the ofatumumab single-agent group. Based on this, the expected number of events would be 
achieved by the end of the planned minimum 12-month follow-up period. It was expected that there 
would be approximately 65 deaths at the time of final analysis. This provided approximately 85% 
power to detect a HR of 0.45 for OS based on a log-rank test at 2-sided alpha level of 0.03. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either of the following treatment assignments: 
Group A: idelalisib + ofatumumab (1000-mg dosing regimen) 
Group B: ofatumumab alone (2000-mg dosing regimen) 
A fixed-block centralised randomisation allocated subjects within the 8 strata as defined by the 
intersection of the following 3 binary stratification factors:

•  17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation in CLL cells: either versus neither (or indeterminate)  
• 
IGHV mutation: unmutated (or IGHV3-21) versus mutated (or indeterminate) 
•  Disease status: refractory (CLL progression < 6 months from completion of prior therapy) 
versus relapsed (CLL progression ≥6 months from completion of prior therapy) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint analysis served as the gatekeeper for the secondary endpoint analyses, ie, the 
primary efficacy hypothesis (the null hypothesis) was to be rejected at the 2-sided significance level 
before the efficacy hypotheses for the secondary efficacy endpoints could be evaluated. If the primary 
hypothesis was rejected at either an interim or final analysis, the 5 secondary endpoints were to be 
sequentially tested at the 2-sided significance level of 0.03 in the order listed above. The significance 
level was chosen in such a way that the overall Type I error rate of testing primary and secondary 
endpoints was preserved at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. If a null hypothesis was not rejected, 
formal sequential testing was to be stopped and only nominal significance would be cited for the 
remaining secondary endpoints.  
Two formal interim efficacy analyses were planned after approximately 50% and 75% of the PFS 
events had occurred. 
Table 2: 
Expected Number of Events at Interim and Final Analyses and Significance 
Levels to Reject H0 
By the date projected for the first interim analysis, when 50% of [the expected 129] PFS events were 
estimated to have occurred, the actual number of PFS events approached the number of PFS events 
targeted for the second interim (75% PFS events). The first interim analysis was conducted at this 
point at a significance level of 0.018, and a decision was made to continue the study until the final 
analysis. There was no second interim analysis. The primary efficacy analysis reported was the planned 
final analyses based on approximately 129 PFS events. 
Descriptive statistics were provided for TTR. DOR was summarized using KM methods (medians, Q1, 
Q3, and corresponding 95% CIs) and a plot of the KM curves for DOR was provided by treatment 
group. 
The best percent change in SPD from baseline during the study was summarised using descriptive 
statistics. 
Differences between treatment groups for splenomegaly response rate, hepatomegaly response rate, 
ALC response rate, platelet response rate, hemoglobin response rate, and neutrophil response rate 
were compared using CMH Chi-square tests after adjusting for stratification factors. For all analyses, 
odds ratios and the corresponding 95% CIs were presented.

Patient disposition is displayed in Table 3. 
Table 3: 
Disposition of Subjects - Study GS-US-312-0119 (ITT analysis) 
Recruitment 
The first subject was screened on 04 December 2012 and the last subject observation for the interim 
report was on 15 January 2015. The study was conducted in 81 sites in the United States, Canada, 
Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Australia. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (Version 1.0) had 6 updates. The main changes were as follows:  
In the 1st amendment (09-NOV-2012) a new section was added to differentiate discontinuation from 
study versus discontinuation of drug. 
The 2nd amendment (13-OCT-2013) increased planned sample size to 255 and removed AEs as a 
reason for discontinuation from study. 
The 5th amendment (26-SEP-2014) added the secondary objective to evaluate the effect of the 
addition of idelalisib to ofatumumab on the onset, magnitude, and duration of tumor control for 
subjects with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation.

Protocol deviations 
A list of the main protocol deviations are presented below. The most common type of major protocol 
deviation was stratification error. The primary type of stratification error was incorrect reporting of 
disease status (refractory vs relapsed) at enrollment. These errors were corrected during database 
cleaning, but after the subjects had already been assigned to treatment groups based on the stratum 
designated at enrollment. The primary efficacy analyses were performed by corrected stratum.

Numbers analysed 
The Intent-to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included data from all subjects who were randomised regardless 
of whether subjects received any study drugs, or received a different regimen from that to which they 
were randomised. Treatment assignment was designated according to randomisation. This analysis set 
was used in the analyses of subject characteristics, PFS, ORR, OS, LNR, CR rate, and health outcomes 
variables. The analysis of PFS based on the ITT Analysis Set was considered the primary analysis of 
the study. 
A Safety Analysis Set included data from subjects who received ≥1 dose of study treatment, with 
treatment assignments designated according to the actual treatment received. 
The PK Analysis Set included data from subjects in the Safety Analysis Set who had the necessary 
baseline and on-study measurements to provide interpretable PK results.

FACT-Leu Questionnaire Results 
Mean (standard error of the mean, SEM) scores for the Additional Concerns, FACT Total Subscale, and 
the Trial Outcome Index were presented. In both treatment groups, postbaseline scores higher than 
baseline scores were observed; however, subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group consistently 
showed greater symptom improvement than those in the ofatumumab alone group at each timepoint 
throughout the first 48 weeks of the study. Beyond Week 48, the number of subjects evaluated 
becomes too small for meaningful comparison. 
Subjects treated with idelalisib + ofatumumab reached the MID for Additional Concerns (ie, 5-point 
improvement) at Week 4 (median change from baseline) and their improvement was generally 
sustained through Week 36, whereas subjects in the ofatumumab alone group reached the MID from 
Week 6 to Week 8 but had median values below the MID thereafter. In the mixed-effects model 
analysis of the changes from baseline, the main effect of treatment was statistically significant for the 
Total score, Trial Outcome Index score, and Additional Concerns subscale score (p = 0.0043, 0.0042, 
and 0.0016, respectively).

Influence of Discontinuation Rates on Efficacy Endpoints 
A summary of study duration for the ITT Analysis Set is shown in Table 20. Median study duration was 
over twice as long in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group (13.6 months) compared to the ofatumumab 
alone group (5.8 months). The discontinuation rate without a PFS event was 13.2% (23 subjects 
[including 2 subjects who missed ≥2 consecutive tumor measurements]) in the idelalisib + 
ofatumumab group and 33.3% (29 subjects) in the ofatumumab alone group. 
A Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to discontinuation from study is shown in Figure 11.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
GS-US-312-0119, a Phase 3 randomised open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in previously treated CLL patients was initiated on 4 
December 2012, and ran almost parallel to the other Phase 3 study GS-US-312-0116 which was 
initiated on 01 May 2012. Both studies were conducted in patients with previously treated CLL and 
randomised between treatment with idelalisib in combination with either rituximab (GS-US-312-0116) 
or ofatumumab (GS-US-312-0119) and their respective monotherapy controls.  
 A total of 261 subjects in study GS-US-312-0119 were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (174 to the idelalisib 
+ ofatumumab group, 87 to the ofatumumab alone group). There were 261 subjects included in the 
ITT Analysis Set, and 259 subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set.  
A total of 173 subjects received treatment with idelalisib + ofatumumab. At the time of the interim 
analysis (the final analysis for PFS), 43.1% (75 subjects) of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group were 
continuing idelalisib treatment, 43.7% (76 subjects) were not continuing treatment due to meeting the 
primary endpoint, and 12.1% (21 subjects) had discontinued treatment for other reasons. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 43/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Investigators cited AEs as the reason for discontinuation from treatment in 29.3% (51 subjects) in the 
idelalisib + ofatumumab group.  
Of subjects reported by the investigator to have discontinued the study without an event, 20/34 in the 
idelalisib + ofatumumab arm and 7/34 in the ofatumumab arm were (later) assessed to have had an 
event (most likely PD) by the IRC.  
Of the 87 patients allocated to the ofatumumab arm, 6 (6.9%) were still ongoing, 47 (54%) were not 
continuing treatment due to meeting the primary endpoint, and 34 (39.1%) had discontinued 
treatment for other reasons. 
In both treatment groups, the primary reasons for discontinuation were physician decision (10.0% [19 
subjects] of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 18.4% [16 subjects] of the ofatumumab alone 
group) followed by withdrawal by subject (6.9% [12 subjects] of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group 
and 16.1% [14 subjects] of the ofatumumab alone group). Median study duration was over twice as 
long in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group (13.6 months) compared to the ofatumumab alone group 
(5.8 months). 
Overall, demographics and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, BMI) were generally comparable 
between the 2 treatment groups. Most subjects (64.0%) were ≥  65 years of age, with a median (Q1, 
Q3) age of 68 (61, 74) years, and an age range of 36 to 85 years. Most subjects (71.3%) were male 
and most were white (84.3%). Almost all subjects (226 subjects; 86.6%) had a reduced Karnofsky 
Performance Status. Median time since diagnosis was 7.7 (4.8, 10.8) years. At study screening, most 
subjects had advanced disease, with 63.6% Rai Stage III or IV and 58.2% Binet Stage C. Disease 
characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. In the total population, 55.2% of subjects 
had platelet counts < 100 × 109/L at screening, 47% had hemoglobin < 11 g/dL, and 22.4% had ANC 
< 1.5 × 109/L; the median (Q1, Q3) CIRS score at screening was 4.0 (2.0, 7.0). The strata of 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation and IGHV mutation status were well-balanced between treatment 
groups. Median number of prior treatments was 3.0 in each arm with a range of 1 to 11. The most 
frequent prior treatments were bendamustine + rituximab (29%), fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + 
rituximab (22%) and fludarabine + rituximab (5.4%), and treatment groups were balanced with 
respect to the incidence and type of prior CLL regimens. 
Due to a stratification error (see section on conduct of the study – protocol deviations), a lower 
percentage of refractory subjects (47.1% v. 54.0) was enrolled of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group 
as compared with the ofatumumab alone group. The primary efficacy analyses presented in this report 
were stratified according to this factor. 
The dose of ofatumumab (1000 mg/infusion) used in combination with idelalisib (Group A) in Study 
GS-US-312-0119 was supported by previously reported nonclinical target-saturation data and clinical 
data for ofatumumab when administered to subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL in combination with 
bendamustine, lenalidomide and other agents. The dose of ofatumumab as a single agent (2000 
mg/infusion) (Group B) is consistent with the approved dosing regimen for patients with refractory 
CLL. 
Thus, the doses of ofatumumab were different in the 2 treatment arms. This is unlike the GS-US-312-
0116 study, where subjects were randomised between idelalisib + rituximab or rituximab only. In that 
study, both treatment arms were administered 8 infusions of rituximab (every 2 weeks for 4 infusions 
and every 4 weeks for a further 4 infusions). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 44/94 
 
 
 
 
The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on the ITT Analysis Set and stratified by 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation, IGHV mutation, and disease status. With an overall event rate of 
~50%, a total of 43.7% (76 subjects) of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 62.1% (54 subjects) 
of the ofatumumab alone group experienced a PFS event, with an adjusted HR (95% CI) of 0.27 (0.19, 
0.39) and 2-sided p-value of < 0.0001 based on a stratified log-rank test. The median PFS (95% CI) 
was 16.3 (13.6, 17.8) months for subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 8.0 (5.7, 8.2) 
months for subjects in the ofatumumab alone group. Although the data are not yet mature, it seems 
unlikely that the difference in PFS between the arms will undergo any dramatic change. There are few 
remaining subjects as a high number of patients discontinued without event. Therefore, a substantial 
change to the median PFS in the control arm seems unlikely. 
The PFS advantage for the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm seems not to be dependent on the presence 
or absence of del17p/TP53-mutation. Based on the IRC assessment (ITT Analysis Set), the ORR 
(classified as CR or PR) (95% CI) was 75.3% (68.2%, 81.5%) for the idelalisib + ofatumumab group 
and 18.4% (10.9%, 28.1%) for the ofatumumab alone group. The odds ratio (95% CI) for the ORR 
was 15.94 (7.8, 32.58), which favored idelalisib + ofatumumab compared with ofatumumab alone (p 
< 0.0001). Only 1 patient achieved a CR in the study. 
The primary OS analysis was performed using the ITT Analysis Set. As of the data cutoff date, a total 
of 64 subjects had died (42 subjects [24.1%] in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 22 subjects 
[25.3%] in the ofatumumab alone group). The adjusted HR (95% CI) for OS was 0.74 (0.44, 1.24); p 
= 0.27. Therefore, no significant differences were found between the 2 treatment arms of the 
idelalisib-ofatumumab study. This is in contrast with the GS-US-312-0116 study where the adjusted 
HR between the arms was 0.34 with a p-value of 0.0001 using a stratified log-rank test. Subgroup 
analyses showed a great consistency between all subgroups of high risk prognostic markers (17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation (either/neither), mutated IGHV, unmutated IGHV, 17p deletion/no 
deletion). The CHMP raised this as a concern, and whether informative censoring or other factors may 
have contributed to the negative results observed with OS in study GS-US-312-0119.  
The MAH provided several additional analyses  aiming to explore whether informative censoring or 
other factors may have contributed to the negative results observed with OS in study GS-US-312-
0119. These analyses showed that the disproportionate number of discontinued patients in the two 
treatment arms (39.1% in the ofatumumab alone group vs 19.5% in the idelalisib+ofatumumab 
group) could have undermined the integrity of this analysis and that the lack of statistically significant 
result in OS might be, at least partly, explained by a larger proportion of subjects in the control arm 
discontinuing treatment early and receiving rescue therapy (with eg BCR inhibitors) after a progressive 
disease event or after discontinuing without an event. It is likely that many subjects in the control arm 
who discontinued the open-labeled study GS-US-312-0119, which started approximately half a year 
after placebo-controlled study GS-US-312-0116, had subsequent access to idelalisib or other novel CLL 
therapies, confounding the OS analysis in this study. In addition, a direct comparison between the two 
studies is complicated by the different lengths of follow-up. This might have been partly overcome had 
the MAH submitted data from the extension study GS-US-312-0117 (a follow-up to GS-US-312-0116). 
Nonetheless, the CHMP was reassured that the robust PFS data from study GS-US-312-0119, which is 
similar and comparable to that observed in the controlled and blinded study GS-US-312-0116, 
provided sufficient evidence of a clinically relevant benefit in CLL patients.  
Results for the HRQoL measures (mean scores for the Additional Concerns, FACT Total Subscale, and 
the Trial Outcome Index) showed that the idelalisib + ofatumumab group consistently showed greater 
symptom improvement than those in the ofatumumab alone group at each timepoint throughout the 
first 48 weeks of the study. However, there is a risk for bias in HRQoL assessments in an open-label 
Assessment report

study. This would concern especially the results from FACT-Leu and the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS. Therefore, 
no clear conclusion can be drawn on the HRQoL data.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of the combination of idelalisib with ofatumumab has been shown in terms of an 
advantange of 8 months in PFS in study GS-US-312-0119 which was statistically significant and 
clinically important and seems robust, although the overall event rate is still not mature at around 
50%. The higher efficacy of idelalisib + ofatumumab appears consistent in all subgroups including 
notably patients with high-risk prognostic features such as del 17p/TP53-mutations and those with 
unmutated IgHV-chains.  
No difference in OS between the 2 treatment arms was seen in the study. This is in contrast with the 
almost parallel study GS-US-312-0116 where idelalisib + rituximab was compared with placebo + 
rituximab, and where the KM estimate of OS indicated a clearly significant advantage of the idelalisib + 
rituximab arm.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Clinical safety of idelalisib was evaluated in the pivotal Study GS-US-312-0119 in subjects with 
previously treated CLL. All safety analyses were performed using the safety population, defined as all 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, in accordance with the study-specific statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Safety data from the pivotal study are supported by data from the randomised, placebo-controlled

Patient exposure 
Of the 261 subjects randomised in the study, 259 received at least 1 dose of idelalisib or ofatumumab 
and were evaluable for safety. All 261 subjects correctly received the treatment to which they were 
assigned during randomization.  
The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure to idelalisib in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group was 12.3 
(6.8, 16.1) months, with a range of 0.2 to 23.9 months (Table 30). The median (Q1, Q3) duration of 
exposure to ofatumumab was 5.3 (5.3, 5.4) months in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and was 4.2 
(1.6, 5.3) months in the ofatumumab alone group.

Prevalence of Adverse Events of Interest by Time Interval (Safety Analysis 
Set) - Study GS-US-312-0119 
Diarrhoea/Colitis 
Diarrhoea has been previously observed with idelalisib in clinical studies, and cases of ≥Grade 3 
diarrhoea and or colitis have been reported. In the majority of such cases, regardless of the PT 
reported, subjects presented after several months of idelalisib administration with several weeks of 
high-volume watery diarrhoea poorly responsive to antidiarrhoeals or to empiric treatment with 
antimicrobials. Of the 35 subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group, 21 subjects were rechallenged 
with idelalisib after dose interruption; 10 of these had successful rechallenge at a reduced dose or that 
starting dose, and 11 had recurrence of the event after rechallenge. The median (Q1, Q3) time to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 57/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
onset of the first Grade 3 event of diarrhoea/colitis (N = 35) was 30.1 (11.9, 48.4) weeks, and the 
median (Q1, Q3) time to resolution of highest grade diarrhoea/colitis (N = 29) was 1.7 (1.1, 4.4) 
weeks. Eleven subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group discontinued idelalisib due to diarrhoea 
and 3 others discontinued due to colitis; the events resolved following study drug discontinuation and 
prior to the database cutoff date for this report in 10 of these 14 subjects. No deaths due to diarrhoea 
or colitis were reported. 
Rash 
Rash was defined per Gilead Medical Search Term (MST), including dermatitis exfoliative, drug 
eruption, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash macular, rash maculo papular, rash papular, 
rash prutitic, rash morbiliform, and exfoliative rash. Through the database cutoff date, 28.3% (49 
subjects) of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group had rash (per MST) of any grade, and 4.0% (7 
subjects) had rash MST of Grade 3 in severity. In the ofatumumab group, 10.5% (9 subjects) had 
rash, and the event was of Grade 3 severity in 2.3% (2 subjects). The median (Q1, Q3) time to onset 
of the first Grade 3 event of rash MST (N = 7) was 10.9 (5.7, 47.1) weeks in the idelalisib + 
ofatumumab group; in the 2 subjects with Grade 3 rash MST in the ofatumumab alone group, the 
times to onset were 0.1 and 3.0 weeks. 
There were no Grade 4 (ie, life-threatening) events of rash in either treatment group. In the idelalisib 
+ ofatumumab group, 3 subjects (1.7%) discontinued idelalisib due to 1 of the rash MST terms.  
Pneumonitis 
Pneumonitis has been reported previously in subjects who have received idelalisib. Through the 
database cutoff date for this report, 6.4% (11 subjects) of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group had 
pneumonitis of any grade (including 1 subject, Subject
, with the verbatim term 
“interstitial pneumonitis” [Grade 2] that was coded to the PT “interstitial lung disease” per MedDRA 
coding convention, and 4.6% (8 subjects) had pneumonitis of ≥Grade 3 in severity. In the 
ofatumumab group, no subjects had pneumonitis. 
Five subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group discontinued idelalisib due to pneumonitis and the 
events resolved following study drug discontinuation and prior to the database cutoff date for this 
report in 2 of these 5 subjects. 
Overall, there was 1 death due to pneumonitis in a subject (Subject 
) with history of 
emphysema and past chemoimmunotherapy including chlorambucil, fludarabine, bendamustine and 
rituximab who was initially admitted for treatment of chest x-ray findings of bilateral lower lobe 
pneumonia. 
Pneumonia 
For the purposes of this analysis, “pneumonia” included the PTs pneumonia, lung infection, lung 
infiltration, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pneumonia legionella, lung infection pseudomonal, 
pneumonia fungal, respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, and lower respiratory 
tract infection bacterial. Through the database cutoff date, 24.9% (43 subjects) of the idelalisib + 
ofatumumab group had an AE of pneumonia (any grade), and 17.9% (31 subjects) had events that 
were ≥Grade 3 in severity (26 subjects with Grade 3, 4 subjects with Grade 4, and 1 subject with 
Grade 5). In the ofatumumab group, 17.4% (15 subjects) had pneumonia of any grade, and 10.5% (9 
subjects had events that were ≥Grade 3 in severity (7 subjects with Grade 3 and 2 subjects with 
Grade 5). The median (Q1, Q3) time to onset of the first ≥Grade 3 event of pneumonia was 17.6 (4.1, 
33.1) weeks in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group (N = 31) and was 7.6 (1.9, 16.9) weeks in the 
ofatumumab alone group.

Seven subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group discontinued study drug due to pneumonia. 
Bowel Perforations 
Bowel perforations have been reported in a few subjects who have received idelalisib in other clinical 
trials. Through the database cutoff date for this report, 1 subject (0.6%) in the idelalisib + 
ofatumumab group had an AE of large intestine perforation, compared with no subjects in the 
ofatumumab alone group. This subject died of septic shock secondary to intestinal tumor perforation, 
as an autopsy revealed a perforated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the large intestine. 
Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis has been reported previously in a few subjects who have received idelalisib in other 
clinical trials. Through the database cutoff, events in the HLT of anaphylactic responses were reported 
for no subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group, compared with 1 subject (1.2%) of the 
ofatumumab alone group. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
PML has been reported previously in Study GS-US-312-0116, in 1 subject who received idelalisib in 
combination with rituximab. In Study GS-US-312-0119 through the database cutoff date, no subjects 
in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group had an AE of PML, compared with 2 subjects (2.3%) of the 
ofatumumab alone group.

were ~55% and 50 % in the experimental and control arm, respectively. The most common event 
resulting in ofatumumab delay was infusion-related reaction, occurring in 10.4% (18 subjects) of the 
idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 23.3% (20 subjects) of the ofatumumab alone group. Neutropenia 
was the second most common reason (12.1% [21 subjects] of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 
4.7% [4 subjects] of the ofatumumab alone group), followed by pneumonia (1.7% [3 subjects] of the 
idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 8.1% [7 subjects] of the ofatumumab alone group). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As the treatment duration with ofatumumab was limited to ~5 months, whereas idelalisib was dosed 
continuously, there is an imbalance in the exposure time observed between the two treatments and 
hence, the adjustment to exposure time does not seem to be justified. In addition, the dose of 
ofatumumab in the control arm was higher (2000 mg per infusion except for the first infusion of 300 
mg in both arms) as compared to the experimental arm (idelalisib + ofatumumab 1000 mg), which 
affects comparability of the 2 arms and compromises attribution of causal relations to safety events. 
In general, the safety findings of idelalisib combined with ofatumumab in study GS-US-312-0119 seem 
to be consistent with the previously known safety profile of idelalisib, both in monotherapy and when 
combined with rituximab in previously treated CLL patients. Elevations in hepatic transaminases are 
among the most frequent AEs encountered but are generally moderate and most often self-limiting, 
without necessitating interruption of treatment. Severe cases of drug-induced liver toxicity, fulfilling 
Hy’s law, are as yet rarely reported. Other AEs that are frequently reported during idelalisib treatment 
include diarrhoea, rash, pneumonitis and infections eg pneumonia. These AEs are often more severe 
and require dose interruption, dose reductions, and sometimes permanent discontinuation of idelalisib.

The incidence of infections could be related to neutropenia, which is often reported in CLL patients 
treated with idelalisib.  
A higher frequency of on study deaths due to causes other than progressive disease 27/173 (15.6%) 
in the idelalisib+ofatumumab arm vs 5/86 (5.8%) and a higher rate of deaths due to TEAEs (12.7% vs 
7.0%) was observed and raised some concern. The CHMP requested the MAH to present all TEAEs 
leading to death, in relation to time on treatment and in relation to which treatment was being 
received at the time of death. The MAH presented several analyses with study GS-US-312-0119 and 
pooled with study GS-US-312-0116 and for TEAEs leading to death and cardiac-related TEAEs leading 
to death (15 January 2015 data cut). The data showed no consistent safety signals with regard to 
TEAEs leading to death and cardiac-related events leading to death have emerged on analysis of the 
idelalisib clinical development program. 
Rituximab and ofatumumab have not yet been directly compared in clinical studies in CLL and their 
relative tolerability/toxicity has not been evaluated. Tolerability of the combined regimen in this study 
does appear somewhat more limited than that in study GS-US-312-0119 (eg. discontinuation of 
idelalisib in this study was 30.6% compared to 17.3% in study GS-US-312-0116), but comparisons are 
hampered by the different length of follow-up. The MAH presented data comparing the incidence of the 
key safety findings in the 2 studies but no important differences were observed.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new ADRs have been reported in study GS-US-312-0119 with the combination of 
idelalisib+ofatumumab. The ADRs and frequency reported were comparable with what has been 
previously described and were considered well tolerated and manageable. Therefore, the safety and 
tolerability of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab is considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting 
from emerging from post-marketing data 
During the decision making process, the European Commission (EC) was informed of new safety data 
from ongoing clinical trials of an increased risk of death and higher incidence of serious adverse events 
(SAE) among subjects receiving idelalisib compared to the control groups. This important safety 
signals had been observed in three clinical trials by the Independent Safety Data Monitoring group 
overseeing the studies. The trials evaluated treatment combinations with chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy which are currently not authorised for Zydelig (idelalisib) in populations with earlier 
disease characteristics than the currently approved indication. However, in light of the emerging safety 
data, the EC considered that the findings from the clinical trials and all available safety data related to 
idelalisib should be reviewed in order to assess their potential impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
Zydelig in the approved indications and relevant ongoing variations. 
Therefore, on 11 March 2016, the EC triggered a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the impact of 
the above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of Zydelig (idelalisib) and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or 
revoked. 
The MAH submitted data from all relevant clinical studies, including the pivotal studies supporting the 
initial marketing authorisation and extension of indication in combination with ofatumumab as well as 
studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of idelalisib in new treatment combinations and/or study 
populations (including studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125). Some of

these studies were completed and a final or interim (including completed primary analysis) clinical 
study report (CSR) was available while for the three most recent the data was interim and therefore 
limited analyses were available. Temporary measures such as not to initiate idelalisib treatment and 
provisional risk minimisation measures, update posology and warnings were agreed in the meantime 
(EC decision 23 March 2016) while the assessment of the emergent safety information was ongoing.

In study GS-US-312-0123 there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment 
groups for PFS, best overall response or OS in previously untreated CLL subjects with 17p deletion 
and/or TP53 mutation. However, the immaturity of the data and small number of patients are noted as 
a plausible reason for the lack of observed benefit. Although the dataset for first line patients with 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation is too limited to draw direct conclusions, the overall assessment does 
not challenge the extrapolation of the benefits observed in relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation to treatment naïve patients, for idelalisib in combination with rituximab or 
ofatumumab.  
Nevertheless, in view of the limited data available in this subset and considering availability of other 
options for first line treatment for CLL patients, the PRAC was of the view that as a precaution, 
idelalisib should only be used in patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation if they are not eligible for 
any other therapies. 
Safety aspects 
Serious infections and deaths 
Interim results showed an increase in incidence of deaths and AE leading to deaths in the idelalisib 
arms compared to placebo for each of the studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-
0125.

In the pooled data from the three studies, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to 
death in the idelalisib and placebo arms was predominantly in the system organ class of infections and 
infestations (2.0% vs 0.7%) and respiratory disorders (1.2% vs 0%).   
Due to the first line setting of CLL studies GS-US-312-0123 and 101-08, time since diagnosis was 
shorter in these patients (see table 3). For iNHL studies, time since initial diagnosis was comparable 
between treatment and control arms within studies and also across studies. The median number of 
prior regimens was similar in studies GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125 and higher in study 101-
09 (see table 3). 
In study GS-US-312-0123 the causes of death for 9 of the 12 subjects (75%) on the idelalisib plus 
bendamustine and rituximab arm were events either directly reported as infectious events (including 
one case of CMV sepsis and one PJP associated with cardiopulmonary failure) or associated with 
infection, compared with 2 of 11 subjects (18.2%) on the idelalisib plus rituximab arm in study GS-US-
313-0124 and 15 of 28 subjects (53.6%) on the idelalisib plus bendamustine and rituximab arm in 
study GS-US-313-0125 (including two cases of PJP). In the cases where the cause of death was not 
associated with infectious aetiologies, it mainly consisted of progressive disease. There was a notable 
difference in the rates of infection between treatment arm and control arm in study GS-US-313-0124, 
which was also seen, albeit to a lesser extent, in study GS-US-313-0125.  
In CLL studies, GS-US-312-0116, GS-US-312-0119 and GS-US-312-0115 PJP accounted respectively 
for 5-12 % and 0-4% of serious infection cases in the idelalisib and control arms respectively and 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) accounted for 0% of the serious infection cases in studies GS-US-312-0116 
and GS-US-312-0119 and 7.2% and 6.1% in the idelalisib and control arms of study GS-US-312-0115, 
respectively. In iNHL studies, PJP cases accounted for 3-10% and CMV for 6-8% of the serious 
infection cases in the idelalisib arms and both accounted for 0% of serious infection case in the control 
arms. 
Death rates in the single arm study 101-08 were comparable to those observed in the front line setting 
treatment arm (6.3% and 4.9% in cohort 1 and 2, respectively). Whilst all deaths in study GS-US-312-
0116 occurred during treatment, a very large proportion of deaths in study GS-US-312-0119 and GS-
US-312-0115 occurred during long term follow-up (12.1% and 9.2% respectively). Broken down by 
time periods ≤1, >1-≤2, >2-≤3, >3-≤6 and >6 months and adjusted for the number of patients at 
risk, the death rates for each periods in first line CLL were 1.9%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 2.1% and 1.5% 
respectively compared to 1.9%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 3.0% and 19.7%, respectively in relapsed/refractory 
patients. 
There was no apparent relationship between treatment duration and risk of infectious SAE. 
The PRAC reviewed the safety data from studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and 
GS-US-313-0125 in the context of the results from other studies. The infectious SAE rate in 
the idelalisib + rituximab + bendamustine arm in treatment naïve patients was comparable 
or slightly lower than rates in the relapsed/refractory CLL studies where idelalisib was 
administered in combination with rituximab, ofatumumab or rituximab and bendamustine. 
However, it was noted that the rate of infectious SAEs in the control arms the studies 
presented was much lower compared to that in the other previous CLL studies. Analyses 
suggest that treatment with idelalisib in CLL versus placebo in combination with rituximab, 
ofatumumab or bendamustine and rituximab, results in a higher incidence of early infections 
across all quartiles of treatment-free intervals. There was no clear relationship between risk 
of infection and deaths and number of prior therapies or time off treatment prior to idelalisib 
initiation or between first line and relapsed/refractory patients.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 73/94 
 
 
 
 
The PRAC considered that risk minimisation measures were warranted in order to bring the 
use in clinical practice closer to that in the clinical trials where a positive benefit-risk was 
observed. Patients should not start taking idelalisib in case of systemic bacterial, fungal or 
viral infection and that patients should be monitored for respiratory signs and symptoms 
throughout treatment and advised to report promptly any new respiratory symptoms. 
Further, as neutropenia leads to a higher risk of infection and infections were reported from 
the first month in the study, in line with measures applied in clinical trials and as 
implemented in the provisional measures, blood counts should be monitored every two 
weeks during the first six months of treatment. Blood counts monitoring should be 
intensified to weekly in patients with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) below 1,000 per mm3 
and treatment withheld while ANC is below 500 per mm3. Treatment may then be restarted 
at a reduced dose of 100 mg twice daily. In addition, it should be further specified in a 
footnote to the tabulated list of adverse reactions that the serious infections reported 
included opportunistic infections as well as bacterial and viral infections such as pneumonia, 
bronchitis, and sepsis. 
•  Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
An increased incidence of PJP cases was observed in the treatment arms compared to the 
controls in the CLL and iNHL studies. The majority of cases (66% [23/35]) occurred within 
the first 6 months of treatment, however, while more cases occurred during the first 6 
months on treatment, considering the proportion of cases occurring later it was not 
considered appropriate to limit the administration of PJP prophylaxis to this fixed time 
window.   
Overall, there was no clear relationship to treatment duration or number of prior regimen. The PRAC 
was of the view that section 4.4 of the SmPC should advise physicians that prophylaxis for PJP should 
therefore be administered to all patients throughout idelalisib treatment, and for a period of 2 to 
6 months after discontinuation.  The duration of post-treatment prophylaxis should be based on clinical 
judgment and may take into account a patient’s risk factors such as concomitant corticosteroid 
treatment and prolonged neutropenia with a cross reference to section 4.8, where “infection” with the 
frequency “very common” was qualified to mention PJP. Section 4.8 also includes information that PJP 
was amongst the opportunistic infections observed in clinical studies, including after stopping idelalisib 
treatment and that most PJP cases, including fatal cases, occurred in patients that did not receive 
prophylaxis. The PRAC was also of the view that cases of PJP should be closely monitored; to this 
effect a targeted follow up questionnaire has been included in a revised RMP.  The MAH should 
implement these questionnaires and their results should be discussed in future PSURs. 
•  Cytomegaloviral infection 
In relapsed/refractory CLL patients serious CMV infections occurred only in association with 
bendamustine, whilst small numbers of non-serious CMV cases were observed in all studies. 
CMV infections occurred predominantly in the treatment arms of studies evaluating idelalisib 
in combination with both rituximab and bendamustine. The majority of CMV cases (75% 
[39/52]) occurred within the first 6 month of treatment. Similarly as for PJP infection, while 
more cases occurred during the first 6 months of treatment considering the proportion of 
cases also occurring later, it was not considered appropriate to limit the CMV monitoring to 
this fixed period of time. 
Overall, there was no clear relationship to treatment duration or number of prior regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 74/94 
 
 
 
 
 
In the clinical studies, the risk of CMV appears particularly evident in patients administered idelalisib 
and rituximab in combination with bendamustine. While it is acknowledged that the frequency of CMV 
might have been underestimated as symptoms of CMV infection are relatively unspecific and no regular 
screening for CMV (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) was performed in the studies, in patients 
treated with idelalisib in combination with rituximab or ofatumumab in controlled studies (GS-US-312-
0116, GS-US-312-0119 and GS-US-313-0124), the event rate of CMV was low (1%). The SAG advised 
that monitoring was only needed in patients with positive serology at start of treatment with idelalisib. 
This was agreed by the PRAC, which added that patients with other evidence of a history of CMV 
infection should also be monitored. In addition, the SAG considered that patients with increased 
viraemia compared to baseline should be carefully monitored but that idelalisib treatment should be 
continued. If clinical signs of CMV infection occur in these patients, then consideration should be given 
to interrupting idelalisib until the infection has resolved, weighting the need for idelalisib treatment 
against the severity of the CMV symptoms. The PRAC considered these recommendations appropriate. 
The SAG further advised that if the benefits of resuming idelalisib are judged to outweigh the risk, 
consideration should be given to administering pre-emptive CMV therapy. The PRAC considered that 
CMV should be added to further qualify the nature of the serious infections listed as adverse reactions 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC and that it should be further described that these were amongst the 
opportunistic infections reported in the idelalisib arms of clinical studies. The MAH should closely 
monitor cases of CMV and discuss these in detail in future PSURs.  
Conclusion 
The results of study GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125 are 
considered of limited relevance to the benefit-risk balance of idelalisib in the authorised 
indication and to the benefit-risk balance of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in 
CLL patients. 
The PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance in the authorised indications remained 
positive, provided that first line treatment with idelalisib is only used in patients with 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation that are not eligible for any other therapies and that changes are 
implemented in the product information to minimise the risk of serious infections. The PRAC 
considered that these measures should be applied for the use of idelalisib in combination 
with ofatumumab in CLL patients.

The SmPC section 4.2, Posology and method of administration, 
provides instruction for dose modification in the event of 
elevated liver transaminases: 
None 
“Treatment with Zydelig must be withheld in the event of a 
Grade 3 or 4 aminotransferase elevation 
(alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST] > 5 x upper limit of normal [ULN]). Once values have 
returned to Grade 1 or below (ALT/AST ≤ 3 x ULN), treatment 
can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily. 
If the event does not recur, the dose can be re-escalated to 
150 mg twice daily at the discretion of the treating physician.  
If the event recurs, treatment with Zydelig must be withheld 
until the values return to Grade 1 or less, after which re-
initiation at 100 mg twice daily may be considered at the 
discretion of the physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).” 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use, states: 
“Elevations in ALT and AST of Grade 3 and 4 (> 5 x ULN) have 
been observed in clinical studies of idelalisib. These laboratory 
findings were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of 
treatment, were generally asymptomatic, and were reversible 
with dose interruption. Most patients resumed treatment at a 
lower dose without recurrence (see section 4.2). ALT, AST, and 
total bilirubin must be monitored in all patients every 2 weeks 
for the first 3 months of treatment, then as clinically indicated. 
If Grade 2 or higher elevations in ALT and/or AST are 
observed, patients must be monitored weekly until the values 
return to Grade 1 or below.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “transaminase increased” 
as a very common (≥ 10%) adverse drug reaction.

Severe diarrhoea/colitis 
The SmPC section 4.2, Posology and method of administration, 
provides instruction for dose modification in the event of 
diarrhoea: 
None 
Pneumonitis 
“Treatment with Zydelig must be withheld in the event of 
Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea/colitis. Once diarrhoea/colitis has 
returned to Grade 1 or below, treatment can be resumed at 
100 mg twice daily. If diarrhoea/colitis does not recur, the 
dose can be re-escalated to 150 mg twice daily at the 
discretion of the treating physician (see section 4.8).”  
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use, states:  
“Cases of severe drug-related colitis occurred relatively late 
(months) after the start of therapy sometimes with rapid 
aggravation, but resolved within a few weeks with dose 
interruption and additional symptomatic treatment (e.g., anti-
inflammatory agents such as enteric budesonide). 
There is very limited experience from the treatment of patients 
with a history of inflammatory bowel disease.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “Diarrhoea/colitis” as a 
very common (≥ 10%) adverse drug reaction. 
The SmPC, section 4.2, Posology and method of 
administration, states: “Treatment with Zydelig must be 
withheld in the event of suspected pneumonitis. Once 
pneumonitis has resolved and if re-treatment is appropriate, 
resumption of treatment at 100 mg twice daily can be 
considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).” 
The SmPC, section Section 4.4, Special warnings and 
precautions for use, states:  
“Cases of pneumonitis have been reported in clinical studies 
with idelalisib. Patients presenting with serious lung events 
that do not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy 
should be assessed for drug-induced pneumonitis. If 
pneumonitis is suspected, idelalisib should be interrupted and 
the patient treated accordingly. Treatment must be 
discontinued for moderate or severe symptomatic 
pneumonitis.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “pneumonitis” as a

Rash 
The SmPC Section 4.2, Posology and method of administration 
states:  
None 
“Treatment with Zydelig must be withheld in the event of 
Grade 3 or 4 rash. Once rash has returned to Grade 1 or 
below, treatment can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily. If 
rash does not recur, the dose can be re-escalated to 150 mg 
twice daily at the discretion of the treating physician (see 
section 4.8).” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “rash” as a very common 
(≥ 10%) adverse drug reaction (Any Grade) and common (≥ 1 
to <10%) for Grade ≥ 3.  
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, Description of selected 
adverse reactions states:  
“Rash was generally mild to moderate and resulted in 
discontinuation of treatment in 1.7% of subjects. In studies 
312-0116/0117 and 312-0119, rash (reported as dermatitis 
exfoliative, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash 
macular, rash maculopapular, rash papular, rash pruritic, and 
skin disorder) occurred in 28.3% of subjects who received 
idelalisib + an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and 7.7% who 
received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody only. Of these, 
4.9% who received idelalisib + an anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody and 1.0% who received an anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody only had rash of Grade 3, and no subjects had an 
adverse event of Grade 4. Rash typically resolved with 
treatment (e.g., topical and/or oral steroids, diphenhydramine) 
and dose interruption for severe cases (see section 5.3, 
phototoxicity).” 
SJS-TEN 
Text in SmPC:  
None 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use: 
“Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN) with fatal outcomes have been 
reported when idelalisib was administered concomitantly with 
other medicinal products associated with these syndromes. If 
SJS or TEN is suspected, idelalisib should be immediately 
interrupted and the patient treated accordingly.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, Description of selected 
adverse reactions: 
“Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(see section 4.4) 
Rarely, cases of SJS and TEN have occurred when idelalisib 
was administered concomitantly with other medicinal products 
associated with these syndromes (bendamustine, rituximab, 
allopurinol, and amoxicillin). SJS or TEN occurred within one 
month of the medicinal combination and fatal outcomes have 
resulted.”

The SmPC, section 4.4, special warnings and precautions for 
use, states: 
“Serious infections 
Treatment with Zydelig should not be initiated in patients with 
any evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral 
infection.Serious and fatal infections have occurred with 
idelalisib, including opportunistic infections such as 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and cytomegalovirus 
(CMV).  Prophylaxis for PJP should therefore be administered 
to all patients throughout idelalisib treatment, and for a period 
of 2 to 6 months after discontinuation.  The duration of 
post-treatment prophylaxis should be based on clinical 
judgment and may take into account a patient’s risk factors 
such as concomitant corticosteroid treatment and prolonged 
neutropenia (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for respiratory signs and 
symptoms throughout treatment.  Patients should be advised 
to report new respiratory symptoms promptly.Regular clinical 
and laboratory monitoring for CMV infection is recommended 
in patients with positive CMV serology at the start of treatment 
with idelalisib or with other evidence of a history of CMV 
infection.  Patients with CMV viraemia without associated 
clinical signs of CMV infection should be carefully monitored.  
For patients with evidence of CMV viraemia and clinical signs of 
CMV infection, consideration should be given to interrupting 
idelalisib until the infection has resolved.  If the benefits of 
resuming idelalisib are judged to outweigh the risks, 
consideration should be given to administering pre-emptive 
CMV therapy.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “infections (including 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and CMV)” as a very 
common (≥ 10%) adverse drug reaction, and states under 
“Description of selected adverse reactions”: 
“Higher frequencies of infections overall, including Grade 3 and 
4 infections, were observed in the idelalisib arms compared to 
the control arms of idelalisib clinical studies.  Most frequently 
observed were infections in the respiratory system and septic 
events.  In many instances the pathogen was not identified; 
however, both conventional and opportunistic pathogens, 
including PJP and CMV, were among those identified.  Nearly 
all PJP infections, including fatal cases, occurred in the absence 
of PJP prophylaxis.  There have been cases of PJP after stopping 
idelalisib treatment.” 
The SmPC, section 4.1 Therapeutic indications, states:  
Zydelig is indicated in combination with an anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody (rituximab or ofatumumab) for the 
treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL): 
•  who have received at least one prior therapy (see section 
4.4), or 
• 
as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation in patients who are not eligible for any 
other therapies (see section 4.4).

The SmPC Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for 
use states:  
None 
“Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception while taking idelalisib and for 1-month after 
stopping treatment (see section 4.6). Women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method as a second form 
of contraception since it is currently unknown whether 
idelalisib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives.” 
The SmPC Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016  
Page 85/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
states: 
“Women of childbearing potential: Based on findings in 
animals, idelalisib may cause foetal harm. Women should 
avoid becoming pregnant while taking Zydelig, and for up to 
1 month after ending treatment. Therefore, women of 
reproductive potential must use highly effective contraception 
while taking Zydelig and for 1 month after stopping treatment. 
It is currently unknown whether idelalisib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore 
women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier 
method as a second form of contraception. 
Pregnancy: There are no or limited amount of data from the 
use of idelalisib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Zydelig is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential not using contraception.  
Fertility: No human data on the effect of idelalisib on fertility 
are available. Animal studies indicate the potential for harmful 
effects of idelalisib on fertility and foetal development 
(see section 5.3).” 
Section 5.3, Preclinical safety data states under “Reproductive 
and Developmental Toxicity”: 
“In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, increased 
post-implantation loss, malformations (absence of caudal 
vertebrae and in some cases also of sacral vertebrae), skeletal 
variations and lower foetal body weights were observed. 
Malformations were observed at exposures from 12 times the 
human exposure based on AUC. Effects on embryo-foetal 
development were not investigated in a second species.  
Degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the testes was 
observed in 2- to 13-week repeated dose studies in dogs and 
rats, but not in studies of 26 weeks and longer duration. In a 
rat male fertility study, decreases in epididymides and testes 
weight were observed but no adverse effects on mating or 
fertility parameters, and no degeneration or loss in 
spermatogenesis were observed. Female fertility was not 
affected in rats.” 
The SmPC, section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for 
use states “CYP3A inducers: Idelalisib exposure may be 
reduced when co-administered with CYP3A inducers such as 
rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, or carbamazepine. Since 
a reduction in idelalisib plasma concentrations may result in 
decreased efficacy, co-administration of Zydelig with moderate 
or strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided (see section 4.5).”  
The SmPC, section 4.5, Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction, recommend to avoid 
co-administration of idelalisib with strong CYP3A inducers: 
“CYP3A Inducers: A clinical drug interaction study found that 
co-administration of a single dose of 150 mg idelalisib with 
rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer) resulted in a ~75% 
reduction in idelalisib AUC inf. Co-administration of Zydelig with 
moderate or strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, 
phenytoin, St. John’s wort, or carbamazepine should be 
avoided as this may result in decreased efficacy 
(see section 4.4).” 
The SmPC, section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for 
use, states “The primary metabolite of idelalisib, GS-563117, is 
a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Thus, idelalisib has the potential to 
interact with medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, 
which may lead to increased serum concentrations of the other 
product (see section 4.5). When idelalisib is co-administered 
with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product

Characteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be consulted 
for the recommendations regarding co-administration with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant treatment of idelalisib with 
CYP3A substrates with serious and/or life-threatening side 
effects (eg., alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, 
quinidine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, quetiapine, 
lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam) should 
be avoided and alternative medicinal products that are less 
sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible.” 
The SmPC, section 4.5, Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction, recommend caution if 
Zydelig is co-administered with CYP3A substrates: 
“CYP3A Substrates: The primary metabolite of idelalisib, GS-
563117, is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A clinical drug interaction 
study found that co-administration of idelalisib with midazolam 
(a sensitive CYP3A substrate) resulted in a ~140% increase in 
C max and a ~440% increase in AUC inf of midazolam due to the 
CYP3A inhibition by GS-563117.  Co-administration of idelalisib 
with CYP3A substrates may increase their systemic exposures 
and increase or prolong their therapeutic activity and adverse 
reactions.  In vitro, the CYP3A4 inhibition was irreversible, and 
return to normal enzyme activity is therefore expected to take 
several days after stopping idelalisib administration. Potential 
interactions between idelalisib and co-administered medicinal 
products that are CYP3A substrates are listed in Table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑”). This list is not exhaustive and is 
intended to serve as guidance only. In general, the SmPC for 
the other product must be consulted for the recommendations 
regarding co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(see section 4.4).” 
The SmPC section 5.3, Preclinical safety data states 
“Evaluation of the potential for phototoxicity in the embryonic 
murine fibroblast cell line BALB/c 3T3 was inconclusive for 
idelalisib due to cytotoxicity in the in vitro assay. The major 
metabolite, GS-563117, may enhance phototoxicity when cells 
are simultaneously exposed to UVA light. There is a potential 
risk that idelalisib, via its major metabolite, GS-563117, may 
cause photosensitivity in treated patients. ”

The SmPC sections 4.2, states: 
“No dose adjustment is required when initiating treatment with 
Zydelig in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, 
but an intensified monitoring of adverse reactions is 
recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
There is insufficient data to make dose recommendations for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Therefore, caution is 
recommended when administering Zydelig in this population 
and an intensified monitoring of adverse reactions is

in patients with impaired hepatic function as exposure is 
expected to be increased in this population, in particular in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment.  No patients with 
severe hepatic impairment were included in clinical studies of 
idelalisib. Caution is recommended when administering Zydelig 
in this population.” 
The SmPC, section 5.2, states: 
“A study of pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib was 
performed in healthy subjects and subjects with moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic 
impairment. Following a single 150 mg dose, idelalisib 
AUC total, (i.e., bound plus unbound) was ~60% higher in 
moderate and severe impairment compared to matched 
controls. The idelalisib AUC (unbound), after accounting for 
differences in protein binding, was ~80% (1.8-fold) higher in 
moderate and ~152% (2.5-fold) higher in severe impairment 
compared to matched controls.” 
Safety in patients with severe 
renal impairment 
The SmPC sections 4.2, states: 
None 
“No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe renal impairment (see section  5.2).” 
The SmPC section 5.2, states: 
“A study of pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib was 
performed in healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal 
impairment (estimated CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min). Following a 
single 150 mg dose, no clinically relevant changes in 
exposures to idelalisib or GS-563117 were observed in 
subjects with severe renal impairment compared to healthy 
subjects."  
Safety in patients with 
chronic active hepatitis 
The SmPC, section 4.4, states under Special warnings and 
precautions for use:  
None 
“Chronic hepatitis: Idelalisib has not been studied in patients 
with chronic active hepatitis including viral hepatitis. Caution 
should be exercised when administering Zydelig in patients 
with active hepatitis.”

Drug-drug interaction with 
oral contraceptive 
The SmPC section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for 
use states: 
None 
“Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception while taking idelalisib and for 1-month after 
stopping treatment (see section 4.6). Women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method as a second form 
of contraception since it is currently unknown whether 
idelalisib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives.”

The SmPC section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
states: 
“Based on findings in animals, idelalisib may cause foetal 
harm.  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking 
Zydelig, and for up to 1 month after ending treatment. 
Therefore, Women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception while taking Zydelig and for 1 month 
after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown whether 
idelalisib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method as a second form 
of contraception.” 
The  applicant  is  reminded  that,  within  30  calendar  days  of  the  receipt  of  the  Opinion,  an  updated 
version  of  Annex  I  of  the  RMP  template,  reflecting  the  final  RMP  agreed  at  the  time  of  the  Opinion 
should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
–  No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis that the change to the leaflet is only a very minor alteration wording to reflect a new 
combination of idelalisib with ofatumumab. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on the ITT Analysis Set and stratified by 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation, IGHV mutation, and disease status. With an overall event rate of 
~50%, a total of 43.7% of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 62.1% of the ofatumumab alone 
group experienced a PFS event according to the IRC, with an adjusted HR (95% CI) of 0.27 (0.19, 
0.39) and 2-sided p-value of < 0.0001 based on a stratified log-rank test. The median PFS (95% CI) 
was 16.3 (13.6, 17.8) months for subjects in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 8.0 (5.7, 8.2) 
months for subjects in the ofatumumab alone group.  
Based on the IRC assessment (ITT Analysis Set), the ORR (classified as CR or PR) (95% CI) was 
75.3% (68.2%, 81.5%) for the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 18.4% (10.9%, 28.1%) for the 
ofatumumab alone group. The odds ratio favored idelalisib + ofatumumab compared with ofatumumab 
alone (p < 0.0001).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016

The results from the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent in all subpopulations 
analysed including those of subjects with or without 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation. This is also 
consistent with the findings observed in study GS-US-312-0116 study using rituximab as combination 
therapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the effect on OS for the combination of idelalisib and 
ofatumumab in the long term. For study GS-US-312-0116, a highly statistically significant HR = 0.34 
(95%CI 0.19, 0.60, p-value=0.0001) in favour of the idelalisib+rituximab arm was achieved. A similar 
OS was expected for study GS-US-312-0119, however, the HR=0.74 was not statistically significant 
(95%CI 0.44, 1.24; p-value=0.27). Confounding factors such as a imbalanced high discontinuation 
rate in the control ofatumumab arm of patients without an event, the open label design of the study 
and the results of the study GS-US-312-0116 becoming publically available, which may have led to 
patients changing to other effective therapies in the course of their treatment, could have accounted 
for the lack of benefit in OS and of the difference observed between the two studies. Although an 
effect on OS has not been observed, a detrimental effect is not expected. The favourable efficacy 
demonstrated in terms of the convincing PFS and the positive trend observed in OS supports the 
overall clinical benefit in the combination treatment with ofatumumab in the CLL patient population.  
Combination of idelalisib with anti-CD20 MAbs other than rituximab or ofatumumab has not been 
reported. Considering the different mechanism of action of type I and type II CD20 MAbs, further data 
would be needed to support combination with type II anti-CD20 MAbs. Therefore, the combination with 
ofatumumab has been specifically stated in the indication as there is not enough data to support a 
broad indication with any anti-CD20 antibodies.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events related to idelalisib were reported for ~90% of subjects, and in 67% of these AEs were 
grade ≥3. In comparison, AEs related to ofatumumab was reported in 79% (grade ≥3 in 47%) and 
78% (grade ≥3 in 34%) in the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm and ofatumumab arm, respectively.  
Serious AEs were reported for 69.9% of the idelalisib + ofatumumab group and 41.9% of the 
ofatumumab alone group. Adjusting for exposure time, the incidence rate (95% CI) for SAEs was 1.14 
per year in the ofatumumab + idelalisib arm and 1.40 per year in the ofatumumab arm.  The most 
frequently reported SAEs in the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia 
(each 11.6%), pyrexia (11.0%), and diarrhoea (9.8%). In the ofatumumab arm, the most frequent 
SAEs were pneumonia (10.5%) and febrile neutropenia (3.5%). All other SAEs occurred in 2 or fewer 
subjects. 
As expected from the safety profile of idelalisib, the incidence of AEs for the identified risks of 
transaminase elevations, severe diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis, neutropenia, and rash, were more 
frequently seen in the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm.   
Pneumonia of any grade was reported in 24.9% (18% ≥Grade 3) of the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm, 
and in the ofatumumab arm, 17.4% had pneumonia of any grade (10.5% ≥Grade 3). Seven subjects 
in the idelalisib + ofatumumab group discontinued study drug due to pneumonia. 
AEs leading to dose interruption, dose reduction, and study drug discontinuation were more frequent in 
the idelalisib + ofatumumab arm (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657576/2016

Tolerability of the combined regimen of idelalisib and ofatumumab appeared to be worse than for study 
GS-US-312-0116 since discontinuation of idelalisib in the combination arm with ofatumumab was 
30.6% compared to 17.3% in study GS-US-312-0116 with rituximab combination treatment. Taking 
into account the caveat that comparisons between the trials are made more difficult due to different 
length of follow-up, the incidences of AEs seem overall consistent with what is already known from 
both studies and no unexpected safety concerns to patients is expected. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are important potential risks that have been identified in the initial marketing application: 
reproductive toxicity including teratogenicity, drug-drug interaction with CYP3A inducers, drug-drug 
interaction with CYP3A substrates, photosensitivity and skin cancer. These are currently managed 
through recommendations in the SmPC, routine risk minimization activities in the RMP and routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
There is uncertainty over the missing information concerning the development of drug resistance, 
carcinogenicity, long-term safety, safety in patients with severe hepatic impairment, safety in patients 
with severe renal impairment, safety in patients with chronic active hepatitis, safety of patients with 
concomitant immunization, immunological effects and auto-immunity, safety in children, safety of 
breastfeeding and drug-drug interaction with oral contraceptive. These safety concerns are being 
managed through recommendations in the SmPC, routine risk minimization activities in the RMP and 
routine pharmacovigilance. No new safety concerns have been identified with the combination of 
idelalisib+ofatumumab combination.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The clinical benefit of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab has been demonstrated with a 
prolongation in PFS of approximately 8 months. This result is statistically significant and clinically 
relevant in this patient population. Differences between the arms in ORR and lymph node response 
rate are also substantial and clearly indicate higher efficacy when ofatumumab (in a dose reduced by 
50%) is combined with idelalisib. Furthermore, the higher efficacy of idelalisib + ofatumumab in these 
respects seems consistent in all subgroups including notably patients with high-risk prognostic features 
such as del 17p/TP53-mutations and those with unmutated IgHV-chains. No statistically significant 
effect was associated to idelalisib+ofatumumab compared to ofatumumab in terms of overall survival 
although a detrimental effect seems unlikely. The safety data did not raise any specific concerns.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the benefits of idelalisib + ofatumumab in terms of PFS in patients with CLL 
outweigh the risks. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
With the emergence of new therapies, prolonged disease control and survival has been achieved in 
patients with advanced CLL including those with high-risk prognostic factors such as del17p/TP53-
mutations. However, complete remissions are still rare which presumably requires continuation of 
therapy. This increases the importance of optimizing treatment also from a tolerability perspective.

The benefit of the combination of idelalisib+ofatumumab has been demonstrated in the pivotal study 
GS-US-312-0119 in terms of PFS with a difference of 8.3 months compared to the ofatumumab 
treatment arm.  This compares, although somewhat lower, with the PFS demonstrated in the GS-US-
312-0116 study with the combination of rituximab+idelalisib of 12.9 months. Surprisingly, a 
statistically significant difference in OS was not observed with idelalisib+ofatumumab, compared with 
ofatumumab (HR: 074; 95%CI 0.44, 1.25; p-value 0.27). This is in contrast with the results obtained 
in study GS-US-312-0116 where there was a clear OS advantage observed in the rituximab 
combination arm (HR:0.34; 95%CI 0.19,0.60; p-value= 0.0001). It is possible that disproportional 
early discontinuation without events, perhaps as a result of informative censoring due to the open label 
design  and early results from GS-US-312-0116 study, may have confounded the OS results. However, 
a mechanistic explanation could also be plausible. Although ofatumumab and rituximab both target 
CD20, the binding epitopes are different as well as their patterns of cytotoxic effects. Rituximab and 
ofatumumab have not been directly compared in clinical studies in CLL and their relative efficacy and 
tolerability/toxicity have not been assessed. It is acknowledged that indirect comparisons between 
studies are complicated by different study designs and length of follow-up in the various studies. 
The smaller effect size in study GS-US-312-0119 should also be weighed against the safety findings. 
Tolerability of the combined regimen of idelalisib and ofatumumab appeared to be worse than for study 
GS-US-312-0116 since discontinuation of idelalisib in the combination arm with ofatumumab was 
30.6% compared to 17.3% in study GS-US-312-0116 with rituximab combination treatment. Again, 
different lengths of follow-up confound the indirect comparisons from the study findings. The safety 
and tolerability of the combination therapy appears to be acceptable and manageable through SmPC 
recommendations, routine pharmacovigilance and implementation of RMP measures. 
Further to the assessment of emerging safety information under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) reviewed 
data on the interim results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124, GS-US-313-0125 that 
suggested an increased risk of death and serious infection with idelalisib were reviewed. The results of 
these studies were considered of limited relevance for the benefit-risk balance of idelalisib in its 
authorised indications and ongoing extension of indication in combination with ofatumumab for the 
treatment of CLL. Nevertheless, as a precaution and in view of the fact that limited data are available 
in treatment-naïve CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, the PRAC recommended that 
idelalisib should only be used in this group of patients if they are not eligible for any other therapies. 
Further minimisation measures of the known risk of infection related to the use of idelalisib and 
changes to the product information were agreed.

Extension of Indication for Zydelig to include the combination of idelalisib with ofatumumab; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives for United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovenia and Slovakia in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, as a consequence of the art 20 referral procedure (EMEA/H/A-20/1439/C/003843/0023) 
sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC and the package leaflet are updated with a further change 
introduced in the indication so that idelalisib can be used as first line in patients with 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation if they are not eligible for any other therapies.  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Zydelig is not similar to Imbruvica, Gazyvaro and 
Arzerra within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope

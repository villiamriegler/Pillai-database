1. 
Introduction 
In this variation procedure, the MAH applied to introduce the extension of the therapeutic indication 
for Humira to include inhibition of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
Consequential changes to section 5.1 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL were also proposed.  
2. 
Background 
The  dossier  consisted  of  two-year  open-label  extension  (DE019  OLE)  data  from  the  previously 
assessed pivotal trial DE019. 
3. 
Efficacy 
Study design 
Twelve-month data from the DE019 trial were assessed for the Marketing Authorisation (MA) of the 
currently  approved  indication.  Briefly,  DE  019  enrolled  adult  patients  (mean  age  56  years)  with 
chronic  (mean  disease  duration  130  months),  moderate  to  severe,  active  RA.  With  few  exceptions, 
patients  had  failed  on  at  least  one  previous  DMARD,  including  methotrexate  (MTX).  The  first  12 
months were a double blind phase, where adalimumab (20 mg weekly or 40 mg every other week) was 
compared  with  placebo  as  add-on  to  MTX.  During  the  extension  period  of  up  to  two  years 
(DE019OLE),  all  patients  received  open-label  adalimumab,  40  mg  eow.  Study  flow  and  subject 
disposition are given in Figure 1.

Methods 
Trial  DE019  had  three  co-primary  endpoints,  hierarchically  arranged  as  follows,  to  preserve  overall 
α=0.05: 
1.  ACR20 responder rate at 24 weeks 
2.  Change from baseline in modified total Sharp X-ray score (TSS) at week 52 
3.  Change from baseline in disability by HAQ (Health Assessement Questionnaire) at week 52 
Significance  testing  was  done  following  the  closure  principle  (overall  effect  followed  by  individual 
doses vs. placebo). 
For DE019OLE, the following primary criteria relevant to the current application were prospectively 
defined in the analysis plan: 
(cid:57) Sustained inhibition of structural damage for subjects originally receiving adalimumab in DE019  
This  was  evaluated  by  changes  in  TSS  during  the  second  year  of  treatment  compared  to  Week  52.   
The Week 104 TSS change was defined as Week 104 TSS minus Week 52 TSS.  The primary measure 
was the percentage of subjects with no progression, defined as a change in TSS ≤0 during the second 
year of treatment with adalimumab.  If ≥50% of subjects observed a difference of ≤0 units in Week 
104 TSS change, or if the lower confidence limit of the observed percentage of subjects with no Week 
104  TSS  change  is  ≥37%,  the  two-year  open-label  TSS  data  demonstrate  sustained  inhibition  of 
radiographic structural damage.

(cid:57) Maintenance  of  improved  physical  function  for  subjects  originally  receiving  adalimumab  in 
DE019 
Maintenance of improved physical function during Study DE019 OLE was defined as the percentage 
of subjects who achieved a 0.5 units or greater improvement in Week 52 HAQ DI (i.e., HAQ DI 0.5 
responder), and then maintained an improvement of at least 0.5 units in HAQ DI through Week 104.  
Maintenance  of  improved  physical  function  was  demonstrated  if  75%  of  HAQ  DI  0.5  responder 
subjects  (with  lower  confidence  limit  ≥60%)  at  Week  52  maintained  responder  status  at  Week  104 
(LOCF, Last Observation Carried Forward). 
A number of secondary efficacy assessments relating to ACR, TSS and HAQ were predefined. 
Results 
Results from DE019 are summarised in Table 1. The findings had been discussed in greater detail in 
the initial assessment for the Marketing Authorisation.

Bolded parameters represent the primary efficacy endpoints of the study. 
The effects on TSS components joint space narrowing and erosion on score were consistent. 
It was noted that the population studied in DE019 had rather low ongoing erosion activity, with 46% 
of patients in the placebo group showing no deterioration in TSS M0-M12. The CPMP opinion during 
the  initial  assessment  was  that  two-year  data  would  be  necessary  for  reassurance  regarding 
maintenance of clinically relevant effect. 
Efficacy on HAQ was considered clinically relevant and was already mentioned in section 5.1 of the 
SPC. 
Results from DE019OLE are discussed below.

Criteria  for  “sustained  inhibition  of  radiographic  progression”  were,  thus,  fulfilled.  An  analysis 
including  only  patients  with  X-rays  available  during  DE019OLE  (N=304)  produced  similar  results 
(∆TSS ≤0 in 175/304, 57.6%)

Effects  on  TSS  components  erosion  score  and  JSN  were  consistent  with  those  for  overall  TSS. 
Subgroup  analyses  did  not  reveal  clinically  important  differences  with  regard  to  sex,  age,  race, 
corticosteroid use, or duration of RA. 
The CPMP considered that the interpretation is hampered by the lack of a placebo control group for 
the second year. The MAH justifies this by reference to ethical and feasibility aspects. Considering the 
low  underlying  progression  rate  in  the  population  studied  (46%  non-progressors  for  TSS  in  the 
placebo group during M0-M12), the outcome in the primary analysis may not provide very impressive 
support for sustained effect. Second-year data for patients treated with adalimumab in DE019 suggest 
some resumption of erosive activity. 
On the other hand, DE019OLE findings for the original placebo group support efficacy of adalimumab 
on  progression  of  joint  damage  as  noted  in  DE019.  Differences  between  groups  treated  with 
adalimumab M0-M24 and M12-M24, respectively, remain significant at the two-year evaluation and 
do  not  appear  reduced,  compared  with  at  one  year.  Overall,  sustained  effects  of  adalimumab  on  the 
rate of progression of joint damage are considered acceptably documented.

Disability by HAQ 
As  described  above  effects  of  adalimumab  vs.  placebo  on  disability  by  HAQ  were  reasonably 
convincing at 12 months in DE019. Similar findings were made in other trials. The 0.5 MCID criterion 
chosen for analysis in DE19OLE is considered relevant. Outcome for the primary analysis is given in 
Table 4 and supports maintained response in a relevant fraction of patients. Similar conclusions could 
be made for other HAQ MCIDs (0.22, 0.75, 1.0).

Deaths and Adverse events of specific interest 
There  were  three  deaths  during  the  OLE  phase,  one  case  each  of  interstitial  pneumonia,  sepsis,  and 
small bowel infarction. 
Serious  infectious  AEs  occurred  in  similar  proportions  (3.8%  vs.  3.7%  of  subjects)  in  adalimumab-
treated  patients  in  DB  and  OLE  phases,  respectively.  There  were  three  cases  of  granulomatous 
infection (one TB, two Histoplasmosis) during OLE, compared with two cases during DB. 
Demyelinating disorder compatible with MS was diagnosed in one case during OLE and in one case 
during DB. 
Malignancies were diagnosed in 1.9% and 2.0% during DB and OLE phases, respectively. 
No case of autoantibody development was noted during DE019 plus DE019OLE.

5. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
To  document  sustained  benefit  of  Humira  on  progression  of  joint  damage  and  disability,  
the MAH submitted 24month OLE data from the previously assessed trial DE019. Although the trial 
design with lack of control group during the second year is not ideal to assess long-term efficacy, the 
data  presented  provide  acceptable  reassurance  that  the  effect  of  adalimumab  on  progression  of  joint 
damage, established at one year, is not lost with long-term treatment up to two years. Data on ACR 
and HAQ support continued efficacy for symptoms and signs and disability, respectively, as expected 
for this class of agents. 
The safety data raise no new concerns. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
The CPMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the proposed wordings to 
be introduced into the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet based on 
the observations and the appropriate conclusions. 
The CPMP adopted on 22 April 2004 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

Methods 
This retrospective cohort analysis utilized data from the Discover NOW dataset in Northwest London. 
The study cohort included COVID-19 patients (diagnosed between 01 December 2021 and 31 July 
2022) aged ≥12 years who were not hospitalized and met at least one of the NHS's highest-risk 
criteria [NHS, 2022] for receiving early treatment with sotrovimab, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, or 
molnupiravir for COVID-19. The cohort also included patients who were untreated despite being eligible 
for early treatment based on the NHS's highest-risk criteria at the time of diagnosis. The effectiveness 
of sotrovimab in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalisation and/or COVID-19-related death within 28 
days of treatment versus no treatment was investigated in the overall study population using 
propensity score methods and for the following subgroups: patients aged< 65 years, ≥65 years, those 
who had renal disease, or those infected during 3 different periods of circulating variants. 
Treatments 
The commercial formulation of sotrovimab 500 mg concentrate for solution for infusion was used in 
accordance with the regulatory approvals of the relevant countries. 
Results 
A total of 599 patients treated with sotrovimab and 5191 high-risk patients who did not receive any 
treatment were included in the study. Compared with untreated patients, the risk of COVID-19 
hospitalization/death (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.50, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=0.24–1.06; P=.07) and 
the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (HR=0.43, 95% CI=0.18–1.00; P=.051) were both lower in the 
sotrovimab-treated group; however, statistical significance was not reached.  
Paediatric data  
A total of 86 untreated adolescent patients were included in the study; however none received 
sotrovimab. No analysis of this subgroup of patients was conducted in this study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided results from the retrospective cohort analysis from the Discover NOW as part of 
the paediatric obligations. A total of 86 adolescent patients were included in the study, but none of 
them received sotrovimab, and hence no analysis of the paediatric subgroup was conducted. 
Clinical study number and title 
N3C comparative effectiveness study - 219020 
Methods 
This study analysed electronic health records from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) in 
the US [Bell 2023]. Patients aged ≥12 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 between 01 June 2021 and 30 
April 2022 and at high risk of COVID-19 progression, were included in the study. Patients who received 
sotrovimab treatment within 10 days of diagnosis were assigned to the sotrovimab group, while those 
who did not receive any early mAb treatment, prophylactic mAb or oral antiviral treatment were 
assigned to the untreated group. The study analysed the effectiveness of sotrovimab compared to 
untreated patients in terms of all-cause hospitalisation or death within 29 days of follow-up.

Results 
The comparative effectiveness analysis evaluated data from 4992 sotrovimab patients and 541325 
untreated patients. Among those who received sotrovimab, 3.3% required hospitalization compared to 
4.2% of those who were not treated. After inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) 
adjustment, sotrovimab was associated with a 23% reduction in the likelihood of all-cause 
hospitalization compared with the untreated cohort (IPTW-adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI=0.63-0.95). 
The mortality rate in the sotrovimab group was 0.3%, compared to 0.5% in the untreated group. 
When hospitalisation and mortality were combined, 3.5% of the sotrovimab group required 
hospitalisation or died, compared to 4.5% of the untreated group. After IPTW adjustment, sotrovimab 
was associated with a 25% reduction in the likelihood of combined all-cause hospitalisation and 
mortality compared with the untreated cohort (IPTW-adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.61-0.92). The 
percentages of patients that required all-cause critical care were 0.1% in the sotrovimab-treated group 
and 0.3% in the untreated group. 
Paediatric data  
The N3C study included adolescent patients. However, no specific analysis, such as patients’ 
characteristics or clinical outcomes were performed for this specific age group, as a sub-group analysis 
for adolescents was not included in the original analysis plan. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn 
from this study for the adolescent subgroup. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided results from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The study includes 
adolescent participants, but no data are published specifically on the paediatric population, and it is 
agreed that no conclusions can be drawn from this population. 
Clinical study number and title 
Komodo comparative effectiveness study - 219589 
Methods 
This was a retrospective cohort study that utilised administrative claims data from Komodo Health in 
the US. Patients aged ≥ 12 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in an ambulatory setting 
between 26 May 2021 and 05 April 2022 were included. Patients treated with sotrovimab as an early 
treatment were compared with untreated high-risk patients who were eligible to receive a monoclonal 
antibody or an antiviral treatment but remained untreated.  
The objectives were to assess the effectiveness of sotrovimab in preventing all-cause hospitalization, 
as well as preventing the composite all-cause hospitalization and/or all-cause mortality within 29 days 
of treatment start (the acute phase). 
Exact and propensity score matching methods were employed to construct 1:2 matched cohorts of 
sotrovimab-treated and untreated patients with similar clinical characteristics. The following variables 
were used for the exact matching: age (+/- 5 years), diagnosis dates (within 14 days), state of 
residence. Then, patients were matched on the propensity score (probability of receiving sotrovimab 
given a set of observed and measured characteristics) that was derived from a logistic regression 
model based upon the following clinical covariates: age, gender, payor type, US geographic region, 
Quan-Charlson comorbidity index, individual high risk criteria (obesity, pregnancy, any stage chronic 
kidney disease, diabetes, immunosuppressive disease, immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular

disease / hypertension, chronic lung disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, liver disease), index 
month, presence of ≥1 hospitalization, ≥1 emergency room admission and ≥1 critical care admission 
during the baseline period. 
Results 
A total of 34,160 patients who received sotrovimab and 68,320 propensity score matched untreated 
patients were included in the study. During the 29-day follow-up period, patients who received 
sotrovimab had a significantly lower risk of experiencing all-cause hospitalization (Odd Ratio 
[OR]=0.81, 95% CI=0.76-0.87) or all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.70-
0.80) during the acute phase than the untreated cohort. 
Paediatric data  
Two ad hoc exploratory analyses for selected age groups, including paediatric patients < 18 years (i.e., 
12-54 years and 12-<18) were undertaken. These subgroup analyses were not prespecified in the 
study protocol and no new propensity scores for matching were derived for these subgroups of 
patients, hence the propensity score calculated for the overall population was used for these ad hoc 
exploratory subgroups. The results from these sub-analyses were not optimally adjusted for measured 
and unmeasured cofounders, but still reported below. 
The analysis of data from patients aged 12-54 years (N=16104 for sotrovimab and N=32202 for 
untreated) indicated that, during the 29-day follow-up period, there was an increased odds of all-cause 
hospitalization and all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality in the sotrovimab group compared to the 
untreated group (OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.09-1.33 and OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.07-1.30, respectively). 
The sub-analysis that was restricted to patients aged 12-<18 years at the time of diagnosis included 
295 patients treated with sotrovimab and 605 untreated patients. The all-cause hospitalization rate 
during the 29-day follow-up period was higher in the sotrovimab group (4.75%) compared to 1.49% 
for the untreated group, with a greater odds of hospitalization for the sotrovimab group (OR=4.52, 
95% CI=1.52-13.38). No deaths occurred in either group. 
The study employed propensity-score matching to achieve balance in the overall measured 
demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups, however it did not aim to balance these 
characteristics for the subgroup analyses, as would be required for a definitive comparative analysis. 
As a result, the adolescent sub-population that received sotrovimab had a greater burden of risk 
factors for progression to severe COVID-19 disease than untreated patients, such as 
immunosuppressive disease (25% versus 13% for untreated), diabetes mellitus (11% versus 5% for 
untreated) and chronic kidney diseases (5% versus 1% for untreated) (Table 1). However, even if the 
propensity score had been recalculated for the analysis of the paediatric subgroup, it is likely that 
some residual confounding by indication would remain. Symptomatic and more severely ill patients 
were more likely to receive sotrovimab than staying untreated, which may have inflated the treatment 
effect estimates. This is also due to the fact that the demographic and clinical characteristics captured 
in this study and used to derive the propensity scores were generalisable to the entire patient 
population, and hence true confounders and risk factors specific to the paediatric population were not 
captured and could not be controlled for.  
The results of the ad hoc exploratory analysis that focused only on patients aged 12-<18 years at the 
time of diagnosis were not included in the study report. For transparency, the demographics, clinical 
characteristics, and outcomes of patients aged 12-<18 years at the time of diagnosis are summarized 
in Table 1.

Overview of safety 
The 3 observational studies included did not report safety outcomes for patients treated with 
sotrovimab for the overall cohort or for the subgroup of patients aged < 18 years old. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, MAH has submitted the final study reports 
for 3 observational studies all sponsored by the MAH and all including patients aged ≥12 years and < 
18 years of age (Discover Study – 219543, Komodo Study – 219589, and N3C Study 219020). The 
studies are not measures of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan for sotrovimab (EMEA-002899-
PIP01-20-M02).

The MAH has provided an overview of the three studies. Two of the studies did not address or provide 
data on the paediatric age group, hence the N3C study did not report paediatric-specific outcomes, and 
in the Discover study no patient <18 years of age received sotrovimab. However, in the Komodo study 
an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients aged ≥12 years-old and <18 years-old patients was made 
and these results are provided by the MAH.  
The Komodo study was a retrospective cohort study that evaluated the real-world effectiveness of 
sotrovimab versus no treatment in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death. The cohorts were 
matched 1:2 by exact and propensity score matching methods. The variables used were: age (+/- 5 
years), date of diagnosis and state of residence. Then, patients were matched on the propensity score 
based upon the covariates: age, gender, payor type, US geographic region, Quan-Charlson comorbidity 
index, individual high risk criteria (obesity, pregnancy, any stage chronic kidney disease, diabetes, 
immunosuppressive disease, immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease / hypertension, 
chronic lung disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, liver disease), index month, presence of ≥1 
hospitalization, ≥1 emergency room admission and ≥1 critical care admission during the baseline 
period. In total 34,160 patients who received sotrovimab and 68,320 propensity score matched 
untreated patients were included in the full cohort study. In the overall cohort risk of experiencing all-
cause hospitalization or all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality were lower in sotrovimab treated 
patients. (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.76-0.87 and OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.70-0.80, respectively). 
As an exploratory study, the cohort of patients above 12 and below the age of 18 was also examined. 
In total 295 patients were treated with sotrovimab and 605 patients were untreated. The all-cause 
hospitalization rate was higher in the sotrovimab group (4.75%) compared to the untreated group 
(1.49%). Odds for hospitalization for the sotrovimab treated was higher than in the untreated cohort. 
(OR=4.52, 95% CI=1.52-13.38). No deaths occurred in either group. 
The MAH finds that the data from the Komodo study are too biased to draw a meaningful conclusion on 
the benefit:risk of sotrovimab in adolescent patients aged ≥12 years-old. It is agreed with the MAH 
that a cohort study has significant methodological limitations. Further, the analysis in the adolescent 
population was exploratory (not part of an a priori analysis plan) and did therefore not have all 
appropriate adjustment for potential confounders. The MAH also address that the propensity score was 
calculated for the overall population, and not for this specific population, resulting in an imbalance on a 
number of comorbidities and risk factors for COVID-19 progression between the two groups of 
adolescent patients. It is agreed that this imbalance was overall in favour of the untreated patients 
(not receiving sotrovimab), but not entirely as both Neurodevelopment disorder and Chronic lung 
disorder existed more often in the untreated population. Overall, it is agreed that confounding by 
indication is very likely and as the MAH also argues for all retrospective studies even with matching 
and adjustment, unmeasured confounding could still result in significant bias in the results of the 
subgroup analysis, and these post-hoc data should not be reflected in the SmPC. 
The MAH concludes that no update to the paediatric aspects of the product information is required, 
which is agreed.  
There are no reported safety outcomes, and therefore it is agreed that no updates for section 4.8 are 
needed.

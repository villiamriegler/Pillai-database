Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Desloratadine ratiopharm  
desloratadine 
On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Desloratadine ratiopharm. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is ratiopharm 
GmbH. 
The variation concerns a change in the classification of Desloratadine ratiopharm from “medicinal product 
subject to medical prescription” to “medicinal product not subject to medical prescription”. 
This change is based on the fact that CHMP agreed that the criteria for classifying a medicine as subject 
to medical prescription as laid down in the European Commission Guideline do not apply to Desloratadine 
ratiopharm. Therefore, the Committee recommended that the change in the supply classification is 
approvable. 
As a consequence of this change, CHMP agreed to limit the indications to adults only and to restrict the 
urticaria indication to chronic idiopathic urticaria as initially diagnosed by a physician. The CHMP adopted 
a change to the existing indications as follows:2  
Desloratadine ratiopharm 5 mg film-coated tablets is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 
12 years and older for the relief of symptoms associated with: 
- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1) 
- chronic idiopathic urticaria as initially diagnosed by a physician (see section 5.1) 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

1.  Introduction 
On October 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Methylene Blue Proviblue, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert statement was also provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Population Modeling & Simulations of Methylene Blue Proviblue in Support of Dose 
Justification in Pediatric Patients (study number PVP-2015001, Sept 2015) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
This was a modeling and simulation study, exposure in children with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 5 
mg/ml solution for injection was simulated. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Population Modeling & Simulations of Methylene Blue Proviblue® in Support of Dose Justification in 
Pediatric Patients(study number PVP-2015001, Sept 2015).; 
Population PK modeling (report PVP-2015001, Sept 2015) of methylene blue using nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling was performed based on adult healthy subject data collected from a Phase I bioequivalence study 
conducted by the Sponsor (StudyPVP- 2014001, IND Number 118,156). 
2.3.2.  M&S study - Population Modeling & Simulations of Methylene Blue 
Proviblue in Support of Dose Justification in Paediatric Patients(study number 
PVP-2015001, Sept 2015) 
Description 
This modeling and simulation study was to support age-appropriate dose finding in pediatric patients aged 0-18 
years by targeting comparable methylene blue exposures as observed in adults. 
Objective 
The objective of this analysis was to perform population PK modeling and simulation of methylene blue in 
support of paediatric dosing requirements justification in paediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years.

Methods 
Population PK modeling of methylene blue using nonlinear mixed effects modeling was performed based on 
adult healthy subject data collected from a Phase I bioequivalence study conducted by the Sponsor (StudyPVP- 
2014001, IND Number 118,156). An allometric function and maturation factor were applied for clearance to 
account for developmental changes in body size for paediatric subjects and in organ maturation for newborns 
and infants. A total of 700 plasma concentrations collected from 35 adult healthy subjects were available for 
population PK model development. 
Results 
The final model was best described by a three-compartment model with zero-order infusion input. Simulations 
in pediatric patients older than 3 months of age a dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in similar predicted methylene blue 
exposure as observed in adults. In newborns and infants younger than 3 months a lower dose of 1 mg/kg should 
be considered in order to meet target drug concentration ranges.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Methylene Blue (Methylthioninium chloride) is a drug used for a life-threatening methaemoglobinaemia, 
allowing rapid conversion of methaemoglobin into haemoglobin and rapid improvement of symptoms. The drug 
is approved in adults and children. Infants above 3 months, children and adolescent have same posology as 
adults, 1-2 mg/kg given over a period of 5 minutes. The dose for infants less than 3 months of age is 0.3-0.5 
mg/kg. The objective of the analysis was to perform population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation 
of methylene blue in support of paediatric dosing in patients aged 0 to 18 years. No PK data in children were 
available. To simulate pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients, renal maturation was integrated as well as 
allometric scaled body weight in the developed adult population PK model. Predicted methylene blue exposures 
(AUC) were evaluated across the ages of 0 to 18 years. Exposure from 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg were simulated. In 
the PK simulations in paediatric subjects, a dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in drug exposures within the adult range 
in most subjects older than 3 months. In new-born and infants younger than 3 months a lower dose of 1 mg/kg 
should be considered in order to meet target drug concentration ranges according to the simulations.  
The conclusions from the submitted report are only taking PK into account and the MAH states that extra caution 
due to lower NADPH-methemoglobin reductase levels in the youngest children are warranted. Thus, the adult 
target exposure range may not be adequate in the youngest children. The MAH has checked AEs(September 
2018) including lack of efficacy and states that no lack of efficacy has been reported in the youngest children 
while 2 serious AEs have been reported, one case of Haemolytic anaemia and one case of Polycytemia with 
hyperbilirubinaemia. Since the drug is already approved and no lack of efficacy has been reported with the 
recommended posology and since there could be safety concerns with increased dose, the MAHs suggestion not 
to change the approved posology is supported. Subsequently the adequacy of the popPK model has not been 
assessed in detail. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAHs suggestion not to change the approved posology is supported.

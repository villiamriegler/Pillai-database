1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Amgen Europe B.V. submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 3 October 2016 an application for a variation.  
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in relation to multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) following 
discontinuation of Prolia treatment based on an analysis of osteoporosis-related fracture data in 
subjects who discontinued investigational product and remained on study in either the Prolia phase 3 
pivotal fracture study (Study 20030216) or its study extension (Study 20060289). The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. An updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to include 
multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) following discontinuation of Prolia treatment as a new important 
risk. In addition, the applicant took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes throughout the 
Product Information and update the information on local representatives in the Package leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
This variation follows a post-hoc analysis of osteoporosis-related fracture data in subjects who 
discontinued investigational product and remained on study in either the Prolia phase 3 pivotal 
fracture study (Study 20030216) or its study extension (Study 20060289) to better understand the 
incidence of fracture following treatment discontinuation.  
The MAH interpretation of the data is that multiple vertebral fractures may occur following 
discontinuation of Prolia treatment, particularly in patients with a history of vertebral fracture. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk 
balance 
A pivotal 3-year, placebo-controlled, phase 3 Study 20030216 compared Prolia treatment with 
placebo in patients with osteoporosis.  Women who completed Study 20030216 (the parent study) 
and had completed the 36-month visit could enrol in the extension Study 20060289, in which all 
subjects were to receive open-label Prolia treatment for another 7 years to provide additional safety 
and efficacy data. 
The MAH expresses a concern regarding multiple new vertebral fractures (MVF) following treatment 
discontinuation with Prolia based on a post-hoc analysis of osteoporosis-related fracture data in 
subjects who discontinued investigational product and remained on study in either the Prolia phase 3 
pivotal fracture study (Study 20030216) or its study extension (Study 20060289). A total of 1471 
patients in these clinical studies have available follow-up data after treatment discontinuation and

114 of these patients fractured during this off-treatment follow-up period of approximately 10 
months. The MAH proposes new warnings in the SmPC and PL in relation to potential occurrence of 
multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) following discontinuation of Prolia treatment, particularly in 
patients with history of vertebral fractures. . The MAH also proposes to add “Multiple vertebral 
fractures following discontinuation of Prolia treatment” as an important identified risk in the RMP. A 
Dear Investigator Letter (DIL), relating to multiple vertebral fractures following discontinuation of 
Prolia treatment, has been circulated by the MAH earlier. 
In the view of the CHMP, the current data does not support a warning for increased MVF incidence 
following treatment discontinuation: 
• 
in subjects who sustained a new vertebral fracture after Prolia cessation, there was a greater 
The MAH´s current interpretation of the data from studies 20030216 and 20060289 is that, 
incidence of multiple vertebral fractures than in subjects discontinuing placebo. However, the total 
number of subjects with new vertebral fractures was lower in the Prolia discontinuation group. 
Further, there is no biologically plausible mechanism or a clear rationale of why treatment cessation 
would not increase single vertebral fractures but only ≥2 vertebral fractures.  
• 
subjects who discontinued placebo and in the subjects that discontinued denosumab: 12.7 and 12.4 
In study 20030216, the rate of off-treatment new vertebral fractures was identical in the 
per 100 subject-years. There were no imbalances in patients who had two, three or four vertebral 
off-treatment fractures. These groups had comparable baseline risk with regard to age and baseline 
risk. 
• 
groups in study 20060289. Off-treatment new vertebral fractures rate was slightly higher in the 
The rate of on-treatment vertebral fractures seems similar in long-term and cross-over 
subjects who discontinued long-term denosumab (21.9 per 100 subject-years) compared to the 
subjects that discontinued cross-over denosumab (17.1 per 100 subject-years). The number of 
patients who had two, three or four vertebral off-treatment fractures was low and there was no 
pattern that this would be more common in any group. 
• 
>2 vertebral fractures in study 20060289 were higher. The patients who discontinued study 
Compared to study 20030216, the off-treatment new vertebral fractures rates as well as 
20060289 were older and had slightly more vertebral fractures already while on treatment. It is clear 
that any direct comparison that mixes off-treatment vertebral fracture data from these two studies is 
not valid. 
• 
non-vertebral fractures than the subjects who completed. They had also considerably more 
Subjects who discontinued were older and had more baseline vertebral fractures and prior 
on-treatment vertebral fractures than those who completed. Discontinuations due to requirement for 
alternative therapy were not balanced, either. Besides the underlying reasons for discontinuation 
such as concomitant other serious diseases, different therapeutic strategies after discontinuation 
may affect the fracture outcomes after discontinuation.  
• 
treatment and during treatment. The scientific value of stimulated non-study reports of fractures 
Both single and multiple vertebral fractures occur in this high risk population without 
occurring after treatment is therefore low, increasing the uncertainty of the data being the basis for 
the MAH’s recommendations.

warning would promote lifelong Prolia treatment. However, the optimal duration of Prolia treatment 
for osteoporosis has not been established. Therefore, the need for continued treatment should be 
re-evaluated periodically on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. To 
support further direct claims in relation to continued long-term treatment, or recommendations 
against treatment discontinuation, and to evaluate the benefits vs risks of planned cessation 
(treatment holiday) would need to be substantiated by robust clinical trial data such as a randomized 
withdrawal trial after 3-5 year of treatment. Of note, the MAH has recently proposed also 
hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation as a potential risk for Prolia. A randomized 
withdrawal trial could also address this issue. The MAH clarified that they do not have any plans to 
conduct a randomized withdrawal study.  
Overall, the data does not support a conclusion that justifies a warning for increased MVF incidence 
following treatment discontinuation. The argument from the MAH that these ad hoc analyses with 
serious methodological concerns have been published (please refer to section 4.5 of this report) does 
not change the fact that the data presented in this variation application does not indicate an increased 
risk of multiple vertebral fractures after treatment discontinuation when assessed objectively.

treatment cessation would not increase single vertebral fractures but only ≥2 vertebral 
fractures; there were numerous imbalances of parameters for subjects who discontinued

underlying reasons for discontinuation; the scientific value of stimulated non-study reports of 
fractures occurring after treatment is questioned as it increases the uncertainty of the data; 
as well as other uncertainties of the data from the two studies 
the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Prolia (denosumab 60 mg every 6 months [Q6M]) is a fully human monoclonal antibody with high 
affinity and specificity for RANK ligand that binds to and neutralizes the activity of human RANK 
ligand.  Prolia was approved in the European Union (EU) via the Centralised Procedure in May 2010 
and is indicated for:  
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures.  
• 
In postmenopausal women Prolia significantly reduces the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip 
fractures. 
Treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at 
• 
increased risk of fractures (see section 5.1).  In men with prostate cancer receiving hormone 
ablation, Prolia significantly reduces the risk of vertebral fractures. 
Some reports in the literature have described patients sustaining multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) 
following Prolia discontinuation (Popp et al, 2016; Rodriquez et al, 2016; Anastasilakis and Makras, 
2016).  To better understand the incidence of fracture following treatment discontinuation, an 
analysis was performed of osteoporosis-related fracture data in subjects who discontinued 
investigational product and remained on study in either the Prolia phase 3 pivotal fracture study 
(Study 20030216) or its extension study (Study 20060289). 
The purpose of this clinical overview addendum is to provide support for an update to the Core Data 
Sheet (CDS) for Prolia (Prolia CDS version 18) and corresponding changes to EU product information 
that incorporates information on a new identified risk, MVF following discontinuation of Prolia 
treatment. 
4.2.  Methods 
Clinical Study Data Evaluation 
The 3-year, placebo-controlled, phase 3 Study 20030216 demonstrated that Prolia treatment, 
compared with placebo, reduces the incidence of new vertebral fractures, nonvertebral fractures, and 
hip fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.  Women who completed Study 20030216 
(the parent study), completed the 36-month visit, and did not miss more than 1 dose of 
investigational product could enrol in the extension Study 20060289, in which all subjects were to 
receive open-label Prolia treatment for another 7 years to provide additional safety and efficacy data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/493205/2017 
Page 9/46 
 
  
  
 
Subjects were included in the current analyses if they discontinued treatment after receiving at least 
2 doses of investigational product (either placebo or denosumab in Study 20030216, or denosumab 
in Study 20060289) but remained in the study for ≥ 7 months after the last dose of investigational 
product (i.e., the 6-month dosing interval plus a 1-month study visit window).  The incidence of 
fracture was assessed after denosumab discontinuation in Studies 20030216 and 20060289, as well 
as after placebo discontinuation in Study 20030216 as a surrogate for the off-treatment background 
rate of fracture.   
Aggregate Review of the MAH’s Global Safety Database 
Signal evaluation using the Amgen Global Safety Database (AGSD) was conducted on Prolia post 
marketing cases cumulatively through 01 October 2015 to identify off-treatment fractures.  The 
fractures identified from this assessment were reviewed for evidence of MVF and an updated search 
of Prolia post marketing cases from the AGSD for MVF following Prolia treatment discontinuation was 
conducted for the period of 02 October 2015 through 09 February 2016.  In addition, a cumulative 
search through 09 February 2016 was conducted of Prolia clinical study cases.  
To capture all cases potentially relevant to MVF, a search of the AGSD was performed with Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 18.1) using a narrow search of the term 
Fractures.  A medical review of all fracture cases, independent of reporter’s relationship attribution, 
was then conducted to identify MVF following treatment discontinuation with Prolia, defined by a last 
dose latency of > 6 months. 
Literature Review 
A literature search of both PubMed and Google Scholar was performed for articles published between 
2000 and 2016 reporting rates of MVF following discontinuation of anti-osteoporosis therapies and 
rates of MVF in populations potentially eligible for treatment with Prolia (ie, women with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis, men with osteoporosis, men with prostate cancer using hormone 
ablation therapy, women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer). 
4.3.  Results 
Clinical Study Data 
Four hundred seventy subjects in the placebo group of Study 20030216 and 1001 subjects in the 
combined denosumab groups of Studies 20030216 and 20060289 had available follow-up data after 
treatment discontinuation.  The mean follow-up time per subject during the post-treatment period 
(from last dose of investigational product plus 7 months to end-of-study) was 0.8 years in the 
placebo group and 0.84 years in the combined denosumab group. 
Fractures were reported during the period following investigational product discontinuation in 9.1% 
of subjects who discontinued placebo and 7.1% of subjects who discontinued denosumab.  Most of 
these fractures were new vertebral fractures, which were reported for 6.2% of subjects who 
discontinued placebo and 5.6% of subjects who discontinued denosumab (Table 3-1).  The 
proportion of subjects with MVF (≥ 2 new vertebral fractures) was numerically higher in subjects who 
discontinued denosumab (3.4%) compared with subjects who discontinued placebo (2.1%).  
Consistently among subjects with new vertebral fracture after treatment discontinuation, a greater 
percentage of those who discontinued denosumab (34/56 [60.7%]) than placebo (10/29 [34.5%])

sustained MVF.  Logistic regression models found that the presence of prior vertebral fractures, either 
before or during treatment, was the strongest predictor of MVF following treatment discontinuation 
(odds ratio 2.1 to 3.4).  Femoral neck bone mineral density loss after treatment cessation was a weak 
covariate.

Comment: A total of 1471 patients in the clinical study have available follow-up data after treatment 
discontinuation and 114 of these patients fractured during this off-treatment follow-up period of 
approximately 10 months. 
Based on the table above, the MAH expresses a concern regarding multiple new vertebral fractures 
following treatment discontinuation with Prolia. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the 
Assessment report

fractures during the treatment and following discontinuation in different treatment groups is needed 
before any conclusions can be made. 
Firstly, the MAH is asked to present a flow chart of patients in studies 20030216 and 20060289. The 
flow chart should include the number of patients in different treatment arms who  
a. discontinued without any follow-up,  
b. discontinued and had off-treatment follow-up as defined by the MAH 
c. completed the studies 
Secondly, the main baseline characteristics of patients who discontinued (with and without follow-up) 
during study 20030216 should be compared with patients who completed this placebo-controlled 
study. The Applicant is asked to comment any differences in reasons for discontinuation in the 
placebo and denosumab groups, respectively. 
The main study 20060289 baseline characteristics of patients who discontinued (with and without 
follow-up) during study 20060289 should be compared with patients who completed this extension 
study. The Applicant is asked to comment any differences in reasons for discontinuation between 
denosumab arms with different treatment durations. 
Thirdly, the MAH is requested to calculate the fracture rates as well as exposure adjusted subject 
incidences during the placebo-controlled study 20030216 for patients in the placebo and denosumab 
arms: 1. for patients who completed study 20030216  2. for patients who discontinued - while they 
still were on treatment 3. for patients who discontinued - when they were off-treatment. 
Same calculations of the fracture rates as well as exposure adjusted subject incidences are requested 
for the extension study 20060289: 1. for patients who completed study  20060289  2. for patients 
who discontinued - while they still were on treatment 3. for patients who discontinued - when they 
were off-treatment. 
Finally, the MAH is requested to present available data on fracture rates as well as exposure adjusted 
subject incidences for patients who completed study 20060289 and had follow up thereafter, with or 
without treatment. 
Aggregate Review of the MAH’s Global Safety Database 
Clinical Study Cases 
A cumulative total of 449 Prolia clinical study case reports of fractures (523 events) were retrieved 
from AGSD.  Medical review identified 78 case reports with evidence suggesting discontinuation or 
interruption of Prolia with the last dose administered ≥ 6 months prior to the fracture.  Of the 78 
cases, 27 were vertebral fractures (single or multiple; 24 of the 78 cases involved 2 or more fractures 
and 11 of these were cases of MVF (8 occurred following end of study in either Study 20060289 [6 
cases] or Study 20050233 [2 cases]).  There was no apparent pattern between treatment duration 
and number of fractures.  Treatment duration was reported for 8 of the 11 cases and ranged from 6 
to 8 doses prior to the first vertebral fracture for 3 cases and 13 to 19 doses for the remaining 
5 cases.  The last dose latency ranged from 189 days to 529 days.  Nine cases had a prior history of

Post-marketing Cases 
Cumulatively through 09 February 2016, 2587 post marketing case reports of fractures associated 
with the use of Prolia were retrieved from AGSD.  Medical review identified 22 cases of MVF with 
evidence suggesting discontinuation or interruption of Prolia therapy with the last dose > 6 months 
prior to the fracture.  There was no apparent association between treatment duration and the number 
of fractures.  Treatment duration information was provided for 10 of the 22 cases and ranged from 1 
to 2 doses prior to the first vertebral fracture for 4 cases, 3 to 4 doses for 3 cases, and 5 to 6 doses 
for the remaining 3 cases.  The last dose latency ranged from 181 days to 704 days.  Two cases with 
last dose latency > 180 days were due to a missed or delayed dose, but Prolia treatment was 
continued.  Four of the 22 cases reported a history of prior fracture and no information was provided 
for the remaining 18 cases. 
The estimated cumulative number of patient-years of exposure to Prolia through commercial 
distribution was approximately 5 294 962 as of 09 February 2016 and the cumulative reporting rate 
through 09 February 2016 for MVF occurring > 6 months after Prolia cessation was 0.42 per 100 000 
patient-years. 
Literature Review 
A search of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases revealed no relevant information with respect 
to rates of MVF following antiresorptive treatment discontinuation.   
4.4.  Discussion 
MAH conclusions on Benefits and Risks  
Overall, the fracture rate among subjects who discontinued Prolia treatment was low and comparable 
to that in subjects who discontinued placebo.  Among subjects who sustained a new vertebral 
fracture after Prolia cessation, however, there was a greater incidence of MVF than in subjects 
discontinuing placebo.  Prior vertebral fracture, either before or during study treatment, was the 
strongest predictor of MVF after treatment cessation. 
Multiple vertebral fractures may occur following discontinuation of Prolia treatment, particularly in 
patients with a history of vertebral fracture. 
The overall benefit-risk profile for Prolia remains favourable in the approved indications. 
Comment:  
MAH interpretation of the data is that in subjects who sustained a new vertebral fracture after Prolia 
cessation, there is a greater incidence of multiple vertebral fractures than in subjects discontinuing 
placebo. However, the total number of vertebral fractures is lower.  
The MAH is requested to present a rationale or a biologically plausible mechanism of why treatment 
cessation would not increase single vertebral fractures but only ≥2 vertebral fractures.

4.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes 
were the following:  
Multiple vertebral fractures following discontinuation of Prolia treatment is considered as an 
important identified risk. 
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The proposed changes to the RMP are not acceptable at this time point.  RMP version remains as the 
latest approved.  
4.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
(The MAH changes proposed to the SmPC are indicated by bold italics for additions and by 
strikethrough for text that has been deleted.) 
MAH proposes to add the following language in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use: 
Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Prolia Treatment 
Multiple vertebral fractures may occur following discontinuation of treatment with Prolia, 
particularly in patients with a history of vertebral fracture.   
Advise patients not to interrupt Prolia therapy without their physician’s advice.  Evaluate 
the individual benefit/risk before discontinuing treatment with Prolia.  If Prolia treatment 
is discontinued, consider transitioning to an alternative antiresorptive therapy. 
MAH has added the Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Prolia Treatment 
to adverse drug reactions (ADR) table as an uncommon ADR and added following text in Section 4.8 
Undesirable effects: 
Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Prolia Treatment 
In the osteoporosis clinical trial program, multiple vertebral fractures were reported 
uncommonly in patients following discontinuation of treatment with Prolia, particularly in 
those with a history of vertebral fractures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/493205/2017 
Page 14/46 
 
  
  
 
Based on the clinical trial case reports from the Amgen Global Safety Database (8 cases) and the 34 
subjects with MVF from the 20030216 and 20060289 combined analysis, the frequency is ~0.18% 
(42/32,148 clinical trial subjects as of PBRER9 data cut-off).  Therefore, MVF following 
discontinuation of Prolia treatment is considered Uncommon. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is proposed to be updated accordingly, as follows: 
If you stop using Prolia 
To get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use Prolia for as long as your doctor 
prescribes it for you. Please talk to your doctor before you consider stopping the treatment. 
After your treatment with Prolia is stopped, it is possible that broken bones in your spine 
may occur especially if you have a history of broken bones in the spine. Do not stop taking 
Prolia without first talking with your doctor. If your Prolia treatment is stopped, discuss 
other available treatment options with your doctor. 
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
• 
• 
• 
fever, vomiting and abdominal pain or discomfort (diverticulitis),  
ear infection, 
broken bones in the spine after stopping Prolia (multiple vertebral fractures). 
Comment:  
The proposed changes are not accepted.

supplementary information 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1  
The main study 20060289 baseline characteristics of patients who discontinued (with and without 
follow-up) during study 20060289 should be compared with patients who completed this extension 
study. The Applicant is asked to comment any differences in reasons for discontinuation between 
denosumab arms with different treatment durations.

Table 2. Study 20060289 Reasons for Investigational Product Discontinuation 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Subjects who discontinued follow-up study 20060289 were approximately two years older (76 years) 
than subjects who completed the study (74 years). Subjects who discontinued had also more 
baseline vertebral fractures and prior non-vertebral fractures as well as lower baseline total hip BMD 
score. Consequently, calculated 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture/ hip fracture 
were lower in the subjects who completed the study compared to patients who discontinued. 
There were no differences in baseline lumbar spine BMD, sCTX or vitamin D. 
Adverse events were the most common reason for discontinuation in patients with follow up after 
discontinuation (20-25%) whereas “unspecified other reasons” was most common in patients 
without follow-up. Approximately 2% discontinued due to requirement for alternative therapy. 
Conclusion: 
Requested information provided. Issue resolved.  
Question 2  
The MAH is asked to present a complete flow chart of patients in studies 20030216 and 20060289. 
The flow chart should include the number of patients in different treatment arms who: 
a. discontinued without any follow-up, 
b. discontinued and had off-treatment follow-up as defined by the MAH 
c. completed the studies

Question 3  
The main baseline characteristics of patients who discontinued (with and without follow-up) during 
study 20030216 should be compared with patients who completed this placebo-controlled study. The 
Applicant is asked to comment any differences in reasons for discontinuation in the placebo and 
denosumab groups, respectively.

Table 4. Study 20030216 Reasons for Investigational Product Discontinuation 
Study 20030216 baseline characteristics and reasons for investigational product (IP) discontinuation 
in subjects who received at least 1 dose of IP and discontinued IP with and without follow-up are 
presented in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. 
No meaningful differences in age, prior vertebral fracture status, lumbar spine and total hip bone 
mineral density (BMD) T-scores, body mass index (BMI), serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen 
(CTX) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations, or 10-year probability of a hip fracture or a major 
osteoporotic fracture were observed between subjects who discontinued IP (with or without post-IP 
discontinuation follow-up) and subjects who completed the IP. 
The same pattern of reasons for IP discontinuation was observed between subjects who discontinued 
IP with follow-up and those who discontinued IP without follow-up in both treatment groups (ie, 
placebo and denosumab). Within each treatment group, the percentage of subjects who discontinued 
IP due to an adverse event, subject request, requirement for an alternative therapy, and disease 
progression was numerically higher among those subjects who discontinued IP and remained 
on-study compared with those who discontinued IP and study participation. The percentage of 
subjects who discontinued IP due to withdrawal of consent, death, or ineligibility determined was 
numerically higher among those subjects who discontinued IP and remained on-study compared with 
those who discontinued IP and study participation. Furthermore, as expected, requirement for 
alternative therapy and disease progression as reasons for discontinuation were numerically higher 
among subjects who discontinued placebo (with post-IP discontinuation follow-up) compared with 
subjects who discontinued denosumab (with post-IP discontinuation follow-up). None of these small 
differences, however, are likely to affect the outcomes of the analyses.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Subjects who discontinued placebo-controlled study 20030216 were 1-2 years older (73-74 years) 
than subjects who completed the study (72 years).  
Subjects who discontinued had also more baseline vertebral fractures and prior non-vertebral 
fractures as well as lower baseline total hip BMD score. Consequently, calculated 10-year 
probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture/ hip fracture were lower in the subjects who completed 
the study compared to patients who discontinued. 
There were no major differences in baseline lumbar spine BMD, BMI, sCTX or vitamin D. 
The baseline characteristics of patients who discontinued vs those who continued in study 20030216 
was very similar to the study 20060289. 
Adverse events were the most common reason for discontinuation in patients with follow up after 
discontinuation (26-32%) whereas “consent withdrawn” was most common in patients without 
follow-up. 
Of note, 12.8% in the placebo group discontinued due to requirement of alternative therapy vs. 7.3% 
in the denosumab group. Besides the underlying reasons for discontinuation such as concomitant 
other serious diseases, different therapeutic strategies after discontinuation may affect the fracture 
outcomes after discontinuation.  
Conclusion: 
Requested information provided. Issue resolved.  
Question 4  
The MAH is requested to calculate the fracture rates as well as exposure adjusted subject incidences 
during the placebo-controlled study 20030216 for patients in the placebo and denosumab arms: 1. 
for patients who completed study 20030216; 2. for patients who discontinued - while they still were 
on treatment; 3. for patients who discontinued - when they were off-treatment. 
Response: 
As most vertebral fractures are morphometric vertebral fractures, and their identification depends on 
scheduled spine x-rays without exact fracture date, vertebral fractures have always been analyzed as 
a subject incidence endpoint in pivotal fracture trials of osteoporosis medications, including Study 
20030216. In order to enable comparisons between on- and off-treatment fracture incidences in 
subjects with varying follow-up time, both crude rate and exposure-adjusted subject incidences are 
reported. 
Crude and exposure-adjusted vertebral fracture incidence rates for subjects who (1) completed the 
investigational product (IP), (2) discontinued IP with follow-up, or (3) discontinued IP without 
follow-up in the placebo and denosumab arms of Study 20030216 are presented in Table 5. These 
data show the following: 
1. As expected, both crude and exposure-adjusted on-treatment subject incidence rates were higher 
in the placebo, as compared to the denosumab group, in subjects who completed the IP, those who 
discontinued IP with follow-up, and those who discontinued IP without follow-up. 
Assessment report  
EMA/493205/2017 
Page 22/46 
 
  
  
 
 
2. Within each treatment group (ie, placebo or denosumab), both crude and exposure-adjusted 
subject incidence rates were higher among subjects who discontinued IP with follow-up compared to 
those who discontinued IP without follow-up. 
3. As expected, exposure-adjusted off-treatment subject incidence rate of new vertebral fracture was 
higher compared to the on-treatment rate in the denosumab, but not the placebo treatment group. 
4. The exposure-adjusted subject incidence rate of new vertebral fracture following placebo 
discontinuation was higher compared to the incidence rate following denosumab discontinuation. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Subjects who completed denosumab treatment had the lowest vertebral fracture incidences. 
Subjects who completed placebo treatment had significantly lower fracture incidences compared to 
subjects who discontinued placebo. The proportion discontinuing treatment was not proportional 
between placebo and denosumab groups among those with follow-up. The incidence rates above are 
therefore not directly comparable. In addition, the off-treatment new vertebral fracture subject 
incidences are not sufficiently precise to allow a conclusion that it is different in placebo or 
denosumab treated subjects after discontinuation. 
The Applicant has not presented data on all vertebral fractures (fracture rates) in the study but only 
subject incidences. The scope of the variation was specifically multiple vertebral fractures, and the 
rate of all fractures after discontinuation (independently if they occurred in the same or different 
patients) should be presented. The data currently available does not justify a warning for increased 
MVF incidence after treatment discontinuation. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved.

Question 5  
Similar calculations as in question 4 (fracture rates as well as exposure adjusted subject incidences) 
are requested for the extension study 20060289:  
1. For patients who completed study 20060289; 2. for patients who discontinued – while they still 
were on treatment; 3. for patients who discontinued - when they were off treatment. 
Response: 
As most vertebral fractures are morphometric vertebral fractures, and their identification depends on 
scheduled spine x-rays without exact fracture date, vertebral fractures have always been analyzed as 
a subject incidence endpoint in pivotal fracture trials of osteoporosis medications, including Study 
20060289. 
Crude and exposure-adjusted vertebral fracture incidence rates for subjects who (1) completed the 
investigational product (IP), (2) discontinued IP with follow-up, or(3) discontinued IP without 
follow-up in the long-term and cross-over groups of Study 20060289 are presented in Table 6.  
These data show the following: 
1. As expected, the on-treatment crude vertebral fracture subject incidence rates were slightly higher 
among subjects who completed the study compared to those who discontinued IP (with or without 
follow-up) in both the long-term and cross-over groups, because the former subjects (who completed 
all 14 injections) were in the study longer than the latter. 
2. Exposure-adjusted vertebral fracture subject incidence rates were similar across subjects who 
completed the IP, discontinued IP with follow-up, and discontinued IP without follow-up, in both the 
long-term and cross-over groups. 
3. Finally, both crude and exposure-adjusted off-treatment vertebral fracture subject incidence rates 
were higher compared to the on-treatment incidence rates within each group, but similar between 
the long-term and cross-over groups.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant has not presented data on all vertebral fractures (fracture rates) in the study as 
requested but only subject incidences. The scope of the variation was specifically multiple vertebral 
fractures, and the rate of all fractures after discontinuation (independently if they occurred in the 
same or different patients) should be presented before final conclusions.  
In Table 6,  the MAH has presented baseline data for the cross over group at time for cross over, but 
for the long-term denosumab group at start of the initial study; i.e. 3 years earlier. This was not the 
data presentation asked for, and these data are not readily comparable. This table should be updated 
and show the numbers of new vertebral fractures (on and off treatment) at baseline of study 
20060289, as requested and indicated in the heading of the table (RSI). 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
Question 6  
The MAH is requested to present available data on fracture rates as well as exposure 
adjusted subject incidences for patients who completed study 20060289 and had 
follow-up thereafter, with or without treatment.

Response: 
Study 20060289 completed in 2015 after up to 10 years of treatment with denosumab did not include 
further study subject follow-up after the trial ended. However, fracture data are available for a 
number of subjects who completed the study as a result of post-marketing safety reports and 
scientific publications, as follows: 
• Post-marketing safety reports indicated that 11 women who completed Study 20060289 at 2 sites 
(#761 in Estonia and #791 in Latvia) sustained vertebral fracture following denosumab 
discontinuation. On 01 December 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
requested additional information on the number of subjects who may have been at risk for vertebral 
fracture following denosumab discontinuation who were enrolled at the above 2 sites. There were 146 
subjects at the 2 study sites (Site 761, Estonia, N = 125; Site 791, Latvia, N = 21) who completed the 
Month 84 visit of Study 20060289, 11 of whom experienced vertebral fracture after study completion. 
Amgen also provided additional information to further characterize this cohort of 146 subjects to 
describe their degree of skeletal fragility. The results of these analyses are included in the response 
to question (RTQ) submitted to the US FDA on 13 December 2016, which is attached. 
• Two abstracts presented at the 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 
Annual Meeting reported the results of a follow-up study conducted by 2 different Study 20060289 
Investigators - 1 in Argentina and 1 in Switzerland: 
o The Argentina Investigator aimed at describing the changes in bone mineral density and occurrence 
of fragility fractures in a group of 38 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who had been 
enrolled in and completed Study 20060289 at that site. Among the 38 study participants, 17 women 
had received denosumab for 7 years, and 21 women for 10 years; none of the women had received 
bisphosphonate after denosumab discontinuation. Mean gap time between last denosumab dose in 
Study 20060289 and post-denosumab discontinuation follow-up was 17 ± 1 months (range: 16-20 
months). The study showed that 4 subjects sustained a new vertebral fracture and 1 subject 
sustained a wrist fracture upon stopping treatment (Zanchetta et al, 2016;). 
o In Switzerland, 9 study participants who had received 10 years of denosumab therapy were 
evaluated 1 year after trial completion. All women were reported to have experienced bone loss by 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). No clinical fractures were reported, though 1 former study 
participant was noted to have a morphometric vertebral fracture by DXA (Popp et al, 2016;). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Study 20060289 was completed in 2015 and did not include further formal study subject follow-up 
after the trial ended. Results from a randomized withdrawal could have been informative. The 
scientific value of stimulated reports of fractures occurring after treatment is low as multiple fractures 
occur in this high risk population also without treatment and during treatment. 
Issue not further pursued.

Question 7  
The MAH claims that Prolia treatment cessation does increase risk of single vertebral 
fractures but only ≥ 2 vertebral fractures. The MAH should discuss any biologically 
plausible mechanism/rationale of this. 
Response: 
Amgen has performed multiple ad-hoc analyses from Studies 20030216 and 20060289 to investigate 
possible risk factors for the higher incidence of multiple, but not single, vertebral fracture following 
denosumab discontinuation. 
Of note, the duration of follow-up was shorter for those subjects who sustained single vertebral 
fracture (median 0.65 years) compared with those who sustained multiple vertebral fracture (MVF) 
(median 1.67 years) in the extension Study 20060289, and it is possible that additional vertebral 
fracture events might have been observed in subjects with off-treatment single new vertebral 
fracture, had the follow-up period been longer. 
No meaningful differences were detected between subjects who sustained only single off-treatment 
new vertebral fracture and those who sustained multiple off-treatment new vertebral fracture with 
respect to a number of potential risk factors, including number of denosumab doses received, age 
and bone mineral density (BMD) T-score at the beginning of the off-treatment period, serum 
C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at Study 20030216 baseline, or distribution or severity of 
off-treatment vertebral fracture. 
Notably, among subjects with available total hip BMD data during the off-treatment period in Studies 
20030216 and 20060289, mean annualized off-treatment BMD loss was greatest among subjects 
who sustained multiple off-treatment vertebral fracture and greater among those who sustained 
single off-treatment vertebral fracture compared with those with no off-treatment vertebral fracture 
(+0.6% and –1.9% after stopping placebo and denosumab, respectively, for those with no 
off-treatment vertebral fracture; -1.3% and -2.2% for those with single off-treatment vertebral 
fracture; and -1.2% and -3.5% for those with multiple off-treatment vertebral fracture). 
Therefore, a larger and/or more rapid BMD loss after denosumab discontinuation may contribute to 
explain the higher risk of multiple, but not single, vertebral fracture following denosumab 
discontinuation, as compared to placebo discontinuation. 
The mechanism for an increased risk of MVF following cessation of Prolia therapy is currently 
unknown.  
In the osteoprotegerin (OPG) knockout mouse, where RANK/RANKL interaction permits osteoclast, 
formation, and survival, osteoporosis develops due to increased osteoclast activity in the absence of 
OPG. These mice develop spontaneous fractures early in life. The severity of osteoporosis in OPG 
knockout mice demonstrates that the skeleton is unable to compensate for the lack of endogenous 
OPG. This finding highlights the essential role for OPG in protecting bone (Bucay et al, 1998; Min et 
al, 2000). 
This preclinical model may provide a surrogate for biological plausibility where cessation of 
denosumab permits RANK/RANKL activity for a transient period of time until the bone mechanostat 
resets activity to baseline level. The bone mechanostat concept suggests that skeletons, even those 
with low bone mass, appear to possess a bone mineral density “set point” that might be genetically 
determined (Frost, 1987). The bone mechanosensory concept hypothesizes that each individual has 
Assessment report  
EMA/493205/2017 
Page 27/46 
 
  
  
 
a pre-set level of bone density and remodeling that is influenced by a variety of genetic and 
biomechanical stressors on the skeleton. Bone mass could not return to this set point from a higher 
level of bone mass without an increase in bone resorption above baseline. Consistent with this 
concept, discontinuation of denosumab treatment would be associated with increases in 
RANK/RANKL - and subsequent bone remodeling as measured by biochemical markers of bone 
turnover - to values above baseline that subsequently return to the skeleton’s individual setpoint. 
With this transient increase in remodelling, bone loss would be expected to be more marked in 
cancellous than cortical bone, because the former has greater surface area over which bone 
resorption can take place. This is the reason why trabecular-rich regions, such as the spine, have 
higher incidence of fracture at times of rapid bone turnover. Therefore, the rapid BMD loss that occurs 
after denosumab discontinuation may contribute to a higher risk of vertebral compression fractures in 
susceptible subjects, such as those who have a history of fragility fracture. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
There is no known mechanism for an increased risk of multiple but not single vertebral fractures 
following cessation of Prolia therapy. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been 
updated accordingly. 
Question 8  
The MAH is asked to comment if any possible increased risk of vertebral fractures after 
Prolia discontinuation would depend on preceding treatment duration. 
Response: 
Amgen has performed multiple ad-hoc analyses from Studies 20030216 and 20060289 to investigate 
possible risk factors for off-treatment vertebral fracture. Multiple logistic regression models with 
stepwise selection procedure were used to identify possible determinants of off-treatment vertebral 
fracture risk, which also included Prolia treatment duration. Duration of Prolia treatment was not a 
significant determinant of either any (ie, single or multiple) or multiple off-treatment vertebral 
fracture. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
According to Applicant, duration of Prolia treatment was not a significant determinant of either any 
(ie, single or multiple) or multiple off-treatment vertebral fracture. These analyses were not 
submitted by the MAH for assessment. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued here. The table 2 in the RSI will inform about the off-treatment fractures in 
the cross-over and long-term denosumab groups.

6.  Assessment of the responses to the 2nd request for 
supplementary information 
Question 1 
The MAH’s claim for a label update concerns multiple vertebral fractures.  The incidence of 
all fractures after discontinuation (independently if they occurred in the same or different 
patients) should be presented in the study 20030216 and 20060289, not only subject 
incidences, before final conclusions.  This was not presented in the previous round as 
requested.  In addition, in the previous round, a table that mixed data from study 
20030216 was provided for the long-term denosumab group.  The MAH should pay 
attention to what is asked for and present numbers for vertebral fractures for the 
long-term denosumab group in study 20060289 this time in the table 2 below, as 
indicated in the table heading. 
The MAH is asked to fill in numbers to the three tables below, in order to clarify the 
available study data after discontinuations in the four different study population arms.  
95% confidence intervals should be provided for the fracture incidence and subject 
incidence rates.

Response: 
Table 1 provides an off-treatment summary of subjects included in Study 20030216 taking placebo or 
denosumab.  Table 2 provides an off-treatment summary of subjects included in Study 20060289 in 
both the cross-over denosumab, and long-term denosumab treatment groups.  Table 3 provides an 
off-treatment summary of subjects included in both Studies 20030216 and 20060289. 
The analysis including subjects from both Study 20030216 and Study 20060289 (Table 3), combined 
to increase the sample size, shows that exposure-adjusted new vertebral fracture incidence during 
the off-treatment period is numerically higher among subjects who discontinued denosumab in Study 
20030216 or Study 20060289 compared with those who discontinued placebo in Study 20030216 
(17.5 versus 12.7 per 100 subject-years).  Consistent with the analyses previously submitted, while 
the incidence of single off-treatment new vertebral fracture is numerically lower among subjects who 
discontinued denosumab compared with those who discontinued placebo (2.2% versus 4.0%), more 
subjects who discontinued denosumab sustained > 1 off-treatment new vertebral fracture, especially 
4 or more new vertebral fractures, compared with those who discontinued placebo (Table 3).  While 
there is no apparent imbalance in off-treatment new vertebral fracture incidence between subjects 
who discontinued denosumab and those who discontinued placebo in Study 20030216 (Table 1), it 
has to be taken into account that subjects in Study 20030216 were younger than in Study 20060289 
and, as a result, their overall fracture risk was lower than in the extension study.  In fact, the number 
of subjects sustaining > 1 new vertebral fracture after denosumab discontinuation increases from Study 
20030216 (Table 1) to Study 20060289 (Table 2), thus supporting the results of the combined analysis (Table 3).

Assessment of the MAH’s responses: 
The MAH has provided tables as requested. 
In study 20030216, rate of off-treatment new vertebral fractures was identical in the subjects who 
discontinued placebo and in the subjects that discontinued denosumab: 12.7 and 12.4 per 100 
subject-years. There were no imbalances in patients who had two, three or four vertebral 
off-treatment fractures. 
These groups had comparable baseline risk with regard to age and baseline risk. 
In study 20060289, off-treatment new vertebral fractures rate was slightly higher in the subjects 
who discontinued long-term denosumab (21.9 per 100 subject-years) compared to the subjects that 
discontinued cross-over denosumab (17.1 per 100 subject-years). There number of patients who had 
two, three or four vertebral off-treatment fractures was low and there was no pattern that this would 
be more common in any group. 
The rate of on-treatment vertebral fractures seems similar in long-term and cross-over groups. 
Compared to study 20030216, the off-treatment new vertebral fractures rates as well as >2 
vertebral fractures in study 20060289 were higher. This could at least partly be explained that the 
patients who discontinued study 20060289 were older. It is clear that any direct comparison that 
mixes off-treatment vertebral fracture data from these two studies is not valid. 
Conclusion: 
The Assessment report and conclusions have been updated accordingly.

Response: 
The table has been updated, consistent with the Agency’s request (see Table 4). 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses: 
The table has been updated as requested. 
In study 20060289, off-treatment new vertebral fractures rate was slightly higher in the subjects 
who discontinued long-term denosumab (21.9 per 100 subject-years) compared to the subjects that 
discontinued cross-over denosumab (17.1 per 100 subject-years).

The rate of on-treatment vertebral fractures seems similar in long-term and cross-over groups. 
Compared to study 20030216, the off-treatment new vertebral fractures rates in study 20060289 
were higher. This could at least partly be explained that the patients who discontinued study 
20060289 were older. It is clear that a comparison that mixes off-treatment vertebral fracture data 
from these two studies is not valid. 
Conclusion: 
The Assessment report and conclusions have been updated accordingly.

Question 4 
Currently, the data does not support a conclusion that justifies a warning for increased 
MVF incidence following treatment discontinuation, see section 2.  The Applicant should 
comment how they plan to communicate these conclusions in light of the contradictory 
information that they have previously circulated. 
Response: 
Amgen acknowledges that the identification of the new risk of multiple vertebral fracture (MVF) 
following discontinuation of Prolia treatment is based on data that are inherently limited:  the original 
report is a case series with a subsequent expansion of cases (Lamy et al, 2017; Aubry-Rozier et al, 
2016), the Amgen analyses are derived from ad hoc analyses of a completed clinical trial that was not 
prospectively designed to assess long-term off-treatment follow-up.  The findings of the submitted 
analyses indicate that (1) discontinuation of Prolia treatment is associated with an increased risk for 
vertebral fracture, which rapidly returns to levels comparable to those observed in subjects who 
received placebo (Brown et al, 2016a), and (2) among subjects who sustained a new vertebral 
fracture after discontinuing denosumab, the incidence of multiple new vertebral fractures was higher 
than in subjects who discontinued placebo (Brown et al, 2016a).   
Amgen has reached out to scientific experts from several regions to seek advice on the analyses.  
Furthermore, several of these scientific experts have worked independently on data analyses from 
Studies 20030216 and 20060289 to further characterise the risk; their findings and conclusions are 
reported in a manuscript submitted for publication and currently under review (Cummings et al, 
unpublished data, 2017).  The advice and conclusions corroborated Amgen’s point of view that MVF 
following Prolia discontinuation is a risk for patients, particularly in those with a history of vertebral 
fracture.   
As a result, Amgen believes it is important to communicate this information to healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) to help ensure that prescribers have all available information to help inform 
management decisions in patients with osteoporosis at increased risk for fracture.  Therefore, Amgen 
has updated Prolia’s Core Data Sheet (CDS) to indicate that (1) just like the decision to initiate 
treatment, the decision to discontinue treatment should be made under a physician’s supervision, 
and (2) transition to an alternative antiresorptive therapy should be considered for patients who 
discontinue treatment with Prolia.  The latter (# 2) precaution for use is consistent with the 
recommendation provided by an independent medical advisor in the expert review contained in the 
analysis on the risk of MVF (Period Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safety Update Report 
Number 10 Section 16.2.3.1) and in publications presented at multiple international scientific 
congresses (Brown et al, 2017; Ferrari et al, 2017; Brown et al, 2016a; Brown et al, 2016b). 
Information on this risk and recommended mitigation strategy has entailed a comprehensive 
communication plan, which included: 
• 
ongoing clinical trials of denosumab to inform them of the newly identified risk and provide advice on 
A Dear Investigator Letter (DIL), issued on 13 May 2016 to all investigators involved in 
mitigation strategies. 
 
 
 
• 
Warnings and Precautions for Use of Prolia’s CDS version 18 (27 May 2016).  Regions where this 
Regional prescribing information updates, consistent with the updated Section 4.4 Special

been presented at international scientific congresses (Brown et al, 2017; Ferrari et al, 2017; Brown 
et al, 2016a; Brown et al, 2016b) and are summarized in a manuscript authored by independent 
scientific experts, currently submitted for publication. 
Amgen believes that this comprehensive communication strategy will help enable fulfilment of its 
duty to inform HCPs and patients of this newly identified risk and ensure patients who discontinue 
Prolia are adequately assessed, followed up, and treated (as appropriate).  Amgen will continue to 
monitor this important identified risk through routine pharmacovigilance as included in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses: 
The data does not support a conclusion that justifies a warning for increased MVF incidence following 
treatment discontinuation. The fact that these ad hoc analyses have been published does not change 
the fact that the rate of new vertebral fractures following discontinuation of Prolia and placebo were 
similar. The MAH seems not willing to communicate this information. Therefore, a detailed EPAR is 
important in order to communicate the outcome of the variation and the rationale of rejecting the 
proposed changes.  
Conclusion: 
The Assessment report and conclusions have been updated accordingly.

SI.1  
Indication 
Sotrovimab is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and 
over and weighing at least 40 kg) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not 
require oxygen supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe 
COVID-19. 
Incidence  and Prevalence 
On the 31st December 2019 a cluster of ‘pneumonia of unknown cause’, centred on the 
city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, was reported to the China Country Office 
of the World Health Organisation (WHO) (ProMed 2019). The aetiological agent, a novel 
coronavirus, was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it caused termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Infection spread rapidly around the globe, facilitated by air travel and a high lev el of 
transmissibility, and the WHO declared a public health emergency of international 
concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020 and a global pandemic on 11th March 2020. In 
late 2020, it was identified that viral variants had emerged. Variants of concern (VOCs) 
are those where there is clear evidence indicating a significant impact on transmissibility, 
severity and/or immunity. As of June 2021, circulating VOCs in the EU/EAA region 
include the Alpha [UK] (B.1.1.7), Beta [South Africa] (B.1.351), Gamma [Brazil] (P.1), 
and Delta [India] (B.1.617) [ECDC, 2021]. 
As of 01 June 2021, approximately 173 million cases and 3.7 million deaths from 
COVID 19 were reported globally [Johns Hopkins, 2021]. Approximately 32 801 529 
cases and 729 953 deaths (as of 11 June 2021) were reported in the European Union 
(EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) [ECDC, 2021]. Initially, incidence data were 
focused in Asia, with the index country of China accounting for the majority (93%) of the 
88,000 cases reported in January & February 2020 [ECDC, 2021]. By March, however, 
the infection had spread to Europe and North America. From mid-March 2020, the 
incidence in the EU/EAA region started to rise (Figure 1), and non-pharmaceutical 
interventions (NPIs) such as lockdowns were implemented [ECDC, 2021]. By the end of 
April 2020, the initial wave had exceeded its peak and a decreasing incidence was 
generally reported over the northern hemisphere summer. However, from the end of 
August, an increasingly substantial rise in COVID-19 cases was observed until 
November (peak incidence: 581 per 100,000 persons) [ECDC, 2021]. A third wave set in 
around March 2021, reaching its peak in mid-April and has been since declining. As of 
30 May 2021, the 14-day case notification rate for the EU/EEA was 111 (country range: 
10–312) per 100 000 population (based on data collected by ECDC from official national 
sources in 28 countries) [ECDC, 2021]. The incidence in the first versus the subsequent 
peaks are likely heavily influenced by the change in testing strategies over the course of 
the pandemic.

Demographics  of the population  in the authorised  indication

Non-Hospitalized  Patients 
Age & Sex 
Age-sex distributions of cases in the EU/EAA region reported for non -hospitalized (mild 
severity) hospitalized and severely hospitalized cases are shown in Figure 2 [ECDC, 
2021]. Non-hospitalized cases tend to be females and are younger than those who are 
hospitalized or hospitalized with severe disease. In a European multi-centre study by 
Lechien, 2020, the mean age of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (consisting of 
non-hospitalized [92%] and hospitalized without intensive care [8%] patients) was 37 
years, which is in line with estimates from the literature in US and China non-
hospitalized populations [Hsu, 2020; Lechien, 2020; Tenforde, 2020; van Gerwen, 2020; 
Xu, 2020]. In the same study, Lechien, 2020 reported that 67% of patients with mild-to-
moderate COVID-19 were female. Similarly, other studies in the US and China have also 
observed a higher proportion of females to males in the outpatient setting [Bergquist, 
2020; Hsu, 2020; Tenforde, 2020; van Gerwen, 2020; Xu, 2020].

Race/Ethnicity 
Data on the racial and ethnic characteristics among non-hospitalized and hospitalized 
patients remain limited. It has been suggested that among adult patients with COVID-19, 
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately affected, perhaps related 
to underlying health conditions and economic and social conditions [Razai, 2021]. 
Racialized populations tend to have less access to testing, higher rates of severe disease, 
higher mortality rates and worse sequalae when they survive the infection [Melchior, 
2021]. The current evidence suggests that race/ethnicity differences tend to exist between 
hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, though data are mostly based on US studies 
[Lechien, 2020; Tenforde, 2020; van Gerwen, 2020] (Table 2).

Risk factors for the disease  
There is increasing breadth of literature describing factors associated with increased risk 
of infection, severe disease, and mortality. Those at greatest risk of infection include 
healthcare and other essential workers, household contacts of infected individuals, 
persons with prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with an 
infected person, members of minority ethnic/racial groups, and populations living in 
high-density neighbourhoods [Ahrenfeldt, 2021; Allen, 2020; Chou, 2020; Li, 2020; 
Moore, 2020; Wiersinga, 2020]. 
Similar risk factors have been identified for both progression to severe disease and 
mortality, including lifestyle (current smoking and higher body mass index  [BMI]), 
12 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
demographic factors (age over 65, male gender, minority race/ethnicity), and presence of 
pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, 
history of heart failure, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
solid organ tumours, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune 
compromised status, neurologic conditions) [ECDC, 2021; Gold, 2020; Jordan, 2020; 
Weiss, 2020; Zheng, 2020]. 
SI.1.2 
The main existing  treatment options 
Monoclonal antibodies have been proposed as a potential early treatment modality in 
patients at risk for progression of COVID-19 as manifested by the requirement for 
hospitalization and oxygen support. Additionally, treatment with a mAb has the potential 
to both reduce symptoms and reduce disease duration of COVID-19, leading to a 
decrease in the risk of transmission. 
As of June 2021, no mAb treatment of COVID-19 has been granted a marketing 
authorisation in the EU. The CHMP reached a positive scientific opinion following a 
referral under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004 for regdanvimab (adults only), 
casirivimab-imdevimab; and bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, for 
the indication of “For the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over 
and weighing at least 40 kg) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not 
require oxygen supplementation and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-
19.” 
While data on these mAbs have demonstrated proof-of-principle that these products are 
capable of reducing the need for hospitalization, some, such as Lilly mAb bamlanivimab, 
have limited activity against several viral variants (including the California 
[B.1.427/B.1.429], South Africa [B.1.351], Brazil [P.1], and New York [B.1.256] 
variants).For the casirivimab and imdevimab combination only one of the two mAbs in 
the combination retains efficacy for certain variants, such as the South Africa [B.1.351] 
variant. 
SI.1.3  
Natural history of the indicated  condition  in the (untreated) 
population,  including  mortality and morbidity 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, i ncluding 
morbidity and mortality  
The natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the associated clinical manifestations, 
vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe disease that may include 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, Multisystem Inflammatory 
Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), multi-organ failure and death [Feng, 2020; Kaur, 2020]. 
The WHO Clinical Progression Scale measures patient illness by tracking progress 
through the health-care system. Clinical manifestations are categorized into ‘uninfected’, 
‘ambulatory (mild disease)’, ‘hospitalized (moderate disease)’, ‘hospitalized (severe 
disease)’, and ‘dead’ and provides a measure of illness severity across a range from 0 (not 
infected) to 10 (dead). [WHO, 2020a] Approximately 80% of infections present 
asymptomatically or as mild disease, 15% result in severe disease requiring oxygen 
therapy, and 5% are critical cases requiring ventilation [Lauretani, 2020]. 
13 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately one third of all cases [Oran, 
2020], whilst individual study estimates range from 18% to 81% [Nikolai, 2020]. Age 
appears to strongly dictate asymptomatic carriage: in a study of index case contacts in 
Italy asymptomatic rates of 81.9%, 70.5% and 35.5% were observed in 0-19, 40-59, and 
80+ year old age groups respectively [Poletti, 2020]. Both asymptomatic and 
symptomatic persons are capable of transmitting disease, and notwithstanding a limited 
understanding of the role of asymptomatic spread, the risk of transmission is likely higher 
among symptomatic persons [WHO, 2020b]. 
The incubation period for symptomatic infection ranges from 0-24 days, with shorter 
periods (5-7 or 14 days) most commonly reported [Feng, 2020; Shi, 2020; Siordia, 2020].  
In the first phase of the infection, patients most often experience mild symptoms (e.g. 
fever, cough, malaise) which persist for approximately eight days, and progressive lung 
lesions can be observed approximately a week after onset [Asokan, 2020; Sheervalilou, 
2020]. Among adults, symptoms including fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnoea (55%), 
and myalgia (44%) predominate during this time [Lauretani, 2020; Tang, 2020] and a 
loss of taste and/or smell helps differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other infectious 
aetiologies [Zhou, 2020]. When present, the most common symptoms experienced by 
children include fever (59.1%), cough (55.9%), and rhinorrhoea/nasal congestion 
(20.0%), while myalgia/fatigue (18.7%), sore throat (18.2%), shortness of 
breath/dyspnoea (11.7%), abdominal pain/diarrhoea (6.5%), vomiting/nausea (5.4%), 
headache/dizziness (4.3%), pharyngeal erythema (3.3%), decreased oral intake (1.7%), 
and rash (0.25%) were also reported [Hoang, 2020]. 
A progression to lung involvement, which comprises the second phase of infe ction, 
occurs 7-10 days after the development of initial symptoms [Kowalik, 2020]. Patients 
experiencing this phase of disease generally require hospitalization and supportive care. 
According to data collected on 340,312 cases across 54 countries (includin g several 
EU/EAA countries and the United Kingdom) from and the International Severe Acute 
Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), the symptoms most 
commonly reported upon admission to hospital include shortness of breath, cough, 
history of fever, fatigue/malaise, and altered consciousness/confusion [ISARIC 
Consortium, 2021]. Laboratory results may indicate lymphopenia and elevated 
transaminases, and chest imaging reveal bilateral pulmonary infiltrates [Gouveia, 2020]. 
Progression to ARDS occurs between 8-14 days following symptom onset and the 
median time to requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission is 10 days [Asokan, 
2020; Tang, 2020]. The third and most severe phase of infection is largely extra-
pulmonary and occurs within 2-3 weeks of initial symptom presentation. Notable features 
include extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome, severe pneumonia, 
septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and multiple organ failure. [Gouveia, 
2020; Malik, 2020]. Irregular reticular opacities mixed with ground glass opacities can be 
identified by chest CT in the fourth week [Sheervalilou, 2020]. Paediatric Multisystem 
Inflammatory Syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) has emerged as 
a late-stage complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in children and recently a 
similar syndrome in adults Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Adults (MIS A) has 
been observed [Feldstein, 2020; Morris, 2020]. MIS-C is similar in presentation to 
Kawasaki disease (KD) or Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)]. The condition is characterized 
14 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
by a severe auto-inflammatory disorder involving two or more multiple organ systems 
(cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, or neurological) 
[Malik, 2020]. 
Data suggests that some patients experience persistent symptoms or prolonged organ 
dysfunction up to 6 months after their original COVID-19 illness has resolved. This has, 
generally, been referred to as post-acute COVID-19 and can occur even after relatively 
mild acute illness. Depending on the definitions, population studied, setting, and the 
study design, between 13%-87% of patients report ≥1 persistent symptom(s) 3 or more 
weeks following initial symptoms [Nalbandian, 2021; Sudre, 2021]. The most commonly 
reported symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 include fatigue, dyspnoea, continued loss of 
smell or taste, and cognitive issues such as “brain fog” [Carfi, 2020; Garrigues, 2020; 
Logue, 2021; Sudre, 2021]. Clinical sequelae such as acute kidney injury, new or 
worsening control of existing diabetes mellitus, increased cardiometabolic demand and 
others have also been noted [Nalbandian, 2021]. Approximately 14% of patients with 
COVID-19 experienced new clinical sequalae 3 or more weeks after the acute phase of 
the illness [Daugherty, 2021].  
Morbidity  
COVID-Related Complications  
COVID-related complications include atypical pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS, 
liver injury, acute myocardial injury, acute injury, septic shock, and multiple organ 
failure [Baek, 2020; Cavallo, 2020; Shi, 2020]. Lung damage is most commonly 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, the virus can also cause damage to the 
heart, liver, kidney, brain and intestines [Tang, 2020]. Accumulated data suggest that 
more than one-third of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection might have 
impaired liver function [Cichoż-Lach, 2021]. Hypokalaemia has been documented among 
COVID-19 patients and is likely to increase the risk of dysfunction among the lungs, 
heart, and other organs [Sheervalilou, 2020]. 
Older age, male sex, and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular 
and respiratory tract diseases (asthma and COPD), chronic renal failure, 
hypercholesterolemia, cancer, smoking, and obesity are associated with increased risk of 
complications [Asokan, 2020; Godri, 2020; Gouveia, 2020; Lauretani, 2020]. Cytokine 
storm syndrome is more common among patients with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, 
history of smoking, and lung disease [Gasparyan, 2020]. 
Children generally have good prognosis and recover within 1-2 weeks after symptom 
onset [Cavallo, 2020; Ludvigsson, 2020]; however, complications among critically ill 
children can include septic shock, toxic encephalopathy, multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and status epilepticus [Sun, 2020].

Version 1.0 
Severe Disease/Hospitalizations  
Rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients are also dependent on a number of factors 
including age, geography, underlying comorbidities, and VOCs. As demonstrated in 
Figure 3, rates of hospitalization and severe hospitalization among the EU/EEA countries 
are also age dependent with increasing risk associated with increased age [ECDC, 2021]. 
The reduced risk of severe hospitalization among the oldest age groups may reflect 
clinical decisions about the use of limited ICU or ventilator capacity and is a pattern that 
is observed in many countries [ECDC, 2021].

17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
Hospitalization for COVID-19 has been associated with diabetes, heart failure, COPD, 
renal disease, obesity, and ischaemic heart disease in the community setting [ECDC, 
2021]. In addition, recent data from 7 EU/EAA countries suggests that viral VOCs Alpha 
[UK] B.1.1.7, Beta [South Africa] (B.1.351), and Gamma [Brazil] (P.1) are associated 
with a higher risk for hospitalisation, and also for ICU admission in age groups < 60 
years [Funk, 2021]. A larger proportion of VOC cases were admitted to hospital (Alpha 
11.0%; Beta 19.3%, and Gamma 20.0%; p < 0.001 for all VOC) and ICU (Alpha 1.4%, 
p = 0.002; Beta 2.3%, p = 0.001 and Gamma 2.1%, p = 0.005) compared with non-VOC 
cases (7.5%, hospitalized and 0.6% requiring ICU) [Funk, 2021]. 
Mortality  
Over the course of the pandemic, reported case fatality rates (CFR) have varied markedly 
by country, reflecting heterogeneity in underlying risk, ascertainment, definitions and 
reporting. As of 11 June 2021, estimates of CFR in the EU/EAA region range from 0.4% 
in Iceland to 4.3% in Bulgaria, with incidence of death ranging from 8 per 100,000 
persons in Iceland to 306 per 100,000 persons in Hungary [Johns Hopkins, 2021a]. 
COVID-19 age-specific mortality varies as well, reported to be 0%-0.1% among patients 
<19 years, 4.3%-10.5% among adults aged 75-84 years, and rising to as high as 17% 
(range 10.4% - 27.3%) among older adults aged >85 years and those with multiple 
comorbidities [Atzrodt, 2020; Feng, 2020]. When asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic 
disease is included, age-specific COVID-19 infection fatality rates were estimated to 
increase exponentially with age from 0.004% (95% CI: 0.003%-0.005%) for 0-34 year 
old to 28.3% (95% CI: 21.8%-36.6%) for ≥85 year old [Levin, 2020]. 
Mortality among cases detected in the community setting is associated with a history of 
heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease [ECDC, 2021]. Estimates of 
mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients range between 14.5% to 40.7% 
[Hansrivijit, 2020; Lala, 2020; Lewnard, 2020; Nimkar, 2020; Tian, 2020; Yan, 2020]. 
Mortality among COVID-19 patients in the ICU is approximately 40% [Shi, 2020]. 
Importantly, CFR estimates will vary over time given improvements in detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 infections and treatment regimens [Kadkhoda, 2020].  
The spread of new circulating viral variants has had a significant impact on mortality 
compared to previously circulating variants, particularly during the second wave of the 
pandemic in Europe [Challen, 2021; Davies, 2021; Jabłońska, 2021]. In the UK, the 28-
day risk of death for the Alpha [UK] B.1.1.7 variant was 64% higher in the community 
than for previously circulating strains in people older than 30 years [Challen, 2021]. 
Mortality risk from the B.1.1.7 variant increases with age [Davies, 2021]. 
Predictors of mortality include older age, male sex, immunosuppression (including 
cancer), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pre-existing respiratory disease 
and/or infection, abnormal kidney function, increased time from onset of disease to 
hospitalization, and elevated procalcitonin levels [Ahrenfeldt, 2021; Asokan, 2020; 
Lauretani, 2020; Shi, 2020; Venter, 2020]. 
The literature includes CFR estimates among COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular 
disease (10.5%), cancer (5.6%-7.6%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic lung disease (6.3%), and 
hypertension (6.0%) [Asokan, 2020; Siordia, 2020].

Important co-morbidities 
Comorbidities  
Evidence suggests that outpatients have a lower number of health conditions than 
inpatients and that specific individual health conditions are less common in outpatients 
than inpatients (Table 3) [ECDC, 2021]. Studies from the US support this finding, with 
the study by van Gerwen, 2020 concluding that patients who were hospitalized were 
more likely to have 2 or more underlying health conditions compared with those not 
hospitalized (P<0.001) [van Gerwen, 2020; Hsu, 2020; Tenforde, 2020].

PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
Key safety findings  from non-clinical  studies and relevance  to human 
usage 
Sotrovimab has undergone a targeted program of nonclinical toxicology studies. The 
nonclinical program was designed and accelerated due to urgency to find effec tive 
medicines for COVID-19 in accordance with the guidance provided in International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S6(R1) and other applicable guidances as pertaining 
to a non-human antiviral target. Consequently, only studies directly and immediately  
relevant to support clinical development were conducted. 
Table 4 
Key Safety Findings from Non-Clinical Studies and their Relevance 
to Human Usage 
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical studies) 
Toxicity including: 
General Toxicity 
In a 2-week repeat  dose (once weekly) IV infusion (10 
mL/kg/hr infusion rate) monkey toxicology study at 
doses up to 500 mg/kg with 105-day recovery period, 
no toxicity was observed.  
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity  
Animal reproductive and developmental toxicology 
studies were not conducted.  No toxicity was identified 
in male or female reproductive organs in young 
(adolescent) male or female monkeys in the repeat-
dose toxicity study (all males were sexually mature 
except one high dose male was peripubertal). In 
addition, no off-target  binding was detected  human 
reproductive tissue, including placenta, in a tissue 
cross-reactivity study, or in a non-GLP human 
embryofoetal protein array. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not 
conducted 
Relevance  to human usage  
Toxicology studies conducted with sotrovimab in 
monkeys did not identify any safety findings of 
clinical concern. 
Since sotrovimab is directed against an 
exogenous viral target, there is no mechanism-
based concern for reproductive or 
developmental toxicity. In addition, no elevated 
clinical concern was identified from evaluation of 
reproductive tissues in the general toxicology 
study or in cross-reactive binding studies. 
Due to their molecular structure and molecular 
weight, mAbs are unlikely to diffuse into cells or 
to interact with DNA. Therefore, mAbs are not 
likely to be genotoxic. Furthermore, there is not 
a mechanism-based theoretical concern for 
carcinogenicity since sotrovimab targets an 
exogenous viral target and is administered as a 
single dose for short term use.  
Safety pharmacology:  
Safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated in the 
2-week monkey toxicology study at doses up to 500 
mg/kg (5/sex/group). There were no cardiovascular

studies, there is a low likelihood for safety 
effects on CV, CNS or respiratory function.  
Other toxicity-related information or data: 
Infusion-related reactions and immunogenicity 
In the 2-week monkey IV toxicology study, there was 
no evidence of systemic infusion reactions. Anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) were detected in 12 of 40 monkeys. 
There were no apparent ADA-related effects on TK or 
toxicity. 
Local tolerance 
In the 2-week monkey IV toxicology study, local 
infusion site reactions were not observed. In a single 
dose IM local tolerance study in minipig at a dose of 
250 mg (4 mL, 62.5 mg/L), no injection site reactions 
were observed.  
Cross reactivity 
No off-target binding was detected  in an in vitro 
immunohistochemistry human tissue cross reactivity 
study. 
Antibody-dependent enhancement 
The potential for antibody-dependent  enhancement 
(ADE) of disease was evaluated in non-GLP in vitro 
and in vivo studies. Sotrovimab did not enhance  viral 
uptake or replication, or cytokine production in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte-
derived dendritic cells and the U937 monocytic cell 
line. In a hamster SARS-CoV-2 model, sotrovimab 
showed a dose-dependent  improvement in all 
measured outcomes, with no evidence of disease 
exacerbation at any dose tested, including sub-
neutralizing doses. 
Viral Resistance 
An E340A amino acid substitution in the virus spike 
protein emerged in a SARS-Cov-2 cell culture assay 
designed to select mAb resistant virus mutants. This 
substitution is in the conserved epitope that is 
recognized by sotrovimab. In a pseudotyped virus-like 
particle (VLP) assessment in cell culture, reduced 
susceptibility to sotrovimab neutralization was 
observed for amino acid sequence  polymorphisms 
P337H/L/R/T (7.5X, 180X, >276X, 5.4X, respectively, 
of wild-type EC50) and E340A/K/G (>100X, >297X, 
27X, respectively). The presence of the highly 
prevalent D614G variant, either alone or in 
21 
No elevated clinical concern for infusion-related 
reactions was identified in the monkey 
toxicology study. ADA in animals are not 
considered predictive of immunogenicity in 
humans because human antibodies, like 
sotrovimab, are immunologically foreign in 
monkeys. Consistent with the potentially 
immunogenic properties of protein and peptide 
therapeutics, patients may develop antibodies to 
sotrovimab following treatment. 
No elevated clinical concern was identified for IV 
or IM local injection site reactions in toxicology 
studies. 
No elevated clinical concern was identified in 
off-target tissue binding studies. 
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo data did not 
identify an elevated clinical concern for ADE of 
disease. 
The nonclinical studies did not identify an 
elevated clinical risk for treatment failure for 
currently prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The 
clinical significance of resistance related to 
substitutions at amino acid positions E340 or 
P337 is unknown at this time. Notably, E340 
and P337 are ≥99.99% conserved among 
available SARS-CoV-2 sequences. 
Characterization of potential risk of emergence 
of sotrovimab-resistant variants is ongoing.

combination, did not alter neutralization of 
sotrovimab. Pseudotyped VLP assessments indicate 
that sotrovimab retains activity against the UK 
(B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1), 
California (CAL.20C), New York (B.1.526) and India 
(B.1.617) variant spike proteins. Microneutralization 
data using authentic SARS-CoV-2 variant virus 
indicate that sotrovimab retains activity against the 
UK, South Africa and Brazil variants. In addition, 
sotrovimab demonstrated protection in a hamster 
model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using the UK B.1.1.7 
variant based on improvements in disease-related 
body weight changes.  
In conclusion, there are no important identified risks from the non-clinical data. The 
potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are 
resistant to sotrovimab or potential risks associated with biologic therapies including 
mAbs will be further assessed during the clinical development program.

Pregnant women 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of 
sotrovimab in pregnant  women.  
The SmPC states that sotrovimab should be used during 
pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breastfeeding women 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of 
sotrovimab in human milk. A risk to the new-
borns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to abstain from sotrovimab therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Patients with relevant comorbidities: 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
• 
Sotrovimab is degraded  by widely distributed proteolytic 
enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, therefore 
changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect 
on the elimination of sotrovimab. Furthermore, based on 
population pharmacokinetic analyses there is no 
difference in sotrovimab pharmacokinetics in patients with 
mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase 
(1.25 to < 5 x ULN). No dose adjustment is expected to be 
required in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Patients with renal impairment 
• 
Sotrovimab, like other immunoglobulins, is too large to be 
excreted renally, thus renal impairment is not expected to 
have any effect on the elimination of sotrovimab. 
Furthermore, based on population pharmacokinetic 
analyses there was no difference in sotrovimab 
pharmacokinetics in patients with mild, moderate or 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30

•  Children <18 years old 
Patients <18 years old were excluded from clinical 
program. The pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab in 
paediatrics under the age of 18 years have not been 
evaluated. However, the recommended dosing 
regimen in paediatrics aged  12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg is expected to result in 
comparable serum exposures of sotrovimab as those 
observed in adults, based on an allometric scaling 
approach which accounted for effect of body weight 
28 
In COMET-ICE study, 51 patients on sotrovimab had 
cardiac disorders reported as current medical 
condition at baseline and 4 patients had congestive 
heart failure (NYHA class II or more) reported as risk 
factor for COVID-19 progression. 
Severely immunocompromised participants were not 
included in the clinical development programme in 
patients with COVID-19.  
Sotrovimab was evaluated in ACTIV-3-TICO trial with 
300 participants with COVID-19 requiring 
hospitalization; of these approximately 150 
participants received sotrovimab. Following DSMB 
review of the unblinded data no specific safety issues 
were raised.  The DSMB recommended that the trial 
be closed to future enrolment based on sensitivity 
analyses of the available data that raised concerns 
about the magnitude of potential benefit.

safety concerns in the RMP 
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of 
Not all potential or identified risks are considered to meet the level of importance necessitating 
inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Reason for not including  an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns  in the RMP: 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, 
and for which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered 
by prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard  clinical practice in each EU Member 
state where the product is authorised): 
Identified risk of hypersensitivity reactions: 
Incidence of hypersensitivity reactions from frequently used mAbs (e.g. infliximab, rituximab, 
cetuximab, tocilizumab) was generally low but ranges widely (<1% to 27%) [Santos, 2017].  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with monoclonal antibodies for treatment 
of SARS-Cov2 infection (bamlanivimab [both as monotherapy and in combination with 
etesevimab] and the casirivimab-imdevimab [REGN-COV2] combination) including 
anaphylaxis reported for REGN-COV2 (REGN-COV2 Conditions of Use  and Bamlanivimab/ 
bamlanivimab + etesevimab Conditions of Use). 
Hypersensitivity reactions reported in COMET-ICE study include all events that matched 
preferred terms under MedDRA Hypersensitivity SMQ (narrow) and occurred at any time after 
the dose.

In COMET-ICE study, none of the hypersensitivity reactions across both treatment groups 
were serious and majority were of Grade 1. One event in each treatment arm was of Grade 2 
severity: rash in the placebo group that occurred 7 days and 21 hours after th e dose and skin 
reaction in the sotrovimab group that occurred 4 days after the dose. All events across both 
treatment groups were reported as resolved (two on sotrovimab resolved with sequalae-events 
of skin reaction and rash [verbatim skin rash]) except one event on sotrovimab arm (PT 
dermatitis contact) that was reported as resolving at the time of data cut off. None of these 
events in either the sotrovimab or the placebo arm led to premature pausing or discontinuation 
of the infusions. One event of rash (verbatim facial rash) in the placebo group that occurred 5 
hours and 57 minutes after the dose was considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator. Two events in the sotrovimab group: skin reaction described above and rash 
(verbatim skin rash that occurred 2 days and 13 hours after the dose) were considered related to 
study treatment by the investigator. The event of bronchospasm in the sotrovimab group that 
occurred 12 days after the dose was reported for patient with history of asthma. The event of 
hypersensitivity (verbatim allergic reaction over face and forearms) in the sotrovimab group 
occurred 14 days after the dose and was treated with topical steroids.  
No anaphylaxis events were reported in COMET-ICE study in patients with mild to moderate 
COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization at study entry. 
A potentially life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) was observed in one participant, 
who received sotrovimab in the study of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 (the ACTIV-
3-TICO study). This participant reported Grade 4 anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, Grade 3 
shortness of breath, Grade 2 rash, and Grade 1 dizziness and flushing 21 minutes after the start 
of the infusion. All events were considered serious and related to study treatment by the

Version 1.0 
investigator. The infusion was recorded as paused but never resumed. The participant was 
treated with epinephrine and recovered. 
Risks with minimal and temporary clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity 
of the indication treated): 
Potential risk of infusion related reactions 
While sotrovimab is a human Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb, infusion related reactions 
(IRRs) are a potential general risk associated with the mAb class of therapeutics administered 
via intravenous infusion. 
IRRs, including hypersensitivity reactions were listed in the COMET-ICE protocol as adverse 
events of special interest (AESI). Systemic IRRs were defined as events with preferred terms 
(PTs) matching the custom list of PTs and occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion. 
This custom list of PTs was pre-specified at the beginning of the study and derived from the 
MedDRA Anaphylactic standard MedDRA query (SMQ) and Hypersensitivity SMQ as well as 
IRRs from other approved monoclonal antibodies. These included PTs such as pyrexia, chills, 
hypersensitivity, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and allergic reactions. In COMET-ICE study, 
participants were observed for 2 hours after infusion for immediate IRRs.  
Systemic IRRs that started within 24 hours of study treatment were observed with similar 
frequency in participants treated with either sotrovimab (6 of 523 [1%]) or placebo (6 of 526 
[1%]). AEs reported in the participants captured as IRRs include pyrexia, chills, dizziness, 
dyspnoea, pruritus, rash, and IRR. Pyrexia was the most frequent IRR in the sotrovimab arm (3 
of 523 [<1%] and in placebo 1 of 526 [<1%]), whilst dizziness was the most frequent in the 
placebo arm (3 of 526 [<1%] and in sotrovimab 1 of 523 [<1%]). All IRRs were non-serious, 
low grade (Grade 1 or 2) and clinically manageable with no life-threatening reactions. None of 
them lead to treatment discontinuation and all patients received full dose. In the sotrovimab 
arm all of the cases of IRRs were considered resolved and none were considered related to 
study treatment by the investigator. In the placebo arm, one participant had event considered 
not resolved at the time of data cut off and 3 had events considered related to study treatment 
by the investigator. 
Potential risk of immunogenicity 
During clinical development, immunogenicity was assessed using a risk-based bioanalytical 
strategy to understand whether ADA responses against sotrovimab impact safety or efficacy. 
Based on the low immunogenicity risk for sotrovimab, a validated, multi-tiered approach to 
evaluating anti-sotrovimab antibodies, consisting of screening, confirmation, and titration 
assays were implemented.  
Currently, in the COMET-ICE study, the observed incidence of post-treatment ADAs has been 
low, with all titre values near the sensitivity limit of the assay (titres ≤160). Available results 
from approximately 75% of the participants up to Day 29 are provided in Table 10 
. In 
this study, 17 participants confirmed positive at Day 1 (baseline) for ADAs with no increase in 
titre values in subsequent timepoints and, therefore, are not considered to have treatment-
induced ADAs. Ten participants confirmed positive for anti-sotrovimab antibodies at Day 29. 
34 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
Four of the 10 participants were positive at baseline with no boosting in titre values at Day 29 
and therefore are not considered to have treatment-induced ADAs. The other 6 participants 
with positive responses are currently considered to have treatment-induced ADAs: 2 
participants were negative at baseline and 4 participants have not yet had a baseline sample 
analysed. There were no apparent clinical consequences related to the presence of anti-
sotrovimab antibodies.  
To date, the incidence of treatment-induced anti-sotrovimab antibody responses has remained 
low with relatively low titres and with no detectable impact on safety or efficacy. This clinical 
evidence aligns with the low immunogenicity risk profile of the molecule. Immunogenicity 
will continue to be assessed in this study and in the clinical program.

Other reasons for considering the risks not important: 
Potential risk of antibody depended enhancement of the disease 
ADE is a theoretical risk with vaccines and antiviral antibodies and has been best described in 
association with some vaccine development programs. ADE can occur via one of three 
previously described mechanisms: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
By facilitating viral entry into host cells and enhancing viral replication in these cells 
By increasing viral fusion with target host cells, enhancing viral replication in these 
cells 
By enhancing disease pathology from viral antigen-antibody related immune complex 
deposition or complement activation and immune cell recruitment in target organs  
The first two mechanisms are hypothesized to occur at sub-neutralizing antibody 
concentrations. The third mechanism is hypothesized to occur at high levels of antigen (i.e., 
viral load) and antibody potentially leading to immune complex deposition and complement 
activation in tissue sites of high viral replication. If these were to occur, they may manifest as 
increased severity or duration of illness in sotrovimab-treated participants compared to what 
would be clinically expected. 
Sotrovimab shows potent binding as well as neutralization of pseudovirus and live virus in 
vitro, thus this risk is deemed to be low. No enhanced viral uptake or enhanced replication in 
the presence of sotrovimab was noted in in human cells that express FcƴRs: moDCs, PBMCs 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
and U937 cells. No enhancement of cytokine or chemokine production detected in PBMC, DC 
or U937 cells treated with sotrovimab. The impact of sotrovimab on SARS-CoV-2 replication 
indicated comparable levels of replication in the presence or absence of sotrovimab. The in 
vitro data to date show no evidence of FcƴR-dependent or independent mechanisms of ADE of 
infection. In addition, an intraperitoneal ADE evaluation in Syrian golden hamsters also did not 
identify an elevated concern for ADE in the clinical setting. 
To identify any potential events which might be suggestive of ADE, specific renal, cardiac, and 
pulmonary events were reviewed including review by the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC). Renal events were defined as 50% decline in eGFR from baseline (lab 
identified event), urine albumin creatinine ratio > 500mg/g. Only for subjects without end-
stage renal failure at baseline. Cardiac events were defined as a selection of sub-SMQs and 
selected preferred terms. Pulmonary events were defined as any change from baseline in 
requirement for respiratory support.

To further characterize potential ADE events, COVID-19 related events as well as respiratory 
related events were evaluated. Upon the review of the data no evidence was noted suggestive 
of potential ADE associated with sotrovimab.

In the sotrovimab group respiratory events were Grade 1-3 severity and none were considered 
serious. One event (PT Pneumonia bacterial) was reported as not resolved at the time of data 
cut off and none were fatal. 
In the placebo group respiratory events were Grade 1-5 severity and 6 were considered serious. 
Two events were reported as not resolved (PTs of dyspnoea and pneumonia) at the time of data 
cut off and 2 events were fatal (PTs of respiratory failure and pneumonia).  
In addition, to identify any potential events that might be suggestive of ADE, a broad array of 
PTs was reviewed within the renal, cardiac, and pulmonary SOCs. This comprehensive review 
did not identify any trends suggestive of ADE associated with sotrovimab. Summaries are 
provided below.  
The incidence of the potential pulmonary ADE events was 6% (30/526) in the placebo arm and 
1% (6/523) in the sotrovimab arm and there were more severe events in the placebo arm (4 
Grade 4 events and 3 Grade 5 events) compared to the sotrovimab arm (3 Grade 3 events).  
All potential renal ADE events occurred in the placebo arm 5/526 (<1%) with 3 events of 
Grade 4 severity. 
The incidence of the potential cardiac ADE events was <1% (2/526) in the placebo arm and 
<1% (5/523) in the sotrovimab arm. The events reported are in different MedDRA higher-level 
term groups, indicating that the events are in different cardiac pathophysiological conditions. 
Thus, there is no indication of an emerging immune type effect reminiscent of ADE.  
Medical review of the events in the sotrovimab arm show baseline risk factors for each of these 
events: 
•  Tachycardia: concurrent with anxiety 
•  Palpitations (verbatim: worsening of palpitations): participant had baseline palpitations 
•  Cardiovascular deconditioning (verbatim: deconditioning): Occurred after participant was 
hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and had concurrent anaemia of chronic disease 
which may have complicated participant’s recovery. 
•  Cardiomegaly: participant had history of heart disorder and congestive heart failure with 
baseline Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing left ventricular hypertrophy. 
•  Myocardial ischemia: participant with history of hypertension, heart failure and baseline 
ECG showing chamber hypertrophy.

SVII.3.2.1  Use in pregnancy:   
Evidence Source: 
The safety profile of sotrovimab in pregnant and breastfeeding women is not known since they 
were excluded from the clinical program. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. In a cross-reactive binding assay using a protein array enriched for 
human embryofoetal proteins, no off-target binding was detected. Since sotrovimab is a human 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), it has the potential for placental transfer from the mother to the 
developing foetus. The potential treatment benefit or risk from placental transfer of sotrovimab 
to the developing foetus is not known. There is insufficient information on the excretion of 
sotrovimab in human milk. A risk to the new-borns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded from clinical studies with sotrovimab. 
Women of childbearing potential participating in the studies were required to commit to use of 
a contraceptive method, as specified in the protocol. Sotrovimab exposure in pregnancy will be 
monitored in the COVID-PR, a non-interventional, post-marketing cohort study, designed to 
collect prospective safety data among pregnant women treated for COVID-19 at any time 
during pregnancy and in their offspring until one year of age. Other data, including sales, 
spontaneous or electronic healthcare data may be utilized to identify and characterize women 
exposed to Sotrovimab and contextualize the observed sample size and population of COVID -
PR.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST 
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1 
Routine pharmacovigilance  activities 
The safety of patients is of paramount importance to GSK, and to reflect this commitment, 
GSK has implemented routine pharmacovigilance practices which are: 
•  Established processes for the collection and, as required, notification of any AEs occurring 
anywhere in the world; 
•  Established processes for the regular and systematic review of ongoing safety data relating 
to its pharmaceutical products. 
This employs a routine, pro-active process for identifying safety signals with four main 
components: 
1.  Ongoing awareness and review of important individual cases, including all reports with a 
fatal outcome. 
2.  Systematic, regular and proactive review of aggregate safety data. This includes trend 
analysis to detect increased frequency of reporting and, qualitative and quantitative 
methodologies to detect safety signals. 
3.  Systematic, regular review of the literature. 
4.  Regular review of data from EudraVigilance (EV), the pharmacovigilance database of the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA), for products included in EMA’s list of medicines 
under additional monitoring as of 25 October 2017. The Global Safety Database contains 
information on AEs received from spontaneous sources, literature, regulatory agencies, 
post-marketing surveillance studies as well as SAEs from clinical studies. AEs and Serious 
AE reports are actively followed up to obtain relevant clinical information for evaluation.  
Potential safety issues identified from non-clinical studies, clinical studies, individual case 
reviews, signal detection and data mining activities, Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report 
PBRER)/ Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), from regulatory queries or other sources are 
carefully evaluated. Adverse drug reactions identified during these reviews are incorporated 
into the Core Safety Information (CSI) for Sotrovimab and subsequently reflected in local 
country labelling. 
Traceability 
The SmPC Section 4.4 includes the following instructions to healthcare providers: 
“In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.” 
42 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
III.1.1    Routine Pharmacovigilance  Activities  Beyond Adverse Reactions 
Reporting and Signal Detection 
Treatment failure due to emerging variants 
Data monitoring, including systematic, and proactive review of the emerging data will be done 
from all available data sources including but not limited to the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
evaluation of new and cumulative non-clinical data (antiviral activity and viral resistance) 
on new variants found in the sotrovimab epitope 
evaluation of new and cumulative post-baseline epitope variants detected in clinical 
studies among patients who received sotrovimab, when possible 
evaluation of spontaneous reports via targeted follow up questionnaire for lack of efficacy 
including information for variant lineage  
evaluation of literature reports   
evaluation of studies conducted by public health authorities 
Cumulative data from the reviews will be summarized in a dedicated section of the PSUR.  If 
the review of data leads to an impact on the benefit risk profile of sotrovimab appropriate

Additional  pharmacovigilance  activities 
Study short name and title: 
COVID-19 International Drug Pregnancy Registry (COVID-PR)  
Rationale  and study objectives: 
The overall objective of the COVID-PR is to evaluate obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes 
among women who required at least one in-hospital or ambulatory medication for mild to 
severe COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy. Sotrovimab exposure in pregnancy will be 
one of the medications monitored in the COVID-PR. 
Study design: 
The COVID-PR is an international, non-interventional, post-marketing cohort study designed 
to collect prospective safety data among pregnant women treated pharmacologically for mild to 
severe COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy. It includes maternal and offspring follow-up 
until the infant’s one year of age. Registration and participation, via a website especially 
developed for the COVID-PR, are voluntary. Eligible women can enrol at any time during 
pregnancy and up to 30 days after the end of pregnancy. Postpartum mothers and their live 
offspring are followed-up to the infant’s one year of age. In addition to self -reported 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
information, the web data collection system requests participants upload their de-identified 
medical records. 
Study population: 
The study population includes women 18 years of age and older who required in -hospital or 
ambulatory pharmacological treatment, including Sotrovimab, for mild to severe COVID-19 at 
any time during pregnancy. The actual study population will depend on medication utilization, 
the recruitment into the Pregnancy Registry, the retention during follow up and, for livebirth 
outcomes, on the observed percentage of live births among the study pregnancies. Other data, 
including sales, spontaneous or electronic healthcare data may be utilized to identify and 
characterize women exposed to Sotrovimab and contextualize the observed sample size and 
population of COVID-PR. 
Milestones: 
Sotrovimab utilization within COVID-PR will be examined on a yearly basis to determine the 
futility of the study for Sotrovimab. The total duration of the overall COVID-PR study will be 
5 years. Obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes will be assessed on an ongoing basis as data 
become available. The first two years will include, primarily, enrolment of pregnancies; the 
third and fourth years will involve follow-up of pregnancies and new-borns; and, the final year, 
will be for data analyses and publications. A final report will be prepared at the end of the 
study.

COMET-PACE is an open-label study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and 
safety following single dose of sotrovimab in paediatric patients with mild to moderate 
COVID-19 at high risk of progression. 
Rationale  and study objectives: 
There is an urgent medical need for treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
While children are more likely than adults to have asymptomatic or mild infection, those that 
are young or have a history of obesity, gastrointestinal conditions, heart disease sin ce birth, 
genetic or metabolic conditions, neurologic disease, diabetes mellitus, asthma or chronic lung 
disease, immunosuppression, Sickle Cell Disease, or baseline medical complexity  are more 
likely to be hospitalized with severe disease or die.  
In the sotrovimab clinical development program to date patients <18 years of age were 
excluded. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate sotrovimab in children (age <18).

In this planned study the main objectives are: 
• 
• 
to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sotrovimab  
to evaluate safety and tolerability of sotrovimab 
Study design: 
This study includes 2 cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B). Participants in Cohort A will receive 
IV sotrovimab and participants in Cohort B will receive sotrovimab via IM injections. 
Cohort A and Cohort B will each enrol approximately 36 participants to be evaluated for the 
primary analysis divided into the following age groups: 
•  adolescents 12-<18 years of age – at least 6 
•  children 6 to <12 years of age – at least 12 
•  children 2 to <6 years of age – at least 12 
• 
infants and toddlers from birth to <2 years of age (including premature infants born at 
least at 32 weeks) – at least 6  
Each patient will receive single dose of sotrovimab and will be followed for up to 36 weeks 
post dose. Dosing will be based on weight in each age band.  
Study population: 
Male and female infants, children and adolescents from birth to <18 years of age (including

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Xevudy (Sotrovimab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Xevudy. The RMP details 
important risks of Xevudy, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Xevudy 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Xevudy 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Xevudy should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Xevudy should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Xevudy's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Xevudy is authorized for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to 
severe COVID-19 (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains sotrovimab as the active 
substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Xevudy’s benefits can be found in Xevudy’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xevudy 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities  to minimise  or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Xevudy, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Xevudy 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 1.0 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Xevudy is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks  and missing information 
Important risks of Xevudy are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Xevudy. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

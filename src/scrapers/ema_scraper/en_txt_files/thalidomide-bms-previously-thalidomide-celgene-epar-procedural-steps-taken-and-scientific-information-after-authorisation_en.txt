Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML),

thalidomide. The PIL is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
including fatal cases, have been reported in patients, 
treated with thalidomide. Cases were reported, several 
months to several years after initiation of treatment and 
were generally observed in patients taking concomitant 
dexamethasone or prior treatment with other 
immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should 
monitor patients at regular intervals and should consider 
PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or 
worsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural 
signs or symptoms. Patients should also be advised to 
inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, 
since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not 
aware of. 
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until 
a diagnosis of PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, 
thalidomide must be permanently discontinued.

For patients >75 years of age, the thalidomide 
to add new dosing information for elderly patients 
(>75 years) with untreated multiple myeloma 
receiving thalidomide in combination with melphalan 
and prednisone (MPT). In addition the MAH is 
updating the posology with the recommended 
starting doses for melphalan and prednisone for 
completeness. The Package Leaflet is being updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet. A revised RMP 
version 17 was agreed during the procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
recommended starting dose is 100 mg per day. The initial 
dose of melphalan is reduced for elderly >75 years of age 
considering baseline bone marrow reserve and renal 
function. The melphalan recommended starting dose is 0.1 
to 0.2 mg/kg daily according to bone marrow reserve along 
with a further 50% dose reduction for moderate (creatinine 
clearance: ≥ 30 but < 50 mL/minute) or severe (CrCl: < 
30 mL/minute) renal insufficiency. The maximum daily 
melphalan dose is 20 mg in patients > 75 years of age.  
The adverse reaction profile reported in patients >75 years 
of age treated with thalidomide 100 mg once daily was 
similar to the adverse reaction profile observed in patients 
≤75 years of age in patients treated with thalidomide 200 
mg once daily. However, due to additional comorbidities 
and risk factors, patients with age >75 years are 
potentially at risk for a higher frequency of serious adverse 
reactions.

thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving 
thalidomide therapy.  Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
have been amended with regard to haemorrhagic disorders 
due to the potential seriousness of gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and the possible increased incidence of such 
events in patients with existing risk factors, including 
concomitant use of anticoagulants, thrombocytopenia, 
concomitant use of known haematotoxic agents, and/or 
underlying disease complication. Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC have been updated with regard to hepatic disorders 
due to possible existing risk factors, such as pre-existing 
liver disorder and use of concomitant hepatotoxic 
medications, in thalidomide treated patients.

safety review conducted by the MAH. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. The Annex II of the 
Product Information was also updated to include the 
requirement to circulate the DHPC in countries where 
Thalidomide Celgene is already launched, informing 
healthcare professionals of the risk of second 
primary malignancies with thalidomide. Finally, the 
PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.3. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
has been observed in an ongoing clinical study in patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma (MM) receiving 
the combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide 
(MPT). The risk increases over time and was about 2% 
after two years and about 4% after three years. An 
increased incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM) 
has also been observed in patients with newly diagnosed 
MM receiving lenalidomide. Among invasive SPMs, cases of 
MDS/AML were observed in patients receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with melphalan or immediately following 
high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell 
transplantation.  
The benefit achieved with thalidomide and the risk of AML 
and MDS must be taken into account before initiating

infarction and thromboembolic events, the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) was requested by the CHMP to 
submit a variation in order to update the Product 
Information of Thalidomide Celgene with regards to the risk 
of worsening of Parkinson’s disease symptoms, the risk of 
myocardial ischaemia/infarction and the risk of arterial 
thromboembolic events (TEEs).  
Worsening of Parkinson’s disease (PD) 
Reports of PD/worsening PD have been reported with 
thalidomide in the post-marketing experience. Overall, 
based on the currently available information, there is no 
evidence of causal relationship between thalidomide and 
occurrence of newly diagnosed PD. However, in patients 
with underlying PD, thalidomide may have an additive 
effect on PD symptoms, since thalidomide itself is known to 
induce tremor, abnormal coordination, depression and 
confusion, which are also, part of PD symptoms. 
Consequently, “worsening of Parkinson’s disease 
symptoms” was added in the product information as an 
adverse reactions related to post-marketing experience 
with thalidomide. 
Myocardial infarction 
Myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported in patients 
receiving thalidomide, particularly in those with known risk 
factors. Patients with known risk factors for MI, including 
prior thrombosis, should be closely monitored and action 
should be taken to try to minimise all modifiable risk 
factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). 
Consequently a warning to that effect has been added to 
the product information and “myocardial” was added as an 
adverse reactions related to post-marketing experience 
with thalidomide.

Arterial thromboembolic events 
Venous TEEs (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism) were already known risks of thalidomide. At the 
request of the CHMP, a cumulative safety review of arterial 
TE 
pharmacokinetics data on thalidomide collected from 
FU2 003.1 and FU2 003.2, as requested by the 
CHMP. The Marketing Authorisation Holder also took 
the opportunity to update Annex II with the deletion 
of the version number of the DDPS and with the 
latest agreed version number of the RMP (version 
10.0). 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
made the commitment to provide data of the ongoing 
clinical trial OPTIMUM (FUM 003). 
Altogether, thalidomide PK data derive from 47 out of the 
499 myeloma patients included in OPTIMUM study (THA PH 
EU 2005 CL 001) and PK population study which developed 
a PK model from mixed population (96 healthy subjects and 
47 myeloma patients). 
Thalidomide is metabolised almost exclusively by non-
enzymatic hydrolysis. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis suggests 
that the potential for drug-drug interactions with 
thalidomide is low.  
There is a linear relationship between body weight and 
estimated thalidomide clearance; in MM patients with body 
weight from 47-133kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from 
approximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in 
thalidomide clearance of 0.621 L/h per 10kg body weight 
increase.  However, the distribution of thalidomide is not 
influenced by age, gender, renal function and blood 
chemistry variables, to any significant level.  
Studies conducted in healthy subjects and patients with 
multiple myeloma suggest that Thalidomide is not 
influenced to any significant extent by renal or hepatic 
function (see section 5.2). However, this has not formally 
been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic

(MAH) was requested by the CHMP to submit a variation in 
order to update the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) of Thalidomide Celgene with regards to the risk of 
renal dysfunction and the ADRs of pancytopenia and 
hearing loss. The MAH was also requested to review the 
events of hypersensitivity reactions in order to update the 
product information.  
Pancytopenia 
Cytopenias have been observed at a very common 
frequency in trials where thalidomide was administered in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone. Anaemia, 
leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were already included in 
the Thalidomide Celgene EU SmPC.  
A cumulative search of the pharmacovigilance database 
retrieved a total of 266 reports of pancytopenia. Of these, 
262 reports were excluded from the review. Only 4 well 
documented reports of pancytopenia were reviewed. 
Pancytopenia was reported in patients receiving 
thalidomide monotherapy. Analysis of these 4 reports 
concluded that chronological data including time to onset 
and positive dechallenge in the context of thalidomide 
Page 29/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monotherapy and absence of confounding factors, are 
highly suggestive with a possible relationship between 
pancytopenia and thalidomide. 
Hearing loss 
A cumulative safety review of events of hearing 
loss/deafness identified 131 reports. Fifty-four (54) of 
these were serious and 77 non serious. 
The time to event onset was suggestive of a relationship 
between thalidomide therapy and the events of hearing 
disorders. Indeed, the time to onset ranged from 10 days 
up to 1095 days with a median of 145 days. Data on 
dechallenge and rechallenge (reported for 21 patients) 
strengthen the possible relationship between the event and 
thalidomide therapy. 
Five literature articles reported hearing loss/deafness in 
patients receiving thalidomide. One of these described a 
sudden loss of hearing as a possible thalidomide-

2nd Periodic Safety Update Report, section 4.8 of the SPC 
was updated to add the adverse drug reactions febrile 
neutropenia, gastrointestinal perforations and tumour lysis 
syndrome further to reports from the post-marketing 
experience. 
In addition, a warning was added in section 4.4 of the SPC 
to indicate that patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome 
are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. 
These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate 
precautions taken. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
of thalidomide (FUM 002). 
The MAH conducted a phase I trial: Mass balance, 
metabolism and pharmacokinetic study of 14C-labeled 
thalidomide in healthy male subjects following single oral 
dose administration. Within this study, clinical PK 
parameters determination and metabolite profiling and 
identification were conducted. 
In plasma, unchanged thalidomide represents 80% of the 
circulatory components. Unchanged thalidomide was a 
minor component (<3% of the dose) in urine. In addition to 
thalidomide, hydrolytic products N-(o-carboxybenzoyl) 
glutarimide and phthaloyl isoglutamine formed via non-
enzymatic processes are also present in plasma and in 
majority in urine. Oxidative metabolism does not contribute 
significantly to the overall metabolism of thalidomide. 
Following a single oral dose of 400 mg of radio-labelled 
thalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6% of the 
administered dose by Day 8. The majority of the 
radioactive does was excreted within 48 hours following 
dose administration. The major route of excretion was via 
the urine (>90%) while faecal excretion was minor. 
Considering that pharmacologically active metabolites are 
eliminated via urine, patients with severe renal impairment 
should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. 
Section 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics has 
been updated accordingly.

authorisation, no clinical data were provided by the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) in order to justify the 
extent (50%) of reduction of dose in case of thalidomide-
related neuropathy. Therefore, the MAH committed to 
provide a detailed review of all neuropathies observed in 
patients treated for multiple myeloma since the beginning 
of the named patients / cohort patients / compassionate 
use programme in the European Union (FUM 004). 
Based on the review of available data, the CHMP considered 
that the extent (%) of dose reduction was  not justified. 
Therefore, the CHMP requested that the wording in section 
4.2 of the SPC with regard to the extent of dose reduction

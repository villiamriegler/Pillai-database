PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for PIFELTRO (doravirine)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for PIFELTRO. The RMP details 
important risks of PIFELTRO and how more information will be obtained about 
PIFELTRO's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
PIFELTRO's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how PIFELTRO should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for PIFELTRO should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
PIFELTRO's RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used for
PIFELTRO is authorised, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the 
treatment of adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg infected 
with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class.  It belongs to 
a group of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), a 
type of antiretroviral medicine and it is given only by mouth.
Further information about the evaluation of PIFELTRO benefits can be found in 
PIFELTRO's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on 
the EMA webpage. https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/pifeltro
II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of PIFELTRO, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about PIFELTRO's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;

• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken 
as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of PIFELTRO is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of PIFELTRO are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of PIFELTRO. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Introduction 
Chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  is  a  myeloproliferative  disorder.  CML  was  the  first  neoplastic 
process to be linked to a consistent acquired genetic abnormality, the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. 
The Ph chromosome results from a reciprocal translocation t(9;22) in a haematopoietic stem cell and 
results  in  the  transfer  of  the  Abelson  (abl)  oncogene  to  an  area  of  chromosome  22  termed  the 
breakpoint  cluster  region  (bcr)  and  creates  a  fused  Bcr-Abl  gene.  The  final  product  of  this  genetic 
rearrangement is an abnormal 210 kDa cytoplasmic fusion protein, or p210BCR-ABL, the oncoprotein 
responsible for most, if not all, phenotypic abnormalities of chronic phase CML. The Bcr-Abl protein 
is  leukaemogenic  because  its  Abl-derived  tyrosine  kinase  is  constitutively  activated.  Unlike  the 
situation  of  the  normal  Abl  protein,  whose  tyrosine  kinase  activity  is  tightly  regulated,  Bcr-Abl 
transduces signals to various pathways in an autonomous fashion.  
The incidence of CML is approximately 1 case per 100.000 persons/year. The median age of patients 
diagnosed with Ph+ CML is in the range of 55-60 years. CML can occur in  children (2%-3% of all 
childhood  leukaemias  are  CML),  but  if  Ph+,  the  prognosis  for  children  may  be  better  than  that  for 
adults. Median overall survival from diagnosis of CML is 4 to 6 years. 
Clinically,  CML  progresses  through  distinct  phases.  From  a  relatively  indolent  initial  stage  (chronic 
phase), the disease inevitably progresses in a median of 3 to 5 years to an acute leukaemia (blast crisis 
phase), which is rapidly fatal.  
In  40-50%  of  patients,  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  blast  crisis  phase,  an  intermediate  phase  occurs 
(accelerated  phase)  and  generally  lasts  less  than  one  year.  The  criteria  to  define  the  transition  to 
accelerated  phase are  not  entirely agreed although the  most commonly used (Kantarjian et  al, 1998) 
rely on presence of one or more of the following: cytogenetic clonal progression, blasts greater than 
15% in the peripheral blood, > 30% blasts + promyelocytes in the peripheral blood, >20% basophiles 
in peripheral blood, platelets <100 x 109/L (unrelated to therapy).  
The  only  curative  treatment  of  chronic  phase  CML  is  bone-marrow  transplantation  (BMT)  but  few 
patients (10-15%) are eligible and there is a high rate of transplants related mortality (20 to 30%). The 
probability of long-term survival when the BMT is performed in first chronic phase is approximately 
60%. 
The first line standard treatment of patients who are not candidates for BMT includes interferon-alpha 
(IFN) alone or in combination with cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C). IFN is usually associated with a rate 
of  major  cytogenetic  responses  (MCR)  of  10%  to  38%  in  comparison  with  only  0  to  5%  with 
chemotherapy.  For  IFN,  the  achievement  of  cytogenetic  response  was  shown  to  be  associated  with 
improved survival. In patients with a complete haematologic remission, the median time to complete 
cytogenetic remission is 9 to 18 months, but it may occur after 4 years of therapy. The rates of both 
haematologic and cytogenetic responses decrease significantly as the time from initial diagnosis to the 
institution of IFN therapy increases (Kantarjian et al., 1998).  
Approximately  20  to  30%  of  patients  stop  IFN  treatment  because  of  toxicity.  Some  patients  do  not 
respond to IFN and the vast majority ultimately develop resistance. There is no standard definition in 
the literature of what constitutes “IFN failure”, in spite of some attempts to rationalise the definition 
(Kantarjian  et  al.  2000).  For  patients  having  failed  IFN  there  is  no  generally  accepted  standard 
treatment.  Patients  are  usually managed with hydroxyurea or busulfan. Second line  chemotherapy is 
usually  associated  with  a  good  level  of  haematologic  control  (approximately  50%)  of  complete 
haematologic  response  (CHR)  but  the  rate  of  cytogenetic  responses  ranges  from  0  to  5%.  In  these 
patients,  the  probability  of  response  to  therapy  and  of  surviving  decrease  with  increasing  time  from 
1/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
initial diagnosis, regardless of subsequent treatment. The outcome of patients having failed treatment 
with IFN has been described rarely. 
Accelerated phase (AP) CML is usually considered as the first manifestation of resistance to therapy. 
With  IFN  the  response  rate  is  lower  for  AP  than  it  is  for  chronic  phase  CML  although  durable 
responses and suppression of cytogenetic clonal evolution have been reported. The median survival of 
patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  or  IFN  commonly  ranges  from  12  to  18  months.  Using  single-
agent or multi-agent chemotherapy, a haematologic response can be achieved in approximately 50% of 
patients,  but  is rarely complete  and cytogenetic responses  are  very rare. The results of  BMT remain 
disappointing  due  to  high  rate  of  transplant  related  mortality  and  relapse.  The  introduction  of  donor 
leukocyte infusion as a treatment of post-transplant relapse has significantly improved the outcome of 
these patients. 
Blast crisis (BC) is defined as > 30% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow in the presence of 
fever, malaise and progressive splenomegaly. It occurs approximately 3 to 5 years after the diagnosis 
of CML and 18 months after the onset of the AP. BC can be either of myeloid or, less commonly, of 
lymphoid phenotype. It is generally refractory to treatment and median survival is 3-6 months. Only in 
patients with lymphoblastic crisis (who are infrequent), an improvement of a few months in survival 
has been observed with combination chemotherapy. Outcome of patients receiving an allogeneic BMT 
while  in  overt  BC  is  very  poor.  These  acute  leukaemias  are  highly  resistant  to  currently  available 
cytotoxic  therapy,  and  the  results  are  consistently  disappointing:  a  haematologic  response  can  be 
achieved  in  only  20%  to  40%  (complete:  5%  to  30%)  of  patients.  Cytogenetic  responses  are 
exceptional. Clinical trials exploring combination chemotherapy or new chemotherapeutic agents such 
as 5-azacitidine and mitoxantrone alone or in combination have observed a 20% response rate. 
Imatinib mesilate 
The active substance is the mesylate salt form of imatinib, a phenylaminopyrimidine derivative and is 
the  4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)  methyl]  –  N  –  [4-methyl-3-[  [4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]  amino]-
phenyl]-benzamide methanesulfonic acid salt. It is a white to slightly yellowish crystalline powder and 
is prepared using a fully synthetic process. During the development the product has been referred to as 
STI571 (formerly called CGP57148B). 
Imatinib  has  been  identified  as  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  that  selectively  inhibits  the  Abl  tyrosine 
kinases,  including  Bcr-Abl.  Proof  of  concept  in  the  clinical  setting  was  demonstrated  by  the  high 
response  rates  seen  in  a  Phase  I  study.  The  biochemical  mechanism  of  action  was  confirmed  in  the 
clinic,  since  phosphorylation  of  Crkl  (a  substrate  of  Bcr-Abl)  was  decreased  in  patients  undergoing 
treatment with imatinib. 
To investigate CML resistance to STI571, murine and/or human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines resistant 
to imatinib have been generated. These have shown that the most frequent mechanism of resistance is 
amplification  and  over-expression  of  the  BCR-ABL  gene  although  over-expression  of  the  Pgp 
glycoprotein, the product of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, may also contribute to the resistant 
phenotype.  However,  imatinib-resistant  clones  from  some  cell  lines  do  not  show  either  of  these 
resistance  phenotypes,  suggesting  that  resistance  to  STI571  may  evolve  by  multiple  mechanisms.  It 
has been shown that patients in lymphoid BC have a rapid and significant response to treatment with 
STI571  but  relapse  after  a  median  time  of  10.5  weeks,  therefore,  it  will  be  important  to  study  the 
causes of resistance in these primary CML cells, in order to design modifications to the treatment. It is 
possible that combinations of imatinib with other drugs such as IFN, daunorubicin or Ara-C may be 
more  effective  than  imatinib  alone,  as  suggested  by  in  vitro  studies  of  cell  lines  and  primary  CML 
cells.

Part II. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
The  product  is  presented  as  hard  gelatin  capsules  available  in  two  strengths,  50  mg  &  100  mg.  The 
excipients  of  the  powder  mix  are  crospovidone, cellulose  microcrystalline , silica colloidal anhydrous 
and magnesium stearate.  The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow 
2/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
&  iron  oxide  red.  Capsules  are  packaged  in  thermoformed  blisters  using  rigid  plastic  films  of  PVC 
backed with a heat-sealable lacquered aluminium lid foil. 
Active substance 
Imatinib mesilate INN. The synthesis of imatinib starts with the preparation of two intermediates, and 
after that, the synthetic process is completed in 4 main steps. 
Crude  imatinib  methanesulfonate  is  recrystallised  from  acetone  and  is  sieved  to  prepare  a  uniform 
production batch for further processing. A detailed description of the manufacturing process has been 
provided and evaluated, including reaction conditions, quantities of raw materials and yields. Four in-
process  controls  for  key  reactions  are  described,  and  satisfactory  intermediate  specifications  and 
corrective process control actions have been established. 
For storage and transport, the bulk drug substance will be packaged in two polyethylene bags and kept 
in tightly closed containers protected from the light. 
Evidence  of the  chemical  structure has  been  provided  in the form of  an examination of the route  of 
synthesis, elemental analysis, IR, UV/VIS, 1H-NMR,  13C-NMR, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystal 
diffraction. Imatinib mesilate does not have chiral centres and it is not optically active. The solubility 
of imatinib mesilate in aqueous solutions depends on pH; at pH 5.8 it is very soluble. It is soluble in 
polar solvents, but only slightly soluble to insoluble in low polar solvents. The free base has very low 
solubility in water and in aqueous solutions that are slightly alkaline.  
Two  different  crystalline  forms  are  known  -  modifications  A  and  B.  Both  of  them  are  anhydrous 
polymorphs.  Form  A  has  a  lower  melting  enthalpy,  which  indicates  an  enantiotropic  relationship 
between both forms. Form B is the stable polymorph at 25ºC and 50ºC. Conversion to modification A 
does  occur,  but only at high  temperature (175ºC). Both  polymorphs show similar aqueous solubility 
characteristics,  and  therefore  Polymorph  B  is  the  form  chosen  for  the  manufacturing  of  the  finished 
product. 
Specification 
The specification includes limits on the main impurities observed in batches produced by the defined 
route  of  synthesis.  The  impurity  limits  are  qualified  with  reference  to  toxicology  studies  and  do  not 
present a problem of safety. The analytical methods used in routine controls are suitably described. 
The  identity  is  confirmed  by  IR  spectrum  using  nujol  as  dispersion  medium,  which  is  suitable  to 
differentiate both crystalline forms.  Water is checked by Karl-Fischer  method. Clarity and  colour  of 
the solution are carried out according to general methods of the Ph.Eur.  
Related substances are quantified by HPLC and GC methods. Inorganic impurities are determined by 
sulphated  ash  and  heavy  metals.  The  heavy  metals  are  checked  by  IPC-OES  method,  which  is 
equivalent to atomic emission spectrophotometry. 
A  HPLC  method  similar  to  the  related  substances  method  is  used  in  order  to  determine  the  content 
calculated  as  imatinib,  the  salt  forming  agent  is  determine  by  potentiometric  titration  with  sodium 
hydroxide. All method validation studies are in agreement with the current ICH-guideline. 
A  specification  for  particle  size  is  also  included  in  order  to  obtain  adequate  powder  flow  properties 
and homogeneous distribution in the powder blend for encapsulation during processing of the finished 
product.. 
Stability 
Preliminary investigations have established the main degradation pathways , e.g. oxidation to N-oxide 
under  oxidative  stress  conditions.  Degradation  was  not  observed  after  storage  at  high  temperatures 
(100ºC). 
Formal  stability  data  of  3  pilot  batches,  3  production  batches  ,  and  7  batches  representative  of  the 
material used in pre-clinical and clinical studies, are presented. 
3/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
Different types of packaging material were used, - one of them is similar to the containers used in the 
warehouse. 
The  stability  studies  have  been  performed  under  ICH  Q1A  conditions  and  other  experimental 
conditions  have  been  reported.  No  apparent  change  of  the  drug  substance  quality  was  observed  in 
these  studies.  A  re-test  period  of  2  years  at  25ºC  is  proposed  when  the  substance  is  stored  in  tight 
packing protected from light.  
Other ingredients 
The  ingredients  in  the  finished  product  are  of  Ph.Eur.  specification..  The  magnesium  stearate  is  of 
vegetable  origin  and  in  relation  to  the  gelatin,  Certification  of  suitability  with  the  monograph 
“products  with  risk  of  transmitting  agents  of  animal  spongiform  encephalopaties”  of  the  Ph  Eur  has 
been provided. There are no concerns in relation to TSE with any of the ingredients of the product. 
Product development and finished product 
Imatinib  free  base  was  not  considered  for  development  as  it  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  (0.001 
g/100 ml). The mesilate, was selected among various salts as it displays good solid state properties and 
stability.  The  B  form  was  selected  for  further  development  as  it  is  thermodynamically  stable  and 
shows  a  suitable  morphology  with  respect  to  flow  properties.  Form  B  is  not  hygroscopic  in  an 
environment  with  a relative  humidity  up to 90%.and the  mesilate is very soluble in  water (pH=5.8). 
The  investigation  of  bioavailability  has  been  conducted  by  a  three  treatment  randomised  crossover 
study  comparing  imatinib  400  mg  in  the  form  of  a  hard  capsule,  400  mg  oral  solution  and  100mg 
given  as  an  intravenous  injection.  An  absolute  bioavailability  of  98.3  %  was  determined  in  a  study 
comparing  capsules  with  intravenous  injection  solution.  Moreover,  relative  bioavalability  of  the 
capsules to an oral solution showed that release of the drug substance from the capsules is so rapid that 
it is not a rate-limiting factor for absorption. 
The  manufacturing process is a  straightforward dry powder  mixing, in which, no granulation step is 
involved.  An  optimisation  of  the  manufacturing  process  with  respect  to  the  number  of  blending  and 
sieving steps as well as to blending times, sieves sizes and encapsulation speed has been carried out 
during development. The process has been successfully scaled up to commercial batch size. 
Different  sorts  of  packages  were  tested  during  primary  stability  studies:  high  density  polyethylene 
bottles (HDPE), PVC with aluminium foil backing blisters, PVC/PE/PVDC with foil backing blisters 
and  full  aluminium  blisters.  Capsules  were  stable  in  all  packaging  materials;  neither  increase  on 
degradation  products  nor  decrease  in  active  substance  were  observed.  PVC  blisters  were  chosen  as 
packaging  material  for  climatic  zones  I  and  II,  whereas  PVC/PE/PVDC  are  the  intended  one  form 
climatic zones III and IV. 
Product Specification 
An  identical  specification  has  been  developed  for  release  and  end-of-  shelflife.  Tests  include 
identification,  disintegration  time,  dissolution  (Q  ≥  80%    in  30  minutes),  content  uniformity, 
disintegration  products  and  assay  by  HPLC  (95-105%  stated  amount  per  capsule).  Control  methods 
have been validated and the specification is considered to be relevant for a product of this type. 
Tabulated results of three production-scale 50 mg capsules batches and four production-scale 100 mg 
batches have been provided and indicate satisfactory compliance with the specification and uniformity 
of the product. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability studies have been carried out in a number of packaging materials and configurations. As PVC 
is the only packaging material proposed in the application, only the batches packaged in this material 
have  been  considered  for  stability  evaluation.  Others  are  considered  as  supportive  data,  since  the 
packaging material is different as proposed for marketing. 
Results of 12 months for all batches in all packaging configurations under 25ºC/ 60% RH and 30ºC/ 
70% RH condition and 6 months for batches under accelerated conditions were submitted. 
4/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
The tests of microbiological quality is performed according to Ph Eur.  
The  photostability  testing  were  performed  by  means  of  exposure  of  unpacked  capsules  to  light.  The 
characteristics  studied  are  appearance,  dissolution  rate,  assay  of  active  ingredient  (HPLC/UV)  and 
determination of degradation products (HPLC/UV). Specifications for all the mentioned tests are the 
same as at release. The analytical methods are identical to those described and validated for control of 
the product at release.  
Both  strengths  are  chemically  stable  in  all  packaging  types  tested.  No  significant  changes  in  the 
content  of  degradation  products  and  in  the  assay  are  produced  under  any  of  the  storage  conditions 
tested. 
All  the  results  are  within  specifications  for  physical  properties  in  all  batches,  and  no  changes  were 
observed under photostability stress. Supporting data (results from batches packaged in HPDE bottles, 
PVC/PE/PVDC and Alu-B) comply with all the stated specifications. 
In summary, the stability results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  active  substance  and  product  are  defined  and  characterised  in  an  acceptable  way,  typical  for  a 
powder filled hard gelatin capsule. The product has been developed in a rational way and there are no 
special characteristics which need additional routine control to be imposed, other than those required 
by the product release specification. 
Additional presentations: 100mg and 400mg film-coated tablets 
On 11 November 2003, authorisations were granted for two line extensions of Glivec, i.e. 100mg and 
400mg  film-coated  tablets,  intended  to  reduce  the  daily  ‘pill  burden’  imposed  on  the  patient,  and 
intended  to  eventually  replace  the  capsules.  Bioequivalence  between  the  capsule  and  film-coated 
tablets was demonstrated, and therefore it was not necessary to change the dosage or clinical use of the 
product. 
3. 
Part III. Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic studies  indicate that  imatinib inhibits c-Abl, and Bcr-Abl protein-tyrosine kinases 
in p210bcr-abl positive myeloid and p185bcr-abl positive lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines. Imatinib 
also inhibited Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity in primary leukaemia cells obtained from patients with 
Ph  positive  CML  and  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL).  Imatinib  had  no  effect  on  Ph 
chromosome  negative  ALL  and  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML)  primary  blast  cells.  The  in  vivo 
antitumour  effect  of  imatinib  in  nude  mice  has  been  studied  using  the  Bcr-Abl  positive  KU812  cell 
line  originally  derived  from  a  CML  patient  in  BC.  These  results  suggest  that  imatinib  can  be 
efficacious in the treatment of patients with CML.  
Pharmacokinetics 
A  pharmacokinetic  assessment  was  conducted  from  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  dogs  and 
monkeys  and  in  a  3-week  dose  range-finding  study  for  teratogenicity  in  rabbits  and  all  animals 
administered  imatinib  were  systemically  exposed  to  the  compound.  All  the  metabolites  found  in 
humans  have  been  identified  in  animal  species.  A slight  gender  difference  was  observed  in  rats  and 
dogs  but  no  gender  difference  was  observed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  No  unexpected  accumulation 
was observed upon repeated dosing in any species tested. 
The studies have demonstrated that imatinib is distributed throughout foetuses in rats and rabbits and 
is  excreted  into  milk  and  this  is  also  expected  to  occur  in  humans.  Therefore,  adequate  information 
should be included in the SPC regarding these issues. 
5/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
No  in  vivo  interaction  study  was  conducted  with  drugs  that  might  be  co-administered  such  as 
hydroxyurea or citarabine but in vitro metabolism studies indicated that CYP3A4 is the main human 
P450  enzyme  catalysing  the  biotransformation  of  imatinib.  Of  a  panel  of  potential  co-medications 
(acetaminophen, aciclovir, allopurinol, amphotericin, Ara-C, erythromycin, fluconazole, hydroxyurea, 
and  norfloxacin  and  penicillin  V)  erythromycin  (IC50  50 µM)  and  fluconazole  (IC50  118 µM) 
demonstrated  inhibition  of  imatinib  metabolism,  both  of  which  could  have  clinical  relevance. 
Although  it  is  possible  that  no  clinically  relevant  interaction  would  be  expected  since  therapeutic 
levels of fluconazole are approximately 8-fold lower than the observed IC50s, however this possibility 
cannot  be  discarded  in  at-risk  patients  (hepatically  impaired  patients,  for  instance.).  An  interaction 
with erythromycin cannot be excluded, caused either by metabolic and/or protein binding behaviour, 
which may also have been underestimated by in vitro data. 
Imatinib  was  shown  to  be  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  marker  substrates  for  CYP2C9,  CYP2D6  and 
CYP3A4/5. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of metabolism of co-administered drugs is therefore possible 
if  these  enzymes  are  involved,  especially  exclusively,  in  their  clearance.  Likewise,  co-administered 
drugs  which  can  inhibit  CYP3A4  might  reduce  the  imatinib  clearance  and  result  in  an  increase  in 
plasma levels. No indication of hepatic enzyme induction by imatinib has been observed in toxicology 
studies as no mechanistic or in vitro studies on this aspect of drug metabolism have been performed. 
Toxicology  
A single dose intravenous study in rats and several chronic toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys 
were  conducted.  In  a  39-week  study  in  monkeys  treatment-related  effects  were  reported  at  all  dose 
levels. The NOAEL was not established. Target organs identified in the toxicity studies in the different 
animal  species  were  bone  marrow,  lymphoid  tissues,  testis/ovaries  and  gastrointestinal  tract.    It  was 
noted  that  plasma  levels  of  imatinib  in  patients  given  a  dose  of  800  mg  per  day,  the  highest 
recommended dose, markedly exceed those at the no effect level in the investigated species. Because a 
safety  margin  of  less  than  1  is  observed,  the  risk  to  humans  cannot  be  discarded.  Taking  into 
consideration the severity of the  disease  to treat,  however, the  benefit/risk  ratio could  be considered 
positive.  
The  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies  was  conducted  and  results  were  negative  except  for  an 
increase  in  structural  chromosomal  aberrations  (deletions  and  exchange  figures)  in  CHO  cells  at  the 
highest  concentration  of  125  µg/ml  in  the  presence  of  rat  liver  S9.  No  effects  were  observed  at  the 
lower concentrations.  It appears that imatinib is genotoxic in vitro only at very high concentrations. 
Taking into account the negative results in in vivo studies and the therapeutic indication proposed, it 
could be considered that there is no concern in relation to genotoxicity of imatinib. 
The Applicant has conducted five reproductive toxicity studies, one of them to study the fertility and 
early embryonic development in rats and dogs and four studies to assess the embryo-foetal and peri-
natal toxicity in rats  and rabbits. There was  evidence of  effects  on spermatogenesis in both rats  and 
dogs. An increased post-implantation loss was observed in the rat fertility study with treatment of both 
males  and  females,  and  in  the  embryotoxicity  study  with  the  treatment  of  females.  Consequently 
imatinib  is  considered  embryotoxic  at  high  doses.  Imatinib  is  also  teratogenic  in  rats.  It  is 
recommended  that  women  of  childbearing  potential  should  use  effective  contraceptive  measures 
during the entire treatment period. If treatment is necessary for women who are recently pregnant, they 
should be informed about the potential risk to the foetus. These issues are addressed in the SPC. 
No carcinogenicity study has been conducted. Taking into account the short life-expectancy of patients 
with the disease for which imatinib is indicated, the lack of such studies can be considered justified. 
Based on the submitted data, no adverse environmental effects are predicted from imatinib. 
There is no concern in relation to GLP fulfilment 
4. 
Part IV. Clinical Aspects 
The  clinical  development  programme  has  mainly  focused  on  the  different  stages  of  CML,  including 
Ph+  ALL  or  AML.  At  the  time  of  submission  there  were  several  ongoing  or  planned  trials  in  other 
types of tumours such as prostate, small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, glioma and gastrointestinal stromal 
tumors (GIST).

Clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of imatinib were investigated in one dose-finding study (03 001) carried out in 
adult (>18 years) or paediatric (<18 years) patients with resistance or intolerance to IFN, and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance  Status <3, with Ph+ CML in the chronic phase, 
acute Ph+ leukaemia including CML in myeloid or lymphoid BC, relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL or Ph+ 
AML. 
The  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  was  defined  as  the  dose  where  2/6  patients  experienced  non-
haematologic  Grade  3/4  study-drug-related  toxicity.  For  the  pharmacodynamic  activity,  relative 
response as % reduction in WBC after 1 month of treatment was measured (as hyperleukocytosis is a 
prominent  feature  of  CML,  and  the  normalization  of  WBC  is  an  important  therapeutic  goal).  The 
relation of haematologic response to exposure was examined using an Emax model.  
The study included 84 adult patients with chronic phase CML intolerant to IFN and 59 adult patients 
with  either  CML  in  BC  (n=48)  or  ALL/AML  (n=11).  The  study  also  included  a  limited  paediatric 
population (n=6). 
The  relationship  between  pharmacodynamics  and  PK  parameters  at  steady  state  indicated  that,  for 
chronic phase CML, the efficacy of imatinib was related to exposure (expressed as daily dose, AUC, 
Cmin  or  Cmax,  or  time  above  the  1µM  plasma  level  leading  to  apoptosis  in  vitro),  the  best  fit  was 
obtained with dose, suggesting that outcome might be highly dependent on administered dose for adult 
CML patients in chronic phase. Simulations of the Emax model parameters predict that with a dose of 
400  mg  daily,  76%  of  patients  are  expected  to  achieve  a  reduction  of  WBC  count  to  <10  x  109/L. 
However, for acute patients, it is not possible to observe a relation between dose and WBC counts. 
In  IFN-intolerant  patients  with  chronic  phase  CML,  CHRs  were  seen  already  at  140  mg,  and  was 
achieved in 48 of 49 fully assessable patients treated at doses >300 mg. The data show dose-response 
relationship with a rate of CHR of 39% (11/28) and 98% (48/49) in patients treated at doses below or 
>300 mg, respectively. In chronic phase patients, a MCR was achieved in 41% of assessable patients 
and was complete in 18%.  
The  59  patients  with  BC  or  ALL/AML  were  treated  at  doses  ranging  from  300  to  1000  mg/day. 
Patients  with  lymphoid  BC  and  ALL  were  grouped  together  as  “lymphoid  phenotype”  acute 
leukaemias,  whereas  the  patients  with  AML  and  the  myeloid  BC  were  grouped  as  acute  leukaemias 
with myeloid phenotype. The overall rate of haematologic response was 70% and 54% in the patients 
with a lymphoid and a myeloid phenotype, respectively. However, the confirmation of response was 
not required. Haematologic response was complete in 13% of patients with CML myeloid BC and, in 
20% of patients with lymphoid Ph+ acute leukaemias, without an apparent dose-response relationship. 
Duration of response was shorter in lymphoid phenotypes. A MCR was achieved in 14% of patients (4 
out of 28) with a myeloid BC and 30% (3 out of 10) in lymphoid BC. 
Safety results showed that  85.7% of patients suffered adverse drug reactions and in 28.6% of patients 
these  were  grade  3/4.  The  most  frequent  suspected  adverse  drug  reactions  were  nausea,  muscle 
cramps,  oedema,  peri-orbital  oedema  and  leg  cramps  and  haematological  toxicity  such  as  anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia. 
Based  on  non-haematologic  toxicity,  an  MTD  for  imatinib  as  defined  in  the  protocol  was  not 
established  in  chronic  phase  CML  patients.  However,  even  though  these  events  were  not  dose-
limiting,  there  was  a  consistent  trend  for  a  higher  frequency  of  adverse  drug  reactions  as  dose 
increased.  Grade  3/4  granulocytopenia  and  thrombocytopenia  were  clearly  dose-related  with  an 
incidence  of  54%  and  59%,  respectively,  at  doses  >750  mg  daily.  No  clear  dose  relationship  was 
apparent in patients with BC or other Ph+ acute leukaemias. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A total of four pharmacokinetics studies were submitted (studies 0107, 0108, 0118 and 0119). Studies 
0107  and  0108  were  performed  to  characterise  the  ADME  processes  and  the  absolute  and  relative 
7/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
bioavailability of oral imatinib, respectively and both of them were performed in healthy volunteers. 
Studies  0118  and  0119  were  planned  as  interaction  studies.  One  of  them  was  performed  in  healthy 
volunteers and the other one in patients diagnosed with CML. The pharmacokinetic profile of imatinib 
after single and multiple doses, and the relationship between dose and drug exposure and drug effect 
were  also  investigated  in  the  pharmacodynamic  study  03  001.  The  effect  of  food  on  bioavailability 
was  examined  in  10  patients  included  in  the  efficacy  and  safety  trials  0109  and  0110  (phase  II). 
Finally, a population pharmacokinetics approach was applied to data from 491 patients enrolled in the 
three phase II studies (0102, 0109, and 0110). 
ADME 
Following oral administration of 200 mg, [14C]imatinib was rapidly absorbed and Cmax was 1-2 hours 
after dosing (tmax). The extent of absorption was estimated to be approximately 70% of dose. 
Regarding  metabolism,  the  major  radioactive  compound  in  plasma  was  STI571,  followed  by  the  N-
desmethyl metabolite of imatinib CPG 74588, which is the major metabolite in vitro, and in vivo and 
has similar potency to imatinib and its AUC was 16% of that for imatinib. 
Two thirds (66%) of  14C-AUC(0-48h) were covered by unchanged drug (58%) and the main metabolite 
CPG 74588 (8%). The remaining one third was accounted for minor unidentified metabolites. 
The 14C radioactivity was excreted slowly, mainly in faeces (68%) and to a minor extent in urine (≈10-
15%).  Excreted  radioactivity  consisted  mainly  of  unchanged  imatinib.  The  bulk  of  the  dose  was 
recovered within 7 days. Study 0108 was designed as a single dose, open label, 3 period, 3 treatment, 
randomised, crossover study to investigate the absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of STI571 
400 mg hard gelatine capsule and STI571 400 mg oral solution relative to STI571 up to 100 mg given 
IV to a total of 17 healthy volunteers. The bioavailability was >97%. The volume of distribution was 
≈435  L.    At  clinically  relevant  concentrations  of  imatinib,  binding  to  plasma  proteins  was 
approximately 95% on the basis of in-vitro experiments, mostly to albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein, 
with  little  binding  to  lipoproteins.  Total  plasma  clearance  was  about  14  L/h.  With  the  capsule 
formulation,  the  terminal  t1/2  was  approximately  18  hrs,  suggesting  that  once  a  day  dosing,  as 
proposed, is appropriate. 
Multiple dose pharmacokinetics 
A total  of  70 patients  diagnosed with  CML received single and  multiple  and escalating  doses in the 
open  label  study  03  001.  Imatinib  was  rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  administration,  with  Cmax  being 
reached at about 2-4 hours post dose. 
Pharmacokinetics  were  examined  on  day  1  (first  dose)  and  day  28  (multiple  dose,  steady  state).  At 
steady state, plasma AUC(0-24) rose 1.5 to 3 fold after multiple dosing on a once daily schedule. Mean 
AUC(0-24)  rose  linearly  with  dose  from  25  to  1000  mg  for  both  single  and  multiple  doses.  The 
metabolite  CPG  74588  showed  the  same  dose-dependency  as  STI571,  but  its  t1/2  was  longer  (27-58 
hours). 
The influence of dosing by body weight or body surface area on plasma AUC showed no reduction in 
inter-patient variability in AUC, indicating no advantage in normalising the dose of imatinib to match 
differences  in  body  size.  The  Cmin  at  >400  mg  exceeded  the  minimum  concentration  leading  to  cell 
death in vitro, confirming that once daily dosing is adequate for achieving therapeutic levels. 
Drug interactions 
As  in  vitro  studies  had  shown  that  imatinib  is  mainly  transformed  by  CYP3A4  and,  in  addition,  it 
competitively  inhibits  CYP2C9,  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4/5,  two  interaction  studies  were  carried  out, 
one with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) and the other with a substrate (simvastatin). 
Fourteen healthy male and female subjects were included in study 0119, a single dose, open label, and 
randomised  crossover  design  study  whose  main  objective  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  the  co-
administration of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib.  
8/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
Following ketoconazole co-administration, the mean imatinib Cmax, AUC (0-24) and AUC (0-∞), increased 
significantly  by  26%,  40%  and  40%,  respectively.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in 
CL/F with a mean reduction of 28.6%. Regarding the N-desmethyl metabolite of imatinib CPG 74588, 
the mean Cmax and AUC (0-24) decreased significantly by 22.6% and 13% after ketoconazole treatment. 
The AUC (0-∞) only decreased by 5% and this decrease was not statistically significant. 
Study  0118  is  an  ongoing  open-label,  non-randomised  one-sequence  crossover  design  study,  to 
investigate the effects of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4) in 20 
patients with CML. Preliminary results (n=9) showed that imatinib increase the mean Cmax value of 
simvastatin 2 fold and the AUC(0-∞)  value 3.5 fold compared with simvastatin alone. The mean half 
life of simvastatine was prolonged from 1.4 h to 3.2 h when co-administered with  STI571. 
The effect of food on bioavailability was examined at steady state in a cross-over trial in 10 patients 
(enrolled  in  study  0109  or  study  0110)  given  400  mg  imatinib  under  fasted  conditions  or  with  a 
standardised high fat meal. The mean PK parameters  indicate that AUC and Cmax were little affected 
and the prolongation of tmax was small. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Specific studies investigating the use of imatinib in special populations have not been carried out. 
A population PK approach was applied to data from 491 patients enrolled in the three phase II studies 
(0102, 0109, and 0110), to search for differences among population sub-groups. Small and clinically 
irrelevant effects were observed with the co-variates age and body weight and no effects of gender and 
disease  stage  were  found  using  a  one-compartment  model  with  first  order  absorption  and  linear 
pharmacokinetics. No patient was < 18 years and altered PK in children cannot be excluded.  
On  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the  ADME  study  (0107),  exposure  to  imatinib  may  be  expected  to 
increase  if  liver  function  is  impaired.  However,  the  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  did  not 
obtain any conclusion about this and no specific studies have been performed in patients with impaired 
liver function.  
Since the kidney is not a major excertion route for imatinib and its metabolites, studies in patients with 
impaired renal function are not deemed necessary. 
Clinical Efficacy 
The main clinical efficacy data with imatinib in CML have been obtained from three open-label, non-
controlled pivotal phase II studies which recruited a total of 1027 patients in advanced stages of CML 
or in chronic phase after failure of IFN therapy (0102, 0109, 0110) and from a phase I study (03 001) 
as reported in Table 1. Among the 1027 CML patients enrolled in the phase II studies, a total of 638 
patients  were  treated  with  400  mg  and  389  were  treated  with600  mg.  All  enrolled  patients  actually 
started treatment with imatinib.

Clinical Efficacy 
Endpoints and Methods 
Definitions of the phases of CML and efficacy criteria are reported in Table 2. The primary efficacy 
endpoint in study 0110 was the proportion of patients achieving complete and partial (<35% Ph+ cells 
cytogenetic response MCR and was based on cytogenetic analysis. Bone marrow cytogenetic analysis 
was required at baseline and every three months thereafter to evaluate Ph positivity. Due to the short 
follow-up,  unconfirmed  cytogenetic  response  rate  was  considered  the  main  outcome  although 
confirmation  of response  was  additionally calculated for study 0110. The rate of  unconfirmed MCR 
was a secondary endpoint in studies 0102, 0109. Haematological response (HR) rate with confirmation 
after ≥ 4 weeks was the primary endpoint in studies 0102, 0109 and secondary in 0110.  
Other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  time  to  haematological  response  and  duration  of 
haematologic  response  defined  as  time  between  first  documented  response,  with  ≥  4  week 
confirmation,  and  loss  of  response  (any  haematologic  response  criterion  no  longer  fulfilled), 
progression  to  AP  (study  0110)  or  BC  (studies  0109,  0110),  discontinuation  due  to  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect or death, whichever first. Time to MCR was defined as time until first documented 
MCR  and  duration  of  MCR  defined  as  time  between  first  documented  major  response  and  loss  of 
cytogenetic response, discontinuation due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect or death, whichever first. 
Time  to  progression  was  defined  as  time  between  start  of  treatment  and  loss  of  haematological 
response,  progression  to  AP  (study  0110)  or  BC  (studies  0109,  0110),  discontinuation  due  to 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect or death, whichever first. For study 0110 the definitions above refer to 
confirmed CHR. Overall survival was defined as time between start of treatment and death). 
Time to and duration of response were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Observations were 
censored at time of discontinuation for patients discontinuing to undergo BMT, at the time of their last 
bone marrow evaluation date for cytogenetics, as long as there was no evidence of loss of cytogenetic 
response  for  patients  still  on  study  at  the  date  of  cut-off,  and  at  the  date  of  the  last  bone  marrow 
evaluation  if  the  discontinuation  was  for  reasons  other  than  AE,  lab  abnormality,  unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect or death and were followed up for survival. 
10/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For studies 0102 and 0109 (but not study 0110) any discontinuation due to AE or lab abnormality was 
also  considered  an  event  in  any  of  the  time  to  event  analyses  for  response  duration.  Patients  who 
discontinued were declared non-responders at all points after their withdrawal. 
The association between response and survival was explored using the landmark method, considering 
all patients alive and still on study with an assessment performed at 3 months. 
Exploratory  multivariate  analysis  of  the  association  between  baseline  variables  and  the  primary 
endpoints of each of the studies were performed using logistic regression (5% significance level). 
All  studies  used  Fleming’s  single-stage  procedure,  using  an  alpha-level  of  2.5%  (one-sided)  and  a 
power of 90% (H0: p ≤ p0  and  H1: p ≥ p1) with p0 (“uninteresting” response rate) specified to be 15, 
30, 10 and 15%, p1 (response rate which should not be missed) specified to be 30, 50, 20 and 30% and 
p  (the  minimum  observed  response  rate  such  that  the  lower  limit  of  CI  for  response  rate  >  p0) 
calculated (taking into account actual sample size of 165, 235, 152 and 186) to be 21.2, 36.2, 15.8 and 
21.0  for  studies  102,109,  110  (haematologically  resistant/relapsed  group),  110  (cytogenetically 
resistant/relapsed group), respectively. The main study objectives were considered as met if the lower 
limit of the exact binomial two-sided 95% CI of response rate exceeded the “uninteresting” response 
probability. The main analyses on efficacy endpoints were carried out on the intent to treat population 
(all enrolled patients). 
Within  each  CML  phase,  different  sub-populations  were  included:  patients  with  chronic  phase  were 
grouped  according  to  failure  of  IFN  treatment  (haematologic  or  cytogenetic  failure)  versus  IFN-
intolerance  whilst  patients  with  BC  phase  were  grouped  according  to  previously  treated  versus 
untreated status.

** The criteria for CHR were considered fulfilled, if the early forms were < 5%.

Clinical Efficacy Results 
Chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to IFN (Study 0110) 
Patients in chronic phase CML were eligible for this study if they met one of the following criteria for 
IFN failure: haematologic failure (failure to achieve a CHR after ≥6 months of IFN, or relapse with a 
rising WBC to ≥20 x109/L), cytogenetic failure (failure to achieve a MCR after ≥12 months of IFN, or 
relapse  with  a  ≥30%  increase  in  the  %  of  Ph+  marrow  metaphases  to  ≥65%),  or  intolerance  to  IFN 
defined as a  ≥grade 3 non-haematological IFN-related toxicity persisting for ≥1 month. The primary 
endpoint of the study was the rate of MCR (see response criteria in the footnote of Table 2). The target 
response rate of interest was 30% and the rejection rate 15% in patients with cytogenetic failure, and 
20% and 10% in patients with haematologic failure, respectively (Fleming’s single stage procedure). 
In  this  study,  532  patients  were  enrolled  with  either  haematologic  failure  (29%),  cytogenetic  failure 
(35%),  or  intolerance  to  IFN  (36%).  These  patients  had  received  prior  IFN  (given  alone  or  in 
combination  with  other  drugs)  at  a  dose  ≥25  MIU/week  for  a  median  of  14  months  (25th-75th 
12/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
percentile: 7-27 months). The patient baseline characteristics were typical of pre-treated chronic phase 
CML (60% of patients had a baseline WBC count <20 x109/L, which was <10 x109/L in 37%). On the 
basis  of  data  recorded  in  the  CRF,  the  diagnosis  of  chronic  phase  was  confirmed  in  454  patients 
(85%).  The  remaining  patients  had  features  of  BC  (2%),  AP  (3%),  or  had  insufficient  data  to  be 
assigned to a particular disease phase (9%). 40% of the patients were ≥60 years (10% older than 70 
years). Patients were late in the course of the disease with a median time from diagnosis of 32 months.  
Main  study  results  are  reported  in  Table  3.  Unconfirmed  MCR  rate  was  49.4%  (CI:  45.1-53.8). 
Confirmed  MCR  rate  was  38.0%  (CI95%  33.8-42.2).  The  median  time  to  MCR  (overall)  was  2.89 
months. Follow-up of these patients was short and at cut-off, 10 patients had relapsed at times ranging 
from 2.8 to 5.8 months. Median duration of MCR had not been achieved for any of the subgroups.  
CHR  rate  was  88.0%  (CI95%  84.9-90.6).  Results  were  similar  for  the  three  subgroups  based  on  IFN 
treatment failure type (Table 4). The duration of CHR for all groups was also similar with over 80% 
CHR at 6 months. 
The  estimated  6  and  9-month  disease  progression-free  survival  probability  was  83.7%  and  78.7%, 
respectively.  At  cut-off  date,  102/532  (19.2%)  patients  showed  evidence  of  progression  with  22 
(4.1%) due to unsatisfactory effect, 21 (3.9%) progressed to BC, 18 (3.4%) progressed to AP and 63 
(11.8) lost their response (in the absence of progression to AP or BC phase). 
At the time of analysis, 98.3 % patients were alive between 3.9-11.4 months, with treatment duration 
ranging from 0.5-10.5 months. The estimated 9-month survival probability was 98.1% (CI95% 96.9%-
99.3%). 
Factors associated with improved cytogenetic response in the multivariate analysis were platelets <450 
x109/L,  WBC<20  x109/L,  hemoglobin  ≥100  g/L,  time  from  diagnosis  of  CML  <2  years  and  blasts 
<3%.

Literature review of efficacy results in chronic phase CML 
In  view  of  the  current  lack  of  randomised  studies  in  chronic  phase  CML,  historical  data  from  a 
literature  review  relative  to  the  management  and  outcome  of  patients  in  chronic  phase  CML  failing 
IFN  therapy  have  been  submitted  (Table  5).  In  patients  failing  first-line  IFN  therapy  with  a  median 
time  from  initial  diagnosis  of  10  to  14  months,  which  is  lower  that  the  32  months  in  study  0110 
(suggesting  less  advanced  disease),  overall  survival  was  53  to  64  months.  Due  to  the  fact  that  no 
mature  survival  data  were  available  in  study  0110,  an  indirect  comparison  of  survival  imatinib  with 
IFN was not possible.

Accelerated Phase CML (Study 0109) 
Entry  criteria  for  this  study  were  designed  to  include  patients  aged  >18  years  with  histologically 
confirmed Ph+ leukaemia of either AP  CML, or relapsed/refractory  ALL  or AML, or  CML in LBC 
(recruitment of this disease group was stopped), and specified values of clinical laboratory parameters 
(transaminases,  creatinine  and  bilirubin),  no  leukaemic  involvement  of  the  CNS  and  ECOG 
performance status score of <3. 
A  total  of  293  patients  entered  the  study:  235  patients  with  AP  CML  77  started  at  400  mg  and  the 
subsequent  158  patients  at  600  mg.  The  patient  population  recruited  exceeded  the  planned  target 
(minimum  68 patients with AP CML, increased to 100 to take dropout into account). Other  patients 
recruited  were  48  with  relapsed/refractory  ALL,  2  with  relapsed/refractory  AML,  8  with 
relapsed/refractory CML in LBC. 48 ALL, 2 AML, 8 CML in LBC patients. 
Local AP diagnosis was confirmed in 181 patients (77%). The remaining patients had features of BC 
(12%), chronic phase (7%), or could not be assigned to a particular disease phase (4%). Of note, 24% 
of the patients had >20% marrow blasts, a feature now considered as evidence of BC according to a 
new definition recently proposed by the WHO (Harris et al., 1999). 
The median time from the diagnosis of AP was 1.1 months and >6 months in 26% patients. Notably, 
40% of patients were ≥60 years (with 12% being older than 70).  
Imatinib was supplied as 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg capsules, taken orally, once a day with 250 ml of 
water after breakfast for 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d doses, or twice a day after breakfast and the evening 
meal for 800 mg/d (2x400 mg/d) dose. In terms of treatment duration, the study was open-ended with 
patients  able  to  remain  on  treatment  for  as  long  as  they  were  alive  and  able  to  derive  benefit.  Dose 
escalation was permitted to a maximum 800 mg/day (400 mg bid) and dose reduction or interruption 
was foreseen in case of toxicity. 
Main clinical efficacy results for are summarised in Tables 6 and 7. In the whole AP CML population 
(N=235) the number of observed HR was 148 (63%, CI: 56.5% - 69.2%). The median time to HR was 
0.95 months in the overall population and in the two dose subgroups. At data cut-off (median follow-
up time 7.4 months, range 2-12 months), 115/148 (78%) of responders maintained their response. The 
median duration of response had not been reached. The number of observed unconfirmed MCR was 
50  (21.3%,  CI:  16.2%  -  27.1%)  with  median  time  to  MCR  of  2.8  months  (CI:  2.8-2.9)  and  median 
duration  (n=50, 42 observations censored) of 7.39 months (CI: 5.7-7.4).  
Median  overall  survival  was  13.5  months  (CI:  13.5-NA).  The  estimated  6,  9  and  12-month  overall 
survival probability (N=235; 184 observations censored) was 85.8% (CI: 81.3-90.3%), 79.9% (74.5-
85.3%), 73.0% (65.3-80.7%), respectively. The estimated 9-month overall survival probability in the 
400 mg and 600 mg subgroups was 74% (95% CI 64-84%) and 83% (95% CI 76-89%), respectively. 
In  multivariate  analysis,  variables  significantly  associated  with  an  improved  haematologic  response 
rate in the multivariate analysis were hemoglobin ≥100 g/L and female gender.

Myeloid Blast Crisis CML (Study 0102) 
In  this  study,  patients  with  previously  untreated  or  treated  myeloid  BC  were  enrolled.  The  primary 
endpoint was the rate of haematological response. 
A  total  of  260  patients  were  enrolled,  of  whom  165  (63%)  were  previously  untreated  and  95  (37%) 
had  received  prior  therapy  for  either  AP  or  BC.  Baseline  patient  characteristics  were  typical  for  a 
population  of  patients  with  BC.  However,  in  contrast  with  most  published  studies,  38%  of  patients 
were  ≥60  years  (with  12%  being  older  than  70  years).  Local  diagnosis  of  BC  was  made  for  229 
patients (88%). The remaining patients had local diagnosis of AP (6%), chronic phase (1.5%), or could 
not  be  assigned  to  a  particular  disease  phase  (3%).  Central  histopathology  review  was  available  for 
124 patients and resulted only in one discordant diagnosis. 
The first 37 patients were treated at a dose of 400 mg and the subsequent 223 patients at 600 mg. At 
the cut-off date, 93 (35.8%) of patients were still on protocol treatment. The main reason for treatment 
discontinuation was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect in 113 patients (43%). 
Main study results are reported in Tables 8 and 9. The number of HR were 68 (26.2%, CI: 20.9-31.9). 
Response was higher in the 600 mg/d group than in the 400  mg/d group (28.7% vs 10.8%). Median

time to confirmed HR was 1 month for all patients and for the untreated or treated subgroups. Median 
duration of response was 6.6 months (49/68 censored observations, 4.6 months in pre-treated patients). 
The  number  of  observed  unconfirmed  MCR  was  35  (13.5%,  CI:  9.6-18.2)  with  13  (5%)  complete 
responses.  Median  time  to  unconfirmed  MCR  was  2.6  months  and  median  duration  was  2.5  months 
(17/35 censored observations). Overall survival was 6.3 months (142/260 observations censored). 
In this study, in the multivariate analysis, the variable with the strongest association with an improved 
haematological response rate was age ≥60 years, followed by platelets ≥100x109/L, peripheral blood 
blasts <50%, hemoglobin ≥100 g/L and initial dose of 600 mg.

Other Ph positive leukaemias 
A  few  patients  with  other  Ph+  leukaemias  (CML  in  lymphoid  BC,  Ph+  ALL  or  AML)  have  been 
enrolled  in  study  03  001  and  study  0109.  In  study  03  001,  14  out  of  the  20  patients  with  ALL  or 
lymphoid BC achieved a haematologic response. However, these responses were extremely short-lived 
and 12 patients relapsed at a median of 58 days. The median survival of the 58 patients with various 
Ph+ acute leukaemias or lymphoid BC enrolled in study 0109 was 5 months. 
Association between haematological/ cytogenetic response and survival  
An association between haematologic response at  3  months and  prolonged  survival was  observed in 
studies 0102 and 0109 (log-rank p=0.0001). Achievement of a MCR by 3 months was associated with 
prolonged survival in study 0109 (log-rank p = 0.046). This analysis (landmark method) was based on 
101  patients  (62  responder  and  39  non-responder)  in  study  0102  and  142  AP  CML  patients  (122 
responder and 21 non-responder) in study 0109. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
In the main clinical studies, cytogenetic response has been measured by conventional techniques, such 
as  bone  marrow  cultures  and  assessing  metaphases  for  Ph+  chromosome,  which  is  a  relatively 
insensitive  method.  The  use  of  molecular  methods  with  a  higher  sensitivity  such  as  FISH  or  PCR 
would have been desirable. 
Chronic Phase CML 
Study (0110) is the main study that was presented to support efficacy and safety of imatinib in chronic 
phase CML. The primary endpoint was unconfirmed MCR. 
The  results  submitted  show  efficacy  of  imatinib  as  measured  by  the  pre-specified  primary  and 
secondary endpoints. Unconfirmed MCR rate was 49.4% (n=532). Results were more favourable for 
patients  initially IFN  intolerant  or  patients that  had  cytogenetic IFN  failure.  Unconfirmed  MCR rate 
was 51.1% (complete: 30.1%) in the cytogenetic failure group (n=186) and 58.2 (complete: 37.6%) in 
the  IFN  intolerant  subgroup  (n=194)  whereas  it  was  36.2%  (complete:  20.4%)  in  the  haematologic 
failure subgroup (n=152).  
Complete  haematological  response was  observed in 88%  of all  patients with  82.9% achieved  within 
the  haematologic  IFN  failure  subgroup  and  93%  within  the  cytogenetic  IFN-failure  subgroup.  The 
estimated 9-month overall survival and progression-free survival were 98.1% and 78.7%. The results 
observed for secondary endpoints were consistent with the results obtained for the primary endpoint. 
The first significant responses were seen at 2 weeks of therapy. Maximum effects were reached after 
1-3 months. This is in accordance with the results obtained in the phase I study 03 001.  
Compared  to  the  4  randomised  with  IFN  (ICGS  studies:  Rof/CML,  CML94,  and  FCGS  studies: 
CML88 and CML91) the patients enrolled in study 0110 were at a later stage. Time since diagnosis is 
a known important prognostic factor for patient outcome in late chronic phase and the patient selection 
in study  0110  might  be considered to  have a worse  prognosis  than in the  published series. It is also 
important to note that according to recent publications, patients not achieving CHR at 3 months, have 
very poor chance to achieve a cytogenetic response at 6 months, and among the 6 month cytogenetic 
non responders, it is assumed that only 5% of them may achieve a cytogenetic response at 12 months. 
Patients in chronic phase CML failing IFN therapy are usually managed with second line hydroxyurea 
or  busulfan,  with  a  rate  of  haematologic  and  cytogenetic  response  probably  in  the  range  of  20-54% 
and  less  than  5%,  respectively.  No  published  data  are  available  on  the  response  to  this  second  line. 
However, it is assumed that it cannot be superior to the response to the same therapy used as first line 
(rate of haematologic and cytogenetic response less than 50% and 5% respectively). 
According to the literature, overall survival improvement is the primary objective and achievement of 
cytogenetic  response  is  usually  a  secondary  objective.  The  experience  with  IFN  in  the  treatment  of 
CML showed a strong association between haematologic response, cytogenetic response, and survival. 
Thus,  cytogenetic  response  has  become  a  main  endpoint  of  therapeutic  evaluation.  However,  the 
19/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
mechanisms  of  action  of  imatinib  and  IFN  are  different  and  the  association  between  survival 
improvement and achievement of cytogenetic response needs to be confirmed for imatinib.  
Accelerated Phase CML 
Study 0109 in patients with AP CML is the main study submitted to support this indication (n=235).  
The proposed dose of imatinib for adult patients with AP CML is 600 mg given daily. In addition, a 
dose increase from 600 mg to 800 mg may be considered in cases of in the absence of severe adverse 
drug  reaction  and  severe  non-leukaemia-related  neutropenia  or  thrombocytopenia  in  the  following 
circumstances:  disease  progression  (at  any  time);  failure  to  achieve  a  satisfactory  haematological 
response after at least 3 months of treatment; loss of a previously achieved haematological response. 
The selection criteria of the study were rigorously defined according to well documented criteria. The 
primary  endpoint  was  haematologic  response  rate:  overall,  haematologic  response  rate  was  63% 
(complete:  28%),  with  very  similar  results  for  the  two  doses.  The  objectives  of  the  study  were  met 
(target response was 50%). The median time to overall haematologic response was 1 month, range 0.9 
to 9.3 months. The estimated proportion of haematologic responses lasting at least 6 months was 84% 
(95%  CI  78-90%).  The  estimated  9-month  progression-free  survival  rates  (haematologic)  were  60% 
for 400 mg and 82% for 600 mg. 
Results on secondary endpoints were consistent with those obtained on the primary endpoint. A MCR 
was  achieved  in  21.3%  of  patients,  with  a  trend  towards  higher  response  rates  in  the  600  mg  group 
than  in  the  400  mg  group  (24.1%  and  15.6%  respectively).  Complete  cytogenetic  responses  were 
achieved in 14% of patients (17.1% and 9.1% respectively). Median duration of cytogenetic response 
was 7.39 months. The estimated overall 9-month overall survival rate was 80% (95% CI 75-85%).  
The  included  population  is  appropriate  relevant  to  the  definition  of  AP  CML  used.  However,  it  is 
important  to  stress  that  other  definitions  (e.g.,  using  other  definitions  based  on  blast  excess  or  other 
criteria) would not necessarily lead to the same response to treatment. 
Unfortunately the design of this study is not a controlled one. So, it is not possible to compare directly 
the efficacy and safety of imatinib of imatinib with the current standard therapy in these patients.  
Blast Crisis CML 
Study 0102 (n=260) was the main study submitted to support the efficacy of imatinib in BC CML: at 
entry,  165  patients  were  untreated  and  95  had  been  previously  treated  for  AP  CML.  The  primary 
endpoint was haematologic response. 
Baseline  patient  characteristics  were  typical  for  a  population  of  patients  with  BC  phase  CML. 
However, in  contrast  with  most  published  studies,  38%  of  patients were  860 years (with  12%  being 
older than 70 years).  
MCR were observed in 13.5% of patients (untreated: 12.1%, treated: 15.8%), with a median time to 
response of 2.6 months. Median survival was 4.5 or 7 months depending on whether patients were pre-
treated or not. The current estimated 6-month survival rates are 60.3% (untreated patients) and 43.1% 
(treated patients).  
Response was higher in previously untreated patients than in treated patients (30.3% vs 18.9%) and in 
the  600  mg/d  group  than  in  the  400  mg/d  group.  The  median  time  to  confirmed  response  was 
approximately one month, the first favourable responses were seen in the first assessment on week 2 
of therapy. The first losses of response are seen within two months and continue  progressively. The 
median duration of response was 6.6 months. 
The response rate obtained with imatinib in the in CML myeloid BC was high with a rapid reduction 
in  leukocytosis  and  blasts  in  approximately  50%  of  patients.  This  response  rate  is  lower  than  that 
obtained  in  other  stages  of  CML.  For  the  majority  of  responders,  duration  of  response  was  limited. 
Only a subgroup of patients (approximately 25%) obtained a longer response. 
20/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
Concerning overall survival, although only short term data available, results obtained with imatinib are 
interesting  with  a  median  survival  of  13  months  in  the  400  mg  treated  population  and  a  median 
survival that might be superior in the 600 mg treated population. 
Except  for  the  high  rate  of  cytogenetic  responses,  the  haematologic  response  rate  and  the  median 
survival  of  patients  treated  with  imatinib  are  comparable  to  some  of  the  results  obtained  with 
combination  chemotherapy  regimens  (in  the  more  positive  published  studies).  However,  published 
series concern the pooled myeloid and lymphoid BC population and the latter are known be probably 
more sensitive to chemotherapy. With this respect, the population recruited in this study submitted is 
probably one with worse prognosis than that of available published series. 
Clinical Safety 
The  key  safety  population  consists  of  patients  from  the  phase  I  study,  03  001  and  the  3  phase  II 
studies, 0102, 0109, 0110.  
Methods 
The  population included in the  clinical safety analysis consists  of all patients  who started  treatment. 
AEs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  graded  for  severity  using  the  NCI/NIH  common  toxicity 
criteria (CTC). Adverse events (AEs) are summarized by preferred term and body class; because AEs 
were  coded  using  SMTT  in  study  03  001  and  MedDRA  in  the  phase  II  trials,  these  data  cannot  be 
pooled. Summary tables are provided for AEs by highest CTC grade for each event as well as for AEs 
considered related to study drug. 
An  AE  was  defined  as  any  adverse  medical  change  from  the  patient’s  baseline  (or  pre-treatment) 
condition which occurred  during the course  of the study, after study enrollment, whether considered 
treatment-related or not. For any abnormal laboratory or vital sign finding, investigators were asked to 
record it as an AE only if it constituted the main indicator of a severe AE or SAE or led by itself to 
premature discontinuation. 
Clinically  important  AE  were  defined  as  suspected  drug-related  adverse  events  which  led  to 
discontinuation, or death within 28 days of treatment not described as disease progression 
Special analyses of safety were performed on the following SAEs: rash (a frequently reported event, 
leading to hospitalization and study drug discontinuation in a minority of cases), liver toxicity (one of 
the  main  findings  in  animal  toxicology  studies),  fluid  retention,  oedema,  renal  failure  (consistently 
among  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs,  occasionally  associated  with  renal  failure),  GI  tract 
hemorrhage (imatinib was shown to be a local irritant in toxicology studies), subdural haematoma and 
cerebral hemorrhage (a relatively frequently reported AE). 
Exposure 
The  median  drug  exposure  was  shorter  in  study  0102  (99  days)  in  comparison  to  study  0109  (240 
days)  and  study  0110  (254  days),  reflecting  a  higher  discontinuation  rate  for  death  or  progressive 
disease with increasing disease severity. The longest exposure to imatinib was 320 days (study 0110). 
The  number  of  patients  with  drug  exposure  ≥12  months  was  6  and  3  in  studies  0109  and  0102, 
respectively. At the cut-off date, the proportion of patients still on treatment was 93%, 65% and 36% 
in  studies  0110,  0109,  and  0102,  respectively  (Table  10).  The  main  reason  for  treatment 
discontinuation was progressive disease.

The overall incidence of AEs was close to 100% in all disease groups, the digestive system being the 
most frequently affected body system in all disease groups. 
According to the severity of CML , the rate of deaths is increasing from study 0110 to study 0102. In 
the  same  way,  the  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  and  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  is 
increasing with the progression of disease.  
Guidelines  for  dose  reduction  or  interruption  were  provided  for  any  grade  2  non-haematological 
toxicity  resistant  to  symptomatic  treatment  or  any  grade  3-4  toxicity.  Less  than  50%  of  patients 
required  dose  reduction  at  any  time.  Treatment  interruptions  were  required  in  25-45%  of  patients. 
Despite these dose changes, the overall median dose-intensity over the whole study period remained 
close to the initially planned dose in each study. 
Although  almost  all  the  patients  experienced  adverse  events  which  were  assessed  as  related  to 
treatment by the investigator, these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and grade 3-4 
non-haematological events were reported in <5% of  patients. AEs were easy to manage and treatment 
was discontinued because of drug-related AEs in only a minority of patients (1% in study 0110 , 2% in 
study 0109, and 5% in study 0102). 
Non-haematological Toxicity 
The  most  frequent  drug-related  adverse  events  were  gastrointestinal  toxicity,  fluid  retention  and 
musculo-skeletal toxicity (Table 11). 
Gastrointestinal  toxicity  including  nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea  was  more  frequent  in  advanced 
CML studies. Nausea with or without vomiting were the most frequent events reported in 51% to 61% 
of  the  treated  patients,  but  was  severe  in  1%  to  3.4%  of  patients  and  reported  as  serious  in  <3%  of 
patients.  Drug  discontinuation  was  required  in  only  3  patients.  These  symptoms  relate  to  a  direct 
irritant effect of imatinib, as suggested by the toxicological data.  
Oedema was one of the most frequently reported related AE, but was severe in only 1.1% to 3.1% of 
patients and reported as serious in <2% of patients. Face, peri-orbital region and limb were involved. 
Oedema usually appeared within the first 2 months of treatment. The overall frequency of grade 1-2 
oedema  was  higher  at  600  mg  (56-69%)  than  at  400  mg  (19-44%)  in  studies  0102  and  0109.  Dose 
reduction or interruption was useful in 1.9% to 4.1% of patients, but treatment was discontinued due to 
death  in  only  one  patient  in  study  0102  in  a  context  of  congestive  heart  failure,  renal  failure  and 
pleural effusion. Another patient discontinued imatinib due to grade 2 generalised oedema.

Fluid retention was reported in 6.9% to 13% of treated patients and was more frequent in study 0110. 
This event was severe in 1.4% to 2.3% of patients and reported as serious in 0.6% to 3.1% of patients. 
No treatment discontinuation was reported due to fluid retention. Dose reduction or interruption was 
necessary in 0.2% to 1% of patients. 
Among all the serious or severe cases of fluid retention or oedema, half of patients presented a medical 
history of hypertension or cardiac failure or renal impairment or coronary artery disease or pulmonary 
disease. 
Muscle cramps, myalgia, arthralgia were common (from 4.6% to 38.7% of treated patients), but were 
less frequent in advanced CML studies. Grade 3-4 musculo-skeletal events were recorded in 2.4% to 
0% of patients. Serious musculo-skeletal adverse events were reported in few  patients (0 to 1.2% of 
patients). Only one patient discontinued imatinib due to joint pain during study 0110. Dose reduction 
or interruption was necessary in 0 to 1.4% of patients. However two patients experienced severe and 
disabling myalgia or arthralgia, requiring analgesia with morphine. 
Drug-related  skin  rashes  were  collected  in  21%  to  26%  of  patients,  but  were  severe  or  serious  in 
approximately 3% of patients (Table 12). Half of serious or severe cases were related to study drug. 
One  case of  urticaria/angioedema andtwo cases of  Sweet syndrome (1  appearance and  1 worsening) 
were  notified.  One  case  of  multiforme  erythema  was  not  related  to  study  drug.  Other  cases  were 
described  as  generalised,  erythmatous  or  maculopapular,  sometimes  hemorrhagic  or  pruritic  rashes, 
and  occasionally  had  an  exfoliative  component.  0.7%  of  patients  experienced  positive  re-challenge 
when  imatinib  was  reintroduced.  Rashes  were  associated  with  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  levels  in 
0.6% of cases. They were managed with anti-histaminics or topical corticosteroids. They had required 
dose  reduction  or  interruption  in  4  to  5%  of  patients  and  treatment  discontinuation  in  0.4  to  1%  of 
patients.  
Liver toxicity : 2-5% of patients experienced drug-related liver toxicity, 1-3% of them were severe. 1-
3.5%  of  patients  presented  serious  adverse  events.  Treatment  was  discontinued  in  less  than  0.5%  of 
patients. Dose reduction or interruption was necessary in 2-6% of cases. 
Renal toxicity : 0.4-1% of patients experienced drug-related renal toxicity, less of 0.5% of them were 
severe. 0.4-3% of patients presented serious adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in less than 
1% of patients. Dose reduction or interruption was not necessary.

During  the  phase  II  programme,  2.2%  of  treated  patients  experienced  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage. 
Half  of  cases  occurred  in  a  context  of  disease  progression.  A  quarter  of  cases  were  drug-related. 
Severe  thrombocytopenia  were  present  in  more  than  half  of  cases.  Two  cases  of  Mallory  Weiss 
syndrome were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of these events. 
Two cases of neutropenic colitis and clostridium difficile pancolitis were recorded during study 0109. 
In  phase  II  studies  2.8%  of  patients  treated  experienced  serious  cases  of  CNS  haemorrhage.  The 
majority  occurred  in  a  context  of  rapidly  progressive  disease,  with  concomitant  thrombocytopenia. 
One  case  was  considered  to  be  potentially  related  to  a  drug  interaction  between  imatinib  and 
warfarine, leading to a permanent discontinuation of imatinib.

Fatal Adverse Events 
In  most  cases,  deaths  were  related  to  disease  progression.  Only  two  deaths  were  related  to  imatinib 
toxicity (in one case this occurred with paracetamol used as concomitant medication). The relationship 
with study drug was suspected in a third case. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Haematology 
Blood cytopenia was a very common finding in all studies (Tables 13 and 14). The occurrence of drug 
related severe haematotoxicity correlated with the CML seriousness. The time to nadir of neutropenia 
and  thrombopenia  was  shorter  in  advanced  CML  and  the  duration  of  grade  3-4  neutropenia  and 
thrombopenia  was  longer  in  advanced  CML.  The  median  duration  of  the  neutropenic  and 
thrombopenic episodes ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and 3 to 4 weeks, respectively. In studies 0102 and 
0109, there were no apparent differences in the frequency and kinetics of these events between the 2 
doses of 400 and 600 mg.

Biochemistry 
Grade 3 elevations of creatinine were uncommon and were reported in 3 patients each in study 0102 
and  0109. All 6 patients presented advanced disease or had pre-existing renal problems. No grade  4 
creatinine elevation were reported in any study. 
Elevation of transaminases occurred with a similar frequency across studies. There was a decreasing 
frequency of grade 3 bilirubinemia from study 0102 to study 0110, which suggest a relationship to the 
underlying  disease.  The  median  duration  of  hyperbilirubinemia  and  elevated  transaminases  was 
approximately 1 week.  
The rate of discontinuation or dose modification or interruption due to serious or severe hepatotoxicity 
is  between  2.6%  and  0.3%.  Confounding  factors  (pre-existing  elevation  of  hepatic  enzymes)  and 
promoting factors (sepsis, cardiac failure, shock…)  were  frequent  in study 0102. The  seriousness of 
hepatotoxicity was significant in study 0102.

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The  most  frequent  drug-related  clinical  adverse  effects  were  gastrointestinal  toxicity  (nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhoea,  gastrointestinal hemorrhage), fluid retention  or  oedema (peri-orbital, limbs,  and 
face), musculo-skeletal toxicity (cramps, myalgia, arthralgia), and skin toxicity (maculopapular rash). 
Oedema  was  the  only  clinical  side  effect  dose-related,  and  aetiology  remains  almost  unknown.  The 
MAH should commit to propose further evaluation of this adverse event management.  
Gastrointestinal  toxicity  occurred  more  often  in  advanced  CML  patients,  while  fluid  retention  and 
musculo-skeletal toxicity occurred rather in early CML patients. All these adverse events were severe 
only in few cases and did not lead to a high rate of protocol treatment discontinuation.  
Serious  rash  was  a  common  side  effect  of  imatinib,  leading  to  interruption  or  discontinuation  of 
treatment. No case of bullous rash has been reported and the applicant has committed to monitor this 
issue closely.  
The  occurrence  of  CNS  hemorrhage  was  related  to  disease  progression  except  in  one  case  of 
interaction  between  imatinib  and  warfarine.  The  common  way  of  metabolism  of  imatinib  and 
warfarine may increase the concentrations of warfarine and in case the use of warfarine in thrombosis 
prophylaxis becomes necessary, special caution has to be taken. 
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is an expected adverse effect of imatinib due to its direct irritant effect. 
This potentially serious side effect is addressed adequately the SPC and a warning on the possibility of 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been added. Colitis should be monitored. 
Haematologic  toxicity  (all  three  lineages)  and  alteration  of  liver  parameters  were  observed.  The 
frequency of this toxicity increased with the seriousness of CML. Haematologic toxicity was not dose 
related. Additional data on time to onset and particularly duration of grade 3-4 haematotoxicity during 
study 0102 should be provided, as well as the relationship between severe neutropenia and occurrence 
of infections. 
Regarding the case of fatal hepatic failure, the probability of an increase in paracetamol concentrations 
is high in view of imatinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore the SPC recommends restricting or avoiding 
paracetamol use. This analgesic is frequently used in this population either as a prescription or over-
the-counter  medicinal  product.  At  present,  no  study  to  investigate  the  effects  of  paracetamol  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of imatinib was provided. The hepatotoxicity of imatinib, already observed in pre-
clinical  study,  was  also  observed  during  the  phase  II  studies  and  lead  to  dose  modification  or 
interruption  or  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Appropriate  dose  modification/interruption  of  imatinib 
are detailed in the sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.

The  safety  profile  of  imatinib  in  AP  patients  was  similar  to  the  chronic  phase  study  but  adverse 
reactions were more frequent and severe in this study. The toxicity was more intense for the 600 mg 
dose than for 400 mg. 
In  conclusion,  15-64.6%  of  patients  experienced  serious  adverse  effects  and  2.4-21.9%  of  patients 
discontinued  imatinib  due  to  adverse  effect.  The  safety  profile  of  imatinib  is  dependant  on  stage  of 
CML  disease.  In  advanced  CML  patients,  the  exposure  to  study  drug  is  shorter,  whereas  there  is 
higher rate of SAE, deaths and discontinuation of treatment. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology  
Imatinib  has  shown  effects  in  the  specified  pharmacodynamic  (reduction  in  leukocyte  count)  and 
efficacy endpoints (haematologic and cytogenetic responses). A dose-response was observed, with an 
increase  in  response  rate  at  doses  higher  than  300  mg.  The  results  obtained  for  chronic  phase  were 
positive and consistent across the different endpoints while for acute phase patients this was less so. 
A 400 mg dose for imatinib monotherapy was initially chosen for the clinical program. As more safety 
data became available, the protocols in accelerated and BC phases were amended to make 600 mg the 
starting dose. Protocols allowed dose escalation in patients who failed to respond at a lower dose or 
who  subsequently  relapsed,  i.e.,  from  600  mg  to  800  mg,  and  from  400  to  800  mg  in  study  0110 
(chronic phase) despite an increased frequency of AEs at higher doses (results not submitted). 
The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  imatinib  regarding  resistance  to  treatment  and  therefore,  the 
consequences  in  the  treatment  of  CML  have  not  been  described.  Pre-clinical  in  vitro  data  suggested 
that  an  important  mechanism  of  drug  resistance  is  the  amplification  of  the  Bcr-Abl  gene,  leading  to 
increased amounts of the target protein. It was hypothesised that high doses could be more effective in 
inhibiting the target kinase in these patients with overall poor prognosis.  
In  conclusion,  the  pharmacodynamic  investigations  of  a  proposed  starting  dose,  doses  increases  and 
the maximum dose although limited, provides enough evidence to support the proposed posology for 
continuing the investigation with imatinib in the phase II studies, although optimal dose regimen has 
not been completely established. 
The  oral  bioavailability  of  imatinib  in  capsules  is  high  (97%),  with  a  rapid  absorption  (tmax:  2-4  h). 
Half-life  of  elimination  t1/2  is  18  hours,  which  is  supportive  of  the  proposed  posology  of  one  daily 
administration. The volume of distribution was approximately 435 L, reflecting extensive distribution.  
At  multiple  doses,  imatinib  has  shown  a  dose-proportionality  for  the  dose  range  of  25-1000  mg  in 
patients diagnosed with CML. 
Imatinib  is  mainly  transformed  by  the  cytochrome  CYP3A4  and  also  it  competitively  inhibits 
CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5.  
In the two interaction studies submitted, it has been shown that the co-administration of imatinib and 
the metabolic inhibitor ketoconazole increased significantly the exposure to imatinib. In addition, an 
inhibition of the metabolism of simvastatin by CYP3A4 by imatinib was observed. Therefore, imatinib 
may increase the exposure to co-medications that are substrates of these cytochromes, but this has not 
been sufficiently investigated yet.  
The main metabolite of imatinib is CGP 74588. Its AUC was 16% of that for imatinib with a similar 
pharmacodynamic potency to it. In addition, on third of the dose was accounted by minor unidentified 
metabolites. 
For cytochrome CYP2D6, no studies specifically investigating this question have been performed yet. 
Preliminary  clinical  consequences  regarding  toxicity  are  also  associated  with  these  findings.  The 
concomitant  administration  of  simvastatin  and  imatinib  should  not  be  recommended  because  of  an 
increased risk of myopathy associated with high plasma concentration of statins.  
Concomitant  use  of  imatinib  with  substances  that  inhibit  or  induce  the  CYP3A4  or  with  CYP3A4 
substrates is not recommended until reassuring data are available. 
27/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
A  statement  indicating  that  no  specific  studies  have  been  performed  with  imatinib  and  CYP2D6 
substrates has been included in the SPC. It would be of interest to know the real clinical implications 
of this interaction showed only by in vitro tests. 
A statement recommending the intake of imatinib with food in order to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity 
is  included  in  the  SPC.  With  the  available  pharmacokinetic  data  regarding  food  interaction  with 
imatinib, this recommendation is acceptable, since the presence of food did not modify substantially 
the pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Exposure  to  imatinib  increases  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  although  the  potential  clinical 
relevance of this issue is unknown in the absence of specific trials. 
The investigation of interactions for imatinib cannot be considered extensive enough to characterise it 
appropriately.  There  are  no  specific  studies  in  special  populations.  Taking  into  account  the  hepatic 
elimination  of  imatinib,  its  pharmacokinetics  should  be  investigated  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment.  Although the dossier  contains  a description of the pharmacokinetics profile  of imatinib, 
there  are  some  aspects  that  require  further  investigation  such  as  the  interactions  with  the  drugs 
currently  used  in  CML  patients  and,  the  pharmacokinetics  in  special  populations  such  as  renal  and 
hepatic impairment, particularly the possibly reduced clearance in hepatic impaired patients. 
Clinical Efficacy 
The  phase  I  study  showed  a  dose-response  relation  with  a  haematologic  response  rate  of  39%  in 
patients who started imatinib with <300 mg per day compared to 98% of patients who received ≥300 
mg (chronic phase CML). The MCR rates were 18% and 41% respectively. 
The main evidence of efficacy of imatinib in CML comes from three uncontrolled, open-label studies 
(0110,  0109  and  0102),  for  the  three  submitted  indications  (chronic  phase  CML,  AP  CML  and  BC 
CML) in 1057 CML patients.  
In  these  phase  II  studies,  haematological  or  cytogenetic  response  by  starting  dose  suggests  that  the 
response was somewhat greater with the higher dose than with the lower dose. This was confirmed by 
an exploratory analysis adjusted for patient and tumour characteristics. 
Long term efficacy and safety data are limited or absent. In the main phase II studies 0109 and 0102 
the number of patients with drug exposure ≥12 months was 6 (2.6%) and 3 (1%) in studies 0109 and 
0102, respectively. In the main phase II study 0110, the longest exposure to imatinib was 320 days. At 
present, in the absence of mature data on overall survival and progression free survival, assumptions 
on the relevance of the pre-defined primary endpoints are required. The assumptions appear justified 
as  the  achievement  of  a  haematological  response  implies  a  degree  of  disease  control  and  that  the 
validity  of  cytogenetic  and  haematological  response  has  been  shown  for  IFN.  Nevertheless,  the 
validity of such assumption on the chosen surrogate endpoint will need to be proven. 
The definitions and evaluation criteria for CHR and MCR are acceptable. The definition for CHR is 
comparable to those used in the Italian and the French co-operative group studies with the exception of 
the  criteria  for  the  platelet  count;  the  definition  of  MCR  is  comparable  to  the  French  and  Italian 
studies. 
Chronic Phase CML 
The  overall  MCR  rate  in  this  study  (including  IFN  intolerant  patients)  was  49.4%.  The  pre-defined 
objectives  of  the  study were  met with  a  MCR rate  of 36.2% (complete: 20.4%)  in the haematologic 
IFN  failure  sub  group  and  51.1%  (30.1%)  in  the  cytogenetic  IFN  failure  subgroup.  Overall,  88% 
patients  had  a  complete  haematological  response  with  82.9%  achieved  within  the  haematologic  IFN 
failure  subgroup  and  93%  within  the  cytogenetic  IFN  failure  subgroup.  The  estimated  9-month 
survival and time to progression rates were 98.1% and 78.7%.  
Despite the known drawbacks of this approach, compared to historical controls from published series, 
cytogenetic  and  haematologic  responses  are  considered  as  outstanding,  with  close  to  50%  response 
rate after 3 months of treatment and especially taking into account that the included patients have bad 
prognosis because the interval since diagnosis is long.  
28/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
Accelerated Phase CML 
The  overall  haematologic  response  rate  (primary  endpoint)  was  of  63%  (28%  complete),  with  very 
similar  results  for  the  two  doses.  A  confirmed  MCR  was  achieved  in  21.3%,  with  a  trend  towards 
higher response rates in the 600 mg group than in the 400 mg group (24.1% and 15.6% respectively). 
Complete cytogenetic responses were achieved in 14% of patients (17.1% and 9.1% respectively). 
Results  of  time  to  progression  and  survival  are  very  limited  and  should  be  updated.  A  landmark 
analysis of this study suggested that the achievement of such responses is probably clinically relevant. 
These results will need to be confirmed as more mature survival data become available. 
In conclusion for patients in AP, haematological results were interesting, and cytogenetic results are 
outstanding  in  spite  of  the  lack  of  a  demonstrated  association  between    achievement  of  cytogenetic 
response and survival. 
Blast Crisis Phase CML 
Haematological response rate was 51%, confirmed in half of these. Response was higher in previously 
untreated patients than in treated patients (30.3% versus 18.9%) and in the 600 mg/d group than in the 
400  mg/d  group  (28.7%  versus  10.8%).  MCR  were  recorded  in  13.5%  of  patients  (previously 
untreated: 12.1%, previously treated: 15.8%) and, complete CR were respectively 4.8 and 5.3%. 
Taking in due account the severe prognosis in this very advanced phase, results show a clinical benefit 
in  the  elderly  patients  subgroup,  where  an  improved  response  rate  in  patients  with  age  >60 
years (CHR=39.2%  versus  19.1%  for  patients  <60  years).  This  is  a  very  interesting  finding, 
particularly taking into account the high toxicity of cytotoxic regimens commonly observed in elderly 
patients.  
In  addition  the  dramatic  improvement  observed  in  a  few  patients  is  outstanding:  CHR  and,  more 
importantly, unconfirmed MCR results are outstanding as compared to what reported in the literature. 
The responses obtained in BC phase CML are much poorer than those obtained in the previous stages 
of  CML.  The  magnitude  of  effect  of  imatinib  seems  comparable  to  that  obtained  in  historical  data 
where no effective treatment is available. 
Clinical Safety 
Imatinib  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  patients  with  CML.  The  majority  of  patients  experienced 
adverse events at some point in time, but most were of mild to moderate grade, and in clinical trials 
drug  discontinuation  because  of  drug-related  adverse  events  was  observed  in  only  1%  of  patients  in 
chronic phase, 2% of patients in AP and 5% of BC patients.  
The  most  commonly  reported  related  adverse  events  were  nausea,  sometimes  accompanied  by 
vomiting, dyspepsia and/or upper abdominal pain. Other commonly reported toxicity was oedema at 
various sites (most frequently in the peri-orbital region), and a variety of musculo-skeletal symptoms 
including muscle cramps, myalgia and arthralgia.  Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia, have 
been a consistent finding in all studies 
Miscellaneous  adverse  events  such  as  pleural  effusion,  ascites,  pulmonary  oedema  and  rapid  weight 
gain  with  or  without  superficial  oedema  may  be  collectively  described  as  “fluid  retention”.  These 
events  can  usually  be  managed  by  interrupting  imatinib  and  with  diuretics  or  other  appropriate 
supportive care measures. However, a few of these events may be serious or life-threatening and one 
patient with BC died with a complex clinical history of pleural effusion, congestive heart failure and 
renal failure. 
Excluding myelosuppression, which was an expected effect, some SAEs warrant special mentioning. 
Rash was occasionally quite severe and led to discontinuation in a minority of patients. Liver toxicity - 
manifesting  as  raised  transaminases,  though  sometimes  accompanied  by  raised  bilirubin  and/or 
alkaline  phosphatase  Fluid  retention,  oedema  and/or  renal  toxicity  -  leading  in  severe  cases  to 
generalized  fluid  retention,  weight  gain  and  pleural  or  pericardial  effusions  and  ascites,  and  more 
rarely to congestive heart failure or pre-renal failure. GI tract hemorrhage - though usually observed in

EMEA 2004 
 
the setting  of  profound thrombocytopenia,  this AE  may be related to local irritation  of the  upper GI 
tract.  CNS  hemorrhage  -  episodes  of  cerebral  bleeding  were  generally  associated  with  profound 
thrombocytopenia and their frequency seems to be no higher than expected in this patient population.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The active substance is well-defined, and the product is formulated, manufactured and controlled in a 
way  that  is  characteristic  of  a  powder-filled  hard  gelatin  capsule.  The  specifications  guarantee  a 
consistent product with uniform bioavailability from batch to batch and the safety of the impurities has 
been demonstrated with reference to toxicology studies. 
Therefore in general, there are no outstanding major quality issues which may have a negative impact 
on  the  benefit/risk  balance.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  confirm  the  stability  of  the  product  by 
providing  the  results  of  two  additional  production-scale  batches  of  product  packaged  in  PVC  and 
Triplex which have been placed on stability trials as extra confirmation. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacodynamic  studies  demonstrate  that  imatinib  inhibited  Bcr-Abl  protein-
tyrosine kinase activity in leukaemic cell lines as well as in primary leukaemia cells from patients with 
Ph positive CML and ALL.  Imatinib showed antitumor activity in nude mice injected with the Bcr-
Abl  positive  KU812  cell  line  derived  from  a  CML  patient  in  BC  supporting  the  hypothesis  that 
imatinib  could  be  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  CML.    The  applicant  has  agreed  to 
justify the lack of pharmacodynamic studies comparing the activity of imatinib with that of standard 
therapies. 
From  the  few  interaction  studies  performed  by  the  applicant  only  erythromycin  and  fluconazole 
showed an inhibition of imatinib metabolism which could be clinically relevant.  Imatinib was shown 
to be metabolised by CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 enzymes.   
Imatinib  was  systemically  exposed  to  several  animal  species  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetics.    Gender 
differences  were  slight  and  only  observed  in  some  species,  and  accumulation  after  repeated  dosing 
was not observed in any species tested. Imatinib is distributed in foetal tissue and is excreted into milk; 
this is also expected to occur in humans.  
From  toxicity  studies,  imatinib  was  found  to  be  genotoxic  only  under  the  most  extreme  in  vitro 
conditions.  Imatinib  was  also  shown  to  be  embryotoxic  (increased  post-implantation  loss)  and  is 
teratogenic in rats.  The risks of imatinib treatment in women of childbearing potential is addressed in 
the SPC:  contraceptive measures should be used during treatment and women already pregnant before 
treatment  start  should  be  warned  of  the  risks.    No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed.  
Overall,  the  target  organs  for  imatinib  toxicity  were  identified  as  including  bone  marrow,  lymphoid 
tissues, reproductive organs and gastrointestinal tract.  This may occur at therapeutic doses, but given 
the severity of the disease, the benefit/risk ratio can be considered positive. 
Clinical aspects 
In  chronic  and  accelerated  phases,  the  efficacy  results  regarding  response  rate  were  outstanding 
compared to historical series. In fact, the results in terms of MCR rate in chronic phase CML resistant 
or  intolerant  to  IFN  are  outstanding  (close  to  50%)  after  a  short  time  of  treatment  (3  months).  At 
present, apart from BMT, no other treatments are known to achieve this size of effect on this endpoint.  
In BC, one  phase II uncontrolled study with  a total of 260 patients  with  CML  myeloid BC  (95  pre-
treated  and  165  untreated)  was  submitted.  The  response  rate  was  high,  with  a  rapid  reduction  in 
leukocytosis  and  blasts  in  approximately  50%  of  patients.  However,  the  duration  of  this  response  is 
extremely limited. Median survival was 4.5 or 7 months depending on whether they were pre-treated 
or not. 
30/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
In  the  absence  of  mature  data  on  overall  survival  and  progression  free  survival,  assumptions  on  the 
relevance of the primary clinical efficacy endpoints studies are required. Specific analysis updates on 
relevant endpoints will be submitted as specific obligations. 
Regarding safety, imatinib appears acceptably tolerated in the studies where it was studied. Incidence 
and  severity  of  adverse  events  increased  with  dose  escalating  and  disease  progression,  including 
severe  medullar  aplasia,  especially  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  Complications  of  fluid 
overload or redistribution occurred in some patients, suggesting a potentially serious drug effect.  
The  long-term  benefits  of  imatinib  are  not  yet  known.  Specific  protocols  for  longer-term  follow  up 
will be submitted as specific obligations. 
In addition, further data must be gathered on an ongoing basis and the benefit/risk re-evaluated, as new 
data are available to clarify the population that could benefit from imatinib. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
In an oral explanation, the applicant has provided additional argumentation to support the assumptions 
related to the clinical relevance of the main endpoints and to the relative treatment effect of imatinib 
compared to published series. 
An update (cut-off date 31 January 2001) of the primary and secondary endpoints of the three pivotal 
studies  was  presented  confirming  the  results  previously  submitted.  With  up  to  four  months  of 
additional follow-up, the efficacy update showed a higher rate of haematological response, major and 
complete cytogenetic response in all trials and a similar duration of response, time-to-progression and 
overall survival. 
An  update  of  analyses  exploring  the  association  between  response  and  survival  confirmed  that  the 
achievement of a haematologic response at 3 months is associated with a prolonged survival in studies 
0102  and  0109.  Achievement  of  a  MCR  at  3  months  was  associated  with  an  improved  survival  in 
study 0109. In study 0110, the achievement of a MCR at 3 months was associated with an improved 
time to progression. 
According to currently available data imatinib appears promising compared to alternative second line 
chemotherapy in terms of both haematologic and cytogenetic response. The rate of CHR to second line 
therapy usually ranges from 20 to 54% with HU or BU, and was 72% in two single-centre studies of 
the  investigational  agent  HHT.  In  contrast,  in  study  0110  (n=532),    the  rate  of  CHR  was  89%.  The 
rates of MCR that can be expected with HU and BU are in the range of 1 to 5%, up to 15% in the HHT 
trials.  Notably,  when  IFN  is  started  late  in  the  chronic  phase,  the  rate  of  MCR  decreases  rapidly  to 
only 8%. In comparison, the rate of major and complete cytogenetic responses were 55% and 36% in 
study 0110. 
Blast  crisis  is  the  terminal  event  in  the  clinical  course  of  CML,  defined  usually  as  the  presence  of 
≥30%  marrow  blasts.  There  is  no  standard  therapy  available  for  these  patients.  Treatment  usually 
includes  combination  chemotherapy  regimen  commonly  used  to  treat  ALL  or  AML,  as  appropriate. 
Published series have reported a haematological response in the range of  20% to 40%, but response is 
complete  in  only  5%  to  30%  of  patients,  and  generally  short-lived.  The  prognosis  of  patients  with 
CML in myeloid BC has is poor and median survival is in the range of 3 to 6 months.  
The  data  presented showed that imatinib was active in patients  with  myeloid BC, inducing  a rate of 
haematological response which was in the range of what reported for chemotherapy but with a higher 
rate of cytogenetic response and a median survival which compared favourably with what is usually 
reported with chemotherapy.  
Although the clinical  relevance  of  complete cytogenetic response  for imatinib  mesilate has  not  been 
validated,  this  endpoint  is  directly  linked  with  the  well  established  pathology  of  the  disease  and 
association with clinical benefit can be in principle  assumed pending further  validation as follow up 
measures and specific obligations (see Specific obligations and follow-up measures of the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder). 
Given  the  outstanding  activity  observed,  the  CPMP  considered  that  an  approval  under  exceptional 
circumstances could be considered, provided that the applicant commits to fulfil the agreed follow-up 
measures and to complete the identified programme of studies laid out as specific obligations, within 
31/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
the specified timeframe, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk 
profile. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Glivec  in  the  treatment  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome 
(bcr-abl) positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase after failure of interferon- alpha 
therapy, or in accelerated phase or myeloid blast crisis was favourable and therefore recommended the 
granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. 
6.  
Extension of the indication: treatment of Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are uncommon visceral sarcoma that arises predominantly in 
the gastrointestinal tract. A the time of  this application, the MAH had established that malignant GIST 
was estimated to be affecting 0.06 in 10,000 persons in the EU.  
The origin of GIST is not fully understood, but available histopathogenetic evidence links GIST cells 
with the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), gastrointestinal pacemaker cells that regulate gut peristalsis.  
GIST  are  the  most  common  subtype  of  GI  sarcomas,  which  also  include  leiomyosarcomas, 
liposarcomas and other more rare histologic subtypes. GIST have been reported to represent about  3% 
of all malignant GI tumours.  
GIST  are  most  common  in  the  stomach  (60-70%),  followed  by  small  intestine  (20-30%),  colon  and 
rectum  (5%),  and  oesophagus  (<5%).  GIST  primary  in  the  omentum  and  mesentery  have  also  been 
reported.  Recurrence  of  disease  after  resection  is  predominantly  intra-abdominal  and  involves  the 
original tumour site, peritoneum and liver. 
Recent advances in molecular and immunohistochemical analysis of GIST have identified that GIST 
cells  are  positive  for  CD117,  a  cell  surface  antigen  localised  on  the  extracellular  domain  of  the 
transmembrane  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  KIT,  the  protein  product  of  the  proto-oncogene  c-KIT  and 
receptor for stem cell factor. It is hypothesized that virtually all malignant GIST harbour mutations of 
c-KIT as the driving factor of this disease, resulting in constitutive activation of KIT associated with 
the  signal  transduction  pathway  for  cell  division  and  tumour  growth.  KIT  overexpression  is 
determined by immunohistochemistry which are performed in standard practice. 
The treatment of GIST so far has been almost uniquely surgical and there is no approved specific drug 
therapy. Whereas resection is potentially curative, especially in low-grade or borderline tumours, long-
term  outcome  is  dismal  for  patients  with  large,  high-grade  lesions,  even  with  complete  surgical 
extirpation.  For  patients  who  undergo  complete  resection  there  is  high  risk  of  recurrence  within  the 
abdomen.  Median  time  to  recurrence  is  in  the  range  of  7  months  to  2  years,  with  the  probability  of 
recurrence  after  re-excision  approaching  100%.  Most  GIST  do  not  respond  to  radiotherapy  and/or 
chemotherapy  and  are  ultimately  lethal.  There  is  no  evidence  that  pre-operative  or  post-operative 
systemic therapy has a favourable impact on outcome.  
The  prognosis  is  poor  largely  due  to  the  fact  that  there  is  no  effective  systemic  therapy  for 
unresectable  or  metastatic  malignant  GIST.  Since  treatment  with  any  conventional  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  is  considered  ineffective,  current  recommendations  for  these  patients  are  to  enter 
clinical trials. Response rates  for true  GIST  to any conventional  chemotherapy are  much lower  than 
for other sarcomas of non-osseous tissues and range from 0% to 5%. The estimated progression free 
survival for metastatic GIST is less than 2 months. The median survival of GIST patients for whom 
complete resection cannot be accomplished is in the range of 10 to 12 months. 
Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the KIT-associated tyrosine kinase at an 
IC50  of  approximately  100  nM  which  is  similar  to  that  required  for  inhibiting  the  tyrosine  kinases 
associated with Bcr-Abl and the PDGF- receptor. A primary cell line established from a patient with 
GIST  characterized  by  the  point  mutation  K642E  that  results  in  autoactivation  of  the  c-KIT  protein 
product  showed  inhibition  of  cell  growth  by  imatinib  at  concentrations  of  0.1-1  µM.  These  results 
32/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided the rationale for the clinical development of imatinib in the treatment of malignancies such 
as GIST that are completely or partially dependent upon the activity of wild type or mutant c-KIT for 
proliferation and/or survival. 
Clinical aspects 
This  application  is  based  on  one  pivotal  phase  II  trial  (B2222)  and  a  publication  (a  phase  I-II  study 
performed by the EORTC, and a single patient case report)1,2,3.  
B2222  is  a  multi-center,  randomised,  phase  II  study.  All  patients  included  in  B2222  trial  had 
unresectable  and/or  metastatic  GIST.  The  sample  size  was  expanded  from  36  to  200  in  several 
amendments.  Finally,  147  patients  have  been  included.  This  interim  analysis  was  not  prospectively 
planned. 
Patients included in the trial were randomly assigned to receive imatinib 400 mg or 600 mg daily. 
The primary endpoint was objective response rate (complete response, CR plus partial response, PR), 
following the SWOG response criteria. These criteria are mainly based on bi-dimensional tumour size 
based  on  physical  examination  and  imaging  and  are  the  standard  criteria  for  phase  II  trials  in  this 
setting.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response, time to response, time to treatment failure 
(TTF) and overall survival. Failure was defined as either progressive disease, death due to any cause, 
or protocol treatment discontinuation for any reason other than “condition no longer requires therapy”. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  study  B2222,  a  full  pharmacokinetics  analysis  was  performed  in  a  subset  of  GIST  patients 
following continuous once daily oral administration for both imatinib doses (400 mg, n=10; 600 mg, 
n=9). Imatinib was rapidly absorbed after the first administration and there was an approximate 1.5-
fold  drug  accumulation  after  one  month.  The  AUC (0-24h)  values  indicate  1.2  times  higher  drug 
exposure for the 600 mg dose than for 400 mg at steady state. Considerable inter-patient variability of 
pharmacokinetics  was  observed  and  the  coefficient  of  variation  for  AUC  was  about  40%  at  steady 
state. A population PK approach, on data from patients with full PK profiles (n=19) and those patients 
with  limited  PK  sampling  (n=54)  identified  albumin,  WBC  and  bilirubin  showing  a  statistically 
significant relationship with imatinib PK.  
The  PK  of  imatinib  in  GIST  patients  seem  to  differ  from  CML.  Peak  plasma  concentrations  and 
systemic exposure observed in GIST patients were higher than those observed in CML patients at 400 
and  600  mg.  This  may  have  been  related  to  differences  in  the  liver  function  between  the  two 
populations  (78.2%  of  GIST  patients  had  liver  metastases).  In  addition,  patients  with  GIST  had  a 
higher  percentage  of  biochemical  abnormalities  than  CML  patients  at  baseline  for  albumin,  alkaline 
phosphatase,  SGOT  and  SGPT.  The  cause  of  these  differences  in  PK  is  unknown  although  hepatic 
impairment could be involved. The presence of hepatic metastases is related with hepatic insufficiency 
and this is in turn, expected to reduce metabolisms. The biochemical abnormalities observed in GIST 
patients (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT and SGPT) support this hypothesis. Additional factors 
such  as  some  functional  and  anatomic  abnormalities  associated  with  GIST  could  also  be  involved. 
Intestinal surgery could influence drug absorption or hepatic surgery could decrease drug elimination. 
Therefore, the pharmacokinetics profile of imatinib in this population should be further investigated.

Efficacy 
Seventy-three  patients  received  400 mg  of  imatinib  daily,  and  74  received  600 mg  daily  for  periods 
ranging from 7 days to up to 13 months. The mean duration of treatment was 7 months. At the time of 
the analysis, only 10 patients had received treatment with imatinib for ≥12 months.  
The main reasons for treatment discontinuation (n=25, 17%) were progressive disease (7.5%), adverse 
events (3%), and death (3%).  
No CRs were observed in the intent-to treat analysis. Fifty nine out of 147 patients achieved a PR. The 
overall  response  rate  was  59/147  (40.1  %,  95%CI:  32.1  %  -  48.5%).  There  was  no  difference  in 
response rate between the two doses of imatinib. Sixty-one patients (41.5%) had stable disease (table 
1).

The Kaplan-Meier estimate of patients who were free from treatment failure at 12 weeks was 80% and 
this estimate was 66% at 24 weeks . A difference between dose groups was not observed. At the cut-
off date for analysis, 38 patients had failed therapy, mainly due to disease-related events. The median 
TTF has not yet been reached. Overall survival has not been analysed for the interim report due to the 
low number of deaths observed and the short follow-up period. 
In  a  published  dose-escalating phase I trial with  40  patients (of  whom  36 had  GISTs)  who received 
imatinib  at  doses  of  400  mg  once  daily  (8  patients),  300  mg  twice  daily  (8  patients),  400  mg  twice 
daily  (16  patients)  or  500  mg  twice  daily  (8  patients),  19/36  (52.8%)  confirmed  partial  responses 
(RECIST criteria) were observed.. 
Two phase III studies (B2223 and B2224) comparing 400 vs 800 mg of imatinib in the treatment of 
GIST are ongoing. An update on patient recruitment planned availability of data and results from these 
studies will be provided as part of the specific obligations of the MAH. 
Safety 
The toxicity profile of imatinib in the pivotal trial in GIST patients was similar to that observed in 
CML patients. AEs with suspected relationship to study drug are reported in table 2. No major 
differences in toxicity were attributable to the imatinib doses given in the trial. Toxicity was observed 
in 66% of the patients and grade 3-4 toxicity was reported in < 3% of patients.  
The most commonly reported adverse events were fluid retention, emesis, diarrhoea, muscle cramps, 
fatigue and skin rash (table 2). In comparison to CML studies, there was an increased frequency of 
oedema in GIST patients, which was characterised as either periorbital (47% of patients), lower limb 
(19% of patients) or facial (10% of patients) and that was of grade 3-4 severity in 1.4 % patients.

 1  Other fluid retention events included pleural effusion and ascites 
There were 10 deaths reported, and none was attributed to the study drug.  
Seventeen patients (11.6%) suffered SAEs related to imatinib treatment. Treatment was discontinued 
for drug-related AEs in 4/147 patients (3%) of patients. These included 4 patients that developed GI 
bleeding and 3 patients that developed intratumoral haemorrhage.  
Clinical laboratory abnormalities related to liver and renal function were uncommon (grade 3: <5%, 
grade 4: <2%) and usually not related to imatinib.  
Haematological toxicity was lower than in CML patients. In the data submitted as part of the MAA for 
the registration of Glivec in CML, grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 25% 
and  16%  of  patients  with  chronic  phase  CML,  respectively,  as  compared  with  less  than  5%  of  the 
GIST patients in B2222. Grade 4 episodes of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 8% and 3% in 
CML patients and 0.4% and 0% in GIST patients, respectively. 
The  phase  I  study  by  the  EORTC  confirmed  the  safety  findings  of  the  pivotal  trial.  Dose-  limiting 
toxicities  (grade  3  emesis:  3  patients;  grade  3  oedema:  1  patient;  grade  3  dyspnoea:  1  patient)  were 
observed  at  the  dose  of  500  mg  twice  daily,  and  400  mg  twice  daily  was  shown  as  the  maximum 
clinically feasible dose. Intratumoural bleeding (one with perforation to the abdomen) was seen in 3 
patients. 
Benefit/risk analysis 
Overall,  the  efficacy  data  available  demonstrate  the  ability  of  imatinib  to  induce  tumour  regressions 
and disease stabilisation in a range of GIST patients, where no available therapy exists. 
The implications of such regressions on the natural history of the disease are unknown as yet, given 
the short follow up of the studies reported. Tumour regressions seem to be accompanied by tumour-
related  symptoms  improvement,  a  clinically  meaningful  endpoint.  Furthermore,  the  duration  of 
response and TTF as compared to that reported in historic series (median TTF: 1.2 versus >6 months) 
suggest that imatinib affords, at least, effective palliation for these patients.  
Imatinib appears to have an acceptable safety profile in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic, 
malignant  GIST.  Chronic  daily  administration  is  feasible  and,  though  relatively  frequent,  AEs  are 
35/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generally mild to moderate in severity and can be reasonably monitored and managed. Intratumoural 
haemorrhage is a potentially severe side effect that should be closely monitored.  
According  to  the  CPMP  “Note  for  guidance  on  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man. 
CPMP/EWP205/95,  Rev.1”  non-comparator  studies  maybe  acceptable  in  the  circumstances  of  a 
proven outstanding anticancer activity and an acceptable and extensively documented toxicity profile. 
In  this  application  for  a  new  indication  for  imatinib  in  GIST  patients  it  can  be  considered  the  these 
requirements set in the Note for guidance are met. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  has  committed  to  provide  on  an  ongoing  basis  regular  updates  with  longer 
follow-up on the trial B2222 (Response, Response Duration, TTF and survival data) and available data 
or  update  from  the  EORTC  phase  I/II  trial.  An  update  on  accrual,  efficacy  and  safety  on  the  study 
status of the NCI and EORTC Phase III studies will be provided. 
The MAH will also provide additional pharmacokinetic data on GIST patients, including the effect of 
liver dysfunction on imatinib pharmacokinetics. The effects of prior treatments (previous extensive 
gastric, bowel or liver surgery, embolisations, chemotherapy, etc) on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib 
in the GIST population should be investigated. A further assessment of PK relationship to prior 
surgery in the B2222 study will be performed. 
With  regard  to  safety,  The  MAH  has  committed  to  provide  long  term  toxicity  data  from  B2222, 
especially on intratumoural/ GI bleeding and fluid retention. This update will include a study on the 
impact of previous cardiac, renal, and hepatic function and prior treatments given on imatinib toxicity. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Glivec  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Kit  (CD  117)  positive 
unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of the additional indication. 
7. 
Extension of the indication to patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML 
Treatment  of  CML  is  usually  initiated  when  the  diagnosis  is  established,  which  is  done  by  the 
presence  of  an  elevated  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count,  thrombocytosis,  Philadelphia  (Ph) 
chromosome, and splenomegaly. The standard therapeutic options include IFN-α(IFN), chemotherapy 
with  hydroxyurea,  low-dose  cytarabine  or,  rarely,  busulfan.  CML  is  not  currently  curable  with 
conventional  chemotherapy  or  immunotherapy  and,  allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation  from 
related or unrelated donors in the chronic phase is the only known curative therapy, although it has a 
risk of mortality. 
There is no consensus on what should be the initial therapy for patients with early chronic phase CML. 
At  initial  diagnosis,  the  possibility  of  curative  therapy  with  bone  marrow  transplantation  (BMT)  is 
explored.  IFN-based  regimens  are  now  considered  as  the  standard  therapy  for  newly  diagnosed 
patients  in  chronic  phase  that  are  ineligible  for  allogeneic  transplantation.  Hematologic  responses 
(control of the peripheral blood counts) have been reported in 50-80% of patients and, about 20-40% 
of the chronic-phase patients treated with interferon alpha have major cytogenetic remissions (MCR, 
defined  as  <35%  Philadelphia  chromosome-positive  cells  in  the  bone  marrow).  The  achievement  of 
both  a  haematological  and  an  MCR  with  IFN  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  prolonged 
survival.  However,  the  majority  of  patients  treated  with  interferon  still  had  molecular  evidence  of 
disease when assessed by the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  
The combination of IFN and low-doses AraC has been investigated in phase II and phase III trials with 
the  objective  of  maximising  the  antileukaemic  effect  of  both  drugs.  It  has  been  found  that  the 
combination of IFN at the standard “high dose” regimen and low-dose intermittent subcutaneous AraC 
36/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is  more  effective  than  IFN  alone  in  inducing  both  hαematologic  and  cytogenetic  response,  although 
the translation of this effect into a prolonged survival remains controversial. Thus, there is a clear need 
for a more effective and safer therapy.  
The MAH applied for an extension of the imatinib indication, to the treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML).  Data  presented  in 
the  dossier  supporting  this  type  II  variation  relates  only  to  adult  population.  This  extension  of 
indication  is  mainly  based  on  the  results  of  a  pivotal  randomised  phase  III  trial  (0106)  comparing 
Glivec  as  single  agent  given  at  400  mg  with  interferon  (IFN)  plus  cytarabine  (Ara-C).  Additional 
safety data paediatric and late chronic phase and advanced phase CML have also been provided. 
The proposed dose for this indication is 400 mg/day. A dose increase from 400 mg to 600 mg (up to a 
maximum  of  800  mg/d)  is  recommended  in  the  absence  of  adverse  drug  reactions  if  assessments 
demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy. 
7.1.  Preclinical aspects 
In view of the expected longer treatment duration of newly diagnosed CML patients, a carcinogenicity 
study program has been initiated. In addition, since the original submission an oral pre- and post-natal 
development study in rats has been now completed. 
Carcinogenicity 
A  2-year  rat  carcinogenicity  study  is  presently  ongoing.  Protocol  design  was  based  on  the  ICH 
Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  S1C  Dose  selection  for  carcinogenicity  studies  of  pharmaceuticals 
and S1B Testing for carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals. A final study report is expected by mid 2005. 
In addition, a complementary carcinogenicity study in the p53 transgenic mouse model using gavage 
dosing is in planning. Therefore, the MAH is planning to: 
- perform a 4-week DRF study in the p53 wild type strain, starting 3rd quarter 2002. 
- initiate the main 26-week study in p53 mice, based on the results from the DRF study. 
A final study report for this mouse carcinogenicity study is expected no later than by mid 2005. 
Pre- and post-natal development  
Three  groups  of  timed-pregnant  F0  female  rats  were  administered  orally  the  test  compound  from 
implantation of the embryo (gestation day 6) to the end of lactation (lactation day 20), at daily doses of 
5, 15 and 45 mg/kg/day.  
There was no maternal mortality. Red vaginal discharge was noted for 5 females in the 45 mg/kg/day 
group  on  day  14  -  15  of  gestation.  The  significance  of  this  finding  is  unknown  since  all  of  these 
females produced viable litters and none had significantly elevated post-implantation loss. The number 
of stillborn pups was slightly increased and the number of viable pups per litter was decreased at 45 
mg/kg/day as was the number of pups dying between postpartum days 0 and 4. In the F1 offspring at 
the  same  dose  level,  mean  body  weights  were  reduced  from  birth  until  terminal  sacrifice  and  the 
number  of  litters  achieving  criterion  for  preputial  separation  was  slightly  decreased.  There  were  no 
other significant effects noted on developmental parameters or behavioural tests. F1 fertility was not 
affected, but reproductive effects were noted and included an increased number of resorptions and a 
decreased  number  of  viable  foetuses  at  45  mg/kg/day.  The  no  effect  level  for  both  the  maternal 
animals and the F1 generation was 15 mg/kg/day. 
7.2.  Clinical aspects 
The claim is supported by one pivotal phase II trial (0106). Study 0106 is an open-label, controlled, 
multicentre,  international  randomised  phase  III  study  comparing  treatment  with  either  Glivec 
monotherapy or a standard combination of IFN+Ara-C in patients with CML within 6 months of their 
37/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initial diagnosis. Because of differing mode of administration (Glivec being orally available and both 
IFN  and  Ara-C  requiring  subcutaneous  injections)  and  different  safety  profiles,  a  double-blind 
controlled design was considered impracticable by the applicant. On the basis of the efficacy seen with 
Glivec given as second-line therapy in patients in chronic phase CML failing prior IFN therapy in the 
phase  II  study 0110, the applicant  considered  a crossover to  be  an essential  component  of  the study 
design. Patients showing lack of response (lack of CHR at 6 months, increasing WBC, no MCyR at 24 
months), loss of response (loss of CHR or MCyR) or severe intolerance to treatment were allowed to 
crossover to the alternative treatment arm.  
Study 0106. Study design 
In the Glivec arm, patients were treated with 400 mg/day. In the IFN+Ara-C arm, patients were treated 
with the standard recommended target dose of IFN of 5 MIU/m2/day s.c., in combination with Ara-C 
20 mg/m2/day s.c. for 10 days/month. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is progression-free survival and the study was designed to 
show  superiority  of  first-line  therapy  with  Glivec.  Progression  was  defined  as  any  of  the  following 
event: progression to AP or BC, death, loss of CHR or MCyR, or in patients not achieving a CHR an 
increasing  WBC  despite  appropriate  therapeutic  management.  MCyR  was  considered  as  the  main 
endpoint for this first interim analysis. Haematological response, time to AP or BC, survival and PCR 
analysis of MRD are main secondary endpoints. 
The  management  of  the  study  was  supported  by  a  Study  Management  Committee  (SMC)  of  4 
investigators  authorised  to  review  (in  a  blinded  fashion)  requests  for  crossovers  related  to  either 
intolerance to treatment or increasing WBC. This aspect of the study was essential to guarantee that all 
measures recommended by the protocol had been taken before actually crossing over. Patients safety 
and general monitoring of the study conduct was overseen by an Independent Data Monitoring Board 
(IDMB) which has conducted two data reviews, a safety review of the first 500 patients randomised 
(April 2001) and an analysis of both safety and efficacy on all data collected up to a cut-off date of 31 
July 2001, i.e. 6 months after the last patient had been randomised. On the basis of early evidence for a 
consistent and significant superiority of the Glivec arm in terms  of efficacy together with a superior 
safety profile, the IDMB recommended that the  data be released  and the  protocol amended  to allow 
crossover also for patients not achieving a CHR at 12 months, patients not achieving a MCyR at 12 
months  (instead  of  24  months)  and  for  patients  refusing  to  continue  treatment  with  IFN.  This 
amendment was implemented after the cut-off for the present “12-months” analysis. 
Between  16  June  2000  and  30  January  2001,  a  total  of  1106  patients  were  randomised  from  177 
centres  in  16  countries,  553  to  each  arm.  The  baseline  characteristics  of  these  patients  were  well 
balanced between the two arms and are described in the following table.  
38/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1.: Patients characteristics in Study 0106 
The median follow-up for all patients the cut-off for this analysis was 14 and 13 months in the Glivec 
and  IFN  arms,  respectively.  90%  of  patients  randomised  to  Glivec  are  still  receiving  first-line 
treatment. As a consequence of high rates of both discontinuation and crossover, only 30% of patients 
randomised  to  IFN+ara-C  are  still  on  first  line  treatment.  Discontinuation  of  first  line  therapy  was 
more  frequent  in  the  group  of  patients  randomised  to  IFN+ara-C,  the  most  frequent  reason  being 
withdrawal  of  consent  (13.4%).  In  addition,  considerably  more  patients  treated  with  IFN+ara-C 
crossed-over  to  the  alternative  therapy  than  those  randomised  to  treatment  with  Glivec,  the  most 
frequent reason for crossover in the former group being intolerance to treatment. 
The SMC examined a total of 424 requests for crossovers for 267 patients randomised to IFN+ara-C. 
Out of the 227 requests for intolerance, 140 were approved (61.6%), but only 126 patients had crossed 
over  at  the  time  of  cut-off.  Likewise,  the  SMC  examined  requests  for  crossover  due  to  increasing 
WBC  for  40  patients,  and  approved  29  of  them  (72.5%).  Only  25  of  them  were  implemented  at  the 
time of cut-off. 
Efficacy results 
Haematological response 
The rate of CHR was significantly higher in the Glivec arm. In addition, CHRs were achieved faster 
with Glivec (median time to CHR of 1 month) than with IFN (2.5 months). Duration of response was 
also significantly longer in the Glivec arm, with an estimated proportion  of patients with continuing 
response at 12 months of 98% compared to 79.7% in the IFN arm. 
However, this analysis may underestimate the response to IFN because of the high rate of crossovers 
or discontinuations. As an example a patient crossed over because of intolerance might be counted as a 
non-responder  in  this  analysis.  To  compensate  for  this  bias,  the  data  were  further  analysed  with  the 
Kaplan-Meier  method,  in  which  patients  who  crossed  over  or  discontinued  for  reasons  other  than 
progression were censored. Using this approach, the estimated rate of CHR at 12 months in the Glivec 
arm was minimally affected (95.9%) whereas it increased from 54.6% (Table 6) to 66.6% in the IFN 
arm. The difference between the two arms remained significant (p<0.001). 
39/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
Of interest, the rate of CHR to second line Glivec for the 218 patients who crossed over was 83.5%, ie. 
very similar to the reported rate of 88% in the phase II study 0110. When CHR was analysed using the 
ITT principle, the rate of CHR in the Glivec arm (94.6%) remained significantly higher than that in the 
IFN arm (76.5%, p<0.001). 
Cytogenetic response 
During first line treatment, 83% of patients achieved an MCR in the Glivec arm, compared to 20% in 
the  IFN  arm.  Sixty  eight  percent  of  patients  randomised  to  Glivec  achieved  a  CCR,  compared  with 
only  7%  in  the  IFN  arm.  Major  responses  were  achieved  faster  with  Glivec  (median  3  months) 
compared to IFN (median 5.8 months). At the cut-off, a higher proportion of responding patients had 
lost  their  MCyR  in  the  IFN  arm  (n=9,  8%)  compared  to  the  Glivec  arm  (n=7,  1.5%).  Out  of  the 
responding patients, three (0.6%) progressed to AP or BC in the Glivec arm and three (2.6%) in the 
IFN arm. 
As with haematologic response, the rates of MCR and CCR responses were further estimated using a 
Kaplan-Meier approach in order to compensate for the higher rate of discontinuation and crossovers in 
the IFN arm. Using this conservative approach, the estimated rates of MCyR at 12 months were 84.1% 
in the Glivec arm as compared to 29.8% in the IFN arm. This difference remained highly statistically 
significant (p<0.001). For the 218 patients who crossed over from IFN, the rate of MCyR to second 
line Glivec therapy was 53.2%. This was again very similar to the rate of 49.4% reported in the initial

available for study 0106.

Time to progression 
Time to progression (TTP) was analysed for first-line treatment, second-line treatment and using the 
ITT principle regardless of crossover. Only the most conservative ITT analysis is presented in this 
report. There were more progression events in the IFN arm (18.6%) than in the Glivec arm (4.3%). 
The difference between the two arms is highly statistically significant using either the Logrank or the 
Wilcoxon test (p<0.001, Figure 2). The estimated rate of progression-free survival at 12 months is 
97.2% in the Glivec arm and 80.3% in the control arm. Given the known activity of Glivec as second 
line therapy in study 0110, this ITT analysis represents an overestimate of the rate of progression to 
IFN (the estimated 12 months rate on first line therapy is 75.3%, CI95% 70-80%).

Time to AP or BC 
There was a statistically significantly higher 12-months rate of patients without progression to AP or 
BC in the Glivec arm (98.5%) as compared to the IFN arm (93.1%, p<0.001). 
Figure 2. 
Time to progression to AP or BC (ITT principle) 
In the IFN arm, in addition to the 32 patients with progression to AP or BC as first progression event 
(29 during first line therapy, 3 during second-line therapy), there were 4 patients who progressed to 
AP or BC after having lost a CHR, giving a total of 36 patients. In contrast, in the Glivec arm, in 
addition to the 8 patients with progression to AP or BC as first progression event (all during first line 
therapy), 2 patients progressed to AP/BC after either loss of MCyR or increasing WBC giving a total 
of 10 patients. 
Survival 
With the follow-up currently available, there were a total of 31 deaths: 11 in patients randomised to 
Glivec (1 of them after crossover to IFN) and 20 on the IFN arm (4 of them after crossover to Glivec 
and another 5 who received Glivec after progression under the extension protocol). Five and 13 of 
them were reported as related to CML in the Glivec and IFN arms, respectively. None were considered 
drug-related. These differences were not significant. 
Prognostic factors analysis 
In a multivariate analysis, treatment group remained the strongest significant factor, followed by the 
Sokal risk group (and to a lesser degree the Hasford score).

Minimal residual disease (RT-PCR) 
The degree of MRD achieved after a CCyR on first-line therapy was assessed. Samples were taken at 
baseline, within 3 months of achieving a CCyR, and every three months thereafter. MRD was assessed 
by  quantitative  RT-PCR  and  expressed  as  the  ratios  of  the  number  of  Bcr-Abl  transcripts  over  the 
number of normal Bcr transcripts. At the time of analysis, at least one sample taken either at or after 
the achievement of a CCyR was available for 285 of 416 of patients with CCyR. In the Glivec arm, 
677 samples were available for 257 responding patients; in the IFN arm, 71 samples were available for 
28  patients.  The  median  follow-up  with  PCR  samples  after  the  achievement  of  a  CCyR  was  5.7 
months in the Glivec arm (up to 15.2 months) and 2.8 months in the IFN arm (up to 11.2 months). The 
baseline  Bcr-Abl/Bcr  ratios  were  similar  in  the  two  groups  (median  of  approximately  25%).  At  the 
time of CCR, the median ratios were reduced to a median of 0.09% and 0.17% in the Glivec and IFN 
arms,  respectively  (p<0.001).  Importantly,  after  the  achievement  of  a  CCR,  the  ratios  continued  to 
decrease in the Glivec arm to a median of 0.008% more than 6 months after the achievement of a CCR 
(ie. more than one log reduction compared to the values at CCR, and >3 logs compared to baseline).

IFN, there were more patients with very low levels of MRD (ratio equal or below 0.001%) in the 
Glivec arm as compared to the IFN arm.

Study 0106: Molecular response obtained after 12 months 
Safety 
Patient exposure 
In Study 0106, in contrast to nearly 90% of the patients randomised to Glivec, only 30% of the 
patients randomised to IFN+Ara-C are still on their first line treatment. The median duration of first-
line treatment was 14 months in the Glivec arm, as compared to 8 months in the IFN arm. 
For the 218 patients who crossed over from IFN+Ara-C to Glivec at a median of 5.6 months after 
randomisation, the median duration of their second-line therapy with Glivec was 7.8 months. Whereas 
the median daily dose of Glivec was 400 mg as intended, the median dose of IFN was 4.9 MIU/day. If 
this dose is lower than the intended target dose of IFN, it is in line with the delivered dose in published 
phase IIIstudies. In the IFN arm, Ara-C was started in 71.2% of patients, who received a median of 4 
cycles. In addition, more patients in the IFN+Ara-C arm required additional hydroxyurea (74.3%) for 
a longer period of time (median of 30 days) compared to the Glivec arm (44.6% patients, median 
duration of 15 days). Considerably more patients required dose-reduction or dose interruption in the 
IFN+Ara-C arm (75.6% and 54.2%) compared to the Glivec arm (33% and 28.1%). The main reasons 
were AEs or laboratory abnormalities. 
At the cut-off date of 31 July 2001, the median follow-up in study 0110 was 18 months and 86.7% of 
patients were still on treatment. Treatment was given for more than 12 months in 90.1% of patients. 
Adverse clinical events 
All safety analyses were performed on all patients who have received at least one dose of study 
medication. The most striking difference in the safety profile between the two groups is illustrated by 
a considerably higher rate of crossovers related to severe intolerance to therapy in the IFN arm (22.7% 
vs. 0.7%). An additional 5.6% of patients discontinued treatment with IFN because of AEs not 
qualifying for crossovers, in contrast to only 2% in the Glivec arm. Lastly, there was a 13.4% rate of 
withdrawal of consent (compared to 1.8% in the Glivec arm). 
The frequency of reported AE in both arms was consistent with previous data with both regimens. In 
particular, there were no new unexpected findings in the Glivec arm. 
In the Glivec arm, the most frequent AEs were superficial edemas, nausea, muscle cramps and skin 
rashes. However, as in the previous phase II studies, these events were mostly of grade 1-2 severity 
and only a minority were considered as severe (grade 3-4). Nausea was less frequent than in the phase 
II study 0110, a difference which may be related to the fact that drug was taken with food in study 
0106 but not in study 0110. The main AE leading to treatment discontinuation were skin rash and 
abnormal liver tests. The safety profile of second-line Glivec for those patients who crossed over from 
IFN to Glivec was similar. The updated safety analysis of the preceding phase II studies, and in 
particular study 0110, revealed no new findings. In the IFN arm of study 0106, the most frequent 
events were typical of IFN therapy: fatigue (severe in 24% of patients), nausea, anorexia, rigors and 
myalgias. There was a slightly higher frequency of severe depression (12.4%) as compared to 
published data. Psychiatric disorders were the most frequent reason for crossover related to intolerance 
(29.3% of the 126 patients who crossed over due to intolerance).

Table 5. 
Most frequently reported AEs in Study 0106 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Severe myelosuppression in the Glivec arm was significantly less frequent as compared to the IFN 
arm and also less frequent than in study 0110 in late chronic phase. In addition, the frequency of grade 
3-4 neutropenia and thrombopenias were slightly higher with second line Glivec (22.5% and 10.1%, 
respectively). In the Glivec arm, the median time to grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombopenia were 44 
days (range 7-463) and 43 days (8-421 days), respectively. 
The incidence of severe transaminitis (elevation of SGOT and/or SGPT) was also significantly higher 
in the IFN arm (7.1% vs. 4.2%, p=0.0357). Transaminitis occurred earlier in the IFN arm (median 85 
days) than in the Glivec arm (median 141 days).

Discussion of efficacy 
Overall,  the  results  of  study  0106  demonstrate  that  Glivec  is  clearly  superior  to  the  combination  of 
IFN+Ara-C  in  terms  of  both  haematological  and  cytogenetic  responses.  Time  to  response  is  also 
shorter with Glivec than with the comparative treatment. This effect has shown to be consistent across 
risk groups. In addition, although data are limited due to the short follow up, there is some evidence 
showing that Glivec also significantly reduces and delays disease progression, even when considering 
only  AP  and  BC  as  relevant  events  and  under  the  more  conservative  ITT  approach.  In  a  prognostic 
factor analysis, in each of the three Sokal risk groups, the treatment differences favouring the Glivec 
arm remained large and significant for either haematologic response, MCyR or TTP. 
However,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  influence  that  the  high  rate  of  crossover  may  have  had  on  the 
lower  rate  of  response  observed  in  the  control  arm.  The  MAH  will  provide  further  details  on  the 
timing  of  patient’s  crossover  due  to  safety  reasons  (most  of  crossovers)  and  their  baseline 
demographics and disease-related characteristics. 
The relationship of response rate with survival with Glivec remains to be investigated. In this sense, 
the findings of the effect of Glivec on disease progression and on the persistence of MRD seem to 
indicate that Glivec might have a relevant impact on the major objective of the treatment of the 
disease: to prolong survival. However, long-term data correlating these facts with a prolonged survival 
are still lacking. In addition, relevant questions as the time to reach a plateau of major cytogenetic 
response and the assessment of long-term treatment escapes are considered of utmost importance in 
order to determine the optimal treatment duration and the time to withdrawal in case of absence of 
major cytogenetic response. Today, the only available curative treatment for CML is bone marrow 
transplantation. It is supposed that Glivec is intended as first line treatment for patients with CML who 
are not candidates for BMT. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that patients initially treated with 
Glivec can eventually be transplanted. There is no available data to assess whether Glivec might have 
a potentially beneficial, neutral or deleterious effect on the outcome of an ulterior BMT. This is an 
important issue and the applicant is committed to closely monitor this issue and provide data to the 
CPMP on an annual basis. 
45/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion of safety  
Overall, Glivec appears to have an acceptable safety profile and, as expected from previous data, 
compares favourably with IFN based regimens. However, it is important to highlight that the control 
arm, although harbouring a presumably higher antineoplastic activity than IFN monotherapy, is 
considerably more toxic regarding both clinical and laboratory adverse events. This can be regarded as 
one of the reasons of the high crossover rate of patients to Glivec arm. Anyway, Glivec appears to be a 
reasonable well tolerated drug on the long-term basis. As already requested in the initial application 
for Glivec, the applicant should monitor the impact of fluid retention and weight gain associated with 
Glivec therapy 
Benefit/risk ratio 
The clear benefit of Glivec, superior to the combination of IFN+Ara-C, in patients newly diagnosed of 
Philadelphia chromosome positive CML has been demonstrated in terms of both haematological and 
cytogenetic responses and is consistent across risk groups. Although the data are limited due to the 
short follow up, there is sufficient evidence showing that Glivec also significantly reduces and delays 
disease progression, even when considering only AP and BC. Glivec appears to have an acceptable 
safety profile and, as expected from previous data, compares favourably with IFN based regimens.  
The data submitted do not show any effect of Glivec on survival. The effect of Glivec on disease 
progression and on the persistence of MRD seems to indicate that Glivec might have a relevant impact 
on survival. However, long-term data correlating these facts with a prolonged survival are still lacking.  
There is no available data to assess whether Glivec might have a potentially beneficial, neutral or 
deleterious effect on the outcome of an ulterior BMT. This is considered an important issue, and the 
applicant must provide any data available on this issue and commit to closely monitor patients treated 
with Glivec.  
The CPMP recommend the approval of the indication for Glivec in patients newly diagnosed of 
Philadelphia chromosome positive CML. The MAH committed to fulfil a number of follow-up 
measures ;  
- 
The design and follow-up of the trial does not allow showing any effect of Glivec on survival. 
The achievement of a cytogenetic response has been demonstrated to have clinical relevance 
regarding survival in the studies with IFN. However, for Glivec this correlation has not been 
validated yet. The MAH will submit any further information available on this issue. 
The study design makes difficult the interpretation of the results, as it is difficult to assess the 
influence that the high rate of crossover may have had on the lower rate of response observed in 
the control arm. In this sense, the MAH will give further details on the timing of patient’s 
crossover due to safety reasons (most of crossovers) and their baseline demographics and 
disease-related characteristics. 
The MAH will update the CPMP with information on the present status of study 0106 after the 
last amendment has been implemented.  
The MAH will commit to provide annual updates of study 0106 in order: 
To monitor treatment escapes,  
To determine the optimal duration of Glivec administration,  
To assess the potential impact of Glivec therapy on BMT. 
To monitor minimal residual disease (MRD).  
The MAH will further assess the time to reach a plateau (if any) of major cytogenetic response 
to clearly define the time to treatment withdrawal in case of absence of major cytogenetic 
response 
In  order  to  identify  responding  and  non-responding  patients,  the  MAH  will  further  assess  the 
predictive  factors  of  response  to  Glivec.  This  remains  an  important  issue,  especially  when 
considering  the  better  efficacy  of  allogeneic  transplantation  when  it  is  performed  in  the  first 
year following the diagnosis. 
The MAH will further assess the potential impact of fluid retention and weight gain associated 
with long-term Glivec therapy. 
The MAH should commit to provide annual updates of the study 0106 in order to monitor 
unexpected long-term side effects.

Recommendation 
On the basis of the above commitments agreed with the MAH, the CPMP considered that the 
benefit/risk of Glivec for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome 
(bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is 
not considered as the first line of treatment, is positive. 
8. 
Extension of the indication in paediatric patients with CML 
The  initially  approved  indication  for  Glivec  was:  “Treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase after failure of interferon-
alpha therapy, or accelerated phase, or blast crisis. Glivec is also indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastasic malignant gastrointestinal stromal 
tumours (GIST). The indication was extended to newly diagnosed patients with CML (see section 7 of 
the EPAR) and in a parallel application the MAH proposed to extend the indication in order to include 
paediatric patients with CML.  
8.1.   Clinical aspects 
The current type II variation for the extension of the CML indication to the use in children is based on 
efficacy,  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  safety  data  from  two  Phase  I  studies  (study  0103  -Pivotal  and 
study  03  001,  see  table  1).  Additional  safety  data  were  provided  from  approximately  92  children 
treated in a compassionate case program.

Glivec was administered at doses of 260, 340, 440 and 570 mg/m2/day once daily or b.i.d. if the dose 
was > 800 mg/day, for 28 days during course 1, and for 28 additional days during course 2. After 
completion of the two 28-day treatment courses, eligible patients could receive further courses of 
therapy.  
As a dose escalation study, the starting dose was 260 mg/m2/day, which was extrapolated from the 
efficacious dose of 400 mg in the adult population. Dose levels for subsequent groups of patients were 
based on escalation in increments of 30% up to a dose of 570 mg/m2/day. 
This study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) 
of imatinib to characterise the pharmacokinetics in children and to preliminarily define efficacy.

Endpoints were:  
Haematological response. A complete haematological response for chronic phase CML patients is 
defined as a reduction in the white-cell count to less than 10.000 per cubic millimetre and in platelet 
count to less than 450,000 per cubic millimetre, maintained for at least four weeks.  
Bone marrow response in acute phase patients were defined as follows: M1: 0-5% bone marrow blast 
cells. M2: >5-25% bone marrow blast cells. M3: >25% bone marrow blast cells.  
Cytogenetic response is defined in terms of the percentage of Ph chromosome positive metaphases in 
bone marrow. Complete cytogenetic response is defined as 0% Ph+ cells, a major response: 0-35% 
Ph+ cells, minor with >35-65% Ph cells, minimal with >65-95% Ph cells and none with >95-100% Ph 
cells. For chronic phase CML patients, best cytogenetic response as given by the investigator was 
listed. In addition, it was checked if this best response was confirmed after at least four weeks. Data on 
cytogenetic response were not obtained for acute leukaemia. No PCR bcr-abl results were obtained for 
patients with complete cytogenetic response.  
Adverse events were identified using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). 
Recruitment 
A total of 31 patients with either chronic phase CML (n=15) or CML in blast crisis or Ph+ acute 
leukemias (n=16) were enrolled over a 17 months period between 26 February 2000 and 4 September 
2001 in 23 centres. Data collected up to 19 March 2002 have been analysed. Patients’ characteristics

Supportive study 03 001 
This study was a phase I open, non-controlled, dose-escalation study conducted in the US (3 Centres). 
The study population consisted on adult and paediatric patients with either CML in the chronic phase, 
resistant to or intolerant of IFN, or Ph+ acute leukaemia (myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis, or Ph+ 
ALL or AML). Glivec was administered at doses of 175 mg/m2/day once daily for 28 days during 
course 1, and for 28 additional days during course 2. After completion of the two 28-day treatment 
courses, eligible patients could receive further courses of therapy. Eight paediatric patients 5 to 17 
years old were enrolled under amendment 6 of the protocol in one centre, 3 with CML in chronic 
phase failing prior IFN (two cytogenetic failures, one haematological failure) and 5 with ALL (n=4) or 
lymphoid blast crisis (n=1). Their median age was 9 years.

Clinical pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of imatinib in paediatric patients have been investigated in a total of 33 children 
(27 children enrolled in study 0103 and 6 children enrolled in the phase I study 03 001).  
Plasma  concentrations  of  imatinib  were  determined  by  a  high-performance  liquid  chromatography 
MS/MS  method  (LC/MS/MS).  Blood  samples  were  collected  from  all  patients  enrolled  on  day  1  of 
course 1 and at the following time points following drug administration: 
- Single dosing at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours (only for day 8) post drug administration.  
- b.i.d. dosing at 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 16, 24 and 48 hours (only for day 8) post drug administration. 
The basic pharmacokinetics parameters of imatinib and its main metabolite (CGP 74588) were to be 
summarised by dose using descriptive statistics. 
Whenever  feasible,  the  following  non-compartmental  parameters  were  calculated  from  the  plasma 
concentration-time  profiles  (tmax,  Cmax,  λz,  t1/2,  AUCτ,  AUC(0-∞),  Vz/F  and  Cl/F.  Phamacokinetic 
parameters were determined using WinNonlin Pro (Version 3.2.). 
Absorption 
As in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It was detectable in 
plasma 30 minutes after oral administration (the first sampling time), tmax was approximately 3.7 
hours. There was considerable inter-patient variability in the PK and the coefficient of variation for 
AUC(0-24) at steady state ranged from 21% (260 mg/m2) to 68% (570 mg/m2). The comparison of 
AUC(0-24) at steady state and at Day 1 following treatment at 340 mg/m2 revealed similarly a 1.7 fold 
drug accumulation after daily dosing. The comparison of the relationship between AUC and dose in 
relation to either body surface area (m2) or body weight (kg) at steady state showed that dosing based 
on body weight did not reduce inter-patient variability of AUC. 
Metabolism 
The kinetics of the main metabolite CGP 74588, the N-desmethyl derivative of the parent compound 
was investigated. In most patients, CGP 74588 could be detected in plasma 30 minutes after the oral 
administration  of  imatinib.  As  in  adult  patients,  the  plasma  AUC(0-24)  for  CGP  74588  is 
approximately 20% of the AUC for imatinib.

Comparison between children and adult populations 
As shown in the figures, the mean plasma concentration curve and AUC at steady state in children 
following once daily dosing with 260 mg/m2 and 340 mg/m2 were comparable to the exposure in 
adults at daily doses of 400 mg and 600 mg, respectively.

Dose (mg or mg/M 2)
Legend: -     Adults from study 03 001 treated at (1) 400 mg or (2) 600 mg  
-  Children in study 0103 treated at (3) 260 mg/m2, (4) 340 mg/m2, (5) 440 mg/m2 and (6) 
570 mg/m2.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effects  were  explored  by  examining  the  relationship  between  WBC  counts 
after  one-month  treatment  and  drug  exposure  (AUC).  The  lowest  AUC  was  above  20000  ng.h/ml, 
which is almost 3 times higher than the EC50 estimated from adult data (7000 ng.h/mL), at which level 
of AUC  87.5% of the  maximum  WBC  reduction effect  of  Glivec is to  be  expected.  On  the basis  of 
these  limited  data  and  despite  substantial  between-patient  variability,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
lowest dose of 260 mg/m2 evaluated in this study is associated with a drug exposure already above the 
maximal effect level and is predicted to result in normalization of WBC counts in all patients.

Dose - response  
In study 0103, the starting dose of 260 mg/m2 was extrapolated from the dose of 400 mg/day, which 
was found to be both safe and effective in clinical trials in adult patients with chronic phase CML. 
Subsequent dose levels were defined as 30% dose escalation steps (340, 440 and 570 mg/m2/day).  
Data from study 0103 indicate that a daily dose of 260 mg/m2 in children is associated with a similar 
PK exposure and a comparable efficacy and safety in comparison with a dose of 400 mg in adults. A 
higher dose of 340 mg/m2 daily is similarly safe and yields a drug exposure comparable to a dose of 
600 mg in adults. In this study, no MTD was characterised up to 570 mg/m2/day.  
A modelling of the relationship between drug exposure and pharmacodynamic response measured by 
WBC at day 28 indicate that the maximum effect on WBC is already achieved at the dose of 260 
mg/m2. On this basis, it can be concluded that imatinib at doses of 260 to 340 mg/m2 is safe and 
effective. However, the total daily dose should not exceed the doses recommended in adults, ie. 400 
and 600 mg respectively. As recommended for adults, escalation of the dose to 340 and 440 
mg/m2/day can be considered in selected patients with insufficient response or loss of response.  
Efficacy results 
Study 0103  
•  Chronic phase CML failing prior IFN therapy 
Among the 14 patients with confirmed late chronic phase CML, all (100%) achieved a complete 
haematological response with WBC <10 x109/L and platelets <450 x109/L on two consecutive visits (8 
had elevated WBC and/or platelet counts at baseline). 
Out of 13 patients with chronic phase CML and cytogenetic data available, major cytogenetic response 
rate (MCR) was 84.6%, thereof 7 (54%) and 4 (31%) achieved a complete and partial cytogenetic 
response respectively. After the database lock for this analysis, communication with the principal 
investigator revealed that two of the 4 patients with a partial response subsequently achieved also a 
complete cytogenetic response (CCR). Glivec was effective at all doses tested. 
The estimated 12-months rate of survival for the 15 patients reported to be in chronic phase CML was 
93.3% (95%CI 80.7 – 100). However, the only patient who died in the chronic phase cohort is the 
patient who had testicular disease at study entry and therefore fulfilled the criteria for blast crisis. 
None of the 14 patients with confirmed chronic phase CML have died.

Months since start of treatment
•  Acute leukaemia  
The haematological response of patients with acute leukaemia was evaluated on bone marrows only. 
Overall, the rate of M1 marrow response (ie. with up to 5% blasts) was 60% (9 out of 15 patients). 
Out of the six patients evaluable for response and with an acute leukaemia with a myeloid phenotype, 
51/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three (50%) achieved a M1 marrow. In contrast, six (67%) of the 9 patients with a lymphoid 
phenotype achieved a M1 marrow.  
For cytogenetic response, no summary is provided in the acute phase patients due to incomplete data. 
The estimated 12-months rate of survival for the 16 patients with either blast crisis or acute leukaemia 
was 40.9% (95%CI 13.4 – 68.5).  Median survival was 8 months. 
The results are not described separately for patients with CML in blast crisis, ALL and AML.

The  third  patient  did  not  achieve  a  cytogenetic  response  but  stayed  on  study  for  675  days. Of  the  5 
advanced phase patients, only the one with CML lymphoid blast crisis achieved a complete response 
in both blood and bone marrow.

In patients with either CML in BC or Ph+ acute leukaemias, the level of bone marrow response (≤5% 
blasts in marrow regardless of peripheral blood counts) seen in children in studies 0103 and 03 001 is 
also similar to previous findings in adults enrolled in study 03 001 in which haematologic response 
was evaluated using similar response criteria. However, as seen in adult trials, these responses were 
usually short and many patients discontinued study because of progressive disease.

Clinical safety  
Patient exposure 
It  is  estimated  that  approximately  131  children  with  Ph+  leukemias  have  been  treated  with  Glivec 
either  in  clinical  trials  (39  patients  in  studies  0103,  03  001),  in  the  expanded  access  program  (30 
patients in trials 0113, 0114, 0115) or in a specific paediatric compassionate case program (program 
0116 and other local mechanisms involving 62 children). There is no post-marketing experience with 
paediatric patients. 
The majority of the 18 children with CML enrolled in both study 03 001 and 0103 with chronic phase 
CML were in the adolescent group. The median age of the patients with chronic phase CML in study 
0103 was 14 years. 
In contrast, the majority of patients with acute leukaemias were in the children category as expected 
given the epidemiology of ALL in children. No infants below 3 years of age have been enrolled in 
these trials.

Study 0103 
At  the  time  of  cut-off  for  analysis,  13  (86.7%)  and  1  patients  (6.3%)  with  chronic  phase  CML  and 
acute leukemias were still on study, respectively.  
The main reasons for discontinuation were progressive disease for 5 patients (4 with acute leukemias), 
relapse for 8 patients (7 with acute leukemias) and transfer to a BMT program (2 patients with acute 
leukemias).  
The median duration of exposure was 16.6 months for the chronic phase patients (ranging from 2.6 to 
≥24.8 months) and 2 months for acute leukaemia patients (ranging from 0.9 to ≥11.0 months).  
The median dose-intensities in each dose cohort were almost identical to the intended dose.  
Only  one  3-year-old  patient  treated  at  260  mg/m2  had  to  have  the  capsules  opened  and  the  contents 
suspended in a beverage. According to the expert report, this patient experienced no remarkable AEs 
and  his  PK  profile  was  not  different  from  the  profile  of  the  other  patients  enrolled  in  this  cohort. 
However, in the final study report, it is mentioned that this patient experienced several dose reductions 
from 250 to 25 mg/day. This finding is not adequately described and the applicant justifies that, from 
the data available, it was not possible to assess the nature of the toxicity, which led to dose reduction 
in this patient. 
Study 03 001 
Among the 8 children enrolled in this study, 3 received a dose of 173 to 200 mg/m2/day, four a dose of 
approximately 260 mg/m2, and one a dose of 360 mg/m2/d. The median duration of treatment was 9.8 
months (range 1.6 to 22.2 months). The three patients with chronic phase CML were treated for ≥15.2, 
≥19.4 and 22.2 months, respectively (the first two were still on treatment at the time of analysis). The 
five advanced phase CML or ALL patients were on treatment for 1.6, 1.9, 2.6, 5 and 14.6 months. 
Additional data 
It is estimated that approximately 62 children have received Glivec under the 0116 compassionate case 
program up to 31 January 2002, including one 13-month-old infant treated with accelerated phase 
(Guilhot, personal observation).  
Thirty patients were enrolled in the expanded access program (6 with chronic phase CML in study 
0113, 13 in study 0114 including 4 ALL and 7 accelerated phase CML, and 11 in study 0115 including 
2 AML and 9 blast crisis). Their median age was 15 years (range 3 to 17 years). 
From both the compassionate case program and the expanded access program trials, only safety data 
on SAEs are available. 
Safety results 
A maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was not formally established during the first 28 days of therapy, as 
specified in the protocol. However, with continued daily treatment beyond the first month, the highest 
dose of 570 mg/m2 appeared to be somewhat less well tolerated in acute phase patients though many 
“dose-limiting toxicities” may have represented complications of the underlying disease (all occurred 
in  patients  with  acute  leukaemia).  The  study  therefore  did  not  formally  characterise  a  MTD,  in  line 
with the corresponding study in adults. 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  study  0103  are  shown  in  the  table.  The  most 
frequent AEs reported in chronic phase CML were  mild nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain 
53/61 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  skin  disorders.  In  patients  with  acute  leukaemia,  most  frequent  AEs  were  mild  nausea  and 
vomiting. The incidence of grade 3-4 drug-related AEs was low. 
The pattern of AEs seen in this study is similar to previous studies in adults, with the exception of a 
much  lower  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  events  and  oedema.  Muscle  cramps  were  never  reported 
during the study and only three patients (10%) complained of myalgia. There were also no reports of 
periorbital  or  lower  limb  oedema  and  only  two  patients  experienced  events  possibly  related  to  fluid 
retention:  one  patient  with  a  pericardial  effusion  though  in  association  with  a  pericarditis  that  may 
have had an infectious origin,  and a  second patient with  marked weight gain (from 71.4 to 78.6 kg) 
during the first month of therapy without overt signs of fluid retention. This was judged to be a dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose of study drug was reduced by 30%. A single episode of cerebral 
haemorrhage occurred in a patient with myeloid blast crisis and a grade 4 thrombopenia who was also 
receiving heparin.

In general, within the range of doses evaluated and keeping in mind the limitations of small numbers 
of patients, there was no clear evidence of any dose-relationship in terms of AEs, grade 3-4 AEs, and 
SAEs. When considering the three different age groups, there was again no obvious difference with 
the exception of a slightly higher incidence of drug-related diarrhoea and abdominal pain in patients 
older than 12 years. 
A total of 10 deaths have been reported in this study, all in patients with blast crisis or acute 
leukemias, all were related to a progression of the underlying disease.  
Examination of the safety data from the 8 children enrolled in study 03 001 revealed no additional 
findings. 
Laboratory findings 
In study 0103, in comparison with adult studies, there was a higher incidence of grade 3-4 
myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombopenia). This may relates in part to the population of 
patients enrolled (51.6% with acute leukaemia, and heavily pre-treated population). However, it is 
more probably related to “aggressive” protocol guidelines for dose adjustment. Indeed, the protocol 
required no dose adjustment for thrombocytopenia and required temporary interruption of dosing only 
in case of grade 4 neutropenia persisting for more than 3 days. Although 87% of chronic phase CML 
patients developed grade 3/4 haematological toxicity in this current study, no severe episodes of 
febrile neutropenia or bleeding were reported.

With regards to biochemistry abnormalities, grade 3-4 elevation of liver transaminases were reported 
in only 2 patients (6.5%) in study 0103. It was reported also in two children in study 03 001, however 
attributed to a GVHD in one patient, whereas the other patient had already grade 1-2 transaminases at 
baseline, probably related to the underlying disease.  
In study 0103 as well as in study 03 001, no patients discontinued therapy because of AEs. 
Additional data: compassionate case and expanded access programs  
Patients were eligible to the compassionate case program (protocol 0116) if they were below 18 years 
of age and had either a Ph+ ALL or a CML in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase failing 
prior IFN. No data were collected from this program with the exception of SAE. The dosing 
recommendations were with either 260 or 340 mg/m2 daily.  
In addition, a few children have been treated as special exemptions in one of the three adult expanded 
access protocols 0113 (chronic phase CML failing IFN), 0114 (accelerated phase) or 0115 (blast crisis 
and Ph+ ALL or AML). 
There  are  no  additional  studies  that  are  ongoing  at  the  time  of  application  in  the  indication  of 
paediatric CML. 
Altogether, up to 31 January 2002, SAEs have been reported to the MAH in a total of 13 children with 
Ph+ leukemias less than 18 years old treated either in one of the three expanded access clinical trials, 
the compassionate case program, or as spontaneous reports. Only 6 of them (6.5% out of the estimated 
denominator of at least 92 patients) were considered to have a suspected relationship to drug therapy 
and are listed in the table.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
CML  is  very  rare  in  children.  The  clinical  course  and  outcome  of  the  disease  in  children  appears 
essentially  similar  to  adults.  Even  though  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  BMT  may  be  slightly 
superior, the toxicity and mortality related to the transplant procedure remain substantial.  
In this variation application for paediatric use, the main evidence comes from two phase I dose finding 
studies which only included 39 children and out of them, only 18 were of an age from 3 to 12 years 
old, which is the most representative subgroup of a paediatric population. In the limited data available, 
the  efficacy  of  imatinib  in  children  has  been  demonstrated.  In  the  chronic  phase,  the  response  rate, 
including cytogenetic response, was very high and it was maintained during the duration of the study. 
The rate of MCR observed in the 16 children with late chronic phase CML and evaluable cytogenetic 
data enrolled in the two studies (13 in study 0103, 3 in study 03 001) was 81.3% (95%CI 54.4–96.0, 
with 11 patients in study 0103, and 2 patients in study 03 001). A complete cytogenetic response was 
achieved in 9 patients (56.5%). These results also include 5 patients of an age between 18 and 22 years 
old. In patients with acute leukaemia, the response rate was high (60%) but of a very short duration 
with a median survival of approximately 8 months. In general, the efficacy of Glivec in this paediatric 
population was similar to adult studies in terms of haematological response, cytogenetic response and 
survival. 
The recommended dose is acceptable as the results of these studies show a pharmacokinetic profile 
that seems to be similar to data previously obtained in adult studies. However, provided that the 
studies involved a very limited number of patients, an analysis of PK data according to age subgroups 
should be performed, especially for the 3-12 years subgroup. Moreover, it has to be underlined that no 
data regarding children under 3 years old are yet available. 
Concerning the treatment approach of CML in children, it should be taken into account that BMT is 
considered  as  “first  line”  treatment  due  to  being  potentially  curative  of  the  disease.  The  impact  of 
imatinib  treatment  on  the  outcome  of  ulterior  BMT  should  be  discussed.  Detailed  data  on  clinical 
experience  in  patients  receiving  BMT  that  had  been  treated  with  Glivec  previously  should  be 
provided. 
A number of methodological issues have been discussed during the assessment. The total number of 
patients included in the studies submitted is very low, even considering the circumstances of the low 
incidence  of  CML  in  children.  It  should  be  noted  that  only  18  patients  younger  than  12  years  have 
been included in the studies. The youngest patient was 3 years old. A very high proportion of patients 
had received prior BMT (45.2% of the patients) or prior multi-agent chemotherapy (67.7%). The age 
groups considered are in accordance with the ICH recommendations for paediatric studies; however, it 
would be interesting to have a more detailed description of the patient characteristics, particularly in 
the subgroup of 2 to 12 years. An important part of the patients included were adolescents or adults of 
an age from 18 to 22 years old. The MAH presented data to justify the choice of 22 years as the upper 
limit for a paediatric population and reanalysed the results of the studies (pharmacokinetics, efficacy 
and safety) through the age subgroups included in the population investigated.  
In spite of the limitations, the results show that the pharmacokinetics of imatinib, including exposure 
and  metabolism,  in  children  seems  to  be  similar  to  that  in  the  adult  population.  The  inter-individual 
variability  was  high  as  it  was  previously  described  in  former  studies.  The  plasma  concentrations  of 
imatinib obtained in these investigations seem to be in the target concentration. However, each finding 
should be carefully analysed in every age range and compared with adults. The dosage is justified by a 
similar  drug  exposure  to  that  in  the  adult  experience,  which  is  acceptable  taking  into  account  the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship described for Glivec. This similarity was observed for 
the  two  lower  doses  but  the  trial  had  been  designed  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose.  The 
dose  finding  approach  is  acceptable.  It  cannot  be  taken  for  granted  that  doses  lower  than  those 
proposed are also efficacious but, as safety was tolerable, the doses proposed can be recommended for 
further use in children.

Furthermore, concerning the treatment approach of CML in children, the impact of imatinib treatment 
on  the  outcome  of  ulterior  BMT  should  be  described  and  discussed.  Detailed  data  on  clinical 
experience  in  patients  receiving  BMT  that  had  been  treated  with  Glivec  previously  should  be 
provided. Long term safety data of children treated with imatinib should be provided. 
Discussion on Safety 
With  more  than  130  children  with  Ph+  leukemias  (CML  or  acute  leukaemia)  treated  with  Glivec  in 
clinical trials or as compassionate cases, the available data suggest a similar safety profile in children 
compared to adults. In clinical trials, children have been treated for up to 25 months, with apparent no 
late onset toxicities. No data are available to date with regards to the effect (or absence of effect) of 
long-term treatment on growth. The safety results have not been analysed separately in the different 
age  subgroups.  The  3-year-old  patient  experienced  several  dose  reductions  from  250  to  25  mg/day. 
This  finding  is  not  adequately  described  and  should  be  further  discussed  The  results  of  the 
compassionate  case  and  expanded  access  programs  should  be  described  in  more  detail  In  adults, 
Glivec  has  previously  been  shown  to  be  reasonably  safe  as  second-line  treatment  for  all  stages  of 
CML. As the clinical course of the disease and response to IFN therapy in paediatric CML is similar to 
adults, it can be expected that Glivec will have a safety and efficacy profile also comparable to adult 
data. 
Benefit / risk ratio 
The data presented in this report in children with Ph+ leukemias are very limited but they indicate that 
imatinib at the proposed dosing regimen appears safe and effective in a paediatric population.  
In  late  chronic  phase  CML,  14  children  failing  to  IFN  were  treated  with  imatinib  with  a  very  high 
response  rate  that  was  sustained  during  at  least  12  months.  All  of  them  obtained  an  haematological 
response and 85% of them a cytogenetic response. In this population, the efficacy was similar to that 
reported in adults. Regarding CML in blast crisis, it is recognised that the incidence of this situation is 
low  and  its  prognosis  poor,  but  the  clinical  experience  in  paediatric  population  that  is  submitted  is 
limited to 5 cases, which makes difficult to make an adequate benefit/risk assessment.  
It  should  be  taken  into  account  that  the  therapeutic  situation  is  similar  in  both  adults  and  children, 
therefore extrapolation from adult efficacy data may be appropriate considering the pharmacokinetic 
and  safety  results.  Concerning  the  treatment  approach  of  CML  in  children,  it  should  be  taken  into 
account  that  BMT  is  considered  as  “first  line”  treatment  due  to  being  potentially  curative  of  the 
disease.  The  impact  of  imatinib  treatment  on  the  outcome  of  ulterior  BMT  should  be  described  and 
discussed. Detailed data on clinical experience in patients receiving BMT that had been treated with 
Glivec previously should be provided. 
In the available data, imatinib seems to  have a similar safety profile in children compared to adults. 
Moreover,  in  additional  safety  data  from  children  in  compassionate  and  expanded  access  programs 
treated, the safety was acceptable, although long-term results are not yet available.  
Recommendation 
On the basis of the commitments of the MAH to provide additional data, the use of Glivec is indicated 
for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Philadelphia  chromosome  (bcr-abl) 
positive  (Ph+)  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  for  whom  bone  marrow  transplantation  is  not 
considered as the first line of treatment. Glivec is also indicated for the treatment of patients with Ph+ 
CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis. 
The effect of Glivec on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.

Update on Drug interactions  
Imatinib undergoes important hepatic metabolization as described in section 4 of the EPAR. There is a 
potential  for  significant  drug-interactions  when  Glivec  is  administered  concomitantly  with  drugs 
known to be inducers of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulting in a decrease in the exposure to imatinib. An 
interaction  study  to  investigate  the  effects  of  rifampin  (a  semisynthetic  antibiotic  derivative  of 
57/61

rifamycin B, potent inducer of the cytochrome P-450 hepatic enzyme system) on the pharmacokinetics 
of  Glivec  (substrate  of  CYP450  3A4).with  Rifampin,  a  potent  inducer  of  the  cytochrome  P-450 
hepatic enzyme system, has been performed in order to assess this issue and to provide guidelines for 
the co-administration with this class of drugs.  
9.1  Clinical aspects 
Study  CSTI571B2102,  a  single  centre,  open-label,  single-sequence,  crossover  study,  has  been 
developed  to  assess  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  interaction  of  Glivec  with  a  CYP3A4  inducer  in 
fourteen healthy subjects. During the first treatment period, baseline oral Glivec PK were established. 
The  second  treatment  period  consisted  of  oral  Glivec  PK  following  8  days  of  oral  rifampin 
administration.  Rifampin  administration  was  maintained  throughout  the  PK  sampling  period  for  an 
additional 3 days to prevent any reduction in CYP3A4 induction. The ratio of 6beta-hydroxycortisol to 
cortisol excreted in the urine was measured on study days –1, 10, 14 and 18 as proof of induction of 
CYP3A4. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of the co-administration of 
rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of Glivec. The secondary objetive was to assess the tolerability of 
Glivec alone and in combination with rifampin. Safety was assessed by recording all adverse events 
(AEs)  reported  during  the  course  of  the  study,  regular  monitoring  of  clinical  laboratory  parameters, 
vital signs and ECG recordings.  
Pharmacokinetics results 
13  male  and  1  female  participants  were  enrolled  and  completed  the  study.  Two  subjects  were  CYP 
2D6  poor  metabolisers.  The  main  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  imatinib  and  the  main  metabolite, 
CGP74588 for the 14 healthy subjects determined by non-compartmental analyses are listed in Tables 
1 and 2. The mean and standard deviation for each parameter are given for the two treatment periods 
in which Glivec was administered.

Following  rifampin  co-administration,  the  mean  imatinib  Cmax,  AUC(0-24)  and  AUC(0-inf) 
decreased significantly by 54% , 68% and 74% respectively. When expressed as the ratio of the value 
of  imatinib  with  rifampin  over  the  value  without  rifampin,  co-administration  of  rifampin  reduces 
Cmax to  46.1% (90%  confidence interval: 40.8% to 52.1%), AUC(0-24h)  to 32.4%  (29.5%-35.6%), 
and AUC(0-inf) to 26.0% (23.5%-28.7%) of the respective values without rifampin treatment. There 
was a statistically significant increase in CL/F with a mean 4-fold increase.

EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
With regard to metabolites, the mean Cmax and AUC (0-24) of CGP74588 increased significantly by 
88.6% and 23.9% after rifampin treatment. However, the AUC (0-inf), decreased by 11.7%. With the 
exception of AUC (0-inf) of the metabolite, which meets the formal equivalence criteria, the ratios for 
the  other  PK  parameters  are  far  from  the  ideal  value  of  1.  Thus,  a  pharmacokinetics  interaction 
between Glivec and Rifampin exists. The ratio of 6-β-hydroxycortisol to cortisol increased by 10-fold 
on day 18 after continuous administration of rifampin, indicating that CYP3A4 induction did occur. 
Safety and tolerability 
Mild or moderate adverse events were reported in five (36%) of the fourteen subjects during the study, 
but none of them was suspected to be related to the study drug and all resolved within one to two days 
during  the  study  period.  Thirteen  of  the  patients  presented  deviations  from  the  normal  range  for  at 
least  one  biochemical  and/or  haematological/urinalysis  parameters  (being  cholesterol  plasma 
concentrations and ALT elevations the most frequent). The Investigator did not consider any of these 
abnormalities as clinically significant nor related to study drug. The monitoring of vital signs did not 
reveal any abnormalities related to study drug.  
9. 2.  Discussion  
the 
investigation  of  drug 
the  CPMP  Note  for  guidance  on 
The design of the study is considered appropriate to assess the influence of a potent CYP 3A4 inducer 
of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  Glivec.  The  study  population  is  adequate,  the  inclusion  of  healthy 
subjects is acceptable due to the safety profile of Glivec. The inducer of CYP 3A4 (Rifampin) and its 
dosage regimen is considered sufficient for maximum induction and pharmacokinetic evaluation. The 
definition  of  a  confidence  interval  (0.75-1.33),  an  extension  of  the  confidence  interval  accepted  for 
bioequivalence, for concluding that no clinically relevant interaction is found has not been justified on 
terms of dose-response, although taking into account the results of the study it is not relevant. The data 
analysis  follows 
interaction 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95).  
For  parent  drug,  both  AUCs  and  Cmax  showed  a  very  marked  decrease  under  coadministration  of 
Glivec and rifampin (68% AUC 0-24, 74% AUC o-inf and 54% Cmax), as compared to administration 
of Glivec alone. This decrease was consistent for all subjects. Cl/F and V/F show a similarly consistent 
and  marked  increase  (3.8-fold).  These  results  have  been  explained  by  the  induction  of  the  hepatic 
metabolism of Glivec by CYP3A4 and also by induction of the pre-hepatic metabolism in the gut. The 
applicant’s explanation seems plausible.  
The  AUCs  for  the  metabolite  showed  and  increase  of  the  AUC  0-24  (23.9%)  but  a  decrease  of  the 
AUC  o-inf  (11.7%).  The  mean  Cmax  also  increased  significantly  by  88%  after  rifampin  treatment. 
These  results  are  less  consistent  (not  all  subjects  followed  this  trend)  than  those  seen  for  the  parent 
drug. The increase in the concentrations of the metabolite was only mild. This disproportional change 
is claimed to be due to the increased rate of formation of other metabolites mediated by CYP3A4 not 
determined  in  this  study.  The  applicant’s  explanation  seems  plausible  The  imatinib  exposure  in  the 
two poor CYP2D6 metaboliser was not significantly increased, thus confirming the in vitro findings, 
i.e. CYP2D6  is  not the  main P450 enzyme involved in the  microsomal biotransformation  of  Glivec. 
The reduction in the plasma concentrations of Glivec following the co-administration of rifampin was 
statistically significant and clinically relevant and therefore, may result in subtherapeutic plasma levels 
of  Glivec  (the  plasma  drug  exposure  is  directly  related  to  haematologic  response).  So  that,  it  seems 
reasonable  to  extrapolate  these  findings  to  other  potent  inducer  of  CYP3A4  and  translating  it  in  a 
recommendation in the SPC. The proposed recommendation is acceptable. 
The coadministration of Glivec and Rifampin has been well tolerated. No unexpected adverse events 
have appeared. The AEs were considered no drug related in the investigator’s opinion, although most 
of them have been described in the SmPC as common adverse events. 
The result clearly show that the concomitant use of Glivec and Rifampin  may result in a  significant 
and marked drug-interaction. Following Rifampin coadministration the mean imatinib Cmax, AUC0-
24 and AUC0-inf decrease by 54%, 68% and 74%, respectively. The Cl/F increase nearly 4-fold. 
The results of this study are consistent with the in vitro finding and the in vivo observations suggesting 
that  Imatinib

The  reduction  of  plasma  concentration  of  imatinib  resulting  from  the  concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4 
inducer may result in subtherapeutic plasma levels of Glivec. It is reasonable to extrapolate the results 
to other potent 3A4-inducers.  
Therefore, the above findings were translated to adequate recommendations in the SmPC. 
10.  Update on Clinical Safety post-authorisation 
A number of adverse reactions had been already included in the SPC following the assesment of the  
extensions  of  indication  described  above.  These  reactions  were:  exfoliative  dermatitis,  bullous 
eruption,  erythema  exudativum  multiform  including  Stevens  Johnson  syndrome,  toxic  epidermal 
necrolysis,, vesicular rash, psoriasis, hepatitis and hepatic failure.  
Following  the  assessment  of  the  2nd  PSUR  the  following  additional  reactions  were  included  under 
section  4.8  of  the  SPC  as  rare:  pericardial  effusion,  pulmonary  fibrosis,  interstitial  pneumonitis, 
glaucoma and arthralgia. 
Furthermore, with the review of the 3rd PSUR the following reactions were added as rare: pericardial 
intestinal 
effusion,  pulmonary  fibrosis, 
obstruction,  pericarditis, 
tumour 
haemorrhage, tumour necrosis, confusion and convulsion.  
thrombosis,  embolism,  pancreatitis,  vitreous  haemorrhage, 
interstitial  pneumonitis,  glaucoma,  arthralgia, 
ileus, 
Incorrect statement on possible interaction was deleted from sections 4.4 and 4.5. In section 4.5 of the 
SPC,  in  the  paragraph  on  “drugs  that  may  have  their  plasma  concentration  alterated  by  Glivec”  the 
sentence  “and  patients  should  be  warned  to  avoid  or  restrict  the  use  of  over  the  counter  and 
prescription medicines containing paracetamol” is erroneous. 
Paracetamol is metabolised by conjugation enzymes (glucoronide and sulfate formation). Paracetamol 
is also oxidised by hepatic cytochrome P450. At therapeutic doses, this pathway is a minor one. With 
large doses, the importance of paracetamol oxidation increases. The two P450 isoforms appear to be 
the principal catalysts of paracetamol oxidation are CYP2A1 and CYP2E1. No one of these two P450 
cytochrom isoenzymes appear to be involved in the metabolism of imatinib. In vitro studies has shown 
that  imatinib  is  mainly  transformed  by  CYP3A4  and  competitively  inhibits  CYP2C9,  CYPD6  and 
CYP3A4/5. It is concluded that a metabolic interaction between imatinib and paracetamol at the level 
of CYP’S appear to be unlikely. The above sentence is now deleted. The statement ”One patient, who 
was  taking  paracetamol  regularly  for  fever,  died  of  acute  liver  failure.  Although  the  aetiology  is 
currently unknown, caution should be exercised when using paracetamol” is deleted from section 4.4 
of the SPC. 
Regarding hepatic disorders the sentence in section 4.8 of the SPC that reads “…However, one patient 
with  accelerated  phase  died  of  acute  liver  failure  in  which  drug  interaction  with  high  doses  of 
paracetamol  could  not  be  formally  ruled  out  (see  section  4.5)”  should  be  replaced  by”…There  have 
been  cases  of  cytolytic  and  cholestatic  hepatitis  and  hepatic  failure;  in  some  of  them  outcome  was 
fatal”. This is in accordance with the CPMP recommendation. 
Regarding the statement “on fluid retention reactions” the relevant paragraph has been modified. 
“Miscellaneous  adverse  reactions  such  as  pleural  effusion,  ascites,  pulmonary  oedema  and  rapid 
weight  gain  with  or  without  superficial  oedema  may  be  collectively  described  as  “fluid  retention”. 
These  reactions  can  usually  be  managed  by  withholding  Glivec  temporarily  and  with  diuretics  and 
other appropriate supportive care measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life 
threatening  and  several  patients  with  blast  crisis  died  with  a  complex  clinical  history  of  pleural 
effusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure”. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

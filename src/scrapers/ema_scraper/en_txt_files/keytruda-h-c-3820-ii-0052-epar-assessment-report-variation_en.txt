2.  Introduction 
The  Scope  of  this  variation  is  to  revise  the  existing  indication  for  Keytruda  as  monotherapy  for  the 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for 
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.  
This variation follows the Keytruda PAM ANX/018 procedure, which was triggered by the MAH’s decision 
on February 2018 to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose 
tumours have a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) <10 in the KEYNOTE 361 study, based on external 
Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) recommendation.  
KEYNOTE-361  (KN-361)  is  a  Phase  III  randomized,  active-controlled,  parallel-group,  open-label  trial  to 
determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
alone as first line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma; this study is an 
Annex II condition (PAES) for Keytruda. 
The CHMP’s conclusions (April 2018) of the PAM ANX/018 procedure were the following:  
- revise the wording for Section 4.1 of the SmPC to exclude patients with a PD-L1 expression CPS < 10 
from the indication of Keytruda in locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma adult patients who are 
not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy 
- amend the current wording of Section 4.4 of the SmPC to provide appropriate information to prescribers 
on  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  when  considering  pembrolizumab  use  for  patients  eligible  for  a 
carboplatin-based chemotherapy 
-  further  elaborate  on  potential  factors  that  could  be  associated  with  early  risk  of  death  (including 
hyperprogression?)  in  1L  cisplatin-ineligible  urothelial  cancer  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  
-  comment  on  the  exclusion  of  patients  ineligible  to  all  platinum-containing  products  (Carboplatin  and 
Cisplatin) in the currently authorised indication. 
-  propose  a  communication  plan,  including  a  draft  DHCP  to  inform  prescribers  about  the  change  of 
product information 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
3.1.  Introduction 
Urothelial  carcinoma  (UC)  arises  from  the  urothelial  endothelium,  which  lines  the  renal  pelvis,  ureter, 
urinary bladder, and urethra. More than 90% of urothelial tract tumours pertain to bladder, being the fifth 
most  common  cancer  in  men  in  Europe.  Approximately  70%  of  patients  with  bladder  cancer  are  >65 
years of age, for a median age at diagnosis of 73 years. 
Cisplatin-based  combination  chemotherapy  is  the  standard  first-line  treatment  for  advanced  UC,  for  a 
median survival of 13-15 months (NCCN Guidelines, ESMO guidelines).  
About 50% of patients are unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy due to a poor performance status 
(PS),  impaired  renal  function  and/or comorbidity. First-line  treatment  options  for  these patients  include 
carboplatin-based combinations, that are associated with inferior outcomes, (median OS of 8-10 months), 
or  platinum-free  treatments or  single  agent  chemotherapy  (NCCN Guidelines, ESMO  guidelines,  De  Vos 
2010, De Santis 2012, Sonpavde 2014).  
Assessment report  
EMA/168468/2021  
Page 4/19 
  
  
 
 
In general, long-term survival with combination therapy has been reported only in good-risk patients (i.e. 
good PS, no visceral or bone disease, normal LDH or ALP levels), while poor risk patients (i.e. poor PS or 
visceral  disease),  have  shown  poor  tolerance  to  multiagent  combination  and  few  complete  remission. 
According to the so-called Bajorin risk model, patients are placed into 3 prognostic groups depending on 
their  number  of  adverse  prognostic  factors  (Bajorin  risk  groups  0,  1,  or  2)  which  includes  poor 
performances status (Karnofsky performance status < 80% which aligns with ECOG PS ≥2) and visceral 
disease (Bajorin, JCO 1999). NCCN guidelines underlines that the presence of both visceral (non-nodal) 
metastatic disease and ECOG PS ≥2 strongly predict poor outcome with chemotherapy, and that patients 
without these adverse prognostic factors have the greatest benefit from chemotherapy. NCCN guidelines 
noted also that the impact of these factors in relation to immune-checkpoint inhibitors is not fully defined, 
but they remain poor prognostic indicators in general (NCCN guidelines, v3.2018).  
Haemoglobin level has been considered as a further predictor of overall survival for metastatic urothelial 
cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and was included in other published prognostic 
models (Apolo, JNCI 2013).  
There  are  no clear  guidelines to define  cisplatin-ineligibility.  A proposed  definition  of  unfit  patients  with 
metastatic  US  was  elaborated  with  the  goal  of  establishing  uniform  eligibility  criteria  for  clinical  trials: 
ECOG PS of 2 or Karnofsky PS of 60%-70%, creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) <60 mL/min, 
CTCAE v4 grade ≥ 2 audiometric hearing loss, CTCAE v4 grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy, NYHA Class III 
heart failure (at least one of the above criteria) (Galsky, JCO 2011).  
Keytruda clinical development plan in UC is including the following clinical trials:

In  May  2018,  the  two  clinical  studies  KEYNOTE-672/ECHO-307  and  KEYNOTE-698/ECHO-303  of 
pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  epacadostat  (IDO1  inhibitor)  vs  pembrolizumab  alone  in  cisplatin-
ineligible  and  in  platinum-progressed  UC  patients,  respectively,  permanently  halted  screening  and 
enrollment of new patients. The same action was taken for the pembrolizumab/epacadostat combination 
in other indications (HNSCC, RCC). This was presented by the MAH as a strategic decision based on the 
negative  results  of  the  combination  pembrolizumab/epacadostat  in  melanoma  from  study  KEYNOTE-
252/ECHO 301, while it was not related to the finding of KN-361 study in UC.

3.2.  KEYNOTE-052 
KEYNOTE-052  (KN-052)  is  a  Phase  II  single  arm  trial  of  pembrolizumab  in  first-line  cisplatin-ineligible 
advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This study has been the basis for the approval 
of  pembrolizumab  in  UC  patients  previously  untreated  and  not  eligible  to  cisplatin-containing 
chemotherapy (Keytruda Variation II/23-G, EC decision on 24/08/2017). 
Within this submission, the MAH presented updated efficacy and safety results from KN052 study based 
on a data cutoff date of 30-NOV-2017 (data available in the previous variation II/23-G had a cutoff date 
of 09-MAR-2017).

Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Patients enrolled  in  KN-052  study  had  a  diagnosis  of  advanced/unresectable  (inoperable)  or  metastatic 
urothelial cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra, with measurable disease. Patients were 
enrolled regardless their PD-L1 tumor status. No prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced/ metastatic 
urothelial cancer was allowed (with the exception of adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based treatment 
with  recurrence  >12  months  since  completion  of  therapy.  Patients  had  ECOG  PS  0,  1  or  2.  Cisplatin-
ineligibility definition was based on at least one of the following criteria:  
- ECOG Performance Status of 2 (the proportion of these subjects will be limited to approximately 50% of 
the total population) 
- Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) <60 mL/min but ≥30 mL/min 
- CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 audiometric hearing loss (25dB in two consecutive wave ranges) 
- CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy 
- New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure 
A total of 370 patients were enrolled. All patients received a fixed dosing regimen of pembrolizumab 200 
mg Q3W.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR based on RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed by independent radiology 
review  that  was  estimated  for  all  subjects,  for  subjects  with  PD-L1  expression  (CPS)  ≥  1%,  and  for 
subjects with strongly positive CPS expression (CPS) ≥ 10. DOR and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent 
radiology review, and OS were secondary endpoints. 
Results - efficacy 
At the 30-NOV-2017 data cut-off herein provided, the median duration of follow-up was 11.5 months. The 
last subject was enrolled 17.3 months (21-JUN-2016) prior to the data cut-off.

Table 3: 1L-urothelial-update: Baseline characteristics of KEYNOTE-052 and KEYNOTE-361 
In the table above, a comparison between baseline characteristics of KEYNOTE-052 and KEYNOTE-361 
has been presented. The population enrolled in KN-361 is substantially different from that of study KN-
052. In particular, only patients fit to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) 
are included in KN-361, due to the presence of a chemotherapy-doublet arm. While patients covering the 
full spectrum of cisplatin-ineligibility, including also patients unfit to receive any platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy, not enrolled in KN-361, were enrolled in KN-052. Patients in the KEYNOTE-
052 study appeared to be older, more frequently with ECOG-PS 2, with visceral metastases and with 2 
Bajorin risk Factors compared to cisplatin-ineligible population of KN-361.

Risk factors analysis of OS in patients with PD-L1 CPS<10 
The influence of baseline prognostic factors on the risk of early death (within 3 months after first dose of 
pembrolizumab) in subjects with PD-L1 CPS <10 was evaluated by univariate and multivariate predictor 
analysis using Cox regression models. Prognostic factors were tested in separate univariate Cox models 
and then entered into a multivariate model selection process. Prognostic risk factors tested in the models 
were age (<75 years vs ≥75 years), ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs 2), liver metastasis (yes vs no), haemoglobin 
level (<10 g/dL vs ≥10 g/dL), and Bajorin risk group (0/1 vs 2). 
In  KEYNOTE-052,  the  Bajorin  risk  groups  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  ECOG  PS  and  visceral 
metastases; ECOG PS 0 and 1 were transformed into Karnofsky performance status 80% and ECOG PS 2 
into  Karnofsky  performance  status  less  than  80%.  When  adding  presence  or  absence  of  visceral 
metastases,  patients  were  regrouped  into  3  prognostic  groups  depending  on  their  number  of  adverse 
prognostic factors (Bajorin risk groups 0, 1, or 2). 
Two  factors  that  had  significant  influence  on  the  risk  of  early  death  were  identified  in  the  multivariate 
model,  Bajorin  risk  group  2 HR  2.40  (1.41,  4.08) p  =  0.001)  and  baseline  haemoglobin  <10  g/dL  (HR 
3.75 (2.07, 6.82), p <0.001) in KEYNOTE-052 subjects with PD-L1 CPS < 10 (see table below):

Table 8: Prognostic Factors for Early Death Within 3 Months of Treatment Initiation in KN052 
Subjects with PD-L1 CPS <10 
Subjects  in  the  PD-L1  CPS  <10  subgroup  who  had  at  least  1  risk  factor  (Bajorin  risk  score  2  or 
haemoglobin  <10  g/dL)  experienced  worse  OS  outcome  compared  to  subjects  with  no  risk  factors: 
indeed, median OS values were 6.3 (4.3, 9.7) months for PD-L1 CPS <10 subgroup who had at least 1 
risk factor and 11.7 (9.5, 14.6) months for subjects with PD-L1 CPS <10.  
For  subjects  with  PD-L1  CPS  <10  and  at  least  one  poor  prognostic  feature  (Bajorin  risk  group  2  or 
haemoglobin <10 g/dL), ORR was 15.9% (95% CI: 9.5%, 24.2%) and 24.3% (95% CI: 17.6, 32.1) for 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS <10 with no poor prognostic risk factors. 
Results – Safety  
The MAH presented an overview of the safety data of the KN-052 study at the updated cut-off date of 30-
NOV-2017. Safety results were compared with the standard reference safety dataset for pembrolizumab 
(n=2799 patients, in melanoma KN001, KN002 and KN006 trials and in NSCLC KN001 and KN010 trials). 
No  new  safety  signal  was  identified  when  safety  data  from  KN-052  data  cutoff  30-NOV-2017  were 
compared to the safety data from cutoff 09-MAR-2017. 
In general, the updated safety profile of pembrolizumab in the KN-052 population is consistent with the 
previously established  safety profile  for  pembrolizumab.  A slight  increase  in  the  frequencies  of  Adverse 
Events is seen compared to the previous dataset, likely related with the additional 8 months of follow-up.    
The  nature  and  frequency  of  immune-mediated  events  in  KN-052  were  consistent  with  the  reference 
safety dataset and no new immune-mediated event was identified for pembrolizumab. 
KN-052  safety  analyses  support  that,  in  general,  the  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  1L  urothelial 
cancer  population  is  acceptable  and  consistent  with  the  tolerability  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab 
reference  safety  dataset.  The  key  discrepancies  are  likely  related  to  the  fact  the  KN-052  population  is

older, and has more than 40% of subjects with ECOG 2 in comparison to the reference safety dataset, or 
related to the underlying medical condition urothelial cancer. 
Exposure:  Median exposure was 3.40 months and median number of administrations was 5. A total of 
192 (51.9%) subjects received pembrolizumab for ≥3 months, 132 (35.7%) subjects for ≥6 months, and 
78 (21.1%) for ≥12 months. Exposure to pembrolizumab was similar compared to the reference safety 
dataset.  
Adverse events: The overall frequency of AEs was similar between the KEYNOTE-052 population and the 
reference safety dataset. Subjects in KN-052 population, in comparison to the subjects in the reference 
safety dataset, experienced more Grade 3-5 AEs (62.7% vs 45.5%), drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (20.3% 
vs 13.8%), SAEs (50.5% vs 37.2%), AEs leading to discontinuation (17.0% vs 11.9%), and AEs leading 
to a fatal outcome (6.5% vs 3.9%), but similar or less drug-related AEs (67.6% vs 73.7%), drug-related 
SAEs (11.1% vs 10.0%), drug-related AEs leading to a fatal outcome (0.3% vs 0.4%).

Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Database Cutoff Date: 30NOV2017 
The frequencies of each of the commonly reported AEs in KN-052 were, in general, consistent with the 
frequencies  for  the  same  AEs  in  the  reference  safety  dataset  with  3  major  exceptions:  urinary  tract 
infection  (24.3%  in  KN-052  vs  5.8%  in  the  reference  safety  dataset),  haematuria  (16.5%  vs  1.4%), 
blood  creatinine  increased  (14.6%  vs  3.9%).  Medical  review  of  the  available  data  for  those  3  events 
indicated  they  were  more  likely  related  to  the  underlying  medical  condition  (urothelial  cancer),  with  its 
clinical  complications  or  procedures  performed  due  to  the  underlying  medical  condition  and  did  not 
indicate a specific safety issue. 
The most commonly reported Grade 3-5 AEs in KN-052 were the following (frequencies in KEYNOTE-052 
vs  reference  safety  dataset):  urinary  tract  infection  (10.8%  vs  0.5%),  anaemia  (7.8%  vs  3.2%),  and 
fatigue  (5.4%  and  2.5%).  Urinary  tract  infection  and  anaemia  events  were  considered  likely  related  to 
the  underlying  medical  condition  urothelial  cancer.  The  frequencies  of  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs 
reported 1% or higher in KN-052 are consistent with the frequencies of the same events in the reference 
safety dataset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168468/2021  
Page 14/19 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Serious  adverse  events:  The  frequency  of  SAEs  in  KN-052  was  50.5%  (vs  37.2%  in  the  reference 
safety  dataset).  The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  were  the  following  (KN-052  vs  reference  safety 
dataset): urinary tract infection (7.0% vs 0.5%), urosepsis (3.5% vs 0.1%), acute kidney injury (3.5% 
vs 0.8%), and hematuria (3.0% vs 0).  
Deaths:  Twenty-four  (6.5%)  subjects  experienced  a  fatal  AE  in  KN-052  (cutoff  30Nov2017),  which 
includes  4  additional  fatal  events  reported  since  9-MAR-2017:  colonic  fistula,  death  (unknown  cause), 
embolism, and urosepsis. No new drug-related deaths were reported compared to previous cut-off date. 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation: A total of 63 (17.0%) subjects experienced an AE resulting 
in  treatment  discontinuation,  9.7%  considered  drug-related.  Pneumonitis  (5  events,  1.4%),  colitis  (3 
events, 0.8%), diarrhea (3 events, 0.8%), and tubulo-interstitial nephritis (2 events, 0.5%) were drug-
related AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation reported more than once.  
Adverse events of special interest: The frequency of subjects in KN-052 who experienced AEOSIs was 
similar  to  the  frequency  observed  in  the  reference  safety  dataset:  24.6%  vs  21.4%.  The  nature  and 
frequency of AEOSIs in KN-052 were consistent with the nature and frequency of AEOSIs observed in the 
reference safety dataset. 
3.3.  KEYNOTE-361 
KEYNOTE-361 (KN-361) is an ongoing Phase III randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label 
trial  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  with  or  without  chemotherapy  versus 
chemotherapy alone as first line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.  
Following a recommendation from the eDMC in February 2018 taken based on early review of safety data, 
the MAH decided to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose 
tumors have a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) <10. The clinical trial protocol has been amended 
accordingly.  
The  study  is  powered  to  evaluate  the  potential  benefit  of  the  combination  of  pembrolizumab  + 
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for the first line treatment of urothelial carcinoma in all 
subjects  regardless  of  PD-L1  CPS  status,  primary  endpoints  being  PFS  using  RECIST  1.1  assessed  by 
BICR and OS.  
As of 8-MAY-2018, the study has enrolled 930 of the targeted 990 subjects.  
KEYNOTE-361 data provided to EMA have a data cut-off date of 22-DEC-2017. No additional data analysis 
has  been  planned  by  the  MAH  other  than  the  Interim  Analysis,  results  of  which  are  expected  to  be 
available in September/October 2018.  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
To  evaluate  the  baseline  characteristics  that  may  predict  the  risk  of  early  death  in  the  pembrolizumab 
arm in KN-361, the MAH has been requested by EMA to provide:  
1) Descriptive statistics of characteristics at baseline and statistical comparison between the two arms for 
patients having an OS event.  
2)  The  interaction  term and  p-values between  treatment  and each clinical variable  by using Cox  model 
and the  corresponding HR  for each  subgroups  (including also Bajorin  risk  factors and  haemoglobin),  as 
well as Kaplan Meier curves.

3.4.  Discussion – review of interim results of KEYNOTE-361  
Keytruda  is  currently  approved  in  EU  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.  
In February 2018, the MAH decided to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm 
of subjects whose tumours have a PD-L1 CPS<10 in the KEYNOTE 361 study, an ongoing phase III trial of 
pembrolizumab  with  or  without  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone  as  first  line  treatment  in 
subjects with advanced or metastatic UC (Annex II study for Keytruda), following eDMC recommendation.  
In  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  on  the  currently  authorized  Keytruda  indication,  the  CHMP 
requested  and  analyzed  early  data  from  KEYNOTE-361.  The  MAH  provided  also  updated  results  from 
KEYNOTE-052  study,  the  single  arm  study  which  led  to  pembrolizumab  approval  in  cisplatin-ineligible 
patients. Following the assessment of the totality of data (Keytruda PAM-ANX018 procedure), the CHMP 
concluded  that  a  revision  of  the  current  Keytruda  indication  in  cisplatin-ineligible  UC  patients  was 
warranted, in order to exclude subjects with a PD-L1 expression CPS<10. In addition, an amendment to 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC and a draft DHPC to inform prescribers about the change of product information 
were  requested,  together  with  further  discussion  on  the  exclusion  of  patients  ineligible  to  all  platinum-
containing  products  and  on  potential  factors  that  could  be  associated  with  early  risk  of  death  with 
pembrolizumab. 
Wording of the indication 
The MAH’s proposed revised indication was the following:  
“KEYTRUDA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial 
carcinoma  in  adults  who  are  not  eligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy  and  whose  tumours 
express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥10. Keytruda is also indicated for patients who are 
ineligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy  whose  tumours  express  PD-L1  CPS<10  and  who  are 
without poor prognostic features (2 Bajorin risk factors and haemoglobin< 10 g/dL), or for patients who 
are unfit for any chemotherapy (including carboplatin) regardless of PD-L1 status (see section 5.1).” 
The proposal to submit a variation to exclude patients with a PD-L1 expression CPS<10 was based on the 
early  findings  from  KEYNOTE-361  study  and  the  decision  not  to  enrol  CPS<10  patients  in  the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of the study upon DMC recommendation.  
Therefore,  the MAH  was  also  requested  to  clarify  if  it  was possible  to  identify  factors  associated  to  the 
increased risk of early progression and death. 
The MAH should commit to provide KN-361 IA results as well as the requested comprehensive analysis on 
potential predictive variables when available.  
Based  on  all  available  data  of  pembrolizumab  in  urothelial  cancer  and  on  the  provided  analyses,  the 
MAH’s proposal  for  the  restriction of  indication  is not  considered  acceptable as  not  supported  by sound 
evidence.  
Following the review of the data provided by the iDMC and the MAH, the CHMP agreed with the changes 
of section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to restrict the indication as follows: 
•  Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours 
express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10 (see section 5.1).

•  Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration” 
PD-L1 testing for patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma  
Patients  with  NSCLC  or  previously  untreated  urothelial  carcinoma  should  be  selected  for 
treatment  based  on  the  tumour  expression  of  PD-L1  confirmed  by  a  validated  test  (see 
section 5.1). 
•  Section 4.4 “Warning and precautions” 
Disease-specific precautions 
Use of pembrolizumab in urothelial cancer for patients who are considered ineligible for cisplatin-
containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 10 
The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052 included a 
proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination, for whom the benefit is being 
assessed in a comparative study, and patients eligible for mono-chemotherapy, for whom no 
randomized data are available. In addition, no safety and efficacy data are available in frailer 
patients (e.g., ECOG performance status 3) considered not eligible for chemotherapy. In the absence of 
these data, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of 
the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis. 
•  Section 5.1 “Warning and precautions” 
Please refer to the Attachment 1 to see the changes. 
In addition, a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to 
communicate on the restriction of indication after agreement of the translations local specificities of the 
DHPC with national competent authorities.  
The  DHPC  should  be  sent  by  9  July  2018  to  Prescribing  Oncologists/Oncology  clinics/Oncology 
departments/Pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels. The DHPC and the communication 
plan are provided as attachment II to this report. 
3.5.  Conclusion  
Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  iDMC  and  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  SmPC  changes  to 
restrict  the  1st  line  indication  in  urothelial  carcinoma  in  patients  not  eligible  for  cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy based on the preliminary data from on ongoing clinical trial (KEYNOTE-361) which showed 
reduced survival with Keytruda monotherapy compared to standard chemotherapy when used as first-line 
treatment  for  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  whose  tumour  has  low 
expression of PD-L1. 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate 
on the revised indication for Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. 
The draft DHPC and the draft communication plan are provided in Attachment 2.  
The MAH agreed the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. 
The  DHPC  should  be  sent  by  12th  July  2018  to  prescribing  oncologists,  oncology  clinics,  oncology 
departments, pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels.

4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy is as expected. The lower OS performance of pembrolizumab 
compared to chemotherapy observed in KEYNOTE-361 study does not appear to be related to a safety 
issue.  
5.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance  
The  Scope  of  this  variation  is  to  revise  the  existing  indication  for  Keytruda  as  monotherapy  for  the 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for 
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, following the assessment of early data from the ongoing clinical trial 
KEYNOTE-361  (phase  III  randomized  open  label  study  of  pembrolizumab  with/without  platinum-based 
chemotherapy versus  chemotherapy  alone  as  first  line  treatment  in  advanced  or metastatic  UC), which 
was recently amended to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects 
whose  tumours  have  a  PD-L1  Combined  Positive  Score  (CPS)  <10,  based  on  external  Data  Monitoring 
Committee recommendation. 
Thus, a restriction of indication is warranted. 
The MAH applied for a variation to update section 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1. 
The CHMP agreed with the update of section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
A  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  (DHPC)  was  considered  necessary  to  communicate  on 
the modification of the indication.  
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  Keytruda,  remains  positive  in  the  other  authorised  indications  and  2nd  line 
urothelial carcinoma indication. As for the 1st line urothelial indication, the benefit risk remains positive in 
patients whose tumours have a PDL-1 expression ≥ 10.  
The MAH should provide KN-361 IA results as well as the requested comprehensive analysis on potential 
predictive variables when available.

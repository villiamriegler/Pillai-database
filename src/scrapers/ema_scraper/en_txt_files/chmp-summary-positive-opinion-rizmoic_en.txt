Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Rizmoic 
naldemedine 
On 13 December 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Rizmoic, 
intended for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Shionogi B.V. 
Rizmoic will be available as 200-microgram film-coated tablets. The active substance of Rizmoic is 
naldemedine, a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist which acts in tissues such as the 
gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without reversing the central 
nervous system-mediated opioid effects. 
The benefits with Rizmoic are its ability to induce a clinical relevant increase in the number of spontaneous 
bowel movements in patients suffering from opioid-induced constipation. The most common side effects 
are abdominal pain (7.8%), diarrhoea (5.9%), nausea (3.6%), and vomiting (1.1%). 
The full indication is: “Rizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult 
patients who have previously been treated with a laxative”. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

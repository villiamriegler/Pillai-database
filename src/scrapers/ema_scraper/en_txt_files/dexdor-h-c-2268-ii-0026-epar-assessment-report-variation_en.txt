Dexmedetomidine is an intravenously administered sedative agent that is currently approved in the 
European Union (EU) for sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level 
not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-
Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3). Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist that exerts its 
sedative effects by acting on noradrenergic pathways originating in the locus coeruleus of the brain 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

stem, whereas benzodiazepine sedative agents act on GABAergic pathways. Because of its different 
mechanism of action, dexmedetomidine provides a somewhat different sedative profile. The MAH 
claims that patients sedated with dexmedetomidine are more rousable and able to communicate and 
yet remain calm and comfortable during mechanical ventilation. 
In the central nervous system, many cardiovascular functions, arousal state, cognitive functions, 
nociception, body temperature, secretion of many hormones etc are under alpha-2 adrenergic 
regulation. In the periphery, alpha-2 adrenoceptors have a role in regulating functions such as smooth 
muscle tone, platelet aggregation, lipolysis, insulin secretion, and electrolyte secretion in the kidneys 
and intestines. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation therefore induces a characteristic pattern of 
pharmacodynamic responses that include dose-dependent sympatholysis (with reduction of blood 
pressure, heart rate and oxygen demand), sedation, analgesia, anxiolysis and anaesthetic/analgesic 
potentiation. These characteristics make alpha- 2 adrenergic agonists attractive for use in the 
perioperative and intensive care settings. 
Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml (as the base) concentrate for solution is a simple aqueous solution for 
administration via the intravenous route. The final product is a sterile aqueous solution in vials and 
ampoules which is intended for dilution with a suitable solution prior to administration. It contains only 
dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, sodium chloride and water for injections. 
The first worldwide approval of dexmedetomidine was in the USA in 1999 to Abbott Laboratories for 
short-term sedation (up to 24 hours) in the ICU. A further indication for procedural sedation was 
granted in the USA in 2008 to Hospira, which was at that time a strategic partner of Orion in many 
territories.  
The marketing authorisation application (MAA) for ICU sedation had been considered not approvable 
when initially submitted to EMA in 2000 by Abbott. The Scientific Advice obtained at that time indicated 
two main concerns: that the clinical value of dexmedetomidine for ICU patients was not established 
and that the use of a loading dose at the start of treatment was not justified. After reacquiring the 
European rights to dexmedetomidine in 2005, Orion conducted two phase III trials to establish the 
clinical benefit of dexmedetomidine compared to propofol and midazolam in critically ill ICU patients. A 
new dosing scheme was incorporated in these studies, involving a wider dose range without the use of 
a loading dose. These two studies formed the basis for the approval of Dexdor for ICU sedation in the 
EU in 2011. Despite the procedural sedation indication being already approved elsewhere, Orion did 
not seek approval for this indication at that time, in order to concentrate on the use of 
dexmedetomidine in the ICU. 
Orion is now submitting an application to update the ICU sedation indication for dexmedetomidine to 
include the procedural sedation indication. The additional indication proposed is: For sedation of non-
intubated adult patients prior to and/or during diagnostic or surgical procedures requiring sedation, i.e. 
procedural/awake sedation. There is no change in the biopharmaceutics of Dexdor.  
The proposed dosing recommendation for the procedural sedation is: 
Initiation of Procedural Sedation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For adult patients: A loading infusion of 1.0 microgram/kg over 10 minutes.  
For less invasive procedures such as ophthalmic surgery, a loading infusion of 0.5 
micrograms/kg given over 10 minutes may be suitable. 
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: A loading infusion of 1 microgram/kg over 
10 minutes. 
For patients over 65 years of age: A dose reduction should be considered. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 7/142 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance of Procedural Sedation: 
• 
• 
• 
For adult patients: The maintenance infusion is generally initiated at 0.6 microgram/kg/hour 
and titrated to achieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 
microgram/kg/hour. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the 
targeted level of sedation. 
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: A maintenance infusion of 0.7 
microgram/kg/hour is recommended until the endotracheal tube is secured. 
For patients over 65 years of age: A dose reduction should be considered. 
Although there are many different potential clinical scenarios, the common objective for procedural 
sedation is to help patients tolerate uncomfortable or unpleasant conditions, often over a prolonged 
period, in a way that allows the procedure to be performed effectively and without risk from 
movement. It is also important to recognise that pain to a variable extent may be an important cause 
for patient discomfort during these procedures. Sedation does not ensure adequate pain relief and 
analgesia must therefore be considered as a separate issue.  
Procedural sedation is not always restricted to a full anaesthesia / operating theatre environment but 
may be applied also in other settings, such as in a radiology department or an endoscopy clinic. In 
these settings in particular, administration of procedural sedation may be administered by non-
anaesthetist physicians or other healthcare professionals. Practices differ across member states.  
Propofol and benzodiazepines remain the most common sedative drugs used for procedural sedation, 
often in combination with local/regional anaesthesia and/or opioids. Ketamine can be used as a sole 
agent or as an adjunct, and differs by having a potent analgesic property. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
A Phase I environmental risk assessment has been performed and the assessment has been 
submitted. The Applicant has refined the Fpen given the likely treatment duration and the 
PECSURFACEWATER is well below the action limit. No further environmental risk assessment is 
required.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This variation application is supported by two pivotal phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multicentre clinical trials sponsored by Hospira. The MAC (2005-005) and AWAKE (2005-
006) trials studied the use of dexmedetomidine in two distinct clinical situations. It is proposed to 
extrapolate the findings of these trials to the broader patient population of non-intubated adult 
patients for procedural sedation as defined by the proposed indication statement.  In addition to the 
two main trials the application was supported by a review of literature, including two systematic 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 8/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reviews which compare dexmedetomidine to propofol and to midazolam in several clinical scenarios in 
procedural sedation. 
As with other agents used for procedural sedation under the control of an anaesthetist, the dose of 
dexmedetomidine requires careful individualised titration to achieve a safe and effective level of 
sedation. In the first marketing authorisation of dexmedetomidine in 1999 in the USA, the 
administration of dexmedetomidine for ICU sedation was recommended to be started with a loading 
dose of 1 mcg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/h. MAC and AWAKE trials were 
also planned and approved by FDA with an administration scheme starting with a loading dose. The 
aim, to establish a dexmedetomidine plasma concentration consistent with sedation, was safely 
achievable with a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg in 10 minutes infusion. In the MAC study, the loading dose 
was either 0.5 or 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes. The 0.5 mcg/kg dose, recommended by the FDA, was 
added to allow the evaluation of safety and efficacy of a lower loading dose of dexmedetomidine, as 
well as aiding in preserving the study blind. The maintenance dose began at 0.6 mcg/kg/h and it was 
titrated in the range of 0.2-1 mcg/kg/h to achieve and/or maintain targeted sedation levels. In 
AWAKE, the loading dose of dexmedetomidine was 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, and the maintenance 
dose for dexmedetomidine was 0.7 mcg/kg/h. In literature reports, although both loading doses have 
been employed, the loading dose of 1 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes was more frequently used. Based 
on the clinical data presented by Abbott, Hospira and Orion, and the literature data, the use of loading 
dose of 1 mcg/kg within 10 minutes, or in 0.5 mcg/kg in 10 minutes for less invasive procedures such 
as ophthalmic surgery, followed with a maintenance dose of 0.2-1.0 mcg/kg/h or 0.7 mcg/kg/h for 
awake intubation has been evaluated. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The pivotal 
trials for this application were also submitted as supportive evidence in the original application for 
marketing authorisation for Dexdor and questions concerning GCP are therefore not pursued further in 
this procedure.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAC (2005-005) and AWAKE (2005-006) studies were designed to confirm the clinical safety and 
efficacy and no blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses in these studies. The 
previously submitted Dex-97-028 and W98-273 studies provide relevant PK data and the MAH refers to 
these to support the use of a loading dose of 1 µg/kg over 10 min.  
DEX-97-028 
Objectives: The primary objectives were to identify the dose–exposure relationship for sedation using 
single IV doses of dexmedetomidine; to select and include 3 doses for the long-term infusion portion of 
Part II; and to investigate the effects of long-term infusions (12- and 24-hour) of dexmedetomidine on 
the sedative profile compared with single doses. 
Study Design: During the each part of the study, healthy volunteers received dexmedetomidine or 
placebo as a 2-stage infusion regimen (loading and maintenance). The target steady state 
concentrations and dexmedetomidine administration rates are presented in Table below.

Mean dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations after a 10-min loading dose of 1.0 µg/kg (6 µg/kg/h) 
were 1.8 ng/ml in part I and 1.1 ng/ml in part II. Mean concentrations following the 10-min loading 
infusion in part II were lower than in part I due to that actual sampling time point was slightly later 
than 10 minutes. 
Results: The relationship of dose time-concentration relationship is given in Figure below. The mean 
dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations after a 10-min loading dose of 1.0 µg/kg (6 µg/kg/h) were 
1.8 ng/ml in part I and 1.1 ng/ml in part II, respectively (see Table below). According to the Applicant 
the mean concentrations following the 10-min loading infusion in part II were lower than in part I due 
to that actual sampling time point was slightly later than 10 minutes.

W98-273 
Similar results were obtained in study W98-273 in Japanese subjects (n=6); after a 10 min loading 
infusion (6 µg/kg/h) the mean ± SD plasma concentration was in the range 1.5-1.9±1 ng/mL.  
Summary 
Doses in the range 0.2-1.4 µg/kg/h are recommended in the SmPC for ICU sedation. For ICU sedation 
patients, a maintenance infusion rate of 0.95 µg/kg/h and 1.4 µg/kg/h are expected to result in mean 
steady-state plasma concentrations of approximately 1.72 ng/mL and 2.33 ng/mL, respectively (Study 
3005012 Prodex, Study 3005013 Midex). The mean concentrations reached by the loading infusion are 
at the same level as the mean steady state plasma concentration after a dose of 0.95 µg/kg/h. 
Based on above, the Applicant draws the conclusion that dexmedetomidine plasma concentration 
needed for sedation is achievable with a loading dose of 1 µg/kg over 10 minutes. 
Specific PK considerations for the current application 
There are a number of important differences in the PK considerations for the new compared to the 
existing indication.  
Firstly, the situation is somewhat simplified by the fact that the new target patient population is rather 
less likely than the currently approved ICU population to have highly variable and unpredictable drug 
handling as a result of various disturbance in physiology associated with critical illness. Hence PK data 
in healthy adults can be more directly applied to the new patient population.  
Secondly, the time taken for the effects of the sedative drug to wear off is of far greater importance in 
the new target patient population. In the ICU this is usually not very relevant, but a high percentage of 
procedures requiring sedation are done as day cases so patients need to be fully recovered in a short 
time frame so that they can go home.  
PK aspects relevant to onset of effect 
Dex-97-028 and W98-273 studies summarise the PK data that support the use of a 10-minute loading 
infusion at 6 mcg/kg/h that is equivalent to a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 min. 
The mean plasma concentration achieved by the loading infusion 1 mcg/kg infused over 10 minutes 
was about 1.8 ng/ml. Doses 0.2-1.4 mcg/kg/h are recommended in the SmPC for ICU sedation. For 
ICU sedation patients, a maintenance infusion rate of 0.95 mcg/kg/h and 1.4 mcg/kg/h are expected 
to result in mean steady-state plasma concentrations of approximately 1.72 ng/ml and 2.33 ng/ml, 
respectively (3005012 Prodex, 3005013 Midex). The mean concentrations reached by the loading 
infusion are at the same level as the mean steady state plasma concentration after a dose of 0.95 
mcg/kg/h. 
Based on above, the MAH argued that dexmedetomidine plasma concentration needed for sedation is 
achievable with a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes.  
PK aspects relevant to offset of effect 
The time taken to achieve full reversal of sedation is an important consideration for procedural

sedation, especially for procedures performed as day cases. A number of PK parameters are important 
in this context including short term drug re-distribution and clearance. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with a broad range of pharmacological 
properties. It has a sympatholytic effect through decrease of the release of noradrenaline in 
sympathetic nerve endings. Unlike other sedative agents used in standard of care and acting as GABA 
receptor antagonists (e.g. midazolam, propofol), its effects are claimed to be mediated through 
decreased firing of locus coeruleus, the predominant noradrenergic nucleus, situated in the brainstem 
conferring a mechanism of arousal and different form of sedation. 
The SmPC for Dexdor states that as well as sedative and sympatholytic effects, dexmedetomidine has 
analgesic and anaesthetic/analgesic-sparing effects and is relatively free from respiratory depressive 
effects when given as monotherapy to healthy subjects. The MAH states that it produces a state of 
‘cooperative sedation’, allowing the patient to interact with healthcare providers (Unger et al 2006, 
Pandharipande et al 2006). While patient cooperation can be achieved with other sedatives properly 
dosed, dexmedetomidine maintains this property throughout the usual dosage (Gerlach et al 2007). 
The characteristics of cooperative sedation are highly desirable in the outpatient surgery population 
where patients are expected to be discharged home safely and shortly after their surgery. The MAH 
further argued that because of its pharmacodynamic properties, dexmedetomidine appears to address 
many of the needs of IV sedation in non-intubated patients undergoing surgical and other procedures.  
It is agreed that no further pharmacodynamic data are necessary to support the claimed new 
indication. The pharmacodynamic mechanism is essentially the same and there are no new secondary 
pharmacodynamic considerations. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new PK or PK/PD modelling data have been submitted in the present application. This could in 
general be acceptable, however some SmPC recommendations need to be improved that could be 
solved with PK/PD modelling, such as a dose reduction in elderly patients and better defining the 
recovery phase. The MAH could use available PK/PD data and use of modelling and simulation. 
The MAH was requested to further discuss the PK characteristic of DEX in the context of the relatively 
slow recovery time observed for DEX in the MAC trial. The responses were satisfactory.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the submitted clinical pharmacology data sufficient.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The evidence of efficacy for the proposed new indication comes primarily from two phase III 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies MAC (2005-005) and AWAKE (2005-
006), in in non-intubated patients requiring sedation. These two trials are supplemented with an 
extended review and analysis of literature.

The MAC study (2005-005) evaluated dexmedetomidine for sedation under the control of an 
anaesthetist in 326 patients undergoing surgery under local or regional anaesthesia. It was conducted 
at 26 investigative sites in the USA and enrolled a broad range of patients scheduled for a variety of 
elective surgical procedures including orthopaedic, ophthalmic, plastic, vascular, breast biopsies and 
excision of lesions. The objectives of sedation in this clinical situation are conscious sedation, comfort, 
analgesia, anxiety control and overall patient satisfaction, with acceptable safety especially in relation 
to cardiovascular and respiratory depression. For some procedures it may also be necessary for the 
patient to respond purposefully to verbal input.  
The AWAKE study (2005-006) evaluated dexmedetomidine for awake fibreoptic oral or nasal 
intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure in 105 patients expected to be difficult to 
intubate. It was conducted at 17 investigative sites in the USA. Awake intubation in a patient with a 
potentially difficult airway is an extremely stimulating procedure that may be associated with large 
haemodynamic changes. To attenuate this response, blunting of the airway reflexes is required without 
losing the cooperation of the patient. A successful awake fibreoptic intubation requires an anaesthetist 
experienced in this technique, adequate topical anaesthesia of the airway, and a sedated yet 
cooperative patient. The most common complications of this procedure are hypoxemia and gastric 
content aspiration. Benzodiazepines, combined with opioids, are commonly used for anxiolysis and/or 
analgesia during awake fiberoptic intubations. Unfortunately, this combination of drugs can cause 
respiratory depression, placing the patient at risk for hypoxemia and aspiration. 
Measurement of sedation 
Sedation with dexmedetomidine has been documented using several validated assessment tools. In 
the MAC study, the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S) was selected as the 
intraoperative sedation scale as it was considered suitable for the non-intubated patient population 
undergoing monitored anaesthesia care. This measure has been used and validated in the 
perioperative and postoperative settings (Chernik et al 1990). The target sedation level was OAA/S ≤ 
4, (lethargic response to name, mildly slow speech, eyes glazed or mild ptosis).

In the AWAKE study, the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) was used to determine the level of sedation. 
The RSS has been used and validated in intubated and non-intubated patients in operating room 
settings (De Jonghe et al 2000). The target sedation level was RSS ≤ 2 (cooperative, oriented, 
tranquil).

Main study MAC (2005-005) 
A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluating the Safety and 
Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine for Sedation During Monitored Anaesthesia Care (MAC) 
Methods 
This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, multicentre study designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEX when used for sedation of subjects requiring MAC for 
elective surgery or a procedure. 
A broad range of patients scheduled for a variety of elective surgeries/procedures performed in an 
operating room (OR) or procedure room with an anaesthetist in attendance was tested. The types of 
surgeries/procedures included in this study were: orthopaedic, ophthalmic, plastic, vascular stents, 
breast biopsies, AV fistulas and excision of lesions. Surgeries/procedures were expected to take longer 
than 30 minutes to complete. An estimated 325 subjects (130 DEX 0.5 mcg/kg load, 130 DEX 1 
mcg/kg load, 65 PBO) were to be randomized at 26 investigative sites. 
Subjects were screened up to 14 days prior to receiving study drug infusion. During screening subjects 
were assessed for eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria), a physical examination was performed and a 
medical history was taken. If a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed at this time, it did not 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

have to be repeated at baseline. Informed consent was obtained prior to the performance of any 
study-specific procedures. 
At baseline, prior to study drug infusion, eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio (DEX 0.5 
mcg/kg load: DEX 1 mcg/kg load: PBO) in 1 of 3 blinded arms of the study. Randomisation was 
stratified by surgery/procedure type. Subjects were fitted with standard monitors for ECG monitoring, 
blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and pulse oximetry (SpO2). If not obtained 
at screening, a 12-lead ECG was obtained at this time and a baseline Observer’s Assessment of 
Alertness/Sedation scale (OAA/S) score was obtained and recorded. Blood samples for baseline 
laboratory assessments were collected. For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine 
pregnancy test was performed to confirm eligibility. 
Following completion of baseline procedures, blinded study drug infusion began. Subjects received a 
loading dose of study drug administered over 10 minutes (DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg, or 
placebo). Following completion of the load, the maintenance infusion was started (initiated at DEX 0.6 
mcg/kg/hr for all subjects randomized to receive DEX; and PBO for all subjects randomized to receive 
PBO). 
The level of sedation was assessed during study drug infusion and during the subject’s stay in the 
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) using the OAA/S. The first OAA/S score during the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period was evaluated and recorded 15 minutes following the start of study drug infusion. 
After that, OAA/S scores were obtained every five minutes throughout the remainder of study drug 
infusion. Whenever possible, the same investigator or designee obtained OAA/S scores throughout the 
study for a given subject. 
The target OAA/S score during study drug infusion was ≤  4 (lethargic response to name, mildly slow 
speech, eyes glazed or mild ptosis). After the first 15 minutes of study drug infusion, study drug could 
be titrated in order to achieve and/or maintain an OAA/S of < 4, and if necessary, rescue MDZ was 
administered. For subjects with an OAA/S score of < 3 (over-sedated) the maintenance study drug 
infusion rate was decreased to a minimum of 0.2 mcg/kg/hr for DEX (or an equivalent rate for 
placebo). 
For subjects with an OAA/S score > 4 (not sedated) the investigator was encouraged to achieve 
sedation by increasing the maintenance study drug infusion rate to a maximum of 1 mcg/kg/hr for 
DEX (or an equivalent rate for placebo) prior to giving rescue medication. After titration to a maximum 
infusion rate, the investigator could administer rescue MDZ (0.5 mg IV) as needed to achieve sedation. 
Rescue MDZ was not administered if the OAA/S score was ≤  4. All subjects enrolled in the study 
received a local anaesthetic block prior to surgery/ procedure. The block was performed at least 15 
minutes after the beginning of study drug infusion when an OAA/S score ≤  4 was observed. Local 
anaesthetic infiltration extended 1 dermatome above and below the site of incision and surgery. The 
extent of the anaesthetic block was recorded by sensory dermatome section on the Case Report Form 
(CRF). The ophthalmic surgeon or anaesthesiologist performed retrobulbar blocks when indicated for 
eye surgery; and the anaesthesiologist performed axillary blocks, interscalene blocks or selective nerve 
blocks when indicated. No spinal or epidural anesthesia was permitted in this study. The local 
anaesthetic solution, concentration and volume were recorded. The study drug maintenance infusion 
was continued during the local anaesthetic block. An OAA/S score ≤  4 was required prior to entry into 
the operating room (OR)/procedure room as well as prior to the time the local anaesthetic block was 
administered.

If, after the first 15 minutes of study drug infusion, pain was present, the investigator could administer 
rescue fentanyl (25 mcg IV). Every dose of fentanyl that was given was justified as fitting into 1 of the 
following 2 categories and was recorded as such on the CRF: 
•  Subject expressed that his/her pain score was > 3 on a scale of 0-10, where 0 was no pain and 
10 was the worst pain ever experienced. 
•  Verbal communication was not possible – presence of pain was based on the investigator’s 
judgment. 
No rescue medication (MDZ or fentanyl) was administered during the first 15 minutes of study drug 
administration. 
During the Double-Blind Treatment Period the following was recorded every 5 minutes: systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HR, RR, SpO2, and OAA/S. Cardiac monitoring was 
continuous. The amounts of rescue fentanyl and MDZ administered were also recorded. During 
surgery/procedure, subjects could have nasal cannula oxygen at 3 litres/min or per practice standard 
at each site. Immediately prior to transfer of the subject to the PACU, study drug infusion was 
discontinued. Subjects remained in the PACU for a minimum of 1 hour following discontinuation of 
study drug. 
After the subject arrived in the PACU, the anaesthetist responded to questions related to the ease of 
maintenance of appropriate intraoperative sedation, respiratory stability, haemodynamic stability and 
subject cooperation using Visual Analog Scales (VASs). 
Upon arrival in the PACU, vital signs and SpO2 were recorded every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes, 
then every 15 minutes for the next 45 minutes. OAA/S, pain scale and Aldrete scores were assessed 
every 15 minutes while the subject was in the PACU. A 12-lead ECG was performed and cardiac 
monitoring was continuous. The PACU nurse administered fentanyl boluses (25 mcg IV) in response to 
a subject pain score ≥  4, or, if verbal communication was not possible, when pain was judged to be 
present by the investigator. Readiness for discharge was evaluated using site-specific criteria and the 
Aldrete Scoring System. The time from discontinuation of study drug to achievement of an Aldrete 
score ≥  9 was recorded for each subject. 
Subjects were discharged when the site-specific PACU criteria were satisfied and the Aldrete Score was 
≥  9. A blood sample for postoperative laboratory assessments was obtained prior to discharge from 
the PACU. Subjects were visited or contacted by telephone 24 hours after the discontinuation of study 
drug to assess satisfaction with the sedation using the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS) 
and the level of anxiety experienced before, during and after the study drug infusion process using the 
Anxiety Assessment Scale.

Choice of control groups 
The MAH states that this study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEX when used for 
sedation of subjects for elective surgery or a procedure, in comparison with a blinded saline PBO 
control. The protocol-specified dose of DEX was selected based on the literature reports and 
recommendations from expert advisors. As recommended by the FDA, a low dose loading arm (DEX 
0.5 mcg/kg) was added to the study “in order to aid in preserving the study blind” and to “establish a 
benchmark”. 
Study participants 
Male or female subjects requiring Monitored Anaesthesia Care (MAC) for elective surgery/procedure 
expected to take longer than 30 minutes and performed under local anaesthetic block, and meeting 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria below, were selected and screened for enrolment. In line with FDA 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 18/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation the trial covered a broad range of surgical procedures including orthopaedics, 
podiatry, ophthalmology, gynaecology, urology, general surgery, and vascular procedures. 
Key Inclusion Criteria 
•  Any age >18, any fitness for anaesthesia (ASA grade I to IV), no pregnancy possibility.  
Key Exclusion Criteria 
•  Need for endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway or epidural or spinal anaesthesia. 
•  Recent general anaesthesia or αlpha-2-agonist, opioid within 4 hours, recent MI or unstable 
angina. Otherwise no restriction on prior and concomitant therapy.  
•  Specified CNS or psychiatric disease, abnormal liver function.  
Participation in the study could be terminated by the subject, the investigator, or Hospira at any time. 
Subjects could be discontinued from study drug infusion for various standard reasons relating to 
ethics, GCP and patient welfare, and in particular if the subject could not be adequately sedated by 
protocol-allowed amounts of study drug and rescue medication. Subjects who prematurely 
discontinued were not replaced. The date and reason for premature discontinuation was recorded on 
the appropriate CRF. 
Treatments 
Study drug was infused using a controlled infusion device such as a standard intravenous infusion 
pump system. Study drug was not rapidly bloused.  
The investigational drug was DEX injection (100 mcg/mL, base). The PBO control was 0.9% sodium 
chloride. The sponsor supplied the investigative sites with the DEX for infusion. Blinded study drug was 
prepared (diluted) by the site pharmacy. Blinded study drug was administered as a two-stage infusion: 
• 
• 
a 10-minute loading dose infusion of either DEX or PBO 
a maintenance dose infusion of DEX or PBO 
For the subjects randomized to receive a 0.5 mcg/kg DEX loading dose, the loading infusion bag DEX 
concentration and the maintenance infusion bag DEX concentration were 4 mcg/mL. For the subjects 
randomized to receive a 1 mcg/kg DEX loading dose, the loading infusion bag DEX concentration was 8 
mcg/mL and the maintenance infusion bag DEX concentration was 4 mcg/mL.  
All subjects received a loading dose volume of 0.125 mL/kg administered over 10 minutes, regardless 
of treatment group. DEX maintenance infusion began at a rate of 0.6 mcg/kg/hr and was titrated up or 
down (between 0.2 mcg/kg/hr and 1 mcg/kg/hr) as required to achieve and/or maintain Observer’s 
Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score ≤ 4.  
Midazolam 
If a subject was not adequately sedated (OAA/S score > 4) through titration with randomized study 
drug, MDZ could be administered. Rescue MDZ could be administered only after attempting to achieve 
sedation using study drug. Rescue MDZ was given as single bolus doses of 0.5 mg IV, repeated as 
needed to achieve an OAA/S score of ≤ 4. An OAA/S score was obtained before the administration of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 19/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any rescue MDZ medication. Rescue MDZ was not administered if the OAA/S score was ≤ 4. The 
timing, dose and reason for use of MDZ were recorded on the CRF. 
Fentanyl 
Rescue boluses of fentanyl (25 mcg IV) could be given in the presence of pain. For every dose of 
fentanyl given, a justification fitting 1 of the following 2 categories applied and was recorded on the 
CRF: 
•  Subject expressed that his/her pain score was > 3 during study drug infusion and > 4 in the 
PACU on a scale of 0-10, where 0 was no pain and 10 was the worst pain ever experienced. 
•  Verbal communication was not possible – presence of pain based on the investigator’s 
judgment. 
The timing, dose and reason for use of fentanyl were recorded on the CRF. 
At any time clinically indicated (e.g., subject discomfort despite maximum doses of study drug and 
rescue), at the discretion of the anaesthetist, the subject was converted to an alternative sedative 
and/or anaesthetic therapy. If a subject was converted to an alternative sedative and/or anaesthetic 
therapy, study drug was discontinued. 
Objectives 
The primary endpoint was the percent of subjects not requiring MDZ for rescue sedation based on 
achieving and/or maintaining an OAA/S score ≤ 4. This primary endpoint was selected to establish DEX 
as a stand-alone sedative/anxiolytic. 
Secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The total amount (mg) of rescue midazolam required to achieve and/or maintain sedation 
(OAA/S score ≤ 4). 
Time from onset of study drug infusion to first dose of rescue MDZ. 
Percentage of subjects who converted to alternative sedative and/or anaesthetic therapy due 
to failure of treatment with study drug and rescue. 
Time to recovery and readiness for discharge from PACU: assessed by time from 
discontinuation of study drug to reach Aldrete score ≥ 9. 
Total amount of fentanyl required for pain control. 
•  Anaesthetist assessment of ease of management; subject cooperation. 
• 
Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in PACU. 
•  Overall subject satisfaction and anxiety assessed 24 hours after study drug had been 
discontinued. 
Three analysis datasets were defined for data analysis, the safety dataset, the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
dataset, and the per protocol (PP) dataset. The safety dataset consisted of all subjects who received 
study drug. The ITT dataset consisted of all subjects who received the randomized study drug and had 
at least one post-baseline efficacy measure recorded. The PP dataset consisted of all subjects in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 20/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ITT dataset excluding those who had improper dosing of study medication, had used prohibited 
concomitant medications, and had other major protocol violations. The PP dataset was approved by the 
sponsor prior to breaking the randomization codes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The intraoperative sedation scale used to measure of depth of sedation in the trial was the Observer 
Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S). This measure has been used and validated in 
perioperative and postoperative patients (Chernik DA, Gillings D, Laine H, Hendler J, Silver J, Davidson 
A, Schwam E, Siegel J. Validity and reliability of the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation 
Scale: study with intravenous midazolam. Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology 1990:10:4:244-
251). 
Prior to the start of study drug infusion, the investigator or designee obtained a baseline score on the 
OAA/S. Whenever possible, the same investigator or designee obtained OAA/S scores every 5 minutes 
throughout the study drug infusion, beginning 15 minutes after the start of infusion, and every 15 
minutes while the subject was in the PACU. Table 8 lists the OAA/S criteria. An OAA/S score also was 
obtained prior to the administration of any rescue MDZ. 
Additional endpoints such as subject satisfaction and preservation of subject comfort and anxiolysis 
were incorporated to support evidence of sedative/anxiolysis efficacy. The Aldrete score is a validated 
measure for discharge of patients from the PACU (Aldrete JA. The Post-Anesthesia Recovery Score 
Revisited. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia 1995;7:89-91). The ISAS is a reliable and validated tool to 
measure patient satisfaction with monitored anesthesia care (Dexter F, Aker J, Wright J. Development 
of a measure of patient satisfaction with monitored anesthesia care. Anesthesiology 1997;87:865-
873). 
Anaesthetist Assessment 
Immediately after the subject was transferred to the PACU, the anaesthetist rated the ease of 
maintenance of appropriate intraoperative sedation level, respiratory stability, hemodynamic stability 
and subject cooperation using an anaesthetist assessment questionnaire.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Subject Pain Assessment 
During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, the investigator or designee continually evaluated the study 
subject for the presence of pain. If rescue fentanyl was administered, the reason was documented. 
While in the PACU, the subject was asked to rate his/her pain level on a scale of 0-10 (where 0 is no 
pain and 10 is the worst pain ever experienced) every 15 minutes.  
Aldrete Scoring System 
The Aldrete Scoring System was administered upon arrival in the PACU and every 15 minutes 
thereafter while the subject remained in the PACU. Table 9 lists the criteria for the Aldrete Scoring 
System. 
Measure of Satisfaction with Anaesthesia and Anxiety 
At the end of the Post-Treatment Period, subjects were visited or contacted by telephone for follow-up 
safety. Subjects also were evaluated for satisfaction with the anaesthetic procedure using the ISAS 
and level of anxiety before, during and after the study drug infusion process using the Anxiety 
Assessment Scale. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to receive DEX 0.5 mg/kg, DEX 1 mg/kg or PBO in a 2:2:1 ratio using a 
computer-generated randomization schedule. Randomisation was stratified by surgery/procedure type 
with the following strata: orthopaedic, ophthalmic, plastic vascular stents, breast, biopsies, AV fistulas, 
excision of lesions, protocol exemptions. Randomisation was implemented through IVRS.

Blinding 
This was a double-blind study. All study personnel at the site, except the site pharmacist, were blinded 
to study drug assignment. The pharmacist received the bulk study drug and stored the supplies in a 
secure location. The pharmacist obtained the randomization assignment from the IVRS after a new 
subject had been identified and a medication order had been written. 
The pharmacist prepared the IVRS-assigned study drugs in identical containers. Labeling attached to 
each container identified each bag for the period in which it is to be used (i.e., loading dose period and 
maintenance infusion period) along with the subject’s unique identification number and initials. 
The unblinding of study subjects during a clinical trial was not allowed unless there was a compelling 
medical or safety reasons to break the blinded treatment code [e.g., knowledge of the blinded 
information was necessary for treatment of serious adverse events (SAEs)]. The unblinded pharmacist 
was responsible for the security of the blinded randomization codes for the study. If it became 
necessary to break the blind, the 
Principal Investigator (PI) contacted the unblinded pharmacist to obtain the specific treatment 
assignment for the subject in question. The sponsor was to be notified as soon as possible first by 
phone, then fax, regarding the necessity of breaking the blinded code. The PI notified the IRB, as 
required. Also, the date, time the blind was broken, and the reason for breaking the blind was 
documented on the subject’s CRF. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy analysis is to assess the sedative effect of DEX 1 mcg/kg load versus placebo in 
terms of percent of subjects not requiring MDZ for rescue sedation based on OAA/S score <=4. 
Sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: percentage of subjects not requiring 
rescue sedation of more than 70% in the DEX 1 mcg/kg load group and less than 10% in the placebo 
group, 99% power, and normal approximation.   
Statistical methods 
Primary analysis 
Efficacy analysis was performed on both the ITT and PP populations. The ITT population was the 
primary analysis population. 
The primary efficacy analysis is to assess the sedative effect of DEX 1 mcg/kg load versus placebo in 
terms of percent of subjects not requiring MDZ for rescue sedation based on OAA/S score <=4.  
Statistical assessment comparing DEX 1 load versus Placebo and DEX 0.5 load versus Placebo was 
performed separately using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for surgery/procedure type 
(collapsed into 4 categories). Comparison of DEX 0.5 versus Placebo was tested in hierarchical 
manner. 
Analytical strategy 
The answer (yes/no) from the question “Has the subject required any rescue midazolam?” was used to 
derive the primary endpoint. Statistical assessments of the primary outcome comparing the DEX 1 
mcg/kg load group versus PBO and the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg load group versus PBO were performed 
separately using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test controlled by surgery/procedure type. The 
comparison of DEX 1 mcg/kg load group versus PBO was the primary analysis (excluding DEX 0.5 
mcg/kg load group). The efficacy claim was based only on the comparison of the DEX 1 mcg/kg load

group versus PBO. When comparing the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg load group versus PBO, the DEX 1 mcg/kg 
load group was excluded from analysis.  
In order to control the probability of error in view of the two pairwise comparisons, the efficacy claim 
will only be based on the comparison of DEX 1 mcg/kg load group versus placebo. If this comparison 
fails to show statistically significant results in favor of DEX, no further statistical tests will be 
interpreted for this endpoint; all other p-values will be presented as planned and considered for 
explanatory purpose only. By this pre-specified procedure, no penalty in p-value is needed to control 
the probability of error.  
Missing data 
If a baseline value was missing, the value obtained during the screening period was used as the 
baseline value. Otherwise, there was no imputation of missing data.  
Centre effects 
This study included 26 investigational sites. No site enrolled more than 13% of all subjects. There were 
no adjustments made for centre in any of the analyses.  
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each surgery/procedure type using a chi-square test.  Testing 
of subgroups was exploratory. 
Secondary analyses 
The following analyses were performed: 
Continuous secondary outcomes: ANOVA model adjusting surgery/procedure type  
Time to event outcomes: Kaplan-Meir method and log-rank test adjusted for surgery/procedure type 
Binary outcomes: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CHM) adjusting for surgery/procedure type

A total of 371 subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive study drug, with 149 
in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, 149 in the DEX 1 mcg/kg group, and 73 in the PBO group. Of the 
randomized subjects, 134 (89.9%) in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, 129 (86.6%) in the DEX 1 mcg/kg

group, and 63 (86.3) in the PBO group received study drug and were included in the safety/ITT 
analysis population. The ITT population included all subjects who received any amount of the 
randomized study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measure. Subjects were terminated 
during the post-treatment period mainly due to being lost to follow-up or withdrawing consent. One 
subject (who received placebo) was terminated due to an adverse event and 3 subjects (2 received 
DEX 1 mcg/kg and 1 received placebo) were terminated due to protocol violations. Protocol violations 
are described in Section 10 of the CSR. 
The PP analysis population excluded 33 (22.1%) subjects in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, 34 (22.8%) in 
the DEX 1 mcg/kg group and 25 (34.2%) in the PBO group. The most common reason that subjects 
qualifying to be in the ITT population were excluded from the PP population was that study drug was 
not titrated before the subject was given rescue MDZ. Subjects excluded from the ITT and PP 
populations are listed, along with the reason for exclusion, in Appendices 16.2.3.1 and 16.2.3.2 of the 
CSR. 
134 (89.9%) of the 149 subjects randomized to receive DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, 129 (86.6%) of the 149 
subjects randomized to receive DEX 1 mcg/kg group, and 63 (86.3%) of the 73 subjects randomized 
to receive PBO received study drug infusion. Study drug was discontinued prematurely in 17 subjects: 
5 (3.4%) subjects in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, 6 (4.0%) subjects in DEX 1 mcg/kg group and 6 
(8.2%) subjects in PBO group.  
In the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group subject 211-0019 had study drug discontinued because of a pharmacy 
error in preparing the loading dose. Subject 209-0002 had study drug stopped after infusing for 17 
minutes because of urticaria at the IV site. Subject 201-0030 had study drug discontinued at the same 
time as surgery was completed and was therefore not an early discontinuation per se. Subjects 206-
0003 and 222-0002 had study drug stopped due to inadequate sedation and received general 
anesthesia. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 26/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the DEX 1.0 mcg/kg group, subjects 202-0001 and 206-0011 were discontinued because their 
surgery was cancelled. Subject 211-0021 was converted to general anesthesia at the request of the 
surgeon. Subject 214-0002 had study drug discontinued due to hypotension. Subject 223-0011 was 
discontinued for bradycardia. Subject 226-0047 had study drug discontinued because she was “too 
sleepy.” 
In the placebo group 6 subjects had study drug discontinued. Three subjects (201-0013, 211-0014 
and 218-0005) were unable to be adequately sedated by protocol-allowed amounts of study drug and 
rescue medication. Three subjects were cancelled for other reasons: two (206-0001 and 206-0014) 
because of a partially successful block and one (217-0011) who received additional rescue medication 
for pain.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations are listed in Appendix 16.2.2 of the CSR and included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
inclusion/exclusion criteria not met, 
pharmacy error 
study drug not titrated before MDZ administration, and 
•  MDZ being given outside the time allowed per the protocol 
One subject (209-0008) who received PBO did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria due to use of 
clonidine (α-2 agonist) and excluded from the PP population. 
One subject (235-0015) who received DEX 0.5 mcg/kg had the Screening assessment one day outside 
of the prescribed window, but as this was a minor violation the subject was included in the PP 
population. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 27/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For two subjects at one site (237-0006 who received DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and 237-0018 who received 
PBO) there were pharmacy errors in preparing the study drug. Neither subject had an adverse event 
as a result and at no time was safety an issue. These subjects were excluded from the PP population. 
Three subjects (202-0008 who received DEX 1 mcg/kg; 202-0007 and 205-0008 who received PBO) 
had MDZ administered outside the time allowed by the protocol. They were excluded from the PP 
population. 
Fourteen subjects were granted waivers by the sponsor for minor study entry criteria violations prior to 
study admission (Listing 16.2.4.12). Eleven subjects (5 who received DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, 4 who received 
DEX 1 mcg/kg and 2 who received PBO) had a procedure different from the categories described in the 
protocol; mostly for inguinal hernia repair. One subject (223-0011), who received DEX 1 mcg/kg, 
received a waiver for baseline heart rate < 50, 1 subject (206-0016) who received PBO, was entered 
with a waiver for the use of topical lidocaine for eye surgery and 1 subject who received PBO (235-
0015) was one day out of the screening window. Appendix 16.2.4.12 does not indicate a waiver for 
subject 235-0015 however this subject was granted a waiver for being one day out of the screening 
window prior to study drug infusion (See CRF for subject 235-0015). These subjects were included in 
the PP population.   
For 41 subjects, study drug was not titrated up prior to administering rescue MDZ. This included 17 
subjects who received DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, 13 who received DEX 1 mcg/kg, and 11 who received PBO. 
These subjects were not included in the PP population. These protocol deviations had no effect on the 
study endpoints. All other deviations were minor and did not affect study drug efficacy or safety 
evaluations or subject safety.

Primary analysis of efficacy (ITT population) 
The results for the primary efficacy endpoint the percent of subjects not requiring MDZ for rescue 
sedation based on achieving and/or maintaining an OAA/S ≤4 throughout the study drug infusion 
period, are summarized by treatment group in the following table.  
The two patients in the placebo group who did not require rescue MDZ both had ophthalmic 
procedures.

Secondary analyses 
As the primary analysis is spectacularly uninformative about the key question of scientific interest, the 
main information concerning the usefulness of Dexdor in the clinical situation studied will come from 
the secondary analyses. As the trial design does not allow for a direct comparison of the DEX regimens 
against standard of care sedation with midazolam (+/- fentanyl) and there is inherent bias in DEX vs. 
MDX comparisons, interpretation of the secondary analyses must be extremely cautious. The results 
for the key secondary analyses pre-specified in the protocol are presented in the following tables.

The percentage of subjects who required rescue fentanyl during the infusion period was significantly 
lower for both of the DEX groups (59.0% of subjects randomized to receive DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and 
42.6% of subjects randomized to receive DEX 1 mcg/kg) compared to 88.9% for the PBO group 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 33/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A significantly larger dose of fentanyl was required for the PBO group during the infusion period (144.4 
mcg as compared with 84.8 and 83.6 mcg for the DEX 0.5 and 1 mcg treatment groups, respectively) 
and overall (150.7 mcg as compared with 84.9 and 86.2 mcg for the DEX 0.5 and 1 mcg treatment 
groups, respectively). No significant differences were observed during the PACU period.

For all comparisons (infusion period, PACU period and overall) between the DEX 1 mcg/kg group and 
the PBO group, the differences were significant (p ≤ 0.048) with more subjects in the PBO group 
requiring pain medication in addition to fentanyl. 
Differences between the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group and the PBO group were not significant at any time 
period. Postoperatively, during the PACU period, as the local anaesthetic blocks wore off, significantly 
fewer subjects in the DEX 1 mcg/kg group required analgesics than in the PBO group.

Efficacy conclusions for MAC trial (2005-005) 
The CSR for the MAC trial (2005-005) provides the following discussion on efficacy.  
Efficacy results showed that DEX was more effective than PBO when used to sedate non-intubated 
subjects requiring MAC during surgical and diagnostic procedures. The primary efficacy result showed 
that both doses of DEX were significantly better than PBO at maintaining the targeted sedation level of 
OAA/S < 4 without the use of additional MDZ. In this study, 54.3% (70/129) of subjects randomized 
to receive DEX 1 mcg/kg and 40.3% (54/134) of subjects randomized to receive DEX 0.5 mcg/kg did 
not require rescue MDZ compared to 3.2% (2/63) for the PBO group (p < 0.001 for both 
comparisons). More subjects in PBO group could not be sedated with protocol-specified amounts of 
study drug or rescue MDZ and required additional sedation (propofol) or general anesthesia to 
complete their surgical procedure. Efficacy was supported by the secondary endpoints: 
(1) The mean total dose of rescue MDZ used to achieve and/or maintain the targeted sedation level 
was significantly lower in both DEX groups: 0.9 mg for DEX 1 mcg/kg and 1.4 mg for DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, 
compared to 4.1 mg for the PBO group. 
(2) The median time from start of study drug to first dose of rescue MDZ was significantly longer in 
both DEX groups: 114 minutes for DEX 1 mcg/kg and 40 minutes for DEX 0.5 mcg/kg compared to 20 
minutes for PBO (p < 0.001 for each comparison). 
(3) Fewer subjects in each DEX group required alternate sedation and/or general anesthesia: 2 (1.6%) 
DEX 1 mcg/kg subjects and 4 (3.0%) DEX 0.5 mcg/kg subjects compared to 7 (11.1%) PBO subjects. 
(4) The percentage of subjects who required rescue fentanyl for analgesia during the infusion period 
was significantly lower for both DEX groups (42.6% of DEX 1 mcg/kg subjects and 59.0% of DEX 0.5 
mcg/kg subjects compared to 88.9% of PBO subjects (p < 0.001 for both comparisons); and the dose 
of fentanyl during study drug infusion was significantly lower in both DEX groups, 83.6 and 84.8 mcg

of fentanyl for DEX 1 and 0.5 mcg/kg, respectively, compared to 144.4 mcg of fentanyl in the PBO 
group (p < 0.001 for each comparison). 
(5) Significantly fewer subjects required postoperative analgesics in the DEX 1 mcg/kg group than in 
the PBO group (p = 0.025). 
(6) The anesthesiologists’ assessment using the VAS showed significantly easier maintenance of the 
targeted sedation level in each DEX group compared to PBO group (p < 0.001 for each comparison). 
There was no difference between groups for anesthesiologists’ assessment of subject cooperation. 
(7) Overall, subjects ISAS scores were significantly higher in each DEX group compared to the PBO 
group (p< 0.001 for each comparison). Postoperative subject anxiety was significantly lower in the 
DEX 1 mcg/kg group than PBO. 
Main study AWAKE (2005-006) 
A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study Evaluating 
the Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine Used for Sedation During Elective Awake 
Fiberoptic Intubation 
Methods 
This was a Phase III, randomized, double blind, PBO-controlled, multicentre (17 sites) study designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEX (1 mcg/kg loading dose with 0.7 mcg/kg/hr maintenance 
dose) for sedation in subjects with potentially difficult airways undergoing awake fibreoptic intubation 
prior to an elective surgical or diagnostic procedure. 
Following screening eligible subjects were randomized to receive either DEX or PBO in a 1:1 ratio 
through an IVRS using a computer generated randomization schedule. At baseline, subjects’ blood 
pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) 
were measured. A 12-lead ECG was performed and a Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) score was 
documented. Blood samples for safety analyses were collected and, for female subjects of childbearing 
potential, a urine pregnancy test was performed. 
After completion of baseline procedures, each subject was pre-medicated with glycopyrrolate prior to 
study drug infusion. Supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or facemask was started and continued 
throughout the study period. During study drug infusion, subjects in the DEX group received a DEX 
loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed immediately by a DEX maintenance infusion of 0.7 
mcg/kg/hr. Subjects in the PBO group received a matching volume of normal saline for both the 
loading dose and maintenance infusion. 
Five minutes after beginning maintenance infusion (i.e. 15 minutes after start of loading dose 
infusion), the RSS was repeated. Subjects scoring 1 on the RSS received rescue MDZ 0.5 mg doses as 
needed (PRN) up to a maximum 0.2 mg/kg until the RSS score was ≥  2. RSS scores were obtained 
every 3 minutes from the 15 minute time point until the end of study drug infusion. Any subject 
scoring 1 on the RSS at any time received rescue MDZ, 0.5 mg doses, until the RSS was ≥  2. 
After achieving protocol-defined sedation and no sooner than 15 minutes after the start of study drug 
infusion, topical anesthesia in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and glottis was applied 
using lidocaine. After topicalization, an RSS score was obtained and any subject with a score of 1 
received rescue MDZ until the RSS score was ≥  2. After adequate topical anesthesia and achievement 
of an RSS score of ≥  2, nasal or oral intubation using a flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope was 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

performed. During the fibreoptic procedure, MDZ PRN (maximum total dose of 0.2 mg/kg) was given 
as rescue for sedation in order to maintain the RSS score at ≥  2. Subjects’ RSS scores were recorded 
before receiving each dose of rescue medication. 
Following completion of intubation, the subject’s endotracheal tube was connected to the breathing 
circuit. A positive-pressure breath with a tidal volume of 5-7 mL/kg was administered and the end–
tidal CO2 was recorded. Blood samples for safety analyses were collected. Study drug infusion was 
then discontinued, general anesthesia induced, and the scheduled surgery/procedure proceeded as 
planned. 
Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, pulse oximetry) were recorded every 3 minutes from the start of study drug 
infusion until the completion of intubation and immediately after discontinuation of study drug. 
Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed throughout study drug administration and a 12-lead 
ECG was performed after study drug infusion was discontinued but prior to the scheduled 
surgery/procedure. 
Immediately following intubation, anaesthetists responded to questions related to the intubation using 
Visual Analog Scales (VAS). Subjects began the 24-Hour Follow-Up Period at the time of study drug 
discontinuation. At the end of the 24-Hour Follow-Up Period, subjects were assessed for recall of 
intubation, discomfort and satisfaction. A schematic of the overall study design is provided below.

Study participants 
Male or female subjects requiring sedation for awake fibreoptic (oral or nasal) intubation because of 
anticipated difficult airway, and meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria below, were selected and 
screened for enrolment.

The Mallampati classification relates tongue size to pharyngeal size and is assigned based on the 
pharyngeal structures as follows: 
Class I = visualization of the soft palate, fauces, uvula, anterior and posterior pillars. 
Class II = visualization of the soft palate, fauces and uvula. 
Class III = visualization of the soft palate and the base of the uvula. 
Class IV = soft palate is not visible at all. 
Subjects who were unable to open their mouths due to anatomical abnormalities were classified as 
Mallampati IV. 
For the ASA Physical Status Classification System, subjects were classified as: 
ASA I A normal healthy patient 
ASA II A patient with mild systemic disease 
ASA III A patient with severe systemic disease 
ASA IV A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life 
ASA V A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation 
Treatments 
Study drug was prepared (diluted) by the site pharmacy in an IV bag to a concentration of 4 mcg/mL. 
It was infused using a controlled infusion device such as a standard intravenous infusion pump system. 
Study drug was not rapidly bloused. Sedation dosages were calculated using the subject’s most 
recently measured weight. 
Each subject was pre-medicated with glycopyrrolate prior to study drug infusion. No sedating agents 
other than DEX or MDZ were permitted during the study treatment period, including opioids and topical 
cocaine and phenylephrine that might be used for nasal mucosa vasoconstriction. 
Blinded study drug was administered as a two-stage infusion: 
• 
• 
a loading dose infusion of either DEX 1 mcg/kg administered over 10 minutes or matched PBO, 
at least 15 minutes prior to the start of topicalization procedures for the fibreoptic intubation 
a maintenance dose infusion of DEX 0.7 mcg/kg/hr or matched PBO continued through 
completion of intubation. 
The loading dose and maintenance dose ranges for this study were within the dose ranges 
recommended in the SPC for DEX. 
• 
The DEX package insert states that treatment is generally initiated with a loading dose of 1 
mcg/kg given over 10 minutes. This protocol specified that the loading dose of DEX was 1 
mcg/kg over 10 minutes. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 42/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The maintenance dose range for DEX in this protocol was 0.7 mcg/kg/hr, which is also within 
the recommended maintenance dose range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr listed in the package 
insert. 
If the subject required sedation based on an RSS score of 1, rescue doses of MDZ, 0.5 mg IV boluses 
were given. This dose could be repeated to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg to achieve and/or maintain a 
target RSS score of ≥ 2. If the subject remained inadequately sedated (RSS score = 1) with a total 
dose of 0.2 mg/kg of MDZ, at the anaesthetist’s discretion other rescue medication could be given for 
subject comfort and/or safety. The administration (dosage, total dose, and time) of supplemental MDZ 
or other rescue medication was recorded on the appropriate CRF. If a subject required rescue 
medication other than MDZ, study drug was stopped and the subject was considered a treatment 
failure. 
Topicalization 
After achieving protocol-defined sedation (RSS score ≥2), topical anesthesia in the nasopharynx, 
oropharynx, hypopharynx, and glottis was achieved using lidocaine as described below. Topicalization 
was not to begin until 15 minutes or more after the start of study drug. The following procedure for 
airway topicalization was followed: 
1. Nebulized 4% lidocaine (2 - 4 mL) was delivered over a 10-minute period using a standard nebulizer 
with oxygen 8 - 10 L/min as a driving gas. 
2. If possible, the subject gargled with 4 % viscous lidocaine (1 - 2 mL). 
3. If nasal intubation was planned, 2 % lidocaine jelly (1 – 2 mL) was placed within the nostril. 
4. Topicalization was assessed as the absence of subject discomfort when key airway landmarks were 
stimulated: 
• 
• 
For oral fibreoptic intubations: stimulation of the uvula, tongue and bilateral posterior 
pharyngopalatine fauces with a wooden tongue blade. 
For nasal fibreoptic intubations: stimulation of the posterior nares at least 3 cm from the 
anterior os with a soft-tipped swab stick in addition to stimulation of the uvula, posterior 
tongue and bilateral posterior pharyngopalatine fauces with a wooden tongue blade. 
It was anticipated that adequate topicalization and absence of a gag reflex would be evident within 15 
minutes of beginning topicalization. 
5. After insertion of the fibreoptic bronchoscope, additional doses of 2 % lidocaine in 1–2 mL aliquots 
were administered to the lower airway via the working channel of the bronchoscope. Subjects were 
asked to take slow regular deep breaths to facilitate distribution of local anaesthetic spray to the lower 
airway. 
6. The maximum dose of topical lidocaine was limited to 4.5 mg/kg. 
If a nasal intubation was planned and vasoconstriction was required, Afrin nasal spray could be 
administered. If Afrin was administered it was recorded on the concomitant medications CRF. 
Rescue Midazolam 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 43/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rescue MDZ could be administered PRN in 0.5 mg doses IV up to 0.2 mg/kg for RSS score of 1. 
Rescue MDZ requirements were documented and recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects requiring rescue MDZ to achieve and/or 
maintain proper sedation levels (RSS score ≥2 throughout the study drug infusion. 
Secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
• 
Total dose of rescue MDZ required (mg) to achieve and/or maintain target sedation levels; 
Percentage of subjects requiring additional rescue medications other than MDZ to achieve 
and/or maintain target sedation levels; 
•  Anaesthetist assessment of ease of subject care; 
•  Subject recall and satisfaction assessed 24 hours post study drug. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Ramsay Sedation Scale 
Subjects were assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) at baseline, 15 minutes after start of 
study drug and every 3 minutes thereafter during drug infusion, at the end of topicalization, and prior 
to rescue medication administration (MDZ). The target score was RSS ≥ 2. RSS criteria are as follows: 
The Ramsay Sedation Scale has been used and validated in intubated and non-intubated patients. This 
scale was also used in the pivotal clinical trials supporting the original MAA of DEX.  
Anaesthetist Assessments 
Immediately following discontinuation of study drug, prior to the scheduled surgery/procedure, the 
anaesthetist rated the ease of intubation, hemodynamic stability, and subject cooperation using Visual 
Analog Scales (VAS).

At the end of the 24-Hour Follow-Up Period, the subject was given a Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire 
so that the subject’s recall of and satisfaction with the intubation procedure could be assessed. 
Subjects rated satisfaction with the placement of the breathing tube on a scale of 0 (not satisfied) to 
10 (extremely satisfied). 
Randomisation 
In order to ensure balanced treatment allocation based on airway difficulty and physical status of the 
study subject, the randomization schedule was stratified based on both Mallampati classification (Class 
I-III vs. Class IV), and on ASA classification status (Class I-III vs. Class IV). When a subject was ready 
to be randomized, the site pharmacist obtained the subject’s Mallampati classification and ASA Class 
from the PI prior to calling the IVRS to obtain the subject’s treatment assignment. 
With the goal of enrolling a minimum of 10 subjects in ASA IV, an enrollment cap was placed on ASA I-
III subjects when the total number of ASA I-III subjects reached 90. Before the study was initiated, 
the telephone number and call-in instructions for the IVRS were provided to each site. 
Subjects who met the selection criteria were randomized by the IVRS to receive either DEX or PBO 
within 24 hours of their scheduled surgery/procedure. Subject numbers were assigned by site, 
randomization numbers were assigned by IVRS, and each randomization number was unique. 
Randomization scheme and codes (subject identification and treatment assigned) are provided in the 
dossier.  
Blinding  
This was a double-blind study. All study personnel at the site, except the site pharmacist, were blinded 
to study drug assignment. The pharmacist received the bulk study drugs, and stored the supplies in a 
secure location. The pharmacist obtained the randomization assignment from the study IVRS after a 
new subject had been identified and a medication order had been written. 
The pharmacist prepared the IVRS-assigned study drugs in identical containers. Labeling attached to 
each container identified the subject’s unique identification number and initials. The labels affixed to 
the container did not include the subject’s treatment assignment. 
The unblinding of study subjects during the trial was not allowed unless there was a compelling 
medical or safety reason [e.g., knowledge of the blinded information was necessary for treatment of a 
serious adverse event (SAE)]. The unblinded Pharmacist was responsible for the security of the blinded 
randomization codes for the study. If it became necessary to break the blind, the PI was to contact the 
unblinded Pharmacist to obtain the specific treatment assignment for the subject in question. The 
sponsor was notified as soon as possible first by phone, then by fax, regarding the necessity of 
breaking the blinded code. The PI notified the IRB, as required. Also, the date, time the blind was 
broken, and the reason for breaking the blind was documented on the subject's Case Report Form 
(CRF). 
Sample size   
The sample sis of 90 subjects (45 DEX, 45 PBO) was based on the following assumptions: 80% power,  
less than 20% of subjects in the DEX group and more than 50% of subjects in the PBO group would 
require rescue MDZ for proper sedation during the study using a Fisher’s exact test with alpha=5% 
(two-sided.

Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses were performed using a two-sided 5% significance level. The ITT population was 
used as the primary population for efficacy analyses. The PP population was used as the secondary 
population for efficacy analyses. Since there was only one primary efficacy endpoint and one primary 
efficacy analysis, no adjustment for multiple comparisons was applied. 
Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects requiring rescue MDZ to achieve and/or 
maintain proper sedation levels (RSS score ≥2) throughout the study drug infusion. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, percentages of subjects in the two treatment groups who required 
rescue MDZ to achieve/maintain target sedation levels during study drug infusion, according to RSS 
criteria, were assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Subjects who were randomized but did not receive 
any study drug were excluded from all safety and efficacy analyses. When a baseline value was 
missing prior to study drug infusion, the value obtained during the screening period was used as the 
baseline value. Otherwise, there was no imputation of missing data. 
Secondary analyses 
For the secondary analysis, the total dose of MDZ required to achieve/maintain target sedation levels 
was summarized descriptively by treatment group and differences were assessed using a one-way 
ANOVA with treatment as the factor. The number and percentage of subjects who required rescue 
medication other than MDZ during study drug infusion were summarized by treatment group and 
differences were assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  
Anesthesiologist ratings of the ease of intubation, hemodynamic stability and subject cooperation using 
Visual Analog Scales were summarized by treatment group, and assessed using a one-way ANOVA, 
with treatment as the factor. The Subject Satisfaction Questionnaires measuring the subject’s recall of, 
and satisfaction with, the intubation procedure, were summarized by treatment group and differences 
were assessed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical values and a one-way ANOVA for continuous 
variables.  
The treatment effect of DEX on the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints were also analyzed 
using the CMH test or an ANCOVA model, as appropriate, adjusted for the Mallampati classification 
(Mallampati status I-III vs. IV). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 124 subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomized, with 63 in the DEX group and 
61 in the PBO group. Eight subjects randomized to receive DEX and eleven randomized to receive PBO 
did not receive study drug, mostly because surgery was cancelled.  These subjects were excluded from 
the safety and efficacy analyses. 
55 subjects in the DEX group and 50 in the PBO group received a study drug infusion and were 
included in the safety/ITT analysis population. Only one subject (in the DEX group) who received study 
drug was excluded from the PP population. He received MDZ during study drug infusion while RSS was 
2 (rescue MDZ was to be given only when RSS <2).

Of the 105 subjects (55 DEX group & 50 PBO group) in the safety/ITT population, 51 and 46 subjects 
respectively, completed the 24-hour follow-up. In the DEX group, 1 subject had surgery cancelled for 
pre-existing, untreated hypertension (narrative provided in Section 12.3.2 of the CSR); 2 were unable 
to be intubated and had surgery cancelled; and 1 was still intubated and sedated at the time of the 24-
hour follow-up. In the PBO group, 2 subjects were lost to follow-up, 1 subject was heavily sedated and 
unable to respond at the 24- hour follow-up; and 1 was a treatment failure and received propofol.

successfully intubated (Table 9). Six (11%) subjects in the DEX group and 4 (8%) in the PBO group 
discontinued study drug infusion prematurely. The reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug 
infusion were: 
•  unable to intubate, 3 (5.5%) subjects in the DEX group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the PBO 
group, 
• 
• 
inadequate sedation by protocol allowed amounts of study drug and MDZ or required additional 
rescue medication other than MDZ: 1 (1.8%) subject in the DEX group and 3 (6.0%) subjects 
in the PBO group,  
other reasons (See narratives, CSR Section 12.3.2.2), 2 (3.6%) subjects in the DEX group and 
no subjects in the PBO group (see Figure 2 for the specific reasons). 
The protocol deviations defined prior to data unblinding included improper dosing of study medication 
and use of prohibited concomitant medication. Details of significant protocol deviations are provided in 
the study report.

Primary analysis of efficacy (ITT population) 
The ITT population was used as the primary population for efficacy analyses. The PP population was 
used as the secondary population for efficacy analyses. As the PP population was almost identical to 
the ITT population (with only one less subject in the PP population) and the analysis results from the 
PP population were the same as those from the ITT population, only efficacy results based on the ITT 
population are presented in the following subsections. The single exclusion from the PP analyses did 
not affect the trial results to any meaningful extent. The results for the primary efficacy endpoint - 
percentage of subjects requiring rescue midazolam, are presented below.  
The percentage of subjects who required rescue MDZ to achieve and/or maintain the target sedation 
level of RSS ≥ 2 during study drug infusion was significantly lower in the DEX group (47.3%)

compared to 86.0% in the PBO group (p < 0.001). When Mallampati Class was included as a covariate 
in the exploratory analysis using Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test, the results were similar (p 
<0.001) 
Secondary analyses 
Ramsay Sedation Scale 
Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) scores, assessed 15 minutes after starting study drug, were as follows. 
Midazolam total dose required to achieve and/or maintain target sedation level 
The total dose of rescue MDZ required to achieve and/or maintain the target sedation level (Ramsay 
Sedation Scale at least 2) by treatment group was as follows.  
Need for additional rescue medications other than MDZ to achieve and/or maintain target sedation 
levels 
One subject in the DEX group and four subjects in the PBO group required rescue medication other 
than MDZ (p = 0.189). Subject (109-0002) in the DEX group received propofol and suxemethonium for 
induction of anaesthesia at the same time that the subject was intubated and study drug was 
discontinued. Two subjects in the PBO group received propofol and two more received fentanyl as 
additional rescue medication for sedation during the awake fibreoptic intubation.

Subgroup Analyses 
The treatment effect of DEX on the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints were 
evaluated by the Mallampati Class subgroups (Class I-III vs. Class IV), where Class IV correlates with 
greater difficulty of intubation.

Efficacy conclusions for AWAKE trial (2005-006) 
DEX) was shown to be effective in providing and maintaining targeted sedation levels prior to and 
during awake fibreoptic intubation. The primary efficacy result showed a statistically significantly 
difference between the number of DEX and PBO treated subjects requiring rescue midazolam: 26 
(47.3%) of DEX treated subjects required rescue MDZ versus 43 (86.0%) of PBO subjects (P< 0.001). 
This was supported by the secondary efficacy results (1) that the targeted sedation level (RSS ≥ 2) 
was achieved and maintained in these DEX-treated subjects prior to and during intubation, (2) the 
mean/median total dose of rescue MDZ required in the DEX-treated subjects was significantly lower 
than that in the PBO-treated subjects (1.07/0 mg vs. 2.85/2.25 mg), (3) no additional rescue 
medications other than midazolam were required to maintain sedation in the DEX-treated subjects, 
and (4) that the post-treatment anaesthetists’ rating on ease of intubation, hemodynamic stability, 
and subjects cooperation, as well as subjects’ rating on recall and satisfaction of the intubation 
procedure for the DEX-treated subjects were similar to those for the PBO-treated subjects where the 
majority received MDZ.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Patient groups and procedures in the MAC and AWAKE studies were rather different, including 
orthopaedic, ophthalmic, plastic, vascular stents, breast biopsies, AV fistulas and excision of lesions in 
the MAC study, and awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical procedure in the AWAKE study, 
which made an additional pooled analysis unjustified.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from both pivotal studies and therefore no additional 
dosing information is provided for this population. Patients with renal impairment were allowed in both 
studies. However, a formal analysis of these patients was not performed due to the short term 
administration of the study drug during both studies. For the MAC study, the mean exposure to 
dexmedetomidine for the 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg loading dose groups was 97.0 and 102.3 minutes, 
respectively and for the AWAKE study, the mean exposure to dexmedetomidine was 37.7 minutes.

Arain et al (2002) investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 
minutes, maintenance 0.4-0.7 mcg/kg/h) vs. propofol (75 mcg/kg/min for 10 minutes, maintenance 
12.5-75 mcg/kg/min) in 40 equally randomised patients scheduled for elective surgery (majority hip or 
knee surgery, 25% hernia repair, 10% other surgery) using regional anaesthetic blockade with an 
epidural, spinal or peripheral nerve block. The targeted sedation was achieved within 10 minutes with 
propofol and within 25 minutes with dexmedetomidine. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine during 
surgery had significantly lower pain scores in the postoperative period and received less morphine. 
Patients in each group performed similarly on the psychomotor testing and met discharge criteria at 
equivalent times. The 24-h follow-up inventory of patient satisfaction revealed that the sedation for 
their surgical procedure was equally satisfactory between groups. 
Jalowiecki et al (2005) evaluated the effects in outpatient colonoscopy. 19 patients received  DEX 1 
mcg/kg over 15 min followed by an infusion of 0.2 mcg/kg/h, 21 patients received meperidine 1 mg/kg 
with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and 24 patients received fentanyl 0.1-0.2 mg on demand. In all patients, 
endoscopy was completed with adequate pain relief. The level of analgesia was similar in all study 
groups. Fentanyl was administered in nine cases in both the DEX and meperidine-midazolam groups 
and to 19 patients in the fentanyl group. The average use of supplemental fentanyl was 0.04 mg in the 
meperidine-midazolam group, which was significantly lower than that in the DEX group (0.1 mg) and 
fentanyl group (0.18 mg). The average duration of colonoscopy was longer in the DEX group compared 
to the meperidine-midazolam and fentanyl groups (13 min, 9 min, 8 min, respectively, p = 0.0038). In 
the DEX group, the time required to reach home discharge readiness was longer compared with the 
meperidine-midazolam and fentanyl groups (85 min, 39 min, 32 min, respectively, p = 0.007). 
According to the study protocol, three patients from the DEX group were admitted to the hospital for 
12-h observation because of safety concerns. The study was terminated before the planned 90 
patients had been recruited because of adverse events among patients receiving DEX, in particular 
bradycardia (to approximately 40 bpm in 2 of 19 cases) and hypotension (to less than 50% of the 
initial value in 4 of 19 patients). The authors concluded DEX compared with commonly used sedation 
regimens was associated with the frequent requirement for supplemental fentanyl, sometimes 
profound hypotension and bradycardia, and prolonged recovery time. In their evaluation side effects 
may limit its usefulness in colonoscopy. 
Brown et al (2006) retrospectively reviewed the records of 231 patients who underwent 
endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. They reported the outcomes of a subset of 14 
patients who underwent sedation with dexmedetomidine compared with 22 contemporaneous patients 
who underwent general anaesthesia.  
McCutcheon et al (2006) conducted a double-blind randomised controlled trial to compare 
dexmedetomidine with conventional therapy (a mixture of midazolam and fentanyl) in patients 
undergoing carotid endarterectomy under regional anaesthesia. They enrolled 27 patients in the 
dexmedetomidine arm and 29 patients in the standard of care arm. Dexmedetomidine was 
administered at a loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2-
0.8 mcg/kg/h. The patients in the standard of care arm received 40 mcg fentanyl and 1 mg midazolam 
in bolus followed by repeated boluses of 20 mcg fentanyl and 0.5 mg midazolam. Sedation was 
effectively titrated to RSS range 2-4 in both groups, with 98% of all recorded RSS being within the 
target range. Significantly fewer patients required interventions for hypertension and/or tachycardia in

the dexmedetomidine group (40% vs. 72%). More patients in the dexmedetomidine group required 
haemodynamic drug interventions postoperatively (44% vs. 14%), and these were primarily for 
hypotension. The number of patients requiring no additional pain relief was significantly larger in the 
dexmedetomidine group (72% vs. 38%). The time between admission to the postoperative unit and 
readiness for discharge was similar in both groups (dexmedetomidine 97.3 min vs. standard of care 
102.9 min). There was no difference in the surgeons’ rating on operational conditions. The overall 
patient satisfaction was high, and there was no difference between groups in terms of the proportion of 
patients who reported feeling some discomfort during the procedure.

Kaygusuz et al (2008) reported a double-blind clinical study with 40 randomly allocated patients to 
dexmedetomidine or propofol in combination with fentanyl during extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.  
Jense et al (2008) prospectively reviewed the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a sole 
sedative agent together with local anaesthesia in 14 patients who underwent laryngeal surgery.  
Gupta et al (2014) randomised 90 patients, 30 in each group, scheduled for elective general, plastic 
or otorhinolaryngological surgeries. At least 15 minutes before local anaesthesia, the patients received 
0.5 mcg/kg (DL) or 1 mcg/kg (DH) of dexmedetomidine, or equivalent volume of saline over 10 
minutes as a loading dose, followed by a maintenance dose beginning at a rate of 0.6 mcg/kg/h and 
titrated between 0.2-1 mcg/kg/h to a target level of sedation (RSS score 3). Any patient having an 
RSS score less than 3 received IV midazolam at a 0.02 mg/kg dose repeatedly until the target RSS 
score was achieved. Fentanyl was used for pain control in 0.5 mcg/kg boluses as necessary. 
Significantly more patients required rescue midazolam in the saline group (26 out of 30 patients) than 
the DL (17 out of 30 patients) and DH (12 out of 30 patients) groups. The total dose of rescue 
midazolam was also significantly higher in the saline group than in the DL and DH groups (3.88 mg, 
1.28 mg, 0.87 mg, respectively). The number of patients requiring rescue doses of fentanyl, as well as 
the mean rescue dose was significantly higher in the saline group compared to the DL and DH groups 
(number of patients, 25, 18, 11; mean fentanyl doses, 144.2 mcg, 84.8 mcg, 83.9 mcg, respectively). 
The targeted RSS level was achieved in a higher number of patients in the DL and DH groups 
compared to the placebo group (difference significant to placebo, non-significant between the DH and 
DL groups). Similarly, the targeted VAS score on pain, ≤ 3 on a 0-10 scale, was achieved in 
significantly more patients in the DL and DH groups compared to placebo, with a non-significant 
difference between the two dexmedetomidine groups. In the postoperative unit, sedation scores were 
significantly higher in more patients in the placebo group as compared to the DL and DH groups, and 
significantly higher in the DL group compared to the DH group. The postoperative pain score evaluated 
with VAS was under 3 in a greater number of patients in the placebo group than in the DL and DH 
groups (p = 0.0001). Similarly, a higher number of patients in the DL group achieved VAS < 3 than in 
the DH group (p = 0.003). Patient and surgeon satisfaction was better in both dexmedetomidine 
groups compared to the placebo group (p = 0.03 for patients, p = 0.06 for surgeons), and the 
differences were non-significant between the dexmedetomidine groups.  
DEX as a sole sedative agent in small diagnostic and therapeutic procedures  
ter Bruggen et al (2017) selected 35 articles for a systematic review to summarise the evidence 
from RCTs for the efficacy of DEX during small diagnostic and therapeutic procedures compared to 
other commonly used sedatives. Pain level and patient satisfaction were the primary outcomes for 
effectiveness. For IV use, the initial loading doses of dexmedetomidine ranged between 0.5-4.0 
mcg/kg for 10 minutes, with 1.0 mcg/kg over 10 minutes being the most commonly used dose (20 out 
of 29 trials, 57%). Most of the trials also included a maintenance dose of dexmedetomidine, with 
infusion rates ranging between 0.1-2.0 mcg/kg/h, of which doses 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/h were commonly 
used until the end of the procedure.  
Placebo was the comparator in seven trials, including 379 patients. Studies and main characteristics of 
these trials are presented in the table below:

DEX sedation for awake fiberoptic intubation  
Zhou et al (2016) conducted a meta-analysis on 13 RCTs (including the AWAKE study), where 
dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative for awake intubation in adult patients. The pooled patient 
population included 591 patients, out of which 285 patients received dexmedetomidine.  
Use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a higher Ramsay sedation scale score [mean difference 
(MD): 1.02, 95% CI 0.77–1.28], vocal cord movement score (MD = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.20–1.24), 
coughing scores (MD = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.10–1.22), limb movement scores (MD = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.47–
0.91).  
Another eight clinical trials is presented by the MAH, where DEX was used in awake fiberoptic 
intubation or flexible bronchoscopy since the meta-analysis by Zhou et al (2016) was published: 
Goneppanavar et al (2015) evaluated the effects of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on patient’s 
response to fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The patients received intravenously either midazolam 0.02 mg/kg 
(27 patients) or dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg (27 patients). The authors concluded that in fiberoptic 
bronchoscopy, under topical airway anaesthesia, dexmedetomidine at the 1 mcg/kg dose provided 
superior patient comfort and tolerance as compared to midazolam at the 0.02 mg/kg dose. 
Mirkheshti et al (2017) reported a study to evaluate the effects of local DEX on sedation rate and 
hemodynamic changes in candidate patients for fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation randomly allocated 
into three groups receiving intravenous dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, 31 patients), 
local dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg combined with 5 mg/kg lidocaine, 32 patients), or lidocaine alone 
(32 patients). The dose of propofol used to reach the predetermined cerebral state index before 
sedation induction was significantly higher in the control group compared to both dexmedetomidine 
groups.  
Sharma et al (2017) compared two different doses of DEX in combination with topical spray and 
airway blocks in a randomised way for awake orotracheal fibreoptic intubation in patients (n=60) 
undergoing elective cervical spine surgery with rigid cervical collar in situ. The patients received DEX 
either at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg along with airway blocks or at a dose of 1 mcg/kg along with airway

blocks. Endoscopy and intubation time, patient tolerance, vocal cord and limb movement and 
satisfaction score did not differ significantly between the groups.  
Li CW et al (2015) compared DEX-MDZ and sufentanil with MDZ for sedation for awake fiberoptic 
nasotracheal intubation in 50 patients with limited mouth opening. The scores of ease of the AFOI 
procedure, patient’s reaction during AFOI, coughing severity, tolerance after intubation, recall of the 
procedure and discomfort during the procedure were comparable in both groups.  
Chopra et al (2016) assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study a small-dose 
DEX for conscious sedation during AFOI in simulated cervical spine injury patients. DEX 1 mcg/kg over 
10 minutes was followed by maintenance infusion at 0.7 mcg/kg/h or normal saline at the same dose 
and rate. The number of patients was 50 in each group. The sedation was targeted to RSS score of ≥ 2 
during AFOI. The total number of patients requiring MDZ and the mean dose of MDZ required to 
achieve targeted sedation (RSS ≥ 2) was significantly less in the DEX group compared to the placebo 
group (p < 0.001). Similarly, patient satisfaction score, heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial 
pressure and respiratory parameters were significantly better among patients sedated with DEX (p < 
0.001). Postintubation arousability in the two groups was comparable. The authors concluded that DEX 
provided optimum sedation without compromising airway or hemodynamic instability with better 
patient tolerance and satisfaction for AFOI, while preserving patient arousability for the postintubation 
neurological assessment. 
Xu et al (2016) compared the efficacy and safety of DEX (1 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes 
followed by a continuous infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/h) versus remifentanil (with a target-controlled 
infusion to achieve a plasma concentration of 2.5 ng/ml, increased to 3 ng/ml 10 minutes later) for 
sedation during awake intubation of 68 patients. First attempt success rate, a rescue MDZ dose and 
the duration of intubation did not differ between the groups. Patients receiving remifentanil were 
significantly more tolerant of the tracheal tube. The authors concluded that both DEX and remifentanil 
are effective sedatives for awake intubation. The patients sedated with remifentanil tolerated the 
tracheal tube better after intubation with moderately increased risk of desaturation. 
Niyogi et al (2017) evaluated the efficacy of IV DEX on sedation, patient comfort and cardiovascular 
responses during AFOI in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy in a randomised, placebo-
controlled, double-blinded study in 56 adult patients. The patients received a DEX infusion at a rate of 
1 mcg/kg for the first 10 minutes followed by 0.5 mcg/kg/h or a 0.9% normal saline infusion in the 
same manner. Airway blocks with lignocaine were given to all patients before undergoing AFOI. The 
patients receiving DEX had an acceptable level of sedation (OAA/S: 20 to 17) with greater comfort and 
satisfaction (VAS: 40-60), compared to the control group (VAS: 50-90, p < 0.001).  
Hassan et al (2017) reported a randomised, double-blind study to assess whether the addition of a 
small dose of fentanyl could improve the sedative criteria of DEX during AFOI, without the need to

increase the dose of DEX which may be associated with airway compromise. Patients in three groups, 
fifty patients each, received an infusion of 1 mcg/kg of  DEX over 20 min, or 2 mcg/kg of  DEX over 20 
min, or 1 mcg/kg of  DEX added to 1 mcg/kg of fentanyl over 20 min. Among patients who received 
the 2 mcg/kg DEX loading dose, the incidence of airway obstruction was higher than in the other two 
groups. Limb movement scores were higher among patients who received 1 mcg/kg of DEX alone 
compared to the other two groups. All groups were comparable as regard to fiberoptic intubation 
scores, coughing and vocal cord opening scores. The authors concluded that adding 1 mcg/kg of 
fentanyl to DEX 1 mcg/kg can prevent the risk of airway obstruction associated with higher doses of 
DEX while achieving the same favourable intubation scores. 
2.4.1.1.  Systematic review of literature comparing procedural sedation conducted with 
dexmedetomidine or propofol, and with dexmedetomidine or midazolam 
The MAH conducted separate systematic reviews of the literature, including randomised trials in 
procedural sedations with dexmedetomidine or propofol, and with dexmedetomidine or MDZ in adult 
patient population. Studies, where dexmedetomidine, propofol or MDZ was given as part of intensive 
or critical care or where additional medication with sedative property was used were excluded. For the 
latter condition, two exceptions were made: if the additional medication was opioid and used for 
analgesia purpose as part of the standard sedation regimen (justified also with the dose), or if the 
purpose was for rescue. To characterise the efficacy, the following variables were collected: number of 
patients with successful sedation with/without rescue treatment, number of patients with unsuccessful 
sedation, duration of procedure, amount of additional analgesics used, patient satisfaction with the 
procedural sedation and with pain control, operator overall satisfaction, recovery time. 
Efficacy of sedation with dexmedetomidine versus propofol 
From the identified 290 publications in Pubmed, 130 publications in Embase database and 24 reviews 
in the Cochrane database, 19 trials met the selection criteria including 496 patients sedated with DEX 
and 501 patients sedated with propofol.  
Procedures were surgical (486 patients), diagnostic (262 patients), other procedures like 
extracorporeal lithotripsy and fibreoptic intubation (132 patients) and with healthy volunteers (117 
patients).  
In all but the healthy volunteer studies dexmedetomidine sedation was initiated with a loading dose: in 
12 studies the loading dose was 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine in 10 minutes, in the rest 0.5 mcg/kg 
over 5 or 10 minutes, or less. The maintenance doses varied between 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/h with one 
exception where doses in the range of 0.2-1.4 mcg/kg/h were used (Cho et al 2015). 
Fifteen trials reported patient numbers in terms of successful sedation with/without the use of rescue 
treatment (791 patients).

Efficacy of sedation with dexmedetomidine versus midazolam 
A total of 243 publications in Pubmed, 116 publications in Embase database and 20 reviews in the 
Cochrane database were listed after the literature search, 14 reports of which fulfilled all criteria,

including 546 and 543 patients sedated with dexmedetomidine or midazolam, respectively. The 
procedures were surgical (746 patients), diagnostic (248 patients), and with healthy volunteers (95 
patients).  In all but three trials (in a cataract surgery trial, and two trials with healthy volunteers), 
dexmedetomidine sedation was initiated with a loading dose: in 7 studies loading dose was 1 mcg/kg 
dexmedetomidine (among them in two trials up to this dose) over 10 minutes, (with one exception of 
15 minutes). In the other trials the loading dose was 0.5 mcg/kg loading dose within 10 minutes, and 
in one trial the dexmedetomidine loading dose was 0.25 mcg/kg in 5 minutes. 
Twelve trials reported patient numbers in terms of successful sedation with/without use of rescue 
treatment (994 patients).

Patients’ and clinicians’ satisfaction scores 
Of the 12 studies evaluating the patients’ overall satisfaction compared to PRO, the patients preferred 
DEX in 3 studies and propofol in 3 studies, while in 6 studies there was no significant difference in the 
scores. With regard to pain control, the patients’ preference favoured DEX in 3 studies and PRO in 1 
study, whereas the scores were not significantly different in 2 studies.  
The clinicians were more satisfied with DEX sedation during the procedure in 5 studies, with PRO in 1 
study, and neutral in 2 studies. In one of the latter two, MRI image quality was the primary variable.  
In 10 studies comparing DEX to MDZ the patients/clinicians evaluated their satisfaction with the 
procedure, and in eight studies out of 10 the patients were asked about their satisfaction with pain 
control as well.  
Regarding the patients’ overall satisfaction with the sedation during the procedure, in three studies 
DEX was preferred, and in the other seven trials there was no significant difference in the patients’ 
evaluation between DEX and MDZ. The patients’ satisfaction with pain control showed a preference for 
DEX in two studies and in the other six studies the patients did not report a difference between the two 
sedatives.  
The clinicians were more satisfied with DEX during the procedure in four studies, and did not find a 
difference in the four other studies. 
Details of satisfaction scores are summarised in Table 10.

Clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations 
MAC study 
A dose-response effect with regard to the primary endpoint was demonstrated, as fewer patients 
required rescue MDZ for sedation with the DEX 1 mcg/kg dose (45.7%) than with the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg 
dose (59.7%). The mean total dose of rescue MDZ used to achieve and/or maintain the targeted 
sedation level was lower in the DEX 1 mcg/kg group (0.9 mg, SD 1.51) than the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg 
group (1.4 mg, SD 1.69). The median time to first rescue dose MDZ was longer for the DEX 1 mcg/kg 
group (114 minutes) than for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group (40.0 minutes). The percentage of patients 
who required rescue fentanyl for pain during the infusion period was lower for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg 
group (59.0%) compared with the DEX 1 mcg/kg group (42.6%). 
There were no significant differences in the need for MDZ rescue in either dose group regarding the 
age of DEX patients when comparing either <65 years to ≥65 years or <65 years to ≥75 years. There 
was a general trend to decreased total dose MDZ rescue with increased patient age in both dose 
groups. There was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with ophthalmic surgeries when 
comparing patients <65 years to ≥65 years and the ophthalmic surgery category consistently required 
less need for rescue MDZ and less mean total amount of rescue MDZ compared to other surgery types. 
The lower need for rescue and the lower doses required for rescue with increasing age appear to be 
related to the increased proportion of a surgery subtype that requires less need for and amount of 
MDZ rescue rather than a primary age effect. 
AWAKE study 
The primary endpoint results showed that fewer patients in the DEX (47.3%) than the PBO (86.0%) 
group required MDZ for rescue sedation (p < 0.001). The mean total dose of rescue MDZ required was 
significantly lower in the DEX-treated patients (1.07 mg, SD 1.54) than in the PBO-treated patients 
(2.85 mg, SD 3.01).  
Literature 
In 16 of 19 trials with PRO as comparator a DEX loading dose was used, in 12 studies with 1 mcg/kg 
injected in 10 minutes. In four studies the loading dose was under 1 mcg/kg.

Among the trials comparing the efficacy of dexmedetomidine to MDZ 11 studies out of 12 used a 
loading dose, in seven a 1 mcg/kg dose was applied for loading. The duration of the 1 mcg/kg loading 
dose was 10 minutes in five studies, in one study the loading time was 15 min, and in one study the 
dose was defined as 0.1 mcg/kg/min, without an upper time limit. In four studies a loading dose of 0.5 
mcg/kg or less was used.

2.4.1.2.  Discussion of published efficacy studies with DEX in procedural sedation 
There is extended literature on the use of dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation. Publications differ 
in many ways, including study population, sample size, dosing protocol, and primary and other 
endpoints, which affect the value of the reported observations. In the review of the literature and the 
selection of publications, the primary aim was to present the efficacy data in the literature in a 
balanced way. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferred, as they are by nature free of 
subjective selection bias in regard to how and which publications are chosen. The fact that systematic 
reviews are already available for the proposed indication, indicates a matured publication history of 
dexmedetomidine in procedural sedation. The literature search for this application was closed on 31 
Oct 2017. Based on the literature search, two systematic reviews were conducted to compare the 
efficacy of dexmedetomidine to propofol and midazolam. Although there are published reviews in this 
regard, the aim was to present the most up-to-date data for these comparisons. 
The most recent systematic review about dexmedetomidine as sole sedative agent in procedural 
sedation has been published by ter Bruggen et al (2017). The efficacy of dexmedetomidine was 
evaluated in small diagnostic and therapeutic procedures reported from randomised controlled trials in 
comparison to placebo, propofol, midazolam and opioids. Literature search was closed at the end of 
March 2014. Surgeries belonged to ophthalmic, ear, nasal, oral, dental and gynecological procedures, 
endoscopies and awake fibreoptic intubation. The primary efficacy outcomes included patients’ 
satisfaction and pain level. The intranasal and intramuscular routes of administration and the 
paediatric use were discussed in the review but they are out of the focus of this application. Twenty 
nine adult studies with intravenous administration were identified, one of which had both intravenous 
and intranasal dexmedetomidine arms (19 and 20 patients, respectively) (Zhang et al 2013). The most 
common initial loading dose was 1.0 mcg/kg over 10 minutes (20 trials), ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 
mcg/kg. Most of the trials also included a maintenance dose of dexmedetomidine, with infusion rates 
ranging between 0.1 and 2.0 mcg/kg/h, of which doses 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/h were commonly used until 
the end of the procedure. The review stratified the studies by comparator: placebo, propofol, 
midazolam and opioids. 
Dexmedetomidine compared to placebo 
Seven trials with placebo-controlled design were identified. One in this group was the publication about 
the AWAKE study by Bergese et al (2010). Not counting the AWAKE report, four trials were in

ophthalmic surgery, the others were gastrointestinal endoscopy, and electrochemotherapy), altogether 
representing 274 patients. Patient satisfaction improved significantly in two out of three trials), 
operator satisfaction improved significantly in two out of two trials (where these variable were 
reported). The need for rescue medication was reported to be less in the dexmedetomidine arm in the 
two trials where this outcome was recorded. In three out of four trials the duration of procedure was 
shorter with dexmedetomidine (however, differences were not significant), and similar durations were 
reported in one trial.  
Dexmedetomidine compared to opioids 
Five trials were included in this comparison, representing 223 patients. Three studies reported on 
awake fibreoptic intubation procedures (including 110 patients), one on vaginal surgery and one on 
colonoscopy. Fentanyl was the comparator sedative in three studies, while remifentanil and sufentanil 
were the comparators in one study each. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher with 
dexmedetomidine in three of the four trials assessing this variable, and each of the three studies was 
conducted in awake fibreoptic intubation. Pain level was significantly lower in one out of three trials. 
There was no preference in the operators’ satisfaction in any reports. All of the five trials measured 
procedure duration, which was significantly shorter with dexmedetomidine in one, and with fentanyl in 
another study. Only one of two trials assessing recovery time showed a significantly prolonged time in 
the dexmedetomidine group.  
Dexmedetomidine compared to propofol  
Propofol was compared to dexmedetomidine in nine trials (all IV applications), including 421 patients. 
The procedures included ophthalmic surgeries (n=4), upper airway surgery, oral and nasals surgeries, 
awake intubation and upper endoscopy.. Among the seven trials reporting patient satisfaction, five 
showed significantly higher satisfaction with dexmedetomidine, and two trials reported no difference. 
In three trials, there was a significantly lower level of pain in the dexmedetomidine group. Operator 
satisfaction was recorded in two studies, in one dexmedetomidine was preferred, and no difference 
was reported in the other. Duration of procedure did not differ significantly in the seven trials 
assessing this parameter. Recovery time was significantly shorter with dexmedetomidine in one, and 
with propofol in another, among the six reports with this variable.  
Dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam 
There are 11 trials, including 714 patients, in this comparison. The trials covered four dental surgeries, 
two upper and one lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, one bronchoscopy, one ophthalmic and one 
otologic surgery, and one shockwave lithotripsy in outpatient settings. Eight trials recorded patient 
satisfaction, in four studies dexmedetomidine achieved significantly better patient satisfaction, while in 
one trial midazolam was preferred. Four trials measured patient pain scores separately, and out of 
them in one trial dexmedetomidine, and in another midazolam-fentanyl combination provided better 
pain relief; there was no difference in two trials. Operators had significantly higher satisfaction with 
dexmedetomidine sedation in two out of six trials, no preference to either sedative in the other four. 
One trial out of ten showed a significantly prolonged duration of procedure with dexmedetomidine. 
Recovery time was significantly longer with dexmedetomidine in four out of the five trials which 
reported recovery time.

Systematic review comparing dexmedetomidine to propofol and midazolam in procedural sedation 
The trials included in the systematic review represent a wide variety of procedures with ~1000 patient 
population in each comparison. Success rates of sedation with dexmedetomidine were high and 
comparable to the rates with propofol and midazolam. The duration of procedures did not differ except 
in one study in which dexmedetomidine sedation was favoured. Time to onset of sedation and recovery 
times were usually shorter with propofol and midazolam; however, only in part of the trials these 
periods were recorded. The additional analgesia use and post-procedural analgesia need were reported 
also in few studies only, with a tendency to a less need, and with longer time to the first postoperative 
analgesia demand, if sedated with dexmedetomidine. The patient and clinician satisfaction was 
reported in ~70% of the trials. The patients’ overall satisfaction was well balanced, while showed a 
tendency to prefer dexmedetomidine regarding the efficacy of pain control. The clinicians’ preference 
pointed toward dexmedetomidine sedation more often than comparators. In our overall evaluation, the 
efficacy of dexmedetomidine is comparable to propofol and midazolam, with additional benefit in pain 
control, and with slightly longer time regarding the onset of sedation and recovery. 
2.4.2.  Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations 
The MAC study included 2 DEX loading dose groups of 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg given over 10 
minutes. Each was followed by a maintenance infusion of DEX initiated at 0.6 mcg/kg/h titrated 
between 0.2 to 1 mcg/kg/h to achieve and/or maintain the desired level of sedation (OAA/S  4). The 
0.5 mcg/kg load arm was included to maintain the blindness of the study and additionally to provide a 
dosing benchmark. There were trends in the study results that favoured the loading dose of 1 mcg/kg 
over 0.5 mcg/kg. A dose-response effect with regard to the primary endpoint was demonstrated, as 
fewer patients required rescue MDZ for sedation, at a smaller dose, given later with the DEX 1 mcg/kg 
loading dose than with the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg loading dose. The percentage of patients who required 
rescue fentanyl for pain during the infusion period in the MAC study was significantly lower for both of 
the DEX groups compared to PBO (88.9%), but slightly higher for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group (59.0%) 
compared with the DEX 1 mcg/kg group (42.6%). The subgroup analyses in the MAC study also 
support the efficacy of the DEX 1 mcg/kg loading dose. No specific dosing recommendations with 
regard to age are required for efficacy. 
The dosing in the AWAKE study included a DEX load of 1 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes followed by a 
fixed maintenance infusion of DEX at 0.7 mcg/kg/h. The results from this study also support the 
efficacy of the DEX 1 mcg/kg loading dose.  
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from both studies and therefore no additional dosing 
information is provided for this population. Patients with renal impairment were allowed in both 
studies. However, a formal analysis of these patients was not performed due to the short term 
administration of the study drug during both studies.  
In the literature the 1 mcg/kg loading dose followed by 0.2-1 mcg/kg maintenance dose, in awake 
intubation followed by 0.7 mcg/kg maintenance dose is the most often applied doses for DEX in this 
indication. Compared in few trials, the 1 mcg/kg loading dose brought benefits versus lower or higher 
loading doses, i.e. in terms of patient satisfaction, comfort, more favourable OAA/S scores, or lower 
incidence in adverse effects, respectively. 
Results from MAC and AWAKE indicate that the DEX 1 mcg/kg loading dose was efficacious for 
sedation of non-intubated patients undergoing all procedures, as well as, prior to and during awake 
fiberoptic intubation. However, the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg dose may be suitable for less invasive procedures

such as ophthalmic surgery. Following the load, maintenance dosing of dexmedetomidine should 
generally be initiated at 0.6 mcg/kg/h and titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect with doses 
ranging from 0.2 to 1 mcg/kg/h. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve 
the targeted level of sedation. With regard to awake fiberoptic intubation, a fixed maintenance dose of 
0.7 mcg/kg/h was shown to be efficacious. Orion, Hospira and Abbot have not tested the efficacy and 
safety of a loading dose above 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes. 
Available data in the literature support the benefits of this dosing.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
There is no doubt that DEX is a sedative agent, like other alpha-2 agonists, as it is approved for the 
sedation of patients in the ICU setting and there is extensive clinical experience with the product. As 
such, the two pivotal trials do not address the question that is most relevant to this application, which 
is how the drug, at the proposed doses, performs in relation to standard sedation methods used for 
procedural sedation. In this clinical situation, the key desirable properties of a sedative agent include:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a fast and predictable onset of action 
the ability to titrate the dose according to clinical response so that the desired level of sedation 
can be easily achieved and maintained 
provides a quality of sedation whereby the patient is relaxed, relieved of any anxiety, but 
conscious and responsive to commands 
lack of accumulation with prolonged administration (long procedures) 
does not cause substantial respiratory or cardiovascular depression 
If a new sedative agent failed substantially on any of these criteria, the benefit – risk might be 
considered unfavourable, despite a proven greater sedative effect than placebo. A comparison with 
placebo in this situation is therefore largely meaningless. Unfortunately, the design of the trials, with a 
placebo control for the loading dose period followed by “rescue medication” with midazolam given in a 
way that is far from representative of normal clinical practice (very small doses given in widely spaced 
increments), does not allow for anything close to a direct comparison of the proposed new DEX 
regimen with standard of care sedation with midazolam. The placebo / midazolam group is 
fundamentally disadvantaged in comparison to the DEX group by the design of the trial.  
However, it is possible to conclude quite a lot about the clinical utility of DEX in the proposed new 
indication for procedural sedation without relying heavily on the comparisons with placebo / 
midazolam. The overall weight of evidence is sufficient to establish that DEX, if given at a sufficient 
dose, is sufficiently efficacious as a sedative drug to be used for procedural sedation, at least where 
only a light level of sedation is required. The loading dose of 1.0 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes was 
superior to the 0.5 mcg/kg given over the same time and 2 mcg/kg seems likely to result in 
overdosage for some patients. The loading dose of 0.7 mcg/kg used in the AWAKE study was 
associated with a need for supplemental midazolam in half of the patients so this appears to be an 
insufficient dose. 1.0 mcg/kg therefore seems to be a reasonable starting point but it seems clear that 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 88/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it will be insufficient for a significant proportion of patients. It is far from desirable to rely on a second 
agent (midazolam) to achieve sedation and it seems unimpressive that even in the high loading dose 
DEX group in the MAC study, half of the patients required rescue midazolam. The MAH has been asked 
to discuss whether dose recommendations might be revised so that adequate sedation can be achieved 
reliably and in an acceptable time frame with just DEX.  The SmPC has been updated accordingly.  
There are also issues with the maintenance dose regimen advised in the SPC (which is the same as 
that in the trial protocols). This posology seems to be insufficient in about half of the patients. The 
need for rescue midazolam in the MAC trial generally occurred late (median time 114 minutes after 
start of infusion). The MAH has discussed whether the upper recommended maintenance infusion rate 
of 1 microgram/kg/hour should be revised upwards. It is notable that the most common protocol 
deviation was provision of rescue MDZ prior to finalising the titration of DEX. Further clarification was 
provided regarding the titration procedure.  
There is no rational justification for the SmPC to recommend a lower loading dose for awake fibreoptic 
intubation than for other types of procedural sedation. This is clearly proposed because of the AWAKE 
trial protocol, but it makes no sense clinically and indeed the lower loading dose in the AWAKE trial 
appeared to be insufficient in many patients. The separate posology for awake fibreoptic intubation has 
been deleted.  
Further “real world” observational data might be obtained post approval to clarify dose requirements in 
procedural sedation, for both loading dose and maintenance.  
Finally, some analgesic effect of DEX was apparent, in line with the known pharmacology of DEX. This 
could be a significant advantage in patients for whom opioids are problematic, either for safety reasons 
(respiratory depression) or because the subject is taking an opioid antagonist (e.g. naltrexone for drug 
/ alcohol misuse). However in most patients undergoing procedural sedation it is routine and very easy 
to give suitable analgesia to cover painful procedures so an opioid sparing effect is not of great value.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
It can be concluded that DEX is efficacious as a sedative drug for procedural sedation.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of dexmedetomidine for the sedation of critically ill patients in the ICU was 
established in the original MAA and has been supplemented by the ongoing post-marketing use. Based 
on the figures presented in PSUR AR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000998/201703) covering the period 16 
March 2016 to 15 March 2017, the cumulative exposure to DEX products, Dexdor and Precedex, during 
Dec 1999 – Feb 2017 can be estimated to exceed 12 million patient days. The safety documentation in 
this variation application is focused on the proposed new indication only. Safety information in the 
initial MAA is to a large extent applicable to the new indication. However there are some important 
differences between the existing and proposed indications that require a different safety perspective. 
In particular, CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory depression that persist after the period of sedative 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 89/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
drug administration are much more important potential safety issues in the procedural sedation setting 
than in the ICU setting.  
The MAC and AWAKE studies were included in the initial 2010 MAA but only for the purpose of 
completeness of documentation and providing supporting information. The MAH has now presented the 
safety data from those studies in detail. Most safety data are taken directly from the study reports, 
however the MAH has performed a number of post-hoc additional exploratory analyses in order to 
more clearly present the study data in the Clinical Summary of Safety. 
As an established drug being used in a similar way to its existing EU approval, no new non-clinical 
studies have been performed. While procedural sedation does raise some different questions in relation 
to safety than the ICU submission, there are none for which further non-clinical work would have been 
of significant value. 
There are many studies published detailing the use of dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation but in 
size, robustness and completeness of safety data collection, the MAC and AWAKE studies are clearly 
pre-eminent. The MAH has provided full study data for both studies. It is appropriate that the 
evaluation of dexmedetomidine safety in procedural sedation should be based primarily on the MAC 
and AWAKE studies. Published studies complement the results from MAC and AWAKE studies and 
address relevant safety information outside the scope of those studies. The detail in which safety data 
are presented in published studies is frequently rather limited and thus it is to be expected that some 
arguments and conclusions presented based on original clinical trials documentation may differ from a 
MAA based entirely on published literature data, for example for Ever Pharma dexmedetomidine 
product recently approved in many EU member states. 
The MAC and AWAKE studies both included patients with a broad range of comorbidities, including 
severe systemic disease, and monitored them closely for both cardiovascular and respiratory function 
during and after the study drug infusion. AE follow-up was for 24 hours after the end of study drug 
infusion and for serious adverse events (SAEs) the period was 30 days. Other safety parameters, such 
as safety laboratory and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), were monitored to a degree appropriate to 
a drug already approved and used extensively for longer duration in critically ill patients. 
The method of dosing is an important focus in this application. The use of a loading dose (commonly 1 
mcg/kg infused over 10 minutes) was already long-established in non-EU countries and so was not 
specifically evaluated in the reports for the MAC and AWAKE studies. For the sedation of patients in the 
ICU, it is not normally necessary to achieve a rapid effect with dexmedetomidine because patients are 
commonly already sedated on another drug or under general anaesthesia. For procedural sedation a 
rapid onset of effect will almost always be needed, necessitating use of a loading dose of 
dexmedetomidine. The Applicant has thus prepared some additional analyses to explore the safety 
implications of the use of loading dose in this population of patients. 
Patient exposure 
The safety database comprises the complete study data of the individual MAC and AWAKE studies and 
a pooled database comprising baseline, exposure and AE data from the 2 studies. The study designs 
mean that there are some differences in the AE collection period (the study drug infusion was longer in 
the MAC study and a distinct PACU period was defined) and in the nature of the subjects enrolled that 
might be expected to influence the study results. Therefore the pooled data only provide supportive 
evidence to the individual studies. The same pooled database was presented in the Dexdor 2010 MAA 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 90/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
although in that application the MAC and AWAKE studies were combined with other non-ICU studies in 
many analyses. In this application all analyses of pooled data comprise only these 2 studies. With only 
2 studies, the contribution of the pooled analyses to understanding the data is quite limited. Other 
safety parameters have not been pooled: differences in study design and data collection schedules and 
the limited value of pooling only 2 studies suggest such an attempt would have been of little value. 
The number of subjects included in the safety database is summarised in Table 5. The total of 318 
subjects treated with DEX in this specific indication is sufficient to evaluate any safety issues peculiar 
to the use of DEX for procedural sedation, especially when supported by a large number of published 
studies.

The baseline characteristics of the patients in the phase III safety database are summarised in Table 6. 
The subjects were well matched between treatment groups within each study and the studies enrolled 
quite similar populations. Overall this was a predominantly middle-aged Caucasian population with 
significant systemic co-morbidity (ASA II-III), with some slight over-representation of males, which is 
probably similar to what can be expected in Europe. A meaningful number of patients with morbidity 
that is a constant threat to life (ASA IV) were also included. Close to 30% of subjects were over 65 
years old. Many subjects were receiving extensive concomitant medications, being especially 
treatments for hypertension (renin-angiotensin-system blockers, beta-blockers), diabetes and lipid 
disorders. In the AWAKE study 49% of subjects were being treated for hypertension or cardiovascular 
disease (36% of placebo subjects) and 25.5% were diabetic (placebo 18.8%). This very broad mix of 
subjects with relatively high level of comorbidity represents a good test of the safety of 
dexmedetomidine for clinical use during procedural sedation: in many cases combined local/regional 
anaesthesia with sedation is chosen in patients at higher risk from general anaesthesia.

The medical entry criteria between the 2 studies were closely aligned and relevant to the target 
population as well as the existing Dexdor SmPC. Three exclusions are worth noting: 
•  Subjects requiring a spinal or epidural were excluded. Major regional blocks such as spinal or 
epidural are associated with hypotension as a result of sympathetic blockade leading to 
vasodilation in the limbs. However this is a clinical situation in which procedural sedation is 
frequently used and will be reviewed later.  
•  Subjects potentially less able to tolerate hypotensive or bradycardic effects of 
dexmedetomidine, such as acute myocardial ischaemia, unstable angina, complete heart block, 
bradycardia or hypotension. There are comparable warnings (and contraindication in the case 
of heart block) in the EU SmPC for Dexdor and these seem appropriate to use in procedural 
sedation too. 
•  Subjects with a CNS disease involving raised intracranial pressure or cerebrospinal fluid leak 
were excluded. However such patients are unlikely to be considered suitable candidates for 
procedural sedation, and so the impact on the data can be considered minimal. 
The patients were all treated in hospital in the operating/anaesthesia room prior to surgery and with 
an anaesthetist in attendance, who was responsible for managing the sedation and for the 
identification, management and recording of AEs. This is a key element in the reliability of the safety 
data. 
The population in the MAC and AWAKE studies are representative of the target patient population and 
so support the safety assessment of dexmedetomidine in procedural sedation in adults.  
2.5.1.  Patient exposure 
In the AWAKE study DEX-treated subjects received a 1 mcg/kg loading dose administered over 10 
minutes, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.7 mcg/kg/h until successful completion of the fibreoptic 
intubation. In the MAC study DEX -treated patients were randomised to receive a loading dose of 
either 0.5 or 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion starting at 0.6 mcg/kg/h 
and titrated as required within the range 0.2-1 mcg/kg/h. These loading doses are in line with those 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 92/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used in studies reported in the literature. The upper limit of maintenance infusion rates is lower than 
that approved for ICU sedation in the EU (1.4 micrograms/kg/h) and reflects the lower doses approved 
in the USA. Most published studies of DEX in procedural sedation have employed a similar dose 
scheme. In total 134 and 184 subjects received loading doses of 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg 
dexmedetomidine respectively in the MAC and AWAKE studies.  
The duration and total dose of exposure to dexmedetomidine in the MAC and AWAKE studies is 
summarised in Table 7, along with the mean maintenance dose administered in the MAC study 
according to type of surgical procedure. More than 75% of subjects received dexmedetomidine for less 
than 2 hours and most subjects in clinical practice would not exceed this duration of treatment. The 
maximum duration in excess of 6 hours in one patient is unusual and likely to be a rare event in 
practice. The mean maintenance dose was in the range 0.49-0.7 mcg/kg/h in the MAC study and there 
is a suggestion that the mean dose used in some procedures (notably ophthalmology) may be lower, 
perhaps linked to the level of comfort or stimulation involved in the surgery. Low doses of 
dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/kg loading followed by 0.2 mcg/kg/h maintenance) have been used 
successfully in ophthalmic surgery (Abdalla et a 2006). It is of note though at least 1 patient in each 
procedure type in the MAC study received the maximum permitted maintenance dose of 
dexmedetomidine for the proposed indication.

Shows mean infusion rate of DEX after completion of the loading dose 
In the AWAKE study all patients received the same maintenance dose of 0.6 mcg/kg/h after 
completing the loading dose. 
Combining the MAC and AWAKE studies, the mean duration of exposure to DEX was 1.5 hours and in 
78% and 92.8% of patients the duration was less than 2 and 3 hours respectively. The longest 
exposure exceeded 6 hours in a single patient.

All patients received a loading dose (0.5 or 1.0 mcg/kg) of DEX over 10 minutes, making the dose per 
patient somewhat higher than the maintenance dose specified in the protocols. The shorter the 
duration of maintenance infusion the larger will be the impact of the loading dose and the maximum 
dose/hour of 6 mcg/kg/h is equivalent to stopping the infusion immediately after a 1.0 mcg/kg loading 
dose.

In both studies at least 75% of patients were ASA II or III, meaning that they had systemic disease. In 
the AWAKE study this was more often severe (ASA III, 45.5 – 52.0%) than in MAC (ASA III, 31.0 – 
38.1%). In total 31 patients (23 on DEX) had a severe systemic disease considered a constant threat 
to life (ASA IV). In MAC, the majority of patients were using at least 1 medication before the start of 
study drug infusion. Among the most common medications used prior to start of study drug were 
acetylsalicylic acid (22.4%, 20.9%, 23.8%), metoprolol (9.0%, 4.7%, 3.2%), and hydrochlorothiazide 
(8.2%, 9.3%, 7.9%), in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, DEX 1 mcg/kg group, and PBO group, 
respectively. In AWAKE, of patients receiving DEX, 49% (27/55) were being treated for hypertension 
or cardiovascular disease. Differences in cardiovascular medications between DEX and PBO groups 
respectively included beta-blockers (32.7 vs. 14.0%), calcium channel blockers (12.7 vs. 6.0%) and 
diuretics (18.2 vs. 10.0%). A history of diabetes was reported for 25.5% and 18% of DEX and PBO 
patients, respectively. 
Adverse events 
In both studies, the desired level of sedation was achieved in nearly all patients with few symptomatic 
adverse effects. In total 83.6% of dexmedetomidine-treated subjects experienced an AE either during 
the infusion, PACU or the 24 hour follow-up period compared to 71.7% placebo subjects and these AEs 
were more likely to be deemed treatment-related by the investigators.  
Fewer than 2% of events in either group were recorded as severe. The reporting of AEs was quite 
consistent between the two phase III studies with very similar overall AE incidence during study drug 
infusion between the 2 placebo groups (58.7% vs. 58.0%) and DEX 1 mcg/kg loading dose groups 
(68.2% vs. 63.6%) in MAC and AWAKE studies respectively. The incidence of AEs was highest in the 
DEX 0.5 mcg/kg loading dose group (79.9%) during the study drug infusion period in the MAC study, 
with 56% of subjects having a treatment-related AE. The overall incidence of AEs during the 24 hour 
follow-up was somewhat lower than during the infusion and was similar in all treatment groups.

All AEs reported during the study drug infusion in more than one subject in either the MAC or AWAKE 
study are shown in Table 9 and AEs during the 24 hour follow-up are in Table 10. 
Qualitatively the reported AEs reflect the known effects of dexmedetomidine and what could be 
expected from performing such procedures in the studied populations of subjects. Given the 
preponderance of ASA II-III patients an entirely uneventful perioperative period was not to be 
expected.  
During study drug infusion, the great majority of AEs reported related to protocol-defined 
cardiovascular events (especially hypotension) and respiratory depression. Hypotension (defined as 
SBP < 80 mmHg OR >30% lower than pre-study drug infusion values OR DBP < 50 mmHg) was 
reported in 47.8%, 31.8% and 27.0% of DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg and placebo subjects 
respectively in the MAC study while hypertension incidence was similar in all treatment groups 
occurring in 8.2%, 8.5% and 12.7% of DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg and placebo subjects 
respectively. Protocol-defined bradycardia was reported in 13.2% DEX 1 mcg/kg patients in the MAC 
study. In the AWAKE study hypertension was overall the most frequently reported AE, in 23.6% and 
28.0% of DEX and placebo subjects respectively. Still, hypotension was the most common AE on DEX 
in 27.3% subjects compared to 6.0% of placebo subjects.  
Protocol-defined respiratory depression (RR < 8 bpm OR > 25% decrease from baseline) was a 
common finding but not different between DEX and placebo groups in either study. In the MAC study it 
occurred in between 33.3-37.3% subjects and in 14-16.4% subjects in AWAKE. In only a small 
number of subjects this appeared to be associated with an effect on oxygen saturation. 
AEs apart from these cardiovascular and respiratory events were relatively few and without consistent 
differences between treatment groups during study drug infusion. Indeed most AE terms were 
reported for only a single patient. Single cases of ventricular tachycardia, palpitations and 
extrasystoles were reported on DEX 1 mcg/kg in the MAC study. The case of ventricular tachycardia 
was considered related to underlying coronary artery disease by the investigator: it occurred more 
than 1 hour after the start of DEX, lasted for 12 beats and no action was taken.

In the MAC study, the AEs reported during the time in PACU were somewhat comparable between 
treatment groups, with insufficient events reported to make meaningful comparisons. 
The most frequent AE during the follow-up period remained hypotension. Hypotension was recorded in 
16.3% of DEX 1mcg/kg subjects during the 24 hour follow-up in the MAC study, compared to 8.2% of 
DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and 1.6% of placebo subjects respectively. Several cases of bradycardia also occurred 
during this period in both DEX groups but not placebo. There was no difference in respiratory 
depression between the groups during this time. Subjects on placebo appeared more likely to suffer 
hypertension during follow-up (9.5% vs. 1.5% on DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and no subjects on DEX 1 mcg/kg). 
One patient (DEX 1 mcg/kg) developed a septal myocardial infarction during the follow-up period 
which was described as mild and for which no action was taken. The patient had many predisposing 
characteristics including existing ischaemic heart disease, extensive peripheral vascular disease and 
diabetes. The Dexdor SmPC advises caution in patients with such a history.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No SAEs occurred during the period of study drug infusion in either study. SAEs at other times during / 
after the trial (3 DEX, 5 MDZ/FEN) were in line with expectations for the patients and procedures 
studied. All of these SAE reports were considered unrelated by the investigators. The narratives for the 
SAEs support these conclusions although one SAE of hypotension starting 51 minutes after completion 
of dexmedetomidine infusion and lasting 55 minutes seems possibly treatment related. There were no 
deaths in either study.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
5 patients in the MAC study discontinued the study drug due to an AE; 3 of these patients were in the 
dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg loading dose group, 1 patient was in the dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg 
loading dose group, and one patient was in the placebo group. In the AWAKE study one patient in the 
dexmedetomidine group and one patient in placebo group discontinued due to an AE. The following 
table shows the AEs leading to drug discontinuation in the pooled data for the phase III studies MAC & 
AWAKE.

2.5.2.  Cardiovascular effects 
The cardiovascular effects of DEX, most notably bradycardia and hypotension, are well known and 
were extensively reviewed during the 2010 MAA. Central alpha-2 agonism leads to slowing heart rate 
and peripheral vasodilatation, whereas peripheral actions (at higher DEX concentrations) include 
vasoconstriction and slowing heart rate. The most prominent adverse effects of DEX during use in the 
ICU are bradycardia and hypotension, both. At high concentrations DEX may initially cause 
hypertension, an effect previously noted related to loading dose administration during the early ICU 
studies. In the absence of a loading dose, hypertension was not seen as a common effect of DEX in the 
ICU. At the same time, inadequate sedation during procedures may lead to pain, discomfort and 
sympathetic stimulation, resulting in hypertension and tachycardia.   
The discussion below addresses these effects in the context of procedural sedation only, where they 
will be key safety issues, rather more so than in the highly controlled ICU setting.

Both MAC and AWAKE studies had the detection, management and reporting of cardiovascular adverse 
effects as key safety objectives. To that end the protocols contained identical pre-defined thresholds 
for reporting changes in blood pressure and heart rate as AEs (Table below), regardless of whether the 
individual change was considered of clinical relevance or required treatment. Thresholds were also 
established for respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) that were similar in both 
studies. The impact of these thresholds on the interpretation of the AE data generated will be 
discussed.

RR < 8 bpm OR > 25% decrease from baseline  
SpO2 < 90% (85% in AWAKE) OR 10% decrease from baseline  
Changes in vital signs are summarised in Table 11 for the MAC study. As expected there was a 
significant reduction in blood pressure (mainly systolic) in both DEX dose groups (SBP mean -18.2 
mmHg vs. -11.6 mmHg during study drug infusion in DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and DEX 1 mcg/kg groups 
respectively) that continued into the PACU period. The reduction was greater on the lower DEX dose, 
although no formal statistical comparisons between DEX groups were performed. Such changes started 
during the loading dose, although most change occurred after that time (Figure 1). The blood pressure 
reduction was associated with reduced heart rate that was similar in both dose groups. Similar effects 
have been demonstrated previously in many settings. Xu et al (2016) found mean SBP to be 10 mmHg 
lower at the end of a loading dose infusion of 1 mcg/kg, very similar to the change recorded on 
remifentanil in the same study, along with mean heart rate that was 7 bpm lower than mean baseline.

Figure 2. 
Systolic blood pressure change from baseline during the first 30 minutes of dosing in the 
MAC study 
Source: m5.3.5.3 Additional analyses for procedural sedation, Figure 1 
Blood pressure and heart rate changes were less marked in the AWAKE study, perhaps because the 
process of fibreoptic intubation remains quite unpleasant, even with accompanying sedation. In 
addition, the mandated pre-treatment with glycopyrronium to reduce oral secretions probably also 
mitigated against reductions in heart rate during DEX treatment. There is some baseline imbalance in 
systolic blood pressure that complicates the interpretation of this variable in AWAKE. 
Some reduction in blood pressure and heart rate is to be expected on instituting effective sedation in a 
nervous or anxious patient awaiting surgery, so only a part of the change is likely attributable to DEX. 
Baseline values were taken in the operating room and so consequently may be higher than patients’ 
usual resting values. Changes in the placebo group will also be affected by rescue midazolam.

Despite the large number of cardiovascular AEs reported, only a minority of such patients received any 
specific treatment (Table 12) indicating that investigators considered most changes not of clinical 
importance. Hypotension is ordinarily treated either with fluid or small bolus of a vasopressor such as 
ephedrine, whereas bradycardia responds to anticholinergic therapy such as glycopyrronium or 
atropine. The use of such treatments is very common in anaesthesia and sedation practice. In clinical 
practice the practitioner will normally continuously balance the fluid and DEX infusion rates and 
verbally stimulate the patient to provide optimal sedation and cardiovascular stability, with judicious 
use of a vasopressor when needed.

Bradycardia was much less prominent than hypotension in both MAC and AWAKE studies, with only 
very few patients receiving anticholinergic treatment (none of the 12 bradycardia events on DEX 0.5 
mcg/kg in MAC received treatment). The lower incidence of protocol-defined bradycardia during study 
drug infusion at 1 mcg/kg loading dose in AWAKE (7.3%) compared to the same dose in MAC (13.2%) 
may reflect the unpleasant nature of awake intubation. 
Hypertension was not identified as a clinical problem in procedural sedation, with a higher incidence on 
placebo than DEX in both studies. Even so, DEX can cause hypertension in some patients and users 
should consider this possibility when managing such events, especially if the patient appears 
adequately sedated. 
The incidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular adverse effects should be put in context with other 
studies and with usual sedative care. Both midazolam and propofol cause hypotension. The systematic 
reviews conducted by Orion found no difference in the reported incidence of hypotension in studies 
comparing DEX with midazolam (8.7% vs. 11.4% respectively) or those comparing DEX with propofol 
(9.3% vs. 8.9% respectively). In a study of DEX (0.5 mcg/kg loading, 0.4 mcg/kg/h maintenance) vs. 
midazolam (2 mg, single bolus) in 200 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair (Mishina et al 2017), 
hypotension and bradycardia occurred in 8 and 14 of 99 DEX-treated patients respectively (2 vs. 8 of 
97 midazolam patients respectively) using similar thresholds as the MAC and AWAKE studies. Liao et al 
(2012) found that hypotension incidence (SBP < 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure MAP < 60 
mmHg) was not different between DEX and midazolam (6.1% vs. 7.1% respectively) in 198 post-
thoracotomy patients undergoing transnasal bronchoscopy. In the same study, bradycardia occurred in 
13.1% DEX patients vs. 4.0% midazolam patients (p = 0.04, Chi-square) although the threshold for 
bradycardia was reported as < 60 bpm, which is unusually high. Finally, a Cochrane review (Lewis et al 
2015) of alpha-2 agonists in prevention of post-operative shivering found no major cardiovascular 
complications and that the increased rate of hypotension and bradycardia with DEX were controllable 
with ephedrine or atropine. Both Liao and Mishini studies reported no increase in the incidence of

Page 105/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypertension on DEX compared to midazolam, using the same absolute threshold as in the MAC and 
AWAKE studies (SBP >180 mmHg). 
Some episodes of hypotension were recorded in dexmedetomidine subjects during and after leaving 
PACU. Ephedrine use was recorded in 7 subjects in the DEX 1 mcg/kg group after the end of the 
infusion, although it is not possible to determine whether this was before or after leaving the PACU. 
The finding emphasises the need to maintain close monitoring until signs of blood pressure or heart 
rate effects of dexmedetomidine are fully recovered. 
The SmPC for Dexdor already records that patients with pre-existing bradycardia, hypotension, 
ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or severe neurological disorders should be treated 
with caution because of cardiovascular effects and these warnings seem appropriate also for 
procedural sedation. In addition, hypotension appeared more likely in elderly patients receiving a 
loading dose for procedural sedation in the MAC and AWAKE studies. Protocol-defined hypotension 
increased progressively from 32.6% in patients 65 years to 62.1% in patients >75 years old in the 
MAC study, although the number of very elderly patients was relatively few. Such an increased risk 
was not observed in the ICU population and so it is proposed that users should consider using a lower 
dose of DEX during procedural sedation in elderly patients. The concomitant use of DEX with spinal 
anaesthesia was not found to increase the risk of hypotension compared to other modes of sedation in 
2 meta-analyses (Niu et al 2013, Abdallah et al 2013), although the risk of bradycardia was increased, 
stressing the need for close monitoring of these patients.  
There were no consistent 12-lead ECG changes observed in the phase III studies. Both MAC and 
AWAKE studies enrolled a significant proportion of patients with extensive systemic morbidity and thus 
many abnormalities could be seen at both baseline and follow-up, but without indication of DEX-related 
effects (except on heart rate). The studies did not use central reading or measure conduction intervals. 
Overall, the MAH considers that cardiovascular effects of DEX are well defined and readily managed in 
patients undergoing procedural sedation. The incidence of clinically relevant hypotension appears to be 
similar to that of midazolam and propofol, although bradycardia is more frequent on DEX. Contrary to 
earlier data in ICU patients, DEX does not appear to induce clinically significant hypertension at the 
proposed dose during procedural sedation.  
2.5.3.  Respiratory effects 
Respiratory depression is a common adverse effect of continuous IV sedation with most available drugs 
in procedural sedation. Inadequate respiration may occur as a consequence both of central respiratory 
depression and failure to maintain the upper airway. The MAC and AWAKE studies therefore monitored 
respiratory rate (RR) and SpO2 closely and established thresholds for the reporting of respiratory AEs. 
Mean changes in RR and SpO2 were slight in all treatment groups in both studies. RR reduced in the 
MAC study by -1.0/min, -1.2/min and -1.0/min in the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg and placebo 
groups, respectively, during the study drug infusion. The change from baseline was statistically 
significant in all 3 groups but there was no difference between groups. Small increases in mean SpO2 
during both DEX and placebo treatment are presumed to reflect administration of supplemental oxygen 
(mandatory in AWAKE, optional in MAC) rather than any change in respiratory function. 
The use of both relative and absolute thresholds for reporting respiratory AEs led to reporting of 
respiratory depression AEs in approximately one third of patients in all 3 treatment groups in the MAC 
study, but a high proportion were due to changes in RR that remained above the clinically relevant 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 106/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limit of 8/min. Indeed the incidence of clinically relevant respiratory depression using the absolute 
criteria (either RR < 8/min or SpO2 < 90%) was significantly higher on placebo than in either DEX 
dose group (Table 13). The difference may be related to the effects of higher doses of midazolam and 
fentanyl received by placebo patients. As with cardiovascular variables, baseline was established in the 
operating room when a degree of tachypnoea was likely in many patients (the mean was around 
16/min, maximum was 30/min) and so frequent reductions in RR were to be expected with the 
introduction of effective sedation. For this reason, the number AEs of respiratory depression in the 
MAC and AWAKE studies may be misleading about the extent of respiratory depression actually 
observed in those studies, and specifically the effect of DEX on the respiratory system.

* p-value <0.05 based on Pearson Chi-square test comparing each DEX arm versus the placebo arm 
In the systematic reviews conducted by Orion, the reported relative incidence of hypoxia on DEX was 
similar in studies comparing DEX with midazolam (5.0% vs. 7.5% respectively) but significantly less in 
studies comparing DEX with propofol (3.8% vs. 16.5% respectively, p < 0.001). Several published 
meta-analyses have also addressed this question. Barends et al (2017) found no difference in the 
incidence of hypoxia in procedural sedation trials between Dex and midazolam. In an analysis of trials 
comparing DEX with propofol in gastrointestinal endoscopy (Nishizawa et al 2017) there was no 
significant difference in the risk of developing hypoxia between the treatments, although there were no 
hypoxia events in 162 DEX-treated patients but 16/164 patients with hypoxia on propofol. In contrast, 
an analysis of 13 trials in awake fibreoptic nasal intubation (Zhou et al 2016) found significantly fewer 
hypoxia events on DEX (31/161 patients) compared to alternative sedation (63/164 patients). 
Among individual published trials presented in the Summary of Clinical Safety, several reported the 
incidence of hypoxia or respiratory depression using objective criteria. 
There were significantly fewer hypoxia events on DEX vs. remifentanil (5.9% vs. 26.5% respectively, p 
= 0.021) in the study of awake intubation using a Shikani optical stylet (Xu et al 2016). A very similar 
incidence of respiratory depression to the MAC study, and using the same thresholds, was seen in 
patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair (Mishina et al 2017). Respiratory depression was reported in 
36/99 DEX patients, significantly less than in midazolam-treated patients (50/97 patients, p=0.03). 
Using an absolute threshold of SpO2 <90% for >30 seconds as a measure of hypoxaemia, 14.1% of 
dexmedetomidine patients and 18.2% of midazolam patients developed hypoxaemia during 
bronchoscopy (Liao at al 2012), which was not significant (although SpO2 was significantly lower on 
MDZ when measured during bronchoscopy).

Like other sedative agents, deeper sedation with DEX can lead to narrowing of the upper airway. In 50 
patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy (Yoon et al 
2016), the degree of upper airway narrowing was related to depth of sedation and there was no 
difference in the pattern of airway obstruction on DEX compared to propofol, although episodes of 
desaturation were significantly more common on propofol. In contrast, an artificial airway was more 
often needed on propofol than DEX patients, in a retrospective cohort study in children with OSA (35% 
vs. 12%, p=0.06, in propofol and DEX patients respectively) (Mahmoud et al 2009). 
The concomitant use of midazolam or fentanyl with DEX did not significantly increase the risk of 
respiratory depression on DEX in the MAC study, although this should be considered when adding 
other sedative or analgesic drugs with recognised respiratory depressant effects. 
Respiratory depression is relatively common during procedural sedation but should normally be readily 
managed by anaesthetists and others experienced in sedation and airway management. Comparative 
data on DEX are not consistent but many studies have found a lower degree of respiratory depression 
on DEX than other sedative regimens. 
2.5.4.  Recovery from sedation 
The speed of recovery was examined in the MAC study by assessing the time to achieving an Aldrete 
score of 9-10. A high Aldrete score (maximum score 10) requires patients to be cooperative with 
stable cardiovascular and respiratory measures and there was no significant difference between the 
DEX groups and placebo. In healthy volunteers effects on blood pressure and heart rate persisted for 
several hours after ending a 4 hour infusion, although measurable cognitive effects recovered more 
rapidly (Yatabe et al 2016). There was little difference in the speed of recovery following 
gastrointestinal endoscopy after DEX compared to propofol or midazolam (Demiriran 2007, Wu Y et al 
2015). These findings suggest that patients can be expected to have quite normal cognitive function by 
the time that cardiovascular effects are completely resolved and that recovery practices and 
expectations for other sedatives should apply also for DEX. Advice for return to normal activities is 
considered in Section 2.5.5.4.9.  
Yatabe et al 2016 looked at the acute cognitive effects of dexmedetomidine in healthy volunteers to 
measure the time to recovery of cognitive function following administration of DEX in outpatient 
settings and to provide specific guidance to clinicians. A loading dose of 6 mcg/kg/h (1 mcg/kg) 
dexmedetomidine was administered over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.4 
mcg/kg/h for a total of 4 hours. Cognitive function was evaluated before the infusion and at 2, 4, 6, 
and 8 hours after the start of infusion. A brief computerised test battery consisting of 5 tests 
(CogHealth, Japanese edition) was administered. Response speed, consistency and accuracy of 
response were measured for the following domains: psychomotor function, attention, visual memory, 
working memory and visual attention function. 
Aggregate scores across all of the 5 domains were obtained. Response speed at 2 hours and 4 hours 
after infusion started was significantly lower than baseline values (92 ± 8%, p < 0.0001; 93 ± 6%, 
p < 0.0001). Consistency was also significantly lower at 2 hours and 4 hours after infusion start (96 ± 
7%, p = 0.0009; 96 ± 5%, p = 0.0003). However, response accuracy during infusion remained 
unchanged relative to the pre-infusion values (Figure 3).

In contrast to haemodynamic parameters most of which were still statistically significantly lower at 8 
hours after the start of the infusion (4 hours after infusion end, Figure 4), cognitive function was back 
to baseline level at 2 hours after the end of infusion.

Wu Y et al. 2015 compared propofol vs. DEX in a procedural sedation trial. Discharge was delayed in

Demiraran et al 2007 studied patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The average 
time to full recovery and the number of patients able to carry out independent transfers was found to 
be similar between the DEX and MDZ groups. There were also no differences in the number of patients 
who recovered at the 15, 30 and 45 minute time points between the two groups (Table 27).

Fan et al 2013 in a study of 60 patients found all patients treated with DEX and MDZ were ready for 
discharge at 30 mins after completion of dental surgery. 
2.5.5.  Laboratory findings 
The effects of DEX on routine biochemistry and haematology laboratory tests were investigated in 
earlier studies, based on much more prolonged exposure in a critically ill population. In the procedural 
sedation phase III studies the exposure was necessarily short and so no new safety findings were to be 
expected compared to the review in the 2010 MAA. The only notable finding in the safety laboratory 
tests was a significant increase in serum glucose compared to baseline, that appeared to be larger in 
patients with a history of diabetes (Orion post-hoc analysis). Alpha-2 agonists are known to reduce 
insulin secretion, which is probably at least partly related to alpha-2 mediated inhibition of beta cells 
(Angel et al 1988). Given the assumed mechanism for this effect, the serum glucose increases are 
likely to be short-lived after the DEX infusion is stopped and to be of no clinical significance. 
2.5.6.  Safety in special populations 
The impact of sub-populations on the safety of DEX was evaluated in depth in the 2010 MAA and no 
specific guidance was developed for different sub-populations of patients based on demographic 
factors. There is no reason to consider that any subgroups would be inherently at greater risk from 
DEX treatment during procedural sedation, or that there would be important new sub-groups not 
addressed in the earlier approval. However the use of a loading dose represents an important change, 
necessitating some reanalysis of subgroups. 
Elderly 
AEs in the pooled database of phase III studies are displayed in Table 28 according to different age 
groups. In the DEX group it appeared that the frequency of protocol-defined hypotension increased 
with age occurring in 47.0% vs. 71.2% vs. 72.4% of patients in ≤65 years, >65-75 years and >75 
years groups, respectively. This increase was not reflected in the placebo group. 
No other events on DEX appeared to follow an age-related pattern of incidence. In the placebo group 
the proportions of patients with tachycardia (19.3%) in the ≤65 years group was higher than in the 
>65-75 years (9.1%) and >75 years (12.5%) groups, although there were few patients in the older 
age groups. 
The frequency of protocol-defined hypotension appeared to increase with age on DEX treatment, 
occurring in 47.0% vs. 71.2% vs. 72.4% patients in up to 65 years, 65-75 years and > 75 years groups 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

respectively in the pooled phase III data, without a similar change in the placebo group. The number of 
hypotension events also appeared higher in the elderly during the first 15 minutes after starting the 
infusion, suggesting some of the increased risk was related to the loading dose. The finding should be 
interpreted with a degree of care since the number of patients in the older age groups becomes more 
limited, making the confidence in the size of the difference weak. Also, this predominantly reflects 
changes from baseline rather than the occurrence of hypotension in need of treatment and the number 
of patients receiving treatment for hypotension in these studies was too low to support more detailed 
analysis. Still, it is wise to consider whether a lower dose would be appropriate when treating an elderly 
patient. 
There were no indications of age-related effects for other AEs and neither race nor gender appeared to 
affect the safety of DEX in procedural sedation. An analysis of the MAC study did not show any greater 
risk for AEs in patients receiving anti-hypertensive drugs, predominantly beta-blocks and renin-
angiotensin system blockers. 
Spinal or epidural anaesthesia 
The MAC and AWAKE studies excluded patients having spinal or epidural anaesthesia but this 
represents a relevant clinical situation where DEX can be expected to be used in clinical practice. There 
are many published studies combining DEX with spinal anaesthesia and most patients tolerate the 
treatment well. Although both DEX and spinal anaesthesia cause hypotension and bradycardia, the risk 
of hypotension was not found to be increased in a meta-analysis (Niu et al 2013), although there was 
an increased risk of bradycardia. The risk may be further increased in the elderly (Hong et al 2012). 
The combination of DEX with spinal anaesthesia appears safe provided patients are closely monitored 
and well hydrated.  
Obstetric use 
A number of studies have administered DEX to patients during caesarean section. As with all sedative 
agents, such administration will lead to foetal exposure to dexmedetomidine, although so far no 
adverse effects on the foetus have been observed. In the DEX-09-08 and DEX-11-06 studies 
dexmedetomidine was administered to newborn infants (as early as 28 weeks gestation) without 
specific safety concerns. The use of DEX at the time of caesarean section is likely to be in combination 
with general or spinal anaesthesia and so caution is needed in case of additive adverse effects. 
Experience of the use of DEX during earlier pregnancy is very limited and no specific guidance can be 
given. Overall the administration of DEX during pregnancy is not recommended and should only be 
undertaken if the benefit to the patient is considered to outweigh the potential (partly unknown) risks. 
Apart from MAC and AWAKE, data are presented in a wide range of different patient groups and 
procedures, suggesting that there are no specific uses for which the safety of DEX would constitute 
particularly high risk, provided it is administered under appropriate conditions of monitoring by 
appropriately qualified professionals.

2.5.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There are no drug interaction studies performed specific to this application and neither are there 
significant new interaction risks related to procedural sedation. In the 2010 MAA it was concluded that 
the interaction risk for DEX is low and most drugs commonly used in patients undergoing surgical and 
diagnostic procedures are also common in an ICU environment. 
Addition of midazolam or fentanyl to DEX treatment in the MAC study identified only a modest increase 
in AEs, mostly respiratory depression, which was to be expected given the known adverse effects of 
those drugs. A similar effect could have been expected in the placebo group but very few placebo 
patients did not receive midazolam. 
The analysis of patients with and without pre-operative antihypertensive drug use did not suggest any 
clinically relevant increased risk for cardiovascular instability. There was no increase in the risk of 
bradycardia despite many such patients receiving beta-blockers.

2.5.8.  Overdose, abuse and medication errors 
There is little additional data from post-marketing surveillance on overdose, abuse or medication 
errors since the 2011 approval of Dexdor in the EU. DEX does not appear to be associated with 
intentional abuse or intentional overdose. In those cases of accidental overdose, involving multiples of 
the intended dose (including giving the drug undiluted), patients have suffered predominantly 
bradycardia, hypertension, respiratory depression and deep sedation as anticipated. 
As in the ICU, procedural sedation ordinarily takes place in a closely regulated hospital environment, 
so significant medication errors can be expected to be uncommon. The use of a loading dose slightly 
increases the risk for error, simply because of the increased complexity, but still should not be a 
challenge for personnel experienced in providing sedation. Errors of dilution or of calculating the 
infusion rate are equally relevant to any drug given by continuous IV infusion. A further potential 
source of medication error is of failing to turn the infusion rate down at the end of the loading dose: 
close monitoring of the patient (see Section 2.5.5.4.9) should identify such a mistake rapidly. 
2.5.9.  Dose considerations 
The dosing scheme of dexmedetomidine in procedural sedation is necessarily different to that for ICU 
sedation. In the ICU, most patients who receive DEX have already been receiving another sedative 
drug or general anaesthesia and therefore there is not generally a need for a rapid onset of action. In 
this setting a loading dose is not normally needed and thus the benefits of the rapid onset do not 
justify the associated AEs. In procedural sedation a rapid onset of effect is generally needed and so a 
loading/bolus dose is standard practice with established sedative agents. The loading dose is well 
established for DEX in this indication and for some short procedures a subsequent maintenance 
infusion has not been required. 
A loading dose has been used in almost all published studies of IV DEX in procedural sedation and in 
all those studies discussed in this application. While 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes is the most typical 
loading dose, many studies have used 0.5 mcg/kg or even less, and some have given the infusion 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018  
Page 114/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
faster (over 5 minutes) or slower (over up to 20 minutes). The maintenance DEX dose has also been 
somewhat variable, often starting at around 0.6-0.7 mcg/kg/h, but frequently lower, especially where 
the sedative need is considered lighter. While the maximum DEX continuous dose for ICU use in the EU 
is 1.4 mcg/kg/h, in the USA (and in many other territories at the time of the published studies) it 
remains at 0.7 mcg/kg/h and this is likely to have been an important determinant for the dose 
selection in many existing procedural sedation studies. 
The use of a loading dose of DEX in procedural sedation studies is supported by the available data. 
Aside from the clinical need for a more rapid action, the loading dose is not the main driver of the 
cardiovascular effects of DEX. In the combined MAC and AWAKE studies only 9.2% patients had 
protocol-defined hypotension within the first 15 minutes (during and after the loading dose infusion) in 
patients receiving DEX 1 mcg/kg loading dose. The incidence of hypertension during this same period 
was very similar (8.7%) and not different to the incidence on placebo. Important changes in heart rate 
were uncommon during this time, protocol-defined bradycardia occurring in only 2.7% patients.  
The typical dose of 1mcg/kg loading followed by around 0.7 mcg/kg/h (with range between 0.2 to 1.0 
mcg/kg/h), as used in the MAC and AWAKE studies, appears to be a good standard approach. The 
dose was effective and only 7% of patients had treatment-related hypotension that required a 
vasopressor during the DEX infusion (although some patients will continue to need a vasopressor 
during PACU). Bradycardia sufficient to require treatment was uncommon (3.1% DEX 1 mcg/kg 
patients) and responded rapidly to anticholinergic treatment. Health care professionals experienced in 
anaesthesia and sedation are very familiar with the identification and treatment of such events since 
hypotension at least is a common adverse effect of other sedatives. 
This proposed dose schedule appears suitable for most patients. The combination of the MAC and 
AWAKE studies includes patients who will have both quite challenging and unpleasant procedures and 
those for whom stimulation is limited. Still, there are situations where alternative dose schedules may 
be considered. 
The smaller loading dose (0.5 mcg/kg) did not actually provide an improved safety profile in the MAC 
study. This may be partly because the majority of adverse effects are related to the maintenance 
infusion rather than the loading dose, but might also reflect that peripheral vasoconstriction at higher 
concentrations of DEX will tend to counteract hypotension, despite deeper sedation. Nevertheless it 
may be prudent to select a lower dose when treating patients considered at higher risk, for example 
older, frail patients. 0.5 mcg/kg is the only smaller loading dose for which adequate data are available 
so, although some clinicians have reported using even lower doses, there is insufficient data to 
recommend this. Some limited experience exists on the infusion of the loading dose over a longer 
period to reduce the risk of AEs. In study 3005010, presented in the 2010 MAA, patients admitted to 
ICU after coronary artery bypass received the 1 mcg/kg loading dose over either the usual 10 or 20 
minutes. There was some reduction in the speed of blood pressure change with the slower infusion but 
no change in the reporting of cardiovascular AEs. Such an approach can be considered in individual 
patients but may not generally be of value and might exceed the time available for establishing 
sedation in many clinical situations.  
There is no available data on the use of maintenance DEX infusions >1 mcg/kg/h or loading dose > 1 
mcg/kg over 10 minutes in procedural sedation and such doses cannot be recommended.

2.5.10.  Safety monitoring 
The MAC and AWAKE studies were both performed in a hospital operating room environment with an 
anaesthetist continuously present. There are many different clinical environments where procedural 
sedation might be performed and some minimum standards are needed to ensure that patient safety is 
maintained. These relate to the facilities, the operator and the level of patient monitoring and are not 
specific to dexmedetomidine. 
The requirements for clinical facilities have been described in a number of publications (e.g. 
Calderwood et al 2014) and include equipment for maintaining patient airway and ventilation, oxygen 
supply, suction and other resuscitative equipment. 
The adverse effects of dexmedetomidine, and other intravenous sedatives, are readily managed by 
experienced professionals. Dexmedetomidine sedation should be administered only by a professional 
trained in airway and continuous IV sedation management and in the identification and treatment of 
events such as hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory depression. That person should be dedicated 
to the sedation management and not involved in other tasks such as assisting with or performing the 
procedure itself.  
The appropriate level of monitoring is determined by the condition of the patient and the nature of the 
procedure, and the following is intended as a minimum standard. Users should monitor the level of 
sedation regularly. This particularly involves maintaining verbal contact with the patient when possible. 
Continuous cardiac monitoring is the most effective method to identify bradycardia and should be used 
in all patients treated with dexmedetomidine. Regular measurements of blood pressure, ideally using 
an automated sphygmomanometer, should also be performed in order to identify hypotension or 
hypertension that may need treatment. The use of respiratory monitoring is not consistent. SpO2 
should be monitored in all patients but hypoxaemia is not a reliable monitor for respiratory depression, 
especially when supplemental oxygen is provided (a routine practice for many users). Regular verbal 
contact contributes to respiratory monitoring but capnography may be appropriate for situations where 
the sedation operator is not able to directly see patient ventilation (for example because of equipment 
such as magnetic resonance imaging). Close respiratory monitoring would also be appropriate during 
deep sedation: although this should not normally be a target for dexmedetomidine it may be relevant 
if high doses of other sedatives or opioid analgesics are given concomitantly. Close observation of the 
patient should continue for at least an hour after the dexmedetomidine infusion is discontinued, as a 
number of episodes of hypotension were reported during this time in the MAC study. 
The level of continuous monitoring during sedation for procedures is the subject of multiple guidelines 
or published standards but without complete consensus. See the review by Sheahan et al (2014) for 
further discussion. 
Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation will be discharged home on the 
same day and the same precautions that are applied to other IV sedation agents should be applied to 
dexmedetomidine use. Patients should remain under medical supervision for at least a further hour 
after completing close monitoring, or longer if the effects of dexmedetomidine are persistent and it is 
good practice to ensure that patents are discharged with a suitable responsible third person after 
receiving sedation. It is difficult to give firm rules for a return to normal activities, including driving or 
other hazardous tasks and the operator should provide personalised information according to the 
patient’s condition, comorbidities and circumstances according to usual practice. Such advice should 
also extend to other drugs with sedative effects and alcohol. The cognitive effects of DEX had a shorter 
duration than cardiovascular effects in healthy volunteers but still the period of caution should extend 
longer than the measureable effects of dexmedetomidine.

Adverse event data from the literature 
Xu et al (2016) compared the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine versus remifentanil for 
sedation during awake intubation[8] in a RCT in 68 patients aged 18-70 years, ASA I–III. The DEX 
group received a loading dose of 1.0 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 min followed by a continuous 
infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg while the remifentanil (REMI) group received a target-controlled infusion of 
remifentanil (initial target 2.5 ng/ml, increased to 3ng/ml after 10 minutes).

Data are given as number (proportion, %). Baseline values of SBP, DBP and SpO 2 were used to define AEs. 
Hypotension was defined as SBP < 80 mmHg, DBP < 50 mmHg or SBP decreased ≤ 30% below baseline values. 
Hypertension was defined as SBP > 180 mmHg, DBP > 100 mmHg or an SBP increased ≥ 30% higher than baseline 
values. Bradycardia was defined as HR < 45 min−1 or a decrease to ≤ 30% below baseline. Tachycardia was 
defined as HR 120 min−1 or an increased 30% higher than baseline values. Hypoxia was defined as SpO 2 ≤ 90% or 
a decrease by 10% of the baseline saturation 
Lewis et al (2015) published a Cochrane Database systematic review on alpha-2 adrenergic agonists 
for the prevention of shivering following general anaesthesia[9]. Four studies systematically evaluated 
bradycardia and hypotension and these are summarised in Table 32. In all cases DEX was given in 
conjunction with general anaesthesia. No major cardiovascular complications were reported. There was 
no mortality reported.  
More bradycardia and hypotension occurred in the DEX group, either at a single dose of 1.0 mcg/kg or 
a loading dose of 1.0 mcg/kg followed by a maintenance infusion. Hypotension and bradycardia were 
controllable with ephedrine and atropine and no clinically important haemodynamic derangements 
occurred.

The systematic reviews comparing the clinical efficacy of dexmedetomidine with midazolam or propofol 
in procedural sedation also recorded the reported frequency of hypotension and hypoxia (as an 
indicator of respiratory depression). Note that the studies included may have used a variety of 
definitions or other criteria to assess the presence of hypotension and hypoxia.

There was a high level of variability in the reporting of hypotension and hypoxia between studies for 
both the midazolam and propofol systematic reviews. The incidence of reported hypotension was 
similar for dexmedetomidine, midazolam and propofol (ranging between 8.7 to 11.4%). Hypoxia was 
reported in 3.8% and 5.0% of dexmedetomidine patients, 7.3% midazolam patients and 16.5% 
propofol patients. 
Respiratory events 
The majority of patients having AE respiratory depression in the MAC study were the result of meeting 
the protocol-defined threshold for relative change from baseline (<25% reduction) in respiratory rate. 
In the table below it can be seen that the number of patients meeting the absolute criteria for either 
respiratory rate or SpO2 was very much lower, and significantly less for both DEX groups than placebo. 
During the study drug infusion such cases of absolute respiratory depression occurred in 3.7% vs. 
2.3% vs. 12.7% of DEX 0.5 mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg and placebo groups respectively.

Barends et al 2017 in systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 (dexmedetomidine vs. midazolam) 
procedural sedation trials detected no difference in the incidence of respiratory events between the two 
groups. 20 hypoxia events were reported in 281 dexmedetomidine-treated patients, compared to 24 
events among 280 midazolam-treated patients (p = 0.52). 
Nishizawa et al 2017 in a meta-analysis of gastrointestinal endoscopy trials also did not identify any 
significant difference in the incidence of hypoxia between dexmedetomidine and propofol treated 
groups: –0.080 (95% CI: –0.178 to 0.018; p = 0.11) (Figure 6). Hypoxia was reported in 5 out of the 
6 studies included in this meta-analysis.

(propofol or midazolam or general anaesthesia) groups. 
Zhou et al 2016 in a meta-analysis of 13 trials of awake fiberoptic nasal intubation found that DEX 
was associated with a lower incidence of hypoxia during awake intubation (relative risk 0.32, 95% CI 
0.15–0.70) (Figure 7). The control drugs used in the trials included remifentanil, propofol, midazolam, 
sufentanil and fentanyl.

Mishina et al (2017)[10] conducted a single-blind RCT in 200 patients undergoing inguinal hernia 
repair with local anaesthesia, assigning patients to either DEX (0.5 mcg/kg loading dose then 0.4 
mcg/kg/h maintenance infusion) or midazolam (2 mg, single bolus) sedation.  The AEs reported are 
shown in Table 36. The criteria for respiratory depression were very similar to those in the MAC and 
AWAKE studies and showed a similar incidence of respiratory depression; however this occurred 
significantly more frequently on midazolam. Hypotension and bradycardia were more common on 
dexmedetomidine than midazolam.

Liao et al (2012) randomised 198 patients undergoing transnasal flexible bronchoscopy in the ICU 
after thoracic surgery to DEX (up to 1 mcg/kg loading over 10 minutes, then maintenance infusion 
starting at 0.5 mcg/kg/h) or MDZ (2 mg bolus with further 1 mg as required) along with supplemental 
oxygen by nasal cannula. The mean SpO2 was significantly lower at 5 minutes after the start and at 
the end of the bronchoscopy procedure in midazolam-treated patients. SBP and HR were significantly 
lower on dexmedetomidine at the same time-points. The AEs recorded, along with definitions applied, 
are presented in Table 37.

Yoon et al 2016[11] studied 50 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea undergoing drug-induced 
sleep endoscopy, and found the degree of upper airway narrowing aggravated according to the 
sedation depth for both DEX and propofol. Partial or total obstruction of all the evaluated areas was 
consistently seen in all patients regardless of the drug. The minimal SpO2 was significantly lower 
following propofol treatment than following dexmedetomidine treatment (p = 0.004). SpO2 < 90% and 
SpO2 < 80% were significantly more common during propofol than during dexmedetomidine (p = 
0.032 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
Ma et al 2012 studied 60 adults with obstructive sleep apnoea. DEX was associated with fewer airway 
events (events with airway obstruction score of 1, 2 and 3: 29/1/0 vs. 18/9/3; p < 0.01) and less 
respiratory depression (0 vs. 6 hypoxia events; p < 0.05) compared to propofol.

Post marketing experience 
Much of the evidence provided in this application was already available at the time of the 2010 MAA, 
indeed the MAC and AWAKE studies had already formed the basis for approval of dexmedetomidine for 
procedural sedation in the USA and other countries at that time. There are many relevant published 
studies since that time which have contributed to the breath of evidence but have not raised significant 
new safety concerns. 
The cumulative exposure to DEX products Dexdor and Precedex during December 1999 – August 2017 
can roughly be estimated to exceed thirteen million patient days. The number of individual case safety 
reports received from December 1999 to October 2017 is 2921; these reports include altogether 4732 
adverse reactions, 2466 of which are serious and 2266 non-serious. The most commonly reported 
events are hypotension, and bradycardia, presenting about 15 % and 14 % of all the events reported. 
Post-marketing AE data from December 1999 to October 2017 
PSURs, addendum reports and a line listing were presented in the 2010 MAA for Dexdor. The PSUR 
cycle is currently annual. There is no systematic method to separate reports related to procedural 
sedation use of DEX from ICU or other uses.  
The number of these reports is 2921, of which 1267 are serious and 1654 are non-serious. They 
include altogether 4732 adverse reactions, of which 2466 are serious and 2266 non-serious. The most 
commonly reported events are hypotension reported 707 times and bradycardia reported 660 times. 
Hypertension has been reported 145 times. Pregnancy has been included in 196 reports, drug 
administered to a patient of inappropriate age 179 times and off-label use 152 times. Cardiac arrest 
has been included in 123 reports, pyrexia in 88, drug ineffective in 83, apnoea in 50 and tachycardia in 
50 reports. ASTincreased has been reported 62 times, ALT increased 40, vomiting 40, hyperthermia, 
nausea, drug interaction and agitation 37 times each and respiratory depression 36 times. 
The most commonly reported AEs arising from the spontaneous ICSRs are in line with the clinical study 
AE data and the data described in the Dexdor EU Summary of Product Characteristics sections 4.4 and 
4.8. In addition to the safety issues discussed in the proposed Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC), no new safety signals can be identified from the post-marketing data. 
In conclusion post-marketing adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting has not identified new potential 
risks of dexmedetomidine of particular relevance to use in procedural sedation. 
2.5.11.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety information in the initial MAA is to a large extent applicable to the new indication, and the 
relatively short duration of procedural sedation also limits the concern for potential safety issues. No 
deaths were reported in the pivotal studies. No SAEs occurred during study drug infusion while 3 
events occurred during the 24 hour follow-up period and 6 events between 24 hours and 30 days 
follow-up. All the SAEs were assessed as causally not related to the study treatment. However one of 
the events was hypotension during the recovery period in a vulnerable patient with end-stage renal 
disease; the conclusion of non-causality seems questionable. 
There are some important differences between the existing indication for the sedation of critically ill 
patients in the ICU, and the proposed indication for procedural sedation that require a different safety 
perspective. In particular CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory depression that persist after the period 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018 
Page 124/142 
 
 
 
  
of sedative drug administration are much more important potential safety issues in the procedural 
sedation setting than in the ICU setting where such things are routine and easily dealt with.  
The evaluation of dexmedetomidine safety in procedural sedation is based primarily on the MAC and 
AWAKE studies, which both included patients with a broad range of comorbidities, including severe 
systemic disease. Patients were monitored closely for both cardiovascular and respiratory function 
during and after the study drug infusion. However, the comparison with the comparator group is not 
with a placebo but with sedation using a protocol directed regimen of midazolam +/- fentanyl. This 
regimen did not represent “standard of care” as the start of dosing with active sedation was delayed at 
least until the end of the placebo loading dose infusion, and midazolam was given very slowly in 0.5mg 
dose increments separated by depth of sedation evaluations. This is not the way midazolam is used for 
procedural sedation in normal clinical practice and hence a direct comparison of the safety profiles of 
DEX and standard of care midazolam for procedural sedation is not possible.  
The main safety issue for DEX is its well-known cardiovascular effects. Hypotension was reported in 
48% and 32% for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg loading dose groups respectively in the MAC 
study (vs. 27% for MID/FEN). This inverse dose-response relationship seems plausible, as 
vasoconstriction seen at higher concentrations of DEX, would tend to counteract hypotension, despite 
deeper sedation. The magnitude of the effects of DEX on systolic and diastolic BP, both during the 
procedure and during recovery, were very substantial. In fit, healthy people, hypotension of the 
magnitude of the observed mean values is not likely to be of major concern, but in patients with 
cardiovascular disease there is the potential to cause major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Furthermore, some patients such as the elderly, hypertensive or frail, may have much greater BP falls 
than the mean values. It is clear that safe use of DEX will require careful patient selection and the use 
of vasoconstrictors and chronotropic agents as required. In most cases this should be readily 
manageable but it presents a significant added complication in anaesthetic management and has the 
potential to be associated with adverse outcomes. 
The exclusion of subjects requiring a spinal or epidural blocks is a limitation of the safety database as 
there is clearly the potential for an additive effects of DEX and spinal / epidural blockade on 
sympathetic blockade and hypotension. As DEX has more of a sympatholytic effect than other sedative 
drugs it seems quite likely that the combination would be inadvisable for routine procedural sedation in 
patients with spinal or epidural blocks. Appropriate SPC advice to advise against use in such patients 
should be added to SmPC section 4.4.  
DEX is sometimes said in the literature not to cause respiratory depression but this is clearly not true. 
There are no particular concerns with regard to respiratory depression however, the frequency and 
extent of which appears to be broadly similar to sedation with midazolam.  
Time to recovery was approximately twice as long for DEX as for placebo / midazolam in the MAC 
study. It is noted that midazolam itself is far from a short acting agent in comparison with for example 
propofol and remifentanil. This is perhaps not per se a safety issue as the patients will be monitored by 
trained HCPs in a recovery room until they are fit to leave, but it is a major issue for the clinical utility 
of DEX as an agent for procedural sedation. It seems unlikely for example to be a suitable choice for 
situations where a reasonably rapid recovery from sedation is desired, such as day case procedures.  
The method of dosing is an important focus in this application, for both safety and efficacy. The use of 
a loading dose is new to the proposed indication for procedural sedation as it is not normally necessary 
to achieve a rapid effect with DEX in the ICU as patients are normally already sedated. For procedural 
sedation a rapid onset of effect is required, necessitating use of a loading dose of DEX. A loading dose 
of 1 mcg/kg infused over 10 minutes is recommended in the proposed SmPC and seems to be 
reasonably established in non-EU countries where the procedural sedation indication has been 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018 
Page 125/142 
 
 
  
approved for a number of years. The smaller loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg did not show an improved 
safety profile in the MAC study; if anything the low DEX 0.5 mcg/kg loading dose seemed to be 
associated with more AEs than the high DEX 1.0 mcg/kg loading dose.  Considering the lack of a clear 
dose-response relation for adverse events, there seem to be no clear safety grounds for 
recommending a lower loading dose than 1.0 mcg/kg. There are no available data on the use of 
loading doses > 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes in procedural sedation and the MAH concludes that such 
doses cannot be recommended.  
The draft SmPC recommends the maintenance infusion to be generally initiated at 0.6 
microgram/kg/hour and titrated to achieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 
microgram/kg/hour, adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation. This is as per the MAC study 
protocol. There are no available data on the use of maintenance DEX infusions >1 mcg/kg/h in 
procedural sedation and the MAH concludes that such doses cannot be recommended. This is a shame 
as there seem to be clear indications that a maintenance DEX infusion rate of 1 mcg/kg/h was 
insufficient to maintain adequate sedation for long procedures (> 1 hour) in a significant proportion of 
patients in the MAC study.  
2.5.12.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of DEX can be accepted for an indication in procedural sedation. There are some 
issues, in particular the well-known cardiovascular effects and the slow recovery time but these are 
manageable in a suitable hospital setting with monitored anaesthetic care and are not considered to be 
blocking issues.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The objective of procedural sedation is to provide comfort and relief of anxiety during diagnostic, 
surgical and other procedures such as endoscopy, wound care, reduction of fractures and dislocations, 
radiological examinations, vascular access procedures, endovascular procedures, minor surgery, and 
cardioversion. It follows that the target population for procedural sedation in general is very diverse, 
spanning the entire age spectrum and with variable severity of complicating conditions and 
comorbidity. The duration of a diagnostic/surgical procedure may vary from minutes to hours. Usually 
the objective is to achieve a minimal reduction in conscious level but no loss of consciousness. Patients 
undergoing procedural sedation are expected to be able to breathe independently, and to maintain

their airway without intervention. Depending on the type of procedure, analgesia may be a 
supplementary requirement. In some situations amnesia is a desirable additional effect of sedation, 
especially for procedures that can be unpleasant but need to be repeated regularly (e.g. GI 
endoscopy).  
Procedural sedation is not always restricted to an environment where full anaesthetic equipment is 
available (e.g. operating theatre) but may take place also in other settings, such as in a radiology 
department or an endoscopy clinic. This is in contrast to the currently approved indication for sedation 
of adult Intensive Care Unit patients. Procedural sedation may be administered by a specialist 
anaesthetist, by a non-anaesthetist physician, or by a non-medically qualified healthcare professional. 
Procedural sedation provides different safety challenges compared to ICU sedation. Patients are not 
intubated and so have an unsecured airway. The onset of effect needs to be rapid, sedation may be 
conducted under less-stringent monitoring conditions, sometimes by non-anaesthetists, and patients 
may be discharged home soon afterwards, depending on the type of procedure concerned. It is a pre-
requisite, supported by a number of guidelines, that IV sedation with agents like dexmedetomidine is 
conducted only in adequate facilities that have equipment for monitoring, suction, oxygen 
supplementation, ventilatory support and resuscitation. Sedation should only be performed by a 
suitably trained health care professional, not involved in the surgery or procedure, and not by a lone 
operator. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Respiratory depression is the major undesirable effect of most agents (benzodiazepines such as 
midazolam, IV anaesthetic such as propofol, short acting opioids such as fentanyl) currently used for 
procedural sedation. Over sedation with benzodiazepines and opioids leading to respiratory depression 
has been reported to be the most common cause of death or permanent brain damage in this clinical 
situation (especially when operator administered). 
Propofol has undesirable side effects of hypotension, apnoea, airway obstruction, and consequent 
oxygen desaturation, especially when co-administered with an opioid. Propofol is only suitable for use 
by an anaesthetist. Opioids are the agents of choice for treating pain, and short acting opioids may be 
an agent of choice for certain procedures such as awake fibreoptic intubation, where they have the 
important advantage of attenuating airway reflexes. However opioids used as the sole sedative agent 
are liable to cause respiratory depression so again are suitable for use only by an anaesthetist for this 
purpose.  
A short acting benzodiazepines, in particular midazolam, is widely considered to be the agent of choice 
for procedural sedation that is administered by a healthcare professional other than an anaesthetist. 
This is because the therapeutic index is less narrow in terms of respiratory depression. As 
benzodiazepines do not have analgesic effects, supplementation with an opioid is required for painful 
procedures. Respiratory depression remains an important complication of procedural sedation with a 
benzodiazepine. 
Ketamine can be used as a sole agent or as an adjunct (especially in combination with a 
benzodiazepine), and differs from the aforementioned agents in several aspects, including its 
dissociative CNS effects and analgesic properties.  
The use of DEX for awake fibreoptic intubation in a patient with a potentially difficult airway was 
specifically studied in a separate trial. This is an extremely stimulating procedure that may be 
associated with large haemodynamic changes. To attenuate this response, blunting of the airway

reflexes is required without losing the cooperation of the patient. A successful awake fibreoptic 
intubation requires an anaesthetist experienced in this technique, attenuation of airway reflexes (by 
topical anaesthesia of the airway +/- systemic drugs), and a sedated yet cooperative patient. The most 
common complications of this procedure are hypoxia and gastric content aspiration.  
It can be agreed that there is an unmet need for a sedative agent for procedural sedation that causes 
less respiratory depression than currently available agents, especially in high-risk patients (difficult 
airway, obese, very sick, elderly). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence of efficacy for the proposed new indication comes primarily from two phase III 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies MAC (2005-005) and AWAKE (2005-
006), in in non-intubated patients requiring sedation. These two trials are supplemented with an 
extended review and analysis of literature. The MAC and AWAKE studies are the same studies that 
another company, Hospira, used to obtain approval of Precedex for the same indication in the USA in 
2008 and in a number of other countries. The clinical study reports (CSRs) of these studies were 
submitted in the 2010 MAA for Dexdor in ICU sedation, but were not discussed in detail at that time 
since an indication for procedural/awake sedation in non-intubated patients was not sought in that 
application. Both of these studies are now presented in detail to support this variation application to 
add the indication for procedural/awake sedation in non-intubated patients.  
The MAC study (2005-005) evaluated dexmedetomidine for sedation under the control of an 
anaesthetist in 326 patients undergoing surgery under local or regional anaesthesia. It was conducted 
at 26 sites in the USA and enrolled a broad range of patients scheduled for a variety of elective 
surgical procedures including orthopaedic, ophthalmic, plastic, vascular, breast biopsies and excision of 
lesions. Subjects received a loading dose of study drug administered over 10 minutes (DEX 0.5 
mcg/kg, DEX 1 mcg/kg, or placebo). The maintenance infusion was then initiated at DEX 0.6 
mcg/kg/hr for all subjects randomized to receive DEX; and PBO for all subjects randomized to receive 
PBO. It could be titrated according to clinical response within the range 0.2 to 1.0 mcg/kg/hr. After 15 
minutes of infusion of randomised study drug (DEX or PBO) “rescue” midazolam (MDZ) could be given 
if necessary, in incremental 0.5 mg IV doses, to achieve the necessary level of sedation. Fentanyl 
could also be administered to provide analgesia. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects 
not requiring MDZ for rescue sedation based on achieving and/or maintaining an OAA/S sedation score 
≤ 4. 
The AWAKE study (2005-006) evaluated dexmedetomidine for awake fibreoptic oral or nasal intubation 
prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure in 105 patients expected to be difficult to intubate. It was 
conducted at 17 sites in the USA. Subjects received a loading dose of study drug administered over 10 
minutes (DEX 1 mcg/kg, or placebo). The maintenance infusion was then initiated at DEX 0.7 
mcg/kg/hr for all subjects randomized to receive DEX; and PBO for all subjects randomized to receive 
PBO. It could NOT be titrated according to clinical response. Instead, after 15 minutes of infusion of 
randomised study drug (DEX or PBO) “rescue” midazolam, in incremental 0.5 mg IV doses, could be 
given if necessary to achieve the necessary level of sedation. Fentanyl could also be administered to 
provide analgesia. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects requiring rescue MDZ to 
achieve and/or maintain proper sedation levels (RSS score ≥2 throughout the study drug infusion.

In the primary efficacy analysis, the percentage of subjects not requiring MDZ for rescue sedation 
based on achieving and/or maintaining an OAA/S ≤4 throughout the study drug infusion period was 
40.3% for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg group, 54.3% for the DEX 1.0 mcg/kg and 3.2% for the PBO group. 
The p values for the comparisons of active vs. PBO were <0.001 for both DEX groups.

Published studies 
Some supportive evidence is also provided from published studies and a recent systematic review 
(without meta-analysis) of RCTs.  The data were variable due to the methodological heterogeneity of 
the trials (clinical situations, dose protocols etc) but in general evidence of sedation and pain relief was 
broadly consistent with the findings of the MAC and AWAKE trials.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The design of the MAC and AWAKE phase III trials, using placebo (saline) in the control arm with 
midazolam as rescue medication to ensure adequate sedation could be achieved for all patients. This 
apparently was agreed between a previous MAH for DEX (Hospira) and the FDA. However the design of 
these trials lacks the possibility to compare sedation with Dexdor to that achieved with a standard 
agent such as midazolam. This is a major weakness in the data package.   
Demonstrating superiority to placebo is considered inadequate for the purpose of this application. It is 
necessary to establish that DEX has sufficient efficacy for it to be recommended as a valid therapeutic 
option for the proposed clinical use. There is no requirement for it to be superior or even equivalent to 
existing methods (e.g. midazolam) but the MAH is required to demonstrate that DEX has the efficacy 
expected of a sedative agent intended for procedural sedation, preferably as a sole agent, 
supplemented as necessary with an opioid analgesic.  
As such this pivotal trial is conceptually fundamentally flawed. The design does not allow for a direct 
comparison of the DEX regimens with a standard sedation method (midazolam). Some comparisons 
can be made with the PBO control group, which received sedation with midazolam but only after at 
least 15 minutes of placebo infusion and at a much slower rate of administration (0.5mg incremental 
doses) than would be normal in clinical practice. The differences between DEX and placebo treatment 
groups in the dose of administered midazolam rescue medication seem small. It seems likely that the 
design of the study and the constraints of the trial protocol may have led to relative under-dosing with 
midazolam in the PBO group. Furthermore, the study would have been functionally unblinded to a very 
substantial extent. For these multiple reasons it is considered unreliable to make comparisons between 
the DEX and PBO treatment groups, except for the very obvious and rather unhelpful conclusion that 
dexmedetomidine has more sedative effect than normal saline.  
About half of patients in the DEX groups in both trials required rescue midazolam to achieve the 
desired level of sedation. This does not inspire confidence that DEX can reliably achieve the desired 
effect as a procedural sedative, but it is not clear to what extent this might be the case in clinical 
practice. Certainly some patients in the MAC trial were given rescue midazolam instead of attempting 
to up-titrate the infusion rate of DEX.  
The trial design also makes it difficult to scrutinise claims that DEX has an advantage over other 
available sedation methods in terms of better ability of the sedated patient to co-operate with verbal 
instructions.  
The review of the published literature cannot fully address these uncertainties.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No unexpected safety issues have been identified from the evaluation of the proposed new indication. 
The relatively short duration of procedural sedation also limits the concern for potential safety issues.  
The percentage of patients who had AEs was 84% in the combined DEX groups compared to 72% for 
placebo / rescue. For treatment related AEs the numbers were 53% vs. 28%. No deaths were reported 
in the pivotal studies. No SAEs occurred during study drug infusion, and while three events occurred 
during the 24 hour follow-up period and six events between 24 hours and 30 days follow-up, all were 
assessed as causally not related to the study treatment.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018 
Page 135/142 
 
 
 
  
Hypotension was an extremely common reported AEs, as expected from the pharmacological 
properties and known safety profile of DEX. Hypotension was defined as SBP < 80 mmHg OR ≤30% 
lower than pre-study drug infusion values OR DBP < 50 mmHg.  Bradycardia (HR < 40 bpm OR ≤ 30% 
lower than pre-study drug infusion values) was also common.   
The incidences of respiratory depression in the MAC study were 37% (DEX 0.5mcg/kg loading), 34% 
(DEX 1.0mcg/kg loading) and 33% (placebo / midazolam).  
The median times to recovery and readiness for discharge from the post anaesthetic care unit in the 
MAC study were 29 minutes (DEX 0.5mcg/kg loading), 25 minutes (DEX 1.0mcg/kg loading) and 14 
minutes (placebo / midazolam).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The evaluation of dexmedetomidine safety in procedural sedation is based primarily on the MAC and 
AWAKE studies, which both included patients with a broad range of comorbidities, including severe 
systemic disease. Patients were monitored closely for both cardiovascular and respiratory function 
during and after the study drug infusion. However, the comparison with the comparator group is not 
with a placebo but with sedation using a protocol directed regimen of midazolam +/- fentanyl. This 
regimen did not represent “standard of care” as the start of dosing with active sedation was delayed at 
least until the end of the placebo loading dose infusion, and midazolam was given very slowly in 0.5mg 
dose increments separated by depth of sedation evaluations. This is not the way midazolam is used for 
procedural sedation in normal clinical practice and hence a direct comparison of the safety profiles of 
DEX and standard of care midazolam for procedural sedation is not possible. 
It is expected that patient characteristics such as age, cardiovascular comorbidity, and/or concomitant 
baseline medication could be relevant risk factors, but the data does not identify that. Elderly patients 
were included in the studies but they are relatively few. The number of patients was insufficient for 
detailed analyses of subgroups.  
Although all SAEs were assessed as causally not related to the study treatment, one was hypotension 
during the recovery period (in a vulnerable patient with end-stage renal disease) so the determination 
of this event as not causally related to DEX seems questionable. 
An important practical aspect of procedural sedation is rapid recovery, allowing as early discharge from 
PACU and hospital (e.g. following day-case surgery) as possible. The data indicate that DEX is 
expected to have a prolonged recovery period compared to e.g. propofol, due to its pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic properties.  
The exclusion of subjects requiring a spinal or epidural blocks is a limitation of the safety database as 
there is clearly the potential for an additive effects of DEX and spinal / epidural blockade on 
sympathetic blockade and hypotension. As DEX has more of a sympatholytic effect than other sedative 
drugs it seems quite likely that the combination would be inadvisable for routine procedural sedation in 
patients with spinal or epidural blocks. Appropriate SPC advice to advise against use in such patients 
has been added to SmPC section 4.4.  
There is not a clear dose-response relation between different doses and adverse reactions. While DEX 
consistently lowered blood pressure there was no apparent dose-response with the two dosage levels 
used in the MAC study. The incidence of hypotension during the early high-dose infusion period did not 
appear to be related to the ASA status, and thus the overall health status of the patients. There was a 
tendency that hypertension increased with age, but apparently with little difference between the dose 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018 
Page 136/142 
 
 
 
  
groups. The lack of a clear dose-response relation for adverse events raises further questions 
regarding the dosing regimen and not well described PK/PD relation in the submitted data. 
There are no available data on the use of loading doses > 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes or on the use of 
maintenance DEX infusions >1 mcg/kg/h in procedural sedation. The MAH concludes that such doses 
therefore cannot be recommended. This is a shame as there seem to be clear indications that a 
maintenance DEX infusion rate of 1 mcg/kg/h was insufficient to maintain adequate sedation for long 
procedures (> 1 hour) in a significant proportion of patients in the MAC study. The MAH was asked 
review any available post-marketing or published data in patients who received a higher maintenance 
infusion rate than recommended in the current draft SmPC and discuss the possibility of using higher 
doses where needed. The responses were satisfactory. It is agreed that there are insufficient data to 
support higher loading or maintenance dose than those proposed. Instead there is a recommendation 
to give additional analgesia or sedatives (e.g. opioids, midazolam or propofol) if increased depth of 
sedation is necessary.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
General procedural sedation (MAC study) 
It is not in doubt that DEX was more effective than placebo in this trial. That was very obviously going 
to be the case as DEX is a currently approved sedative drug. The differences between DEX and placebo 
groups in the dose of rescue MDZ needed were modest. 
It seems unimpressive that even in the high dose DEX group, half of the patients required rescue 
midazolam. The dose regimen advised in the SPC is the same as that in the trial protocol. This 
posology seems to be insufficient in about half of the patients. The need for rescue midazolam 
occurred late (median time 114 minutes after start of infusion). This seems to suggest that a higher 
maintenance infusion rate might be required in some patients to maintain adequate sedation levels for 
long procedures. Unfortunately there are no safety or efficacy data with a higher maintenance infusion 
rate. 
It misleading to state (as the MAH does) that there were no significant differences between groups in 
the time to recovery and readiness for discharge from the PACU. Time to recovery was approximately 
twice as long for DEX as for the PBO group. For the low dose and high dose DEX groups separately the 
difference from placebo both just fail to reach statistical significance (p = 0.068 and p = 0.076 
respectively) but for the combined DEX groups the difference would certainly be highly statistically and 
clinically significant.  
Overall however it can be concluded that DEX was effective as an agent for procedural sedation, at 
least for short procedures and with the possibility to supplement with midazolam. The main concerns 
and uncertainties in the first round related to dose. The need for supplemental midazolam after one 
hour or longer in about half of patients dosed in accordance with the draft SPC section 4.2 seems to 
suggest that a higher upper limit for the infusion rate may be necessary. This concern was raised in 
the first LoOI and was satisfactorily addressed in the MAH’s responses, in particular by adding a 
statement that: “Additional analgesia or sedatives (e.g. opioids or midazolam, propofol) are 
recommended in case of painful procedures or if increased depth of sedation is necessary.” This is 
satisfactory and addresses the concern that DEX alone was not sufficient in a proportion of cases. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/391935/2018 
Page 137/142 
 
 
 
  
Using two drugs to achieve sedation when one could suffice (i.e. midazolam) is not ideal and might 
unnecessary complexity, but if there is a good reason to choose DEX, there is no reason why this plus 
a small amount of supplementary opioid, midazolam or propofol would not be a satisfactory sedation 
method. 
An analgesic effect of DEX was quite convincingly seen although in practice the opioid sparing effect is 
rather unimportant. Otherwise the design of the trial does not allow for a meaningful comparison with 
midazolam for aspects such as quality of sedation with regard to maintenance of communication.  
DEX caused substantial adverse cardiovascular effects, in particular hypotension & bradycardia. These 
are manageable by an anaesthetist in a fully monitored environment but are likely to present an 
unacceptable hazard for procedural sedation administered by a non-anaesthetist. The draft SmPC 
states “Dexdor should be administered only by health care professionals skilled in the anaesthetic 
management of patients in the operating room or during diagnostic procedures”. Crucially this 
restriction refers to “anaesthetic management” which seem sufficient to restrict use to appropriately 
skilled personnel. In some countries “nurse anaesthetists” administer anaesthetics under the 
supervision of a medically qualified anaesthetist and in such situations the nurse anaesthetist would 
have the necessary competencies to administer Dexdor for procedural sedation.  
AWAKE study 
The study has achieved statistical significance on the primary endpoint but the conclusion that DEX 
produced more sedation than placebo is no basis for concluding that it is adequately effective for the 
studied clinical use. In fact the opposite seems to be true for many patients. About half in the DEX 
group required rescue MDZ to achieve a very light degree of sedation (RSS score of 2, “co-operative, 
oriented and tranquil”). The difference between DEX and PBO groups of 0.4 points on the 6 point RSS 
seems rather small. The adequacy of the effect of the DEX loading dose in achieving procedural 
sedation for awake fibreoptic intubation is therefore questioned.  
A big problem for this trial is the fixed dose of both loading dose and maintenance infusion of DEX. 
Sedative drugs have a dose – response for both their primary PD activity and their undesirable effects, 
in particular cardiovascular and respiratory depression. DEX is no exception. They therefore need to be 
titrated according to individual clinical response. The AWAKE trial is conceptually flawed because if tells 
us very little about whether DEX can reliably provide sedation as the sole agent for awake fibreoptic 
intubation. A failure rate of 47% as seen in this study seems unacceptable. It is to be expected that a 
higher success rate could be achieved with a more appropriate flexible dose regimen that allowed for 
higher infusion rates as required to achieve adequate sedation. Unfortunately, the design of this trial 
does not enable us to get any information on what the range of those dose requirements might be. 
Importantly, it also does not establish whether DEX as a single agent can reliably achieve the 
necessary sedation with acceptable safety. It might be that at the higher doses of DEX necessary to 
achieve adequate sedation, safety might become more problematic. For awake fibreoptic intubation 
the main concern would be respiratory depression before the airway could be secured.  
In conclusion in the first round, CHMP concluded that the AWAKE trial does not provide sufficient 
evidence of efficacy for uses as a sole agent for sedation for awake fibreoptic intubation. This was 
raised as a Major Objection in the first LoOI but was satisfactorily addressed in the MAH’s responses. 
In particular, the MAH proposed to add a statement that: “Additional analgesia or sedatives (e.g. 
opioids or midazolam, propofol) are recommended in case of painful procedures or if increased depth 
of sedation is necessary.” This is satisfactory and addresses the concern that DEX alone was not 
sufficient in a proportion of cases. As with the wider procedural sedation indication, using two drugs to 
achieve sedation when one could suffice (i.e. midazolam) is not ideal and might unnecessary

complexity, but if there is a good reason to choose DEX, there is no reason why this plus a small 
amount of supplementary opioids, midazolam or propofol would not be a satisfactory sedation method.

Safety 
The safety information in the initial MAA is to a large extent applicable to the new indication, but there 
are some important differences between the existing indication for the sedation of critically ill patients 
in the ICU, and the proposed indication for procedural sedation, that require a different safety 
perspective. In particular CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory depression that persist after the period 
of sedative drug administration are much more important potential safety issues in the procedural 
sedation setting than in the ICU setting where such things are routine and easily dealt with.  
The main safety issue for DEX is its well known cardiovascular effects. Hypotension was reported in 
48% and 32% for the DEX 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg loading dose groups respectively in the MAC 
study (vs. 27% for MID/FEN). This inverse dose-response relationship seems plausible, as 
vasoconstriction seen at higher concentrations of DEX, would tend to counteract hypotension, despite 
deeper sedation. The magnitude of the effects of DEX on systolic and diastolic BP, both during the 
procedure and during recovery, were very substantial. In fit, healthy people, hypotension of the 
magnitude of the observed mean values is not likely to be of major concern, but in patients with 
cardiovascular disease there is the potential to cause major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Furthermore, some patients such as the elderly, hypertensive or frail, may have much greater BP falls 
than the mean values. It is clear that safe use of DEX will require careful patient selection and the use 
of vasoconstrictors and chronotropic agents as required. In most cases this should be readily 
manageable but it presents a significant added complication in anaesthetic management and has the 
potential to be associated with adverse outcomes. 
DEX is sometimes said in the literature not to cause respiratory depression but this is clearly not true. 
There are no particular concerns with regard to respiratory depression however, the frequency and 
extent of which appears to be broadly similar to sedation with midazolam.  
Time to recovery is seen to be approximately twice as long for DEX as for placebo / midazolam in the 
MAC study. It is noted that midazolam itself is far from a short acting agent in comparison with for 
example propofol and remifentanil. This is not per se a safety issue as the patients will be monitored 
by trained HCPs in a recovery room until they are fit to leave, but it is a major issue for the clinical 
utility of DEX as an agent for procedural sedation. It seems unlikely for example to be a suitable choice 
for situations where a reasonably rapid recovery from sedation is desired, such as day case 
procedures.  
The method of dosing is an important focus in this application, for both safety and efficacy. The use of 
a loading dose is new to the proposed indication for procedural sedation as it is not normally necessary 
to achieve a rapid effect with DEX in the ICU as patients are normally already sedated. For procedural 
sedation a rapid onset of effect is required, necessitating use of a loading dose of DEX. A loading dose 
of 1 mcg/kg infused over 10 minutes is recommended in the proposed SmPC and seems to be 
reasonably established in non-EU countries where the procedural sedation indication has been 
approved for a number of years. The smaller loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg did not show an improved 
safety profile in the MAC study; if anything the low DEX 0.5 mcg/kg loading dose seemed to be 
associated with more AEs than the high DEX 1.0 mcg/kg loading dose.  There seem to be no clear 
safety grounds for recommending a lower loading dose than 1.0 mcg/kg.  
One patient who received DEX, fentanyl 100 mcg and no rescue MDZ, discontinued the trial due to an 
infusion site reaction.  ISRs are not listed in section 4.8 of the Dexdor SPC and there were no other 
cases reported in the trials so a discontinuation for this reason is curious. The narrative summary gives 
no useful further information (“hives at the IV insertion site”). The MAH was asked to discuss whether 
infusion site reactions should be added to the SPC section 4.8, considering also any relevant post 
marketing data. The response was satisfactory and it is agreed that no SPC wording is necessary.

3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the MAC study DEX, at the doses recommended in the draft SmPC, was shown to be effective for 
procedural sedation although a significant percentage of patients required supplementary midazolam 
to achieve the necessary depth of sedation. It cannot be concluded that DEX achieves adequate 
sedation reliably as a sole agent and the frequent need to administer a second agent is not entirely 
satisfactory, but is not a deal breaker. It is unknown whether this proportion might be different in 
routine clinical practice compared to the clinical trial setting which set some rather rigid rules for DEX 
dose adjustment and midazolam administration. No benefit in terms of efficacy over midazolam based 
sedation could be concluded.  An opioid sparing effect was seen, which could be advantageous in 
certain clinical situations e.g. in patients taking naltrexone for alcohol and/or drug misuse.  
The most important safety issues concern the well known cardiovascular effects and the slow recovery 
time. However these are considered manageable in a suitable hospital setting with monitored 
anaesthetic care and are not considered to be blocking issues. The safety profile of DEX can be 
accepted as acceptable for an indication in procedural sedation, subject to the restriction to 
administration only by health care professionals skilled in anaesthetic management. 
Based on the presented data, dexmedetomidine is an acceptably safe and efficacious alternative for 
the provision of sedation during surgery and diagnostic or other procedures provided it is used at the 
proposed dose and under the clinical conditions described in the proposed SmPC, with a 
recommendation to use additional analgesia or sedatives (e.g. opioids, midazolam or propofol) in case 
of painful procedures or if increased depth of sedation is necessary.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dexdor is positive.

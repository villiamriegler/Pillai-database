patients who are refractory to other treatments; consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 
5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Additionally, the SmPC section 5.3 is updated with data from juvenile 
toxicity studies. Furthermore, an additional pack size of 30 tablets has been introduced with 
subsequent updates of sections 6.5 and 8 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated 
in accordance. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line 
with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The group of variations requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0373/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0373/2019  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2. Scientific discussion 
2.1 Introduction 
This type II variation is for a new indication for Doptelet (avatrombopag); the treatment of chronic 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. There 
remains an important unmet medical need for new treatment options for these patients, given the 
variable, transient response to the currently approved agents, frequent relapse, and associated 
toxicities of the available treatments for ITP. 
2.1.1 Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired form of thrombocytopenia that is primarily due to 
autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets. The autoantibodies may also affect megakaryocytes 
and impair platelet production. The condition is defined as a peripheral blood platelet count less than 
100 x 109/L. ITP can be further classified pathophysiologically in a primary form (monosymptomatic) 
or secondary (associated with other conditions) and temporally in the acute (0 – 3 months), a 
persistent (3-12 months’ duration) and a chronic (≥ 12 months’ duration) form. In adults the condition 
typically has an insidious onset with no preceding viral or other illness and it normally follows a chronic 
course, (See Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products intended for the treatment of 
chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia, Oncology Working Party). 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The reported incidence data for ITP in the European Union (EU) ranges from 1.6 to 4.4 per 100,000 
(Moulis et al, Blood 2014; Schoonen et al, Br J Haematol 2009; Neylon et al, Br J Haematol 2003; 
Frederiksen & Schmidt, Blood 1999). The prevalence is 9.5 per 100,000 adults (Lambert & 
Gernsheimer, Blood 2017). There is an increasing incidence with older age and equal for the sexes 
except in the mid-adult years (30-60 years), when the disease is more prevalent in women. Childhood 
ITP has an incidence of between 1.9 and 6.4 per 100,000 per year with equal distribution between the 
sexes. There are an estimated 50,000 adult patients with chronic ITP in the EU (Gernsheimer, Eur J 
Haematol 2008). 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Primary ITP in adults has no known trigger or obvious cause. ITP is characterised by immune-mediated 
thrombocytopenia resulting from increased clearance of normal platelets and decreased platelet 
production: 
• 
antibodies bind to circulating platelets and mediate clearance of platelets by tissue 
macrophages (primarily in spleen, but also liver) via surface fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptors 
• 
antibodies may impair platelet function, resulting in bleeding that is disproportionate to the 
platelet count 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 9/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
antibodies may bind to megakaryocytes, resulting in decreased platelet production. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Signs and symptoms vary widely. Many patients have either no symptoms or minimal bruising, 
whereas others experience serious bleeding, which may include gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
extensive skin and mucosal haemorrhage, or intracranial haemorrhage. The severity of 
thrombocytopenia correlates to some extent but not completely with the bleeding risk. Additional 
factors may increase the risk (e.g., advanced age, lifestyle factors, concomitant medications, 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders) and should be evaluated before the appropriate 
management is determined. Although haemorrhagic death is a major concern it has been reported that 
the estimated rate of fatal haemorrhage is around 0.02 to 0.04 cases per adult patient-year risk. 
Diagnosis of ITP is one of exclusion, when the history, physical examination, complete blood count and 
examination of peripheral blood smear do not suggest other aetiology for the thrombocytopenia. 
Physical examination should be normal apart from bleeding signs. The peripheral blood count reveals 
isolated thrombocytopenia and normal red cell and white cell indices. If significant bleeding occurs 
there may be anaemia proportional to the degree of bleeding with possible iron deficiency. The 
peripheral blood smear reveals normal to large platelets in size and no abnormalities should be seen in 
red and white cell morphology. Bone marrow examination is currently not routinely conducted in 
patients with typical ITP presentations but reserved to selected cases such as those with an atypical 
presentation (Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products intended for the treatment of 
chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia, EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, Oncology Working Party). 
Management 
The major goal for treatment of ITP is to provide a platelet count that prevents major bleeding rather 
than correcting the platelet count to normal levels. The management of ITP should be tailored to the 
individual patient and it is rarely indicated in those with platelet counts above 50 x 109/L in the 
absence of bleeding, trauma, surgery or high risk factors (e.g. patients on anticoagulation therapy). 
The management of ITP varies widely and current international guidelines recommend several first and 
second line options, including some medicinal products that have not been approved in the EU for this 
particular condition. First line treatment options include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IV Ig) and intravenous anti-D immunoglobulin (the latter only for non-splenectomised Rhesus-D 
positive patients). Patients who fail to respond or who relapse face the options of treatment with 
second line drug therapy or splenectomy but there is no clear evidence to support the best approach. 
Splenectomy can provide long term efficacy in around 60% of cases. Second line drug therapies 
include high dose dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, high dose IV Ig or anti-D Ig, vinca alkaloids 
and danazol, the immunosuppressants cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and cyclosporine or 
mycophenolate mofetil, TPO receptor agonists and the anti CD-20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. 
ITP is a disease of increased platelet destruction but recent evidence suggests that suboptimal platelet 
production by suppression of megakaryocyte function also occurs. Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) 
agonists activate the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) which is the primary factor that regulates 
platelet production. Treatment aimed at increasing the platelet production has become a potential 
treatment option and TPO-R agonists have been approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic ITP 
splenectomised adult patients who are refractory to other treatments or as second line therapy for 
non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated (Guideline on the clinical development of 
medicinal products intended for the treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia, 
EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, Oncology Working Party). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 10/173 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical guidelines recommend the use of TPO receptor agonists for patients with ITP and a risk of 
severe bleeding who are not candidates for splenectomy, and who have failed at least one other 
therapy. The unmet medical need for effective and safe therapies for the treatment of patients with 
chronic ITP remains. 
About the product 
Avatrombopag maleate (previously known as E5501, AKR-501 monomaleate, YM477 monomaleate, 
and YM-301477 monomaleate), hereafter avatrombopag, is an orally administered, small molecule TPO 
receptor (c-Mpl) agonist that mimics the biologic effects of TPO in vitro and in vivo. The agent does not 
compete with TPO for binding to the TPO receptor and has an additive effect with TPO on platelet 
production resulting in a measured increase in platelet counts. TPO exerts its effect on 
megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis through binding and activation of the TPO receptor, 
which is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, cells of the megakaryocytic lineage, and platelets; like 
the approved TPO receptor agonists, avatrombopag also activates the human TPO receptor. After 
binding to a different site on the receptor, it stimulates signal transduction and mimics the biologic 
effects of TPO, which in turn increases platelet counts; this differential binding may limit off-target 
binding and be the basis for avatrombopag’s lack of hepatotoxicity. Given its basic mechanism of 
action, by directly stimulating the normal production of new platelets by the bone marrow, 
avatrombopag has the potential to be useful for the treatment of thrombocytopenia of any etiology 
across a variety of indications and patient populations, including those with ITP. 
Doptelet was previously approved for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with 
chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure. 
The  development  programme/compliance  with  CHMP  guidance/  scientific 
advice 
On 22nd of November 2019 the modification of the agreed paediatric investigation plan for 
avatrombopag with a deferral and a waiver was accepted by the EMA in accordance with Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.  
On 15th of April 2010 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1606/1/2010/III) and on 17th of February 2011 
(Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1606/1/FU/1/2011/III) Eisai Limited requested scientific advice for the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic 
purpura, pursuant to Article 57(1)(n) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council. 
Due to the length of time that has elapsed since the CHMP scientific advice (first scientific advice was 
issued  in  2010  and  follow-up  scientific  advice  was  issued  in  2011),  there  are  several  aspects  of  the 
completed  avatrombopag  Phase  3  program  that  diverged  from  the  original  plan  as  agreed  in  these 
scientific  advice  procedures.  Accordingly,  a  pre-submission  meeting  with  the  EU  Rapporteur  for  this 
variation  was  conducted  to  discuss  the  existing  avatrombopag  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  for 
avatrombopag, and the suitability of the data to support a type II variation for Doptelet for the treatment 
of chronic ITP in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. 
2.2 Quality aspects 
The addition of the pack size 30 x 20 mg film-coated tablets does not result in any changes to the 
quality part (module 3, part P.7), because the finished product is packed in blisters (Alu/Alu) and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 11/173 
 
 
 
 
 
change only affects the number of blisters included in the package (10, 15 x 20 mg film-coated tablets 
is currently approved). 
The tablets are supplied in cartons containing one or two aluminium blisters. Each blister contains 
either 10 or 15 tablets.  
The MAH has also, with this variation application, included additional information on impurities in 
section 3.2.S.3.2. and in section 3.2.P.5.6. 
Section 3.2.S.3.2.2.3.2 Control of Mutagenic Impurities: 
Results of purge studies with the impurity ER-887068-00 (introduced relatively late in the synthesis) is 
provided. No carry-over to the drug substance is observed. 
Section 3.2.S.3.2.2.3.3 Acceptable Daily Intake for Known or Potential Mutagenic Impurities: 
Total daily intake was added for the CLD indication and ITP indication 
Section 3.2.P.5.6.3 Elemental Impurities Risk Assessment: 
Clarification was provided that the calculation provided for the ratio of potential uptake for each 
elemental impurity against Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) described in the guideline for elemental 
impurities (ICH, Q3D) was based upon a total dose of 60 mg per day per the CLD indication. The total 
dose of 40 mg per day per the ITP indication would result in less exposure than that calculated for the 
60 mg per day dose per the CLD indication. 
2.2.1 Conclsion on Quality aspects 
The change to the pack size is acceptable. 
2.3 Non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. A summary of the definitive juvenile study has been included in section 5.3. of SmPC. This study 
will be summarised and re-assessed below. However, it should be noted that the new indication of ITP 
is not including children, i.e. the indication wording is as follows: Doptelet is indicated for the treatment 
of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. 
2.3.1 Introduction 
Avatrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) agonist that 
mimics the biologic effects of thrombopoietin (TPO), the principal physiologic regulator of platelet 
production. TPO exerts its effect on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis through binding and 
activation of c-Mpl, which is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, cells of the megakaryocytic 
lineage, and platelets. Avatrombopag activates human c-Mpl through a mechanism that is different 
from TPO binding, but is still capable of stimulating signal transduction and mimicking the biologic 
effects of TPO. 
The pharmacologic effect of avatrombopag is highly species-specific, showing activity only in humans 
and chimpanzees, and not in any other species tested (rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, dog, common 
marmoset, squirrel monkey, rhesus monkey, cynomolgus monkey, olive baboon, pig). This species-
specific activity of avatrombopag is attributed to histidine amino acid residue at position 499 (His499) 
in the transmembrane domain of human c- Mpl. His499 is conserved in humans and chimpanzees, but 
not found in other species. 
Assessment report

The  target  indication  for  this  type  II  variation  is  the  treatment  of  chronic  immune  thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. 
The recommended starting dose for avatrombopag in patients with chronic ITP is 20 mg once daily with 
food in the absence of interacting medications, with the following adjustments to the starting dose based 
on specific interacting medications: 
o  Adjustment of the initial dose of avatrombopag to 40 mg once daily in the presence of a moderate 
or strong dual inducer for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 
o  Adjustment of the initial dose of avatrombopag to 20 mg three times a week in the presence of 
a moderate or strong dual inhibitor for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 
To maintain platelet counts within the target range of 50×109/L to 150×109/L, adjustments to the dose 
level or frequency of dosing are recommended based on patients’ platelet counts. 
Avatrombopag is available as a 20 mg tablet, round, biconvex, pale-yellow, film-coated, and debossed 
with “AVA” on one side and “20” on the other side. 
The full nonclinical program encompassed pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and toxicology studies designed to support safe clinical use. The performed nonclinical studies conformed 
to the study types and designs recommended by relevant International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines and satisfy the requirements of Article 8.3 of EC Directive 2001/83 (as amended). All pivotal 
toxicology studies and the battery of safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. In addition, all GLP studies were conducted by laboratories 
in countries that adhere to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) system 
for mutual acceptance of chemical safety data. 
2.3.2 Pharmacology 
There are no new primary, secondary or safety pharmacology studies for this Type II variation, nor are 
there any specific studies of relevance to the ITP indication. The same applies for pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions. 
2.3.3 Pharmacokinetics 
There are no new pharmacokinetic studies covering ADME submitted in support of the new indication. In 
terms of pharmacokinetic drug interactions, the MAH is referring to the Clinical Overview of in vitro and 
in vivo (clinical) pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies relevant to the ITP indication. 
2.3.4 Toxicology  
There  are  no  new  toxicology  studies  submitted  in  support  of  the  new  indication.  The  toxicity  of 
avatrombopag was evaluated previously in a comprehensive set of toxicology studies encompassing all 
appropriate toxicologic endpoints based on the relevant regional and ICH guidelines. Avatrombopag was 
dosed orally, which is the route for clinical use. The toxicology program for avatrombopag is shown in 
Table 1.

The pharmacological effects of avatrombopag were shown to be highly species-specific, with signalling 
occurring  only  in  humans  and  chimpanzees  but  not  in  any  other  species  tested.  Thus,  there  were  no 
relevant species other than chimpanzee and human to investigate on-target effects of avatrombopag, 
and toxicologic evaluation in chimpanzees was not viable for ethical reasons (EU Directive 2010/63/EU, 
22 Sep 2010). Nevertheless, the off-target effects of avatrombopag were thoroughly assessed in species 
commonly used in toxicology studies (mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys). Rats and monkeys were found to 
be  the  most  sensitive  species,  and  these  2  species  were,  therefore,  used  for  the  chronic  toxicology 
studies. 
The  toxicity  of  avatrombopag  was  evaluated  in  single-dose  and  repeated-dose  oral  toxicity  studies  in 
mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys (for up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats, 4 weeks in 
dogs, and 52 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys). In addition, mechanistic studies were conducted in mice 
and rats to elucidate stomach toxicity by avatrombopag. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Stomach findings 
The primary toxicity of avatrombopag was identified as dose-related changes in the stomach in repeated-
dose studies in mice, rats, and Cynomolgus monkeys (Study Nos. SNBL.152.03, SNBL.152.04, B-5120, 
SNBL.152.01,  SNBL.152.05,  SNBL.152.08,  SBL16-95,  SNBL.152.02,  SNBL.152.07).  The  histologic 
change in the fundic glands of the stomach was characterised by primary degeneration of the glandular 
epithelium  with  a  decrease  in  matured  parietal  cells,  with  accompanying  regenerative  epithelial 
hyperplasia  particularly  in  mice,  and  atrophy  of  glandular  mucosa  without  inflammatory  responses  in 
rats  and  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  This effect  was  not  associated  with  an  inflammatory  response  or  any 
evidence of erosion or ulcer formation. These changes were also accompanied by decreases in the gastric 
acid output with accompanying elevation in intragastric pH and compensatory hypergastrinemia in all of 
these species. These stomach lesions were dose-, plasma concentration-, and duration-dependent. 
Histologic changes in the stomach induced by avatrombopag were identified to be due to systemic rather 
than local exposures (Study Nos. 929084, T12077). The gastric changes showed a clear trend towards 
recovery after dosing was stopped. Systemic exposures at no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) 
in all of the pivotal studies were sufficiently above the clinical exposures at the maximum recommended 
human dose under the intended clinical regimen. In addition, in the Phase 3 studies of avatrombopag in 
ITP (Study 302 and Study 305) fasting total serum gastrin levels, fasting gastrin-17, pepsinogen (PG)-
I, and PG-II were also assessed to evaluate for potential gastric toxicity. There was no significant change 
in mean fasting gastrin or mean fasting gastrin-17 levels from Baseline to Week 26 (End of Treatment) 
in  the  Avatrombopag  Treatment  Group.  No  clinically  meaningful  mean  changes  in  PG-I,  PG-II,  or  the 
ratio  of  -I/-II  were  noted  in  the  Avatrombopag  Treatment  Group.  Overall,  the  majority  of subjects  in 
each treatment group had no shifts from Baseline to the highest or lowest post-Baseline value at any 
visit. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that avatrombopag treatment induced reduction in gastric acid secretion 
with consequent intragastric pH elevation in rats. This is not via local contact to the gastric mucosa but 
via action of the absorbed drug on the parietal cell leading to apoptosis and cell loss. The decrease in 
acid secretion was accompanied by secondary elevation of gastrin. Therefore, the results demonstrate 
that the primary effect of avatrombopag on the stomach is on the parietal cells, leading to their loss by 
apoptosis  with  a  resultant  decrease  in  acid  output  and  elevation  in  gastric  pH,  followed  by  gastrin 
elevation. 
The findings in the stomach in the pivotal toxicity studies drove the selection of NOAELs. The systemic 
exposures (AUC) at NOAELs were 4- (monkey) to 45-fold (mouse) higher than the exposure in humans 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 15/173 
 
 
 
 
 
at a dose of 20 mg/day (AUC: 3485 ng∙h/mL). The 20 mg dose was selected for calculation of safety 
margins  as  this  dose  was  the  average  dose  administered  in  the  clinical  trials  with  avatrombopag  in 
patients with ITP. The fact that regenerative capacity is unaffected by avatrombopag even after chronic 
dosing, and that there is an adequate safety margin supports the conclusion that the gastric findings in 
nonclinical toxicity studies are of limited clinical significance to humans. This conclusion from nonclinical 
studies was validated by data collected in the avatrombopag clinical program. In Study 302 and Study 
305 there was no trend in the change from Baseline results across all the gastric biomarkers evaluated 
to suggest a gastric safety signal in patients. These data support that chronic avatrombopag treatment 
at doses between 5 and 40 mg daily did not result in elevated biomarkers suggestive of gastric toxicity.

Skeletal muscle degeneration findings

Page 16/173 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In addition to the observed gastric toxicity in animals, reversible skeletal muscle degeneration/necrosis 
was also a finding but only in 7-day and 4-week studies in F344 rats (but not in SD rats) and Cynomolgus 
monkeys  (Study  Nos.  C-B106,  B-5120,  SBL16-95).  However,  these  findings  were  not  consistent  and 
limited  to  the  short  duration  (up  to  4  weeks)  studies,  with  no  lesions  observed  in  any  species  that 
received  avatrombopag  for  13  weeks  and  longer,  even  though  skeletal  muscles  were  examined 
extensively  with  additional  tissue  collection  from  multiple  sites  with  additional  parameters  in 
biochemistry in mice, SD rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
While musculoskeletal events have been observed in clinical trials with avatrombopag (common events 
of  arthralgia,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  and  myalgia),  these  findings  have  also  been  observed  in 
clinical trials with eltrombopag (common events of myalgia, muscle spasm, musculoskeletal pain, bone 
pain, and back pain, Revolade SmPC) and romiplostim (common events of arthralgia, myalgia, muscle 
spasms,  pain  in  extremity,  back  pain,  and  bone  pain,  Nplate  SmPC).  There  is  no  known  mechanistic 
explanation  for  the  occurrence  of  musculoskeletal  events  in  thrombopoietin  receptor  agonist  treated 
patients  that  would  be  related  to  the  observed  effects  in  nonclinical  studies.  Similar  musculoskeletal 
adverse events have also been observed in clinical trials with other cell stimulating agents (e.g., G-CSF) 
which may implicate stimulation of cell production as a potential cause of these adverse events. 
Renal toxicity 
Reversible renal toxicity was observed at high doses in dogs in 4-week repeated-dose study, including 
increases in BUN, creatinine, urinary protein, and urinary volume. Decreased glomerular filtration rate 
and effective plasma flow, accompanied by histologic changes (epithelial cell regeneration of proximal 
tubules) were also present. 
However,  the  present  findings  are  not  relevant  since  it  is  known  that  maleic  acid  (the  salt  moiety  of 
avatrombopag) could cause similar lesions in dogs (tubular necrosis in proximal tubules) and this could 
have  played  a  role  in  these  renal  changes  (Everett,  et  al.,  1993;  Fiume,  2007).  Moreover,  no  renal 
changes were seen in the repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, or monkeys, and there have been 
no significant adverse events in kidneys and renal functions in clinical studies (Study Nos. 6478-390). 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of avatrombopag was evaluated in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo studies and 
it was shown to be non-genotoxic. There are no new in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity studies to report for 
this  type  II  variation,  nor  any  in  vitro  or  in  vivo  genotoxicity  data  of  specific  relevance  to  the  ITP 
indication.  
Carcinogenicity 
Oral gavage carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. There are no new carcinogenicity 
studies to report for this type II variation, nor any carcinogenicity data of specific relevance to the ITP 
indication. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity of avatrombopag was evaluated in studies on fertility and early 
embryonic  development  in  rats,  embryo-foetal  development  in  rats  and  rabbits,  and  prenatal  and 
postnatal development in rats. In addition, toxicity was evaluated in studies in juvenile/neonatal rats. 
No new studies of reproduction toxicity were submitted. Avatrombopag did not impact reproduction.

Studies in Juvenile Animals 
There are no new juvenile animal studies to report for this type II variation, nor any juvenile animal data 
of specific relevance to the ITP indication. Juvenile animal studies have been submitted previously. 
In brief, the 10-week oral toxicity study in juvenile rats was completed in July 2018, after the submission 
of the CLD MAA, and therefore it could not be included in the original submission. 
Avatrombopag (Lot No. 16080101) was administered by oral gavage to juvenile rats Crl:CD(SD) (10 or 
16 animals/sex/group) from postnatal day (PND) 7 once daily for 10 weeks at a dose level of 20, 100, 
or 300 mg/kg. A control group (16 animals/sex) received an equivalent volume (10 mL/kg) of vehicle, 
a 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose aqueous solution. The reversibility of any effects was also assessed in the 
300 mg/kg group following a 4-week recovery period. For toxicokinetic evaluation, avatrombopag or the 
vehicle was given to toxicokinetic (TK) satellite rats (4 animals/sex/group) in the same manner. 
Assessment was based on the following: mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, sexual 
development,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  toxicokinetics,  organ  weights,  and  macroscopic  and 
microscopic examinations. 
There  was  no  test  article-related  mortality  or  clinical  signs,  or  changes  in  body  weights,  food 
consumption,  sexual  development,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  organ  weights,  or  macroscopic 
examination at doses up to 300 mg/kg. 
In the stomach, test article-related histologic changes were the same as reported in adult rat studies in 
males and females at 100 and 300 mg/kg: dose-dependent degeneration, regenerative hyperplasia, and 
atrophy  of  the  glandular  epithelium.  Increased  incidences  of  background  focal  mineralization  were 
observed in the kidney in females at 300 mg/kg. After a 4-week recovery period, the test article-related 
changes were reversible, although residual mineralization was observed in the kidneys. 
In conclusion, when avatrombopag was administered by oral gavage to juvenile Crl:CD(SD) rats from 
PND 7 once daily for 10 weeks at a dose level of 20, 100, or 300 mg/kg, gastric changes that were the 
same as those reported in adult rats were observed at 100 and 300 mg/kg. These changes were reversed 
after  a  4-week  recovery  period.  The  no-observed-adverse-effect-level  (NOAEL)  of  avatrombopag  was 
considered to be 20 mg/kg/day in male and female juvenile rats. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Refer to Table 2 above. 
Local tolerance 
The potential for skin and eye irritation with avatrombopag was evaluated in rabbits. 
There are no new local tolerance studies to report for this type II variation, nor any local tolerance data 
of specific relevance to the ITP indication.

Other Toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Based on the established safety profile of avatrombopag, no specific studies have been conducted. That 
is considered acceptable. 
Mechanistic Studies 
Non-GLP compliant mechanistic studies were conducted in mice and rats to elucidate stomach toxicity 
by avatrombopag. Dose-dependent changes in the gastric mucosa, as well as increased serum gastrin 
levels were observed in both mice and rats. It was considered that the decrease in mature parietal cells 
is the primary cause of decreased gastric acid secretion with increased intragastric pH, leading to the 
subsequent compensatory hypergastrinemia. From the results of the comparative study of local versus 
systemic avatrombopag effects, it can be concluded that histologic changes in the stomach induced by 
avatrombopag treatment were due to systemic rather than local exposures. 
Studies on Impurities 
The  mutagenic  potential  for  12  possible  impurities  in  avatrombopag  maleate,  including  starting 
materials,  intermediates,  and  others,  were  assessed.  Seven  of  these  compounds  were  positive  or 
inconclusive in the in vitro mutagenicity assay using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli tester 
strains  (Study  Nos.  14K3688G,  K12014,  964106,  15K3898G,  K12006)  or  triggered  an  alert  in  the  in 
silico  assessment  (DEREK  and  Multi-CASE  software).  The  results  of  these  in  vitro  assays  or  in  silico 
assessment for mutagenic potential are summarised in the Table 3:

The 7 potential or known mutagenic impurities which have been identified include four Class 3 and three 
Class 2 impurities. Six out of the seven impurities are below the detection level in any batch, and the 
remaining impurity, ER-887068-00, is controlled at less than 100 ppm in the intermediate ER-878008-
00. A purge study has also been conducted to confirm that ER-887068-00 does not persist through the 
subsequent  synthetic  steps  which  are  conducted  to  convert  ER-878008-00  to  avatrombopag  maleate 
drug  substance.  Therefore,  all  mutagenic  or  potential  mutagenic  impurities  are  not  expected  to  be 
present in the avatrombopag maleate drug substance as they are controlled at the intermediate steps. 
2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Avatrombopag maleate is an orally administered, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) agonist 
that mimics the biologic effects of thrombopoietin (TPO) in vitro and in vivo. Avatrombopag activates 
human c-Mpl through a mechanism that is different from TPO binding but is still capable of stimulating 
signal  transduction  and  mimicking  the  biologic  effects  of  TPO.  The  pharmacological  effect  of 
avatrombopag  maleate  is  highly  species-specific  with  signalling  occurring  only  in  chimpanzees  and 
humans, but not in any other species tested. 
In this environmental risk assessment (ERA), all doses are expressed as the amount of avatrombopag 
free base, where relevant. 
Avatrombopag film-coated tablets (Doptelet) in the 20 mg strength (expressed as free base equivalent) 
are packaged in an aluminium/aluminium blister. 
An  ERA  has  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  potential  environmental  risk  resulting  from  the  use  of 
avatrombopag film-coated tablets in the treatment of: 
•  Severe thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an 
invasive  procedure  (i.e.  the  CLD  indication),  which  is  the  currently  authorised  indication.  The 
maximum  daily  dose  (DOSEai)  is  60  mg  avatrombopag  (free  base);  the  dosing  duration  is  5 
consecutive  days for each treatment period, and there may be up to 3 treatment periods per 
year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 20/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments (i.e. 
the ITP indication), which is the proposed indication for this type II variation. The maximum daily 
dose (DOSEai) is 40 mg avatrombopag (free base); this indication requires chronic dosing. 
Environmental exposure to avatrombopag has been shown to be low based on the calculation of predicted 
environmental  concentration  in  surface  water  (PECSURFACEWATER)  which  has  utilised  refined  values  for 
market  penetration  (Fpen)  of  avatrombopag  film-coated  tablets,  rather  than  the  default  value  as 
discussed in the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 01 June 2006). 
Using a refined Fpen value of 0.00015 for the CLD indication, the PECSURFACEWATER for avatrombopag has 
been calculated to be 0.0045 μg/L. 
Using  a  refined  Fpen  value  of  0.00026  for  the  ITP  indication  the  PECSURFACEWATER for  avatrombopag  has 
been calculated to be 0.0052 μg/L. 
The combined PECSURFACEWATER value for avatrombopag for both indications is 0.0097 μg/L, which is below 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
A  partition  coefficient  study  was  performed  using  the  shake  flask  method  with  HPLC  analysis.  At 
approximately  25ºC,  Log  D  values  of  avatrombopag  maleate  at  pH  3.1,  5.4,  7.1  and  9.3  were  >4.5, 
>4.5, >4.5 and 4.1, respectively (ionic strength I = 0.3) (Study Report W-20140941, 2014). This study 
was followed by a partition coefficient study, which was performed using the slow-stirring method (OECD 
Test Guideline 123) with HPLC analysis. At 25ºC, the Log D value of avatrombopag maleate at pH 7.1 
was >4.5 (ionic strength I = 0.3) (Study Report W-20140961, 2014). 
In a GLP-compliant ready biodegradability study (OECD 301F), avatrombopag maleate was found not to 
be readily biodegradable (Study Report A160181, 2016). 
On the basis that Log D has been found to be greater than 4.5 using the shake flask and slow-stirring 
methods  and  avatrombopag  maleate  was  not  readily  biodegradable,  avatrombopag  maleate  will  be 
further  screened  in  a  step-wise  procedure  for  persistence,  bioaccumulation  and  toxicity  (PBT),  in 
accordance  with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 01 June 2006). 
The  following  was  detailed  in  the  Assessment  report,  Doptelet  (International  non-proprietary  name: 
avatrombopag),  Procedure  No.  EMEA/H/C/004722/0000  (26  April  2019,  EMA/CHMP/322871/2019, 
CHMP); the company is currently in the process of addressing these items. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended the following points to be addressed:  
A step-wise PBT assessment post-marketing: 
• 
Persistence  (P):  Persistence  will  be  assessed  in  a  GLP-compliant  OECD  308,  study  of  aerobic 
transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems. 
•  Bioaccumulation  (B):  Bioaccumulation  will  be  assessed  in  a  GLP-compliant  OECD  305  fish 
bioaccumulation study. 
• 
Toxicity (T): As stated in Section 1.2.3 of Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012: “For animal 
welfare  reasons  it  is  recommended  that  the  evaluation  of  persistence  and  bioaccumulation  is 
carried out first. When the criteria for persistence and/or bioaccumulation are not met, there is 
no requirement to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 21/173 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Available  mammalian  toxicity  data  for  avatrombopag  show  no  evidence  of  any  endocrine 
disruption or mutagenicity, and no evidence of other toxicities indicative of environmental risk, 
based on secondary pharmacodynamics (lack of significant binding to 86 receptors, transporters 
or ion channels) and repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity data. 
The  MAH  therefore  proposes  to  provide,  as  a  post-marketing  commitment,  an  updated  ERA  after  the 
OECD 305 and 308 studies have been performed with an assessment of: 
•  Whether  avatrombopag  does  or  does  not  fulfil  the  P  or  vP  criteria,  as  detailed  in  Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether  avatrombopag  does  or  does  not  fulfil  the  B  or  vB  criteria,  as  detailed  in  Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether or not there is considered to be a need to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within 
the PBT assessment, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
This assessment will be provided in a follow-on updated ERA to this ERA for avatrombopag. 
The  excipients  in  avatrombopag  film-coated  tablets  are,  for  the  core:  lactose  monohydrate,  colloidial 
silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose; and for the film coat: 
Opadry  II  85F42244  Yellow.  These  excipients  present  no  environmental  risks.  The  packaging 
(aluminium/aluminium  blister)  used  for  avatrombopag  film-coated  tablets  presents  no  environmental 
risks. 
2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  nonclinical  studies  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  new  indication  of  ITP.  Unlike  the  first 
indication in CLD, the new indication requires chronic dosing. The documentation was assessed with this 
view  in  mind.  The  nonclinical  program  was  already  designed  to  support  a  small  molecule  MAA  and 
included a full carcinogenicity program as well as reproduction toxicity and studies in juvenile animals. 
Hence, no further studies are required.  
Primary pharmacology was well described and in vitro and in vivo proof of concept is considered well-
established. Avatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, monkeys, or dogs 
because of the unique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal studies do not fully 
model potential adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to avatrombopag in humans. 
Nonetheless, there are no new concerns regarding safety pharmacology. 
There are no new concerns regarding pharmacokinetics either. 
The  non-clinical  aspects  of  relevance  to  this  type  II  variation  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  immune 
thrombocytopenia are focused on: 
1)  dose-related  gastric  changes,  which  were  identified  as  the  primary  toxicity  of  avatrombopag  in 
repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys; 
2) skeletal muscle changes, which are assessed due to the observance of musculoskeletal adverse events 
in clinical trials of avatrombopag in patients with ITP; 
3) assessment of the acceptable intake of potential mutagenic impurities based on the chronic dosing 
regimen required for patients with ITP. 
The  major  toxic  effects  of  avatrombopag  were  in  the  gastric  mucosa,  including  degeneration, 
regenerative hyperplasia, and glandular atrophy with gastrin elevation without an inflammatory response

of avatrombopag on the stomach is on the parietal cells, leading to their loss by apoptosis with a resultant 
decrease in acid output and elevation in gastric pH, followed by gastrin elevation. The systemic exposures 
(AUC) at NOAELs were 2- (monkey) to 23-fold (mouse) higher than the exposure in humans at a dose 
of 40 mg/day (AUC: 3485 ng∙h/mL).   
Even if the safety margin is considered to be sufficiently large relying on the maximum human dose of 
60 mg daily for the CLD indication, the significant differences in duration of treatment between the two 
indications should be taken into account. For the ITP indication, the highest recommended clinical dose 
is  40  mg  (dose  level  6  from  the  SmPC)  for  an  unknown  period  of  time  (based  on  the  platelet  count 
response), while for CLD indication, the highest recommended clinical dose is 60 mg for not more than 
5 days. The relevant information is reflected in the SmPC sections 5.3 and 4.2. 
Skeletal muscle changes were observed only in F344 rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, but these findings 
were reversible and limited to the short duration (up to 4 weeks) studies. Musculoskeletal events have 
been observed in clinical trials with avatrombopag. However similar musculoskeletal adverse events have 
also been observed in clinical trials with eltrombopag (Revolade SmPC) and romiplostim (Nplate SmPC), 
and  with  other  haematological  cell  stimulating  agents  (e.g.,  G-CSF).  There  is  no  known  mechanistic 
explanation  for  the  occurrence  of  musculoskeletal  events  in  thrombopoietin  receptor  agonist  treated 
patients  that  would  be  related  to  the  observed  effects  in  non-clinical  studies.  As  a  potential  cause  of 
these  adverse  events  the  stimulation  of  cell  production  in  the  bone  marrow  may  be  implicated.  The 
relevant  information  is  indicated  in  the  SmPC,  section  4.8.  Undesirable  effects:  Musculoskeletal  and 
connective  tissue  disorders:  Classified  as  common:  Arthralgia,  Back  pain,  Pain  in  extremity,  Myalgia, 
Musculoskeletal pain  
The purity of avatrombopag used for the pivotal toxicology studies ranged from 98.8% to 99.3%. This 
range is comparable with the active substance specification of 98.0% to 102.0%. Based on the hazard 
risk  assessment  including  Ames  testing  and  in  silico  predictions,  it  is  found  that  ER-878005-00,  ER-
887068-00, and ER-880423-00 are mutagenic impurities (Class 2); ER-878003-00, ER-878415-00, ER-
885097-00, and ER-885056-00 are potential mutagenic impurities (Class 3). 
All  seven  mutagenic  or  potential  mutagenic  impurities  are  not  expected  to  be  present  in  the 
avatrombopag maleate drug substance, as they are controlled at the intermediate steps. 
For a 40 mg per day dose of avatrombopag, the maximum daily dose for patients with ITP, for a duration 
of >10 years to a lifetime, the assessment of the acceptable intake of multiple and individual mutagenic 
impurities  indicate  the  total  known  mutagenic  impurities  are  at  a  level  less  than  the  acceptable  total 
daily intake of 5 μg/day for multiple, in accordance with ICH M7. 
The SmPC section 5.3 was updated with a summary from the definitive juvenile animal study. 
This  application  aims  to  broaden  the  indication  for  avatrombopag  from  CLD  to  ITP.  An  updated 
environmental  risk  assessment  was  presented  using  refined  FPEN  for  both  indications  leading  to  a 
combined PECSURFACE water of 0.0097 µg/L. However, as Log D of avatrombopag is > 4.5, the MAH has 
committed to perform a stepwise PBT evaluation. A timeline for submission of an updated environmental 
risk assessment including the PBT evaluation was provided (Q3 2021) and agreed to.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
In general, the gastric changes observed in juvenile animals were the same as those reported in adult 
rats.  The  NOAEL  in  the  initial  4-week  dose-range  finding  appeared  to  be  10  mg/kg/day,  while  in  the 
completed 10-week oral toxicity study in juvenile rats, the NOAEL was 20 mg/kg/day. 
Notably, the indication in both CLD and ITP is at present restricted to adult patients.

2.3.7 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view,  the  current  extension  application  for  avatrombopag  can  be 
recommended for marketing authorisation. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended the following points to be addressed:  
A step-wise PBT assessment post-marketing: 
• 
Persistence  (P):  Persistence  will  be  assessed  in  a  GLP-compliant  OECD  308  study  of  aerobic 
transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems. 
•  Bioaccumulation  (B):  Bioaccumulation  will  be  assessed  in  a  GLP-compliant  OECD  305  fish 
bioaccumulation study. 
• 
Toxicity (T): As stated in Section 1.2.3 of Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012: “For animal 
welfare  reasons  it  is  recommended  that  the  evaluation  of  persistence  and  bioaccumulation  is 
carried out first. When the criteria for persistence and/or bioaccumulation are not met, there is 
no requirement to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment.” 
•  Available  mammalian  toxicity  data  for  avatrombopag  show  no  evidence  of  any  endocrine 
disruption or mutagenicity, and no evidence of other toxicities indicative of environmental risk, 
based on secondary pharmacodynamics (lack of significant binding to 86 receptors, transporters 
or ion channels) and repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity data. 
The  MAH  therefore  proposes  to  provide,  as  a  post-marketing  commitment,  an  updated  ERA  after  the 
OECD 305 and 308 studies have been performed with an assessment of: 
•  Whether  avatrombopag  does  or  does  not  fulfil  the  P  or  vP  criteria,  as  detailed  in  Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether  avatrombopag  does  or  does  not  fulfil  the  B  or  vB  criteria,  as  detailed  in  Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether or not there is considered to be a need to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within 
the PBT assessment, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
This assessment will be provided in a follow-on updated ERA to this ERA for avatrombopag. 
2.4 Clinical aspects

This Type II variation concerns treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The original clinical 
pharmacology  assessment  of  avatrombopag  was  based  on  studies  conducted  in  healthy  subjects, 
subjects  with  chronic  ITP,  and  subjects  with  thrombocytopenia  associated  with  CLD.  Based  on  that 
program, avatrombopag was approved for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients 
with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure. The four avatrombopag 
studies  conducted  in  patients  with  ITP  were:  Study  501-CL-003  (Study  CL-003),  Study  501-CL-004 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021

(Study CL-004), Study E5501-G000-302 (Study 302) and Study E5501-G000-305 (Study 305).  
The clinical pharmacology program for this variation includes: 1) population PK and PK/PD modelling and 
simulations conducted to determine the proposed avatrombopag dosage and administration instructions 
for  patients  with  ITP,  and  2)  results  of  a  simulated  non-inferiority  study  conducted  to  compare  the 
avatrombopag  durable  platelet  response  rate  to  that  of  eltrombopag  based  on  the  established  PK/PD 
models for avatrombopag and eltrombopag. No new clinical data have been generated. 
The Phase 3 ITP studies (studies 302 and 305) were conducted with multiple tablet strengths to allow 
for titration  of the daily  avatrombopag dose  to maintain platelet counts in  the target range (between 
50×109/L and 150×109/L). The dosage regimen proposed for commercial use in ITP patients utilizes only 
one  avatrombopag  tablet  strength  of  20  mg.  Dose  titration  simulations  has  been  used  to  support 
modifying either the dose or dosing frequency of avatrombopag to achieve the goal of maximizing the 
percentage of subjects achieving a platelet count between 50×109/L and 150×109/L.  
Alternative, intermittent dosing regimens are also known to be used clinically, with a recently published 
long-term  study  with  eltrombopag  (EXTEND)  reporting  that  even  with  the  availability  of  multiple 
eltrombopag tablet strengths, 36% (n=108/302) of subjects utilized an alternate daily dosing regimen 
of 25 mg every other day or less frequently to maintain platelets within the target range (Wong, 2017). 
A PK/PD non-inferiority simulation evaluating the durable platelet response during a 26-week course of 
treatment in 10,000 simulated adult ITP patients, using the published eltrombopag PK/PD model (Hayes, 
2011)  and  the  avatrombopag  PK/PD  model  for  ITP,  has  been  conducted  to  provide  additional  data 
comparing the efficacy of avatrombopag versus eltrombopag. 
A single-dose, six-sequence cross-over BA-BE study in healthy adults have been completed (Study AVA-
PED-101).  This  study  determined  the  relative  oral  bioavailability  of  a  pediatric  age-appropriate 
avatrombopag suspension and compared it to the commercial tablet formulation in healthy adult subjects 
under fed and fasted conditions.  
2.4.2 Population PK and PK/PD analyses 
The  popPK  and  popPK/PD  analyses  were  performed  using  NONMEM,  Version  7.3  with  FOCE-I.  All 
graphical analyses were performed using R, Version 3.5.1. Goodness of fit plots were performed using 
Xpose4, Version 4.5.3. Bootstrapping and visual  predictive  checks (VPCs) were conducted  using  Perl-
speaks for NONMEM, Version 4.4.8. 
A  total  of  17067  observation  records  (for  avatrombopag  concentrations)  from  577  healthy  volunteers 
and ITP patients were included in the popPK analysis. A total of 1724 observation records (for platelet 
counts) from 97 ITP patients were included in the popPK/PD analysis. A total of 7 and 12 ITP patients 
were excluded from the popPK and popPK/PD analyses, respectively, due to incomplete data or changes 
in  background  ITP  therapies.  The  total  number  of  BLQ  observations  was  7.61%.  These  records  were 
included with estimated values. No obvious outliers were present in either the popPK or popPK/PD data 
sets.  
PopPK model for ITP-patients 
The  structure  of  the  PK  model  was  a  one-compartment  model  with  zero-order  input  into  the  depot 
compartment  (i.e.,  the  gut)  followed  by  first-order  absorption  and  elimination  in  the  central 
compartment. 
Covariate analysis indicated that moderate or strong dual inducers for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, moderate 
or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors, moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, patient population (healthy or ITP)

and baseline weight all were statistically significant covariates of CL/F1. Weight was also significant for 
V/F1 while formulation was significant for Ka and oral bioavailability F1.  
The  previous  final  model  (Model  25_new)  was  updated  (Model  20)  upon  request.  The  allometric 
coefficient of CL was fixed to 0.75; the effect on Ka was set to be similar for the suspension and the 2G 
tablet but different for the 3G tablet; IOV was added to the relative bioavailability for the 2G tablet; and 
different residual error depending on TAD before or after 4 hours was allowed. 
Parameter estimates from the updated final popPK model (Model 20) of avatrombopag compared to the 
previous model are shown in Table 4. 
Table  4:  Population  PK  parameter  estimates  from  the  updated  final  model  (model  20) 
compared to the previous final model (Model 25_new) (cont’d)  
The models were evaluated by bootstrap analysis, goodness of fit plots and visual predictive check (VPC). 
The pc-VPC plots for healthy subjects and for ITP patients are shown in Figure 7.1.10 at doses 10 mg 
and 20 mg avatrombopag for the previous final model (Model 25_new). Figure 8-2 shows the pc-VPC for 
all time points for the updated final Pop PK model (Model 20).

The population estimates of CL/F1 and V/F1 for avatrombopag were 5.74 L/hr and 235 L, respectively, 
for an average ITP patient of 74.0 kg, that received the 2G tablet formation and no DDI perpetrators. 
Under these conditions, the model-predicted AUC values were 2255 and 3485 ng×hr/mL, respectively, 
for a typical healthy volunteer and a typical ITP patient. The model-predicted AUC values correspond to 
AUC(0-inf) after a single 20 mg dose or AUCss after multiple 20 mg doses at steady state.

PK/PD model for ITP patients 
A six-compartment PK/PD lifespan model (Figure 7) with a linear drug effect on platelet production was 
employed. This model comprised two PK compartments and four PD compartments to characterise the 
relationship between avatrombopag concentrations and platelet count in ITP patients from Studies CL-
003, CL-004, 302 and 305. Individual post-hoc parameter estimates from the final PK model were used 
to generate PK exposure input for the PK/PD model. 
The model was parameterized for the baseline platelet count (BASE) in the blood, SLOPE for the linear 
drug effect on platelet production, zero-order production rate of platelet precursors (KIN) and the first-
order maturation rate constant (KOUT). The first-order platelet degradation rate constant (KDEG) was 
calculated as KIN divided by BASE. The observed individual baseline platelet count (BPLAT) was used as 
the  typical  value  for  a  given  subject,  hence  the  IIV  term  estimated  the  residual  (unexplained)  intra-
individual variability of the baseline value. A proportional error model was used for the residual error for 
the platelet count post-baseline. 
The ITP population PK/PD model were updated upon request. The model structure remained the same 
as  in  the  previous  final  PK/PD  model  submitted  in  the  type  II  variation  (Figure  7).  The  individual 
estimates  from  the  updated  PK  model  were  included  in  the  PK/PD  model.  The  baseline  platelet  count 
(BASE) was estimated; the relationship between SLOPE and observed baseline platelet count (BPLAT) 
was removed. An attempt was made to estimate additive residual error (ADD). However, because the 
estimate of ADD was found to be almost zero with a very large relative standard error (RSE=294%), it 
was removed from the final updated PK/PD model. Even though a relationship between the SLOPE and

observed Baseline platelet count (BPLAT) was still apparent (Figure 9 2), it was no longer statistically 
significant, and was removed from the updated model. 
Table 9 1 shows the population PK/PD parameter estimates and shrinkage values from the updated final 
model (Model 24), compared to the previous final model (Model 32).  
The  updated  parameter  estimates  from  the  NONMEM  output  were  within  the  2.5th-97.5th  percentile 
from  the  bootstrap.  For  the  updated  final  model  (Model  24),  only  2  runs  failed  out  of  100  bootstrap 
replicates, indicating that the updated final model is stable. Goodness of fit plots for the updated final 
population PK/PD model (Model 24) are shown in Figure 9-3.

Model-predicted avatrombopag concentration and platelet count versus time profiles based on the 
previous and updated PK/PD models are shown in Figure 9 6. Model-predicted avatrombopag exposure 
and percentages of ITP patients within different platelet count bins at Week 10 based on the previous 
and updated PK/PD models are shown in Table 9 3 and Table 9 4, respectively.

The  simulation  results  with  the  updated  model  show  that  the  central  tendency  (e.g.,  median  and 
geometric  mean)  of  avatrombopag  concentrations  did  not  change,  but  the  prediction  interval  and 
variability were larger compared to the simulations with the original model. The simulation results also 
show  that  the  distribution  of  patients  within  each  platelet  count  bin  (low,  target,  high,  very  high) 
changed; however, the 20 mg QD was still  predicted to have the largest % of patients  achieving the 
target range using the updated model. 
Overall, the results show that the previous model and the updated model are not substantially different 
from each other.   
Simulation of avatrombopag dose titrations 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021

First simulations with fixed dosing regimen for all subjects (no individualized titration) was conducted to 
evaluate the impact of significant PK and PK/PD covariates on attainment of target platelet counts (50-
150 × 109/L) following avatrombopag 20 mg QD. 500 subjects were included in each simulation scenario 
that  were  based  on  ITP  patients,  the  2G  tablet,  a  weight  of  74  kg,  a  baseline  platelet  count  of  20  × 
109/L,  each  receiving  10  weeks  treatment  followed  by  4  weeks  off-treatment,  with  and  without  DDI 
perpetrators. 
The simulated results suggest that a typical ITP patient (the median line) will have platelet counts well 
within the target range (50-150 × 109/L). See Figure 12. However, there will be some ITP patients who 
are  outside  of  the  target  range  and  need  dose  titration  by  either  adjustment  of  the  dose  or  dosing 
frequency after the initial dose of 20 mg QD.  
Further  simulations  indicated  that  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  platelet  count  is  modest  and  no  dose 
adjustments are required. For a typical ITP patient, the platelet count is predicted to be within the target 
range  after  2  weeks  of  20  mg  QD  dosing  when  the  baseline  platelet  count  is  within  5-30  ×  109/L. 
Therefore,  no  adjustment  of  the  initial  dose  is  needed  with  regard  to  baseline  platelet  count  in  ITP 
patients.  DDI  perpetrators  had  large  effect  on  platelet  counts.  Simulations  showed  that  adjusting  the 
initial  dose  of  avatrombopag  to  40  mg  QD  when  a  moderate  or  strong  dual  inducer  for  CYP2C9  and 
CYP3A4 is present a higher percentage of subjects (45.6%) will achieve the target range compared to 
20 mg QD (39.4%). It also shows that adjusting the initial dose of avatrombopag to 20 mg three times 
a week when a moderate or strong dual inhibitor for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 is present will result in a higher 
percentage of subjects (45.0%) achieving the target range compared to 20 mg QD (36.2%).

For the second round of simulations, a total of 1000 subjects in the base scenario (baseline platelet = 
20 × 109/L, weight = 74 kg, no DDI perpetrators, avatrombopag initial dose = 20 mg QD) went through 
dose adjustments, by modifying as appropriate either the dose or frequency of dosing.  
At each week, the platelet count was binned into 4 bins from low to very high. Based on the bin status 
each week and the observed platelet-count patterns, the subjects were divided into 15 groups. For each 
group,  multiple  titrations  (or  iterations)  were  conducted  with  a  goal  of  maximizing  the  percentage  of 
subjects achieving a platelet count of 50-150 × 109/L. Figure 19 and 22 are two examples of platelet 
profiles for groups that achieved the target range during titration.

The second round of simulations support the following dose titration algorithm with 20 mg QD as the 
initial dose:
The 2nd round simulations demonstrate that when all subjects start with a low baseline platelet count at 
20 × 109/L, by using the dose titration algorithm above, the percentage of subjects achieving the target 
range (50-150 × 109/L) increases over time and stabilizes around Week 10. By the end of the 14-week 
treatment period, 82.4% of the subjects have achieved the target range. At Week 14, the breakdown of 
the 82.4% of subjects who have achieved the target range is as follows: 33.7% from the subjects dosed 
at 20 mg QD dosing without any dose titration, 27.8% through down titration, and 20.9% through up 
titration. See Figure 23.

Initiation of Doptelet at a dose of 20 mg once daily resulted in an increase in platelet count within the 
first 8 days of treatment (Figure 1 below). Table 1 describes the percentage of subjects at each visit with 
thrombocytosis and the corresponding maximum observed platelet count by visit.

Clinical trial simulation 
Eltrombopag  is  another  TPO-RA  approved  for  the  treatment  of  ITP.  The  objective  of  the  clinical  trial 
simulation was to evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag (test) compared to eltrombopag (control) as 
measured by the durable response rate. 
In the population PK model for eltrombopag (Gibiansky, Zhang et al. 2011), body weight, dose <20 mg, 
healthy subjects vs ITP patients, East Asians (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) vs non-East Asians, 
sex,  and  concomitant  corticosteroids  were  significant  covariates.  In  the  population  PK/PD  model  for 
eltrombopag  (Hayes,  Ouellet  et  al.  2011),  sex  and  age  were  significant  covariates.  See  Table  5  for 
demographics of ITP patients for eltrombopag and avatrombopag.

Virtual ITP patients 
After applying a baseline platelet count cutoff <30×109/L (to align with inclusion criteria of Study E5501-
G000-305) and excluding Asian patients, the observed demographic information from a total of 77 ITP 
patients  dosed  with  avatrombopag  were  used  to  create  10,000  virtual  ITP  patients  in  the  simulation 
datasets. The demographic information included age, weight, observed baseline platelet count, sex, race, 
and concurrent corticosteroid use (yes/no). The demographic information for each patient was treated 
as one unit and randomly resampled with replacement to account for correlations across demographic 
covariates.  
Non-inferiority evaluation 
Eltrombopag and avatrombopag treatments were administered to the same virtual 10,000 ITP patients, 
each for 26 weeks. For avatrombopag, the commercial formulation (i.e., the 2G tablet) was used. IIV on 
the observed baseline platelet count was large for avatrombopag (60.7%CV). The value for eltrombopag 
was used in the simulations for both eltrombopag and avatrombopag (i.e., 29.5% CV random variability 
was added to the sampled observed baseline platelet count). Inter occasion variability for the absorption 
rate constant was included in the population PK model for eltrombopag. Residual errors on platelet count 
were large but similar in magnitude between eltrombopag and avatrombopag models. Residual errors 
on the concentration and platelet count were not included in the simulations. 
For the non-inferiority simulations, the doses of both eltrombopag and avatrombopag were titrated to 
maximize the percentage of subjects achieving a platelet count of 50-150×109/L over time. The dose 
titration algorithms were based on the algorithms used in the Study E5501-G000-305 protocol (Phase 3 
study  evaluating  safety  and  efficacy  of  avatrombopag  versus  eltrombopag  in  ITP  patients)  and  were

similar for both treatments. The current simulations did not include DDI perpetrators (i.e., moderate or 
strong dual inducers or moderate or strong dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4). 
The primary  endpoint was the durable  platelet response rate, which was defined as the proportion of 
patients who had at least 75% (e.g., 6 out of 8 weekly monitoring) platelet responses ≥50×109/L during 
the last 8 weeks of the 26-week treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. 
A total of 1000 simulated clinical trial datasets were generated. Each dataset was created by random 
sampling with replacement N=143 avatrombopag  patients and  N=143 eltrombopag  patients from the 
10,000 simulated patients in each treatment group. The sample size of 143 was similar to that of Study 
E5501-G000-305. Each patient was identified as either having or not having a durable platelet response. 
The  null  hypothesis  was  that  avatrombopag  was  not  as  effective  as  eltrombopag.  The  alternative 
hypothesis was that avatrombopag was at least as effective as eltrombopag. Non-inferiority would be 
demonstrated  if  the  upper  bound  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (based  on  normal 
approximation)  for  the  difference  in  the  durable  platelet  response  rate  between  eltrombopag  and 
avatrombopag  (control  –  test)  was  below  15%.  The  choice  of  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  15%  was 
based on a combination of statistical reasoning and clinical judgment. To strengthen the non-inferiority 
comparison, both the pre-specified primary analysis (all patients), and a sensitivity analysis excluding 
the  18.9%  non-responders  of  eltrombopag  (patients  with  a  zero  PD  slope  factor)  were  conducted. 
Individual plots in the population PK/PD analysis for avatrombopag suggested that some subjects may 
also be non-responders to avatrombopag. The IIV for the PD slope factor for avatrombopag was large 
(%CV=123%)  and  would  allow  individual  PD  slope  factors  to  be  small  (=mimicking  non-responders 
behaviour). 
For  avatrombopag,  79.4%  of  the  patients  were  predicted  to  have  a  durable  platelet  response  rate, 
defined as the proportion of patients who had at least 75% platelet responses ≥50×109/L during the last 
8  weeks  of  treatment  over  the  26-week  treatment  period  in  the  absence  of  rescue  therapy.  For 
eltrombopag, 52.5% and 64.7% of the patients were predicted to have a durable platelet response rate 
for the primary analysis (all patients, including 18.9% of patients who had a zero PD slope factor and 
thus not responding to eltrombopag treatment) and sensitivity analysis (excluding the patients with a 
zero PD slope factor), respectively. These durable platelet response rates for eltrombopag are similar to 
the reported durable platelet response of 60% from a 6-month eltrombopag Phase 3 study (RAISE). 
For avatrombopag, the starting dose was 20 mg once daily and the dosing regimen became stable for 
the  entire  population  by  Week  10.  For  eltrombopag,  the  starting  dose  was  50  mg  once  daily  and  the 
dosing regimen became stable for the entire population by Week 6. Eltrombopag reached a stable dosing 
regimen sooner than avatrombopag because eltrombopag had fewer dose levels available for titration. 
See Figure 3.

For avatrombopag, the median platelet count was ≥76×109/L as early as Week 3 and sustained through 
Week 26. For eltrombopag, the median platelet count was 55 and 67×109/L for the primary analysis (all 
patients,  including  18.9%  of  patients  who  had  a  zero  PD  slope  factor  and  thus  not  responding  to 
eltrombopag  treatment)  and  sensitivity  analysis  (excluding  the  patients  with  a  zero  PD  slope  factor), 
respectively.

Overall,  the  difference  in  the  proportion  of  avatrombopag  responders  compared  to  eltrombopag 
responders in the 10,000 simulated patients ranged from 8.4% to 44% in the primary analysis and from 
- 1.4% to 32% in the sensitivity analysis. Thus, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval 
for the difference in the proportion of patients with a durable platelet response between avatrombopag 
and eltrombopag was above -15% for all 1000 simulated trials for both the primary and sensitivity non-
inferiority analyses demonstrating that avatrombopag is non-inferior to eltrombopag.

Absorption 
Below is a summary of ADME properties of avatrombopag. 
Oral administration of the avatrombopag 2G commercial tablet resulted in a short lag time (0.5 to 0.75 
hours) with peak exposure at 6 to 8 hours post-dose. Co-administration with food, irrespective of the 
type  of  food,  significantly  reduced  both  the  inter-  and  intra-subject  variability  in  avatrombopag  PK 
parameters by up to 50%. 
Distribution 
The population estimate of V/F1 for avatrombopag was 235 L in ITP patients. 
Elimination 
The population estimate of CL/F1 for avatrombopag was 5.74 L/hr in ITP patients 
The half-life of avatrombopag was independent of dose and time, approximately 19 hours. 
The primary route of excretion of avatrombopag and its metabolites was by the faecal route (88%). The 
primary metabolite of avatrombopag, the 4-hydroxy derivative, was only detected in faeces (44%). No 
metabolites of avatrombopag were detectable in plasma. 
Avatrombopag metabolism is mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes where CYP2C9 plays the major 
role relative to CYP3A4 in the oxidative metabolism of avatrombopag. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Avatrombopag exhibited linear PK up to the highest tested dose of 80 mg using the 2G tablet formulation. 
Special populations 
There were no clinically important differences in PK or PD parameters between healthy subjects of Asian 
origin  and  white  subjects  administered  avatrombopag.  Avatrombopag  does  not  require  dose 
modifications in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment. Population PK/PD simulations suggest 
that body weight differences in subjects with ITP (ranging from 55 kg – 110 kg) have minimal impact 
on platelet counts. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  new  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  Below  is  a  summary  of  the  effects  observed  with 
avatrombopag in clinical DDI studies. 
Coadministration of rifampin with avatrombopag resulted in mild to moderate induction of avatrombopag 
clearance. Avatrombopag is also a substrate of P-gp transport. Strong P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil 
and  CsA  had  mild,  but  clinically  unimportant  effects  on  systemic  exposures  of  avatrombopag.  Co-
administration  of  a  single  20  mg  dose  of  avatrombopag  with  a  dual  moderate  inhibitor  of  CYP3A  and 
CYP2C9, fluconazole, at study state resulted in a moderate DDI, as demonstrated by an approximately 
2.2-fold  increase  in  avatrombopag  AUC(0-inf)  and  a  17%  increase  in  Cmax.  In  addition,  co-
administration of a single 20 mg dose of avatrombopag with a strong CYP3A and a moderate CYP2C9 
inducer, rifampin, resulted in a mild-moderate interaction as demonstrated  by approximately 0.5-fold 
Assessment report

Page 52/173 
 
 
 
 
 
decrease  in  avatrombopag  AUC(0-inf)  without  any  effect  on  the  Cmax  of  avatrombopag.  In  order  to 
maintain  efficacy,  dose  adjustments  may  be  necessary  when  avatrombopag  is  co-administered  with 
moderate or strong dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors. 
The  PopPK  model  for  ITP  was  able  to  capture  the  magnitude  of  impact  from  the DDI perpetrators  on 
avatrombopag exposure observed in clinical DDI studies with verapamil (P-gp inhibitor, moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor),  cyclosporine  (P-gp  inhibitor,  weak  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A  inhibitor),  fluconazole  (moderate 
inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A), iltraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor, P-gp inhibitor), rifampin (strong 
CYP3A and moderate CYP2C9 inducer, P-gp inducer). See Table 5. 
Simulations of DDI 
Simulations with the final PK/PD model over 14 weeks, indicated that after adjusting the initial dose of 
avatrombopag to 40 mg QD when a moderate or strong dual inducer for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 is present, 
the platelet count is comparable to the base scenario which is no DDI perpetrators and avatrombopag 
20 mg QD dosing. See Figure 14.

Figure 15 shows the simulated effects of a concomitant moderate or strong inhibitor for CYP2C9 only or 
a  moderate  or  strong  inhibitor  for  CYP3A4  only  on  platelet  count  are  very  similar  to  each  other  and 
modest in extent compared to the base scenario. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the initial dose 
(20 mg QD) when avatrombopag is co-administered with an inhibitor for CYP2C9 only or with an inhibitor 
for CYP3A4 only.

Figure 16 shows the effect of concomitant moderate or strong dual inhibitors for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 on 
the platelet count. Among the three dosing regimens evaluated (Top Panel: 20 mg QD; Middle Panel: 20 
mg three times a week; Bottom Panel: 40 mg weekly), 20 mg three times a week was able to produce 
platelet counts comparable to the base scenario.

Although  use  was  limited  during  the  ITP  clinical  studies,  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  and 
pharmacology  of  other  potential  background  ITP  medications  such  as  danazol,  mycophenolate, 
azathioprine,  CsA,  cyclophosphamide,  or  vinca  alkaloids,  these  medications  are  not  expected  to  have 
any clinically meaningful impact on avatrombopag PK or PD. 
With dose adjustments proposed for only moderate or strong dual inhibitors or inducers, the potential 
list of interacting medications is reduced dramatically as described in Table 2. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
There are no new in vitro studies using human biomaterials. 
2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Avatrombopag is an orally active, small molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that 
stimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells 
resulting in increased production of platelets. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A thorough QT study (Study E5501-A001-001) was completed which evaluated the effects of a single 
100 mg dose of avatrombopag using the 1G formulation on the QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia’s formula where QTcF = QT/(RR)1/3 (QTcF).  In this study, avatrombopag had no effect on 
the QTcF interval. Although variability in plasma avatrombopag concentrations were observed with some 
subject’s  exposures  exceeding  300  ng/mL,  as  shown  in  Figure  12  1,  no  relationship  was  identified 
between  avatrombopag  plasma  exposure  and  the  difference  between  avatrombopag  and  placebo  for 
change from Baseline in QT interval.

In  order  to  draw  relevant  conclusions  from  different  formulations  of  avatrombopag  used  during  the 
course of its development, a conversion factor of 0.6 was assigned after comparing relative AUC values 
between the 1G lot used in the thorough QT study and 2G formulations.  Therefore, a 100 mg dose of 
this avatrombopag 1G formulation can be considered, in terms of exposure, equivalent to a 60 mg dose 
of the avatrombopag 2G formulation. The maximum recommended daily ITP dose is 40 mg. 
2.4.5 Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This Type II  variation is for approval of a new doptelet indication for long-term treatment of patients 
with  chronic  immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP).  The  dosage  regimens  are  based  on  one  20  mg  tablet 
strength. The clinical data come from 4 clinical studies conducted in ITP patients earlier Study 501-CL-
003 (Study CL-003), Study 501-CL-004 (Study CL-004), Study E5501-G000-302 (Study 302) and Study 
E5501-G000-305  (Study  305).  No  new  data  have  been  submitted.  The  AVA-PED-101  study 
(avatrombopag  oral  suspension)  will  not  be  assessed  in  this  procedure  as  not  directly  linked  to  the 
indication applied for. 
A dose-dependent rise of platelet counts was observed in study 003. A dose of 20mg was selected as 
startng dose for the phase III trial. There remains uncertainty whether 20mg can be considered an 
optimal starting dose. In a previous SA a starting dose lower than 20mg was advised and a dosage 
justification for the starting dose in the phase III trial was requested. No justification was provided to 
justify the dose recommendation of 20mg in the dossier. As can be seen from the results of the phase 
III study 302, the median daily dose was 19.4mg (please refer to efficacy discussion). In the 
responses to the CHMP question on dosing the MAH discusses information from the Phase 2 dose-
finding studies CL-003 and the roll over CL-004. The responder rate as well as the average daily doses 
are further elaborated suggesting the 20mg dose. However, no justification for the starting dose of 
20mg was provided. The results from studies CL-003 and CL-004 seems to support the starting dose of 
10mg. However, the evidence from Phase 3 studies (study 302 and 305) and post-marketing 
experience from the US seems to support the 20mg starting dose. 
Data from 577 healthy volunteers and 97 ITP patients were included in the PopPK analysis. The Pop PK 
parameters for ITP were estimated from the original 1-compartment model developed for CLD patients 
with only absorption lag time and oral bioavailability fixed. Patient population had significant impact on 
CL. Simulation showed ITP patients had about 50% higher exposure than healthy subjects. Formulation

was a significant covariate of Ka. Less than half of ITP patients received the commercial 2G tablet (42 
patients and 325 observations). DDI perpetrators also had major impact on avatrombopag exposure. 
For the updated final model (Model 20), the population estimate of V/F1 and CL/F1 for avatrombopag 
was 232 L and 5.75 L/hr in ITP patients. Precision of estimated parameters were within acceptable range. 
The random variability was low to moderate for all parameters except for Ka with a CV% of 91.5%. The 
random  effect  of  V1  could  not  be  estimated.  The  pc-VPCs  for  healthy  subjects  indicated  slight 
underprediction of Cmax at doses <60 mg with a better fit at higher doses. The pc-VPCs stratified for 
ITP could capture the observed data after 10 and 20 mg dosing with large prediction intervals. The CHMP 
expressed  concern  that  at  doses  >20  mg,  data  in  ITP  patients  was  too  limited  for  any  meaningful 
interpretation.  The  contribution  of  patient  data  to  the  data  pool  was  considered  low  and  possibly  not 
sufficient to reflect the ITP population. The lack of external validation with patient data was also a concern 
(please refer to the discussion below). 
A  six-compartment  PK/PD  lifespan  model  was  used  to  characterise  the  relationship  between 
avatrombopag concentrations and platelet count in ITP patients. Updating the model improved stability 
and removed the hockey-stick relation between ETA and BPLAT. The prediction intervals of the PK/PD 
model are wide, the precision of parameter estimates range from 6.31%- 50.7%, the random variabilities 
are large (%CV 62.4% - 199%) and the proportional residual error >50%. The predictive value of the 
PK/PD  model  is  considered  limited.  The  MAH  updated  the  PK/PD  model  for  the  ITP  population  as 
requested. The final PK/PD model for ITP patients was used to simulate various dosing scenarios, all with 
a starting dose of 20 mg continued with 20 mg QD with or without dose adjustments for 14 weeks. The 
dose could be adjusted to a less frequent dosing down to 20 mg once weekly or increased up to 40 mg 
QD dosing, giving the option of 6 dose levels. The outcome of the simulations led to the proposed dose 
titration algorithms with 20 mg QD as the starting dose, which is also recommended in the SmPC Section 
4.2.  No  clinical  data  are  available  that  support  the  dosing  adjustments  as  proposed  in  the  SmPC.  To 
address a concern that the patients may drop out of the target range due to fluctuations in relation to 
once  or  twice  weekly  dosing  the  SmPC  Section  4.2  has  been  updated  with  the  suggestion  of  closer 
monitoring at the beginning of treatment and proposals for specific intervals monitoring of the platelet 
count if avatrombopag is not administered on a daily basis. 
The  MAH  provided  a  discussion  on  potential  safety  concerns  related  to  platelet  counts  outside  of  the 
target  range  (50  -  150  x109/L).  Two  subjects  experienced  an  AESI  in  the  Thromboembolic  Events 
category during the time interval of 1 to less than 4 weeks. However, the individual platelet counts of 
these patients at the day of diagnosis were below the applied definition of thrombocytosis (platelet count 
>400×109/L)  and  did  not  indicate  a  direct  relation  to  elevated  platelet  counts  per  se.  Simulations  of 
lower  starting  doses  indicate  that  more  patients  would  remain  below  50  -  150  x109/L  compared  to  a 
starting dose of 20mg. On the other hand, more patients would reach levels above 150 x109/L with the 
20mg starting dose. The MAH argues that in selecting the starting dose of doptelet, the benefit of a rapid 
increase in platelet count to reduce the risk of bleeding must be balanced against the potential risk of 
causing  adverse  events  related  to  platelet  counts  above  the  target  range.  Considering  that  in  clinical 
practice the major goal for treatment in primary ITP is to provide a sufficient platelet count to prevent 
or stop bleeding rather than correcting the platelet count to normal levels (in asymptomatic patients) 
the MAH’s preference for keeping the 20mg starting dose can be endorsed. The risk for thrombocytosis 
is reflected in the SmPC, emphasising careful monitoring of signs, symptoms and platelet counts at the 
beginning of the treatment at least once weekly until a stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 150 x 
109/L has been achieved. Specific recommandations for intervals monitoring of the thrombocyte count 
following  dose  adjustments  of  avatrombopag  are  given  in  Section  4.2.  Hence  the  following 
recommendation is given in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “The recommended starting dose of Doptelet is 20 
mg (1 tablet) once daily with food” and to monitor and make dose adjustment as follows: “After initiating 
therapy, assess platelet counts at least once weekly until a stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 150 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021

x 109/L has been achieved. Twice weekly platelet count monitoring should be conducted during the first 
weeks of therapy in patients receiving avatrombopag only once or twice weekly. Twice weekly monitoring 
should  also  be  conducted  after  dose  adjustments  during  the  treatment.  Due  to  the  potential  risk  of 
platelet  counts  above  400  x  109/L  within  the  first  weeks  of  treatment  patients  should  be  carefully 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of thrombocytosis. After a stable platelet count has been achieved, 
obtain platelet counts at least monthly. After discontinuation of avatrombopag, platelet counts should 
be obtained weekly for at least 4 weeks.” 
CHMP recommends to further evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in the post-marketing setting with 
regards to the dosing recommendations, including the risks associated with the 20mg starting dose and 
platelet  fluctuations  in  the  initial  period  after  treatment  initiation  as  well  as  after  dose  adjustment  to 
once or twice weekly.  
Data from 77 ITP patients dosed with avatrombopag were used to create 10,000 virtual ITP patients by 
sampling with replacement. Multiple simulations were conducted for a virtual non-inferiority trial between 
avatrombopag to eltrombopag. Difference in the proportion of avatrombopag responders compared to 
eltrombopag responders in the 10,000 simulated patients ranged from 8.4% to 44%. Based on these 
results, the company concludes that the non-inferiority criteria of 15% is fulfilled and that avatrombopag 
is “at least as effective” as eltrombopag. The presented non-inferiority evaluation was not accepted by 
the  CHMP.  Due  to  the  heterogeneity  among  ITP  patients,  data  from  77  patients  were  not  considered 
sufficient to reflect the overall patient population. The predictive value of the updated PK/PD model was 
considered limited as based on a limited number of patients and assumptions that were not verifiable, 
for example the distribution of the baseline platelet counts. The lack of external validation precluded the 
assessment of the quality of the Pop PK model and the uncertainties of the PK/PD model were considererd 
too  much.  The  results  presented  by  the  company  did  not  provide  evidence  of  non-inferiority  to 
eltrombopag in the CHMP’s view. The presented simulations could, however, be of value for informing 
dose for future clinical trials in ITP patients. 
No new DDI studies have been conducted. The Pop PK model adequately captured the observed effects 
of DDI perpetrators verapamil, cyclosporine, fluconazole, itraconazole and rifampin on avatrombopag PK 
performed  in  healthy  subjects.  The  MAH  proposed  adjustments  to  the  starting  dose  of  avatrombopag 
based on PK/PD simulations when ITP patients were concomitantly dosed with dual modulators of CYP3A4 
and CYP2C9. The proposed dose adjustments are reflected in the SmPC Section 4.2. The SmPC section 
4.5 mentions that concomitant use of moderate or strong modulators of CYP2C9 may led to changes in 
starting dose in line with the recommendations given for dual inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C9/CYP3A4. 
The SmPC Section 4.2 has also been amended to state that avatrombopag exposure may increase in 
patients with CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 loss-of-function polymorphisms. Poor metabolisers [PMs, n=2]) 
had approximately 2-fold higher exposure compared to subjects wild-type for CYP2C9. 
The thorough QT study evaluated the QTc effects of a single 100 mg dose of avatrombopag using the 
1G formulation. This dose is considered equivalent to 60 mg 2G formulation. ECGs were also monitored 
in patients receiving 40 mg QD during the development program of avatrombopag. No relations were 
identified  between  exposure  and  the  QTc-response.  The  C-QTc  relation  is  considered  sufficiently 
documented to cover also the highest proposed dosing regimen of 40 mg QD in the ITP population. 
2.4.6 Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of avatrompag has been studied in detail. The benefit of a rapid increase in platelet count 
to  reduce  the  risk  of  bleeding  must  be  balanced  against  the  potential  risk  of  causing  adverse  events 
related  to  platelet  counts  above  the  target  range.  Hence,  the  following  recommendation  is  given  in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC: “The recommended starting dose of Doptelet is 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021

with food” and to monitor and make dose adjustment as follows: “After initiating therapy, assess platelet 
counts at least once weekly until a stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 150 x 109/L has been achieved. 
Twice weekly platelet count monitoring should be conducted during the first weeks of therapy in patients 
receiving avatrombopag only once or twice weekly. Twice weekly monitoring should also be conducted 
after dose adjustments during the treatment. Due to the potential risk of platelet counts above 400 x 
109/L  within  the  first  weeks  of  treatment  patients  should  be  carefully  monitored  for  any  signs  or 
symptoms of thrombocytosis. After a stable platelet count has been achieved, obtain platelet counts at 
least monthly. After discontinuation of avatrombopag, platelet counts should be obtained weekly for at 
least 4 weeks.” 
CHMP recommends to further evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in the post-marketing setting with 
regards to the dosing recommendations, including the risks associated with the 20mg starting dose and 
platelet  fluctuations  in  the  initial  period  after  treatment  initiation  as  well  as  after  dose  adjustment  to 
once or twice weekly.  
2.5 Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1 Dose response studies 
Study CL-003 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 
2 study of 4 different doses of avatrombopag taken once daily for 28 consecutive days in adult patients 
with ITP. Subjects were randomly assigned to avatrombopag 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg, or placebo 
in a 3:3:3:3:1 ratio, respectively, for a period of 28 days. Fifteen subjects were to be treated at each 
dose level of avatrombopag, while 5 subjects were to receive placebo. 
Objectives 
• 
Primary:  To  assess  responder  rate  (ie,  platelet  count)  on  Day  28  of  treatment  with  E5501  in 
subjects with ITP.  
•  Secondary: To assess: 1) the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of E5501; 2) 
other  markers  of  effectiveness,  including  peripheral  blood  platelet  count;  and  3)  the 
safety/tolerability of E5501. 
Study CL-003 enrolled 64 subjects, 24 men and 40 women, with chronic ITP that was either refractory 
or  relapsed  after  at  least  one  prior  ITP  therapy;  59  subjects  were  randomized  (3:3:3:3:1)  to 
avatrombopag (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg,) and 5 subjects to placebo. At the end of the study, 
subjects who completed 28 days of treatment were eligible for enrollment in the rollover study (Study 
CL-004).

A  lower  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  Avatrombopag  Treatment  Group  (n=52/59,  88.1%)  completed 
treatment  per  protocol  compared  with  the  Placebo  Treatment  Group  (n=5/5,  100%).  The  majority  of 
subjects from CL-003 (n=53/64; 82.8%) enrolled in the rollover Study CL-004.

The primary efficacy endpoint for Study CL-003 was the Responder Rate on Day 28 for avatrombopag 
versus  placebo  in  subjects  with  chronic  ITP.  Responder  Rate  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  any 
subjects with a Screening Visit B (Day 1) platelet count of <30×109/L who achieved a platelet count of 
≥50×109/L  on  Day  28,  together  with  the  proportion  of  subjects  receiving  steroids  who  had  a  Day  1 
platelet count of ≥30×109/L, but <50×109/L, who achieved a platelet count ≥20×109/L higher than their 
Day 1 platelet count.

Study  501-CL-004:  A  Phase  2,  Parallel-Group,  Rollover  Study  of  AKR-501  in  Patients  With  Chronic 
Idiopathic  Thrombocytopenia  Purpura  (ITP)  Who  Completed  28  Days’  of  Study  Treatment  in  Protocol 
AKR-501-CL-003 
Objectives 
• 
Primary: To assess the safety and tolerability of E5501 administered for an additional 6 months 
in subjects with chronic ITP who completed 28 days’ of treatment in study 501-CL-003. 
•  Secondary: 
Assessment report

o  To evaluate markers of effectiveness of E5501, including changes in, and maintenance 
of, peripheral blood platelet count (PC) and decreasing need for ITP-directed concomitant 
medications. 
o  To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  the  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD) relationship of E5501 in subjects with ITP. 
In  Study  CL-004,  subjects  who  had  responded  to  treatment  in  Study  CL-003  were  able  to  continue 
receiving the same double-blind study treatment and daily dose (placebo or avatrombopag 2.5, 5, 10, 
or 20 mg) to which they had been randomly assigned in Study CL-003; dose titration (2.5 to 40 mg) 
was also permitted in Study CL-004. The blind was maintained in Study CL-004 to ensure that the data 
from the then ongoing Study CL-003 were not unblinded before the latter study was completed. Subjects 
who did not meet the primary response criteria in Study CL-003 (ie, “Non-Responders”) were also eligible 
to enter this rollover study and receive open-label avatrombopag at a starting dose of 10 mg once daily. 
Sixty-four subjects enrolled in Study CL-003; among them, 53 subjects continued into the rollover study, 
Study CL-004, at a total of 17 centers. Of the 11 subjects who did not continue into Study CL-004, 7 
were ineligible for enrollment in Study CL-004 after having withdrawn prematurely from Study CL-003. 
The remaining 4 subjects completed Study CL-003 but chose not to participate in Study CL-004. 
The  FAS  population  included  the  53  subjects  who  enrolled  in  Study  CL-004.  Of  those  53  subjects, 
approximately  two-thirds  (66%)  completed  the  6-month  treatment  period.  A  higher  percentage  of 
subjects  in  the  Responder  group  (20/25,  80%)  completed  treatment  per  protocol  compared  with  the 
Non-Responder group (15/28, 53.6%).

At most time points, median platelet counts were higher in the 10 mg and 20 mg Responder dose groups 
compared with the 5 mg Responder dose group. Median platelet counts among Non-Responders, who 
received  open-label  treatment  with  avatrombopag  10  mg,  increased  most  noticeably  in  subjects  who 
had previously received placebo or the lower avatrombopag doses (2.5 mg or 5 mg), suggesting that 
some subjects need a higher dose of avatrombopag to demonstrate a platelet response.

Proportion of subjects who achieved a Durable Response, defined as subjects who had at least 3 platelet 
count values measured in the last 14 weeks of the 24-week treatment period in Study CL-004 and whose 
platelet count was at a response level for at least 75% of the measured values during those 14 weeks. 
Also, the subject could not have received rescue medication during the 24-week treatment period. The 
last 14 weeks of the treatment period comprised seven analysis windows, at the Weeks 12, 14, 16, 18, 
20, 22, and 24 time points. Windows with missing platelet counts were not included. In addition:

o Subjects with fewer than three windows with non-missing platelet counts were classified as failures for 
Durable Response; 
o Subjects who received any rescue medication to control their platelet count during Study CL-004 were 
considered failures for Durable Response; 
o  A  “cured”  subject  was  one  who  had  an  early  response  to  avatrombopag  and  no  longer  required 
avatrombopag to maintain a high platelet count, but who remained in the study for the entire duration 
of the planned 24-week treatment period. Classification of these subjects was based on assessment by 
clinical review. 
For the FAS, the observed Durable Response Rate during the 6-month treatment period was 52.8% for 
all subjects, 72.0% for Responders, and 35.7% for Non-Responders

Study  E5501-G000-202  was  one  of  4  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies 
conducted in subjects with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver disease (N=604 in total), and one of 2 
Phase 2 studies, which included N randomized=130 patients, avatrombopag-FAS=93. Subjects received 
daily dosing with avatrombopag (10, 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg, with loading doses of 80 or 100 mg in Study 
202) for 5 days, 10 to 13 days prior to the date of the planned, invasive procedure (the endpoint event). 
The E5501-G000--202 study is thus supportive, because the pathophysiologic circumstances are very 
different from ITP. A dose-response was also documented in liver-associated thrombocytopenia, and the 
study proved the principle to use avatrombopag as a TPO-analogue in acquired thrombocytopenia. 
The  starting  dose  of  avatrombopag  used  in  the  Phase  3  protocols  requiring  chronic  dosing  with 
avatrombopag with subsequent titration was based on: 
• Safety and efficacy evaluations from the results from the Phase 2 study (501-CL-003) in subjects with 
ITP 
• PK analysis from all Phase 1 studies and 3 Phase 2 studies (2 studies in chronic ITP [501-CL-003 and 
501-CL-004] and 1 study conducted in subjects with thrombocytopenia-induced liver disease [E5501-
G000-202]) 
• Sequential PK/PD modeling using data from Study 501-CL-003 followed by PK/PD simulations. 
In Phase 3 trials requiring chronic dosing in subjects with ITP, the primary objectives for the selected 
avatrombopag starting dose were to raise and to maintain the platelet counts and a secondary objective 
Assessment report

was  to  decrease  the  need  for  concomitant  ITP  medications  (if  applicable).  The  avatrombopag  dose 
regimen  (20-mg  starting  dose  followed  by  flexible-dosing  regimen  to  optimize  and  maintain  platelet 
response  for  individual  ITP  subjects  was  designed  to  produce  a  rapid  platelet  response  that  could  be 
maintained for the 6-month treatment period. Titration of study drug was performed in accordance with 
protocol-specified titration guidelines in order to find the minimum dose required to maintain platelet 
counts of ≥50 × 109/L and ≤150 × 109/L.

Those  subjects  who  met  all  the  eligibility  requirements  and  who  were  willing  and  able  entered  the 
Extension Phase. Subjects who discontinued the Core Study early because of lack of treatment effect 
remained eligible to continue into the Extension Phase. Subjects who entered directly into the Extension 
Phase did not enter the Dose-tapering and Follow up Periods of the Core Study. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key Inclusion Criteria 
Core Study 
1. Male or female, ≥18 years of age. 
2.  Diagnosed  with  chronic  ITP  (≥12  months  duration)  according  to  the  American  Society  for 
Hematology/British Committee for Standards in Hematology (ASH/BCSH) guidelines, and an average of 
2 platelet counts <30 × 109/L (no single count should have been >35 × 109/L). In addition, a peripheral 
blood  smear  should  have  supported  the  diagnosis  of  ITP  with  no  evidence  of  other  causes  of 
thrombocytopenia (eg, pseudothrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis). The physical examination was not to 
have suggested any disease that might have caused thrombocytopenia other than ITP. 
3.  Previously  received  1  or  more  ITP  therapies  (including,  but  not  limited  to  corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins, azathioprine, danazol, cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab). 
4. Must have either initially responded (platelet count >50 × 109/L) to a previous ITP therapy or have 
had a bone marrow examination consistent with ITP within 3 years to rule out myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) or other causes of thrombocytopenia. 
5. Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time must have 
been within 80% to 120% of the normal range with no history of hypercoagulable state. 
6. Had a complete blood count (excluding platelet count), within the reference range (with white blood 
cell  (WBC)  differential  not  indicative  of  any  significant  hematological  disorder),  with  the  following 
exceptions: 
• Hemoglobin: Subjects with hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL (100 g/L) and the lower limit of normal 
(LLN) were eligible for inclusion, if anemia was clearly attributable to ITP (excessive blood loss) 
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL (1.5 x 109/L) 
•  Elevated  WBC  or  ANC  (eg,  due  to  corticosteroid  treatment)  provided  this  was  discussed  with  the 
medical monitor 
7. Females could not be pregnant at screening or baseline (as documented by a negative serum beta-
human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test with a minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of β-
hCG).  A  separate  baseline  assessment  was  required  if  a  negative  screening  pregnancy  test  had  been 
obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. 
8. All females were considered to be of childbearing potential unless they were postmenopausal (at least 
12 months' consecutive amenorrhea, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected 
cause)  or  had  been  sterilized  surgically  (ie,  bilateral  tubal  ligation,  hysterectomy,  or  bilateral 
oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

9. Females of childbearing potential were to not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days 
prior to study entry and had to agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, abstinence, 
an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method such as condom + spermicide or condom + diaphragm 
with  spermicide,  a  contraceptive  implant/injection,  or  have  a  vasectomized  partner  with  confirmed 
azoospermia)  throughout  the  entire  study  period  and  for  30  days  after  study  drug  discontinuation.  If 
currently abstinent, the subject had to agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if they 
became sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Females 
who were using hormonal contraceptives had to be on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive 
product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and had to continue to use the same contraceptive during the 
study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. 
10. Provide written informed consent. 
11. Were willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol. 
Extension Phase 
1.  Completed  6  months  of  study  treatment  in  the  Randomization  Phase  provided  the  open-label 
Extension Phase was still ongoing. 
2.  Discontinued  from  the  Core  Study  early  due  to  lack  of  treatment  effects  provided  the  open-label

Treatments 
Identity of Investigational Products (Chemical Name, Structural Formula, Etc. of 
Avatrombopag) 
• Test drug code: E5501 
• Generic name: avatrombopag maleate 
• Chemical name: 1-(3-chloro-5-{[4-(4-chloro-2-thienyl)-5-(4-cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-
yl]carbamoyl}-2-pyridyl) piperidine-4-carboxylic acid monomaleate 
• Molecular formula: C29H34Cl2N6O3S2C4H4O4 
• Molecular weight: 765.73 (free form 649.66; conversion factor 1.179) 
Treatments Administered 
Core Study 
Avatrombopag treatment group: avatrombopag administered orally as 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40-mg doses, 
in a flexible dose design. 
Avatrombopag was started at a dose of 20 mg, with dose titration down to 5 mg or up to 40 mg as per 
specified guidelines. 
Placebo treatment group: placebo administered orally to match the 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40-mg doses, in a 
flexible dose design. 
Extension Phase 
Subjects who entered the Extension Phase received a starting dose of 20 mg once daily of open-label 
avatrombopag and underwent dose titration in accordance with protocol-specified titration guidelines. 
Subjects  who  discontinued  the  Core  Study  early  because  of  lack  of  treatment  effect  and  entered  the 
Extension Phase received open-label avatrombopag treatment at a starting dose of 20 mg once daily. 
Study Drug Dose Adjustment Guidelines 
Avatrombopag (or matching Placebo) was started at a dose of 20 mg. Subjects were allowed to have 
their dose titrated up (maximum dose 40 mg for avatrombopag or matching placebo) or down (minimum 
dose 5 mg or matching placebo) in accordance with their individual response to study drug; a placebo 
titration was used to maintain the blind. The overall goal of any dose modification was to maintain the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 77/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
peripheral platelet count ≥50 × 109/L and ≤150 × 109/L, and to decrease the need for concomitant ITP 
medications, if possible.  
Investigators were to consider dose adjustment in accordance with a subject’s platelet counts every 2 
weeks (as most subjects take approximately 10 to 14 days to demonstrate the full effect of study drug 
on platelet count). However, dose adjustment was performed weekly for subjects with platelet counts 
<50 × 109/L or >250 × 109/L. If the platelet count remained >250 × 109/L after 3 consecutive weeks, 
the subject’s concomitant ITP medication, if possible, was to be down titrated provided: 
a) the subject was in the concomitant ITP medication reduction period of the Core Study (ie, Visits 8 to 
13) or 
b) maintenance period/concomitant ITP medication reduction period of the Extension Phase (ie, Visits 
E9 to E31). 
Otherwise, the subject was to be discontinued. Avatrombopag dose adjustments in the Extension Phase 
of the study were identical to those of the Core Study but were performed with open-label avatrombopag, 
as defined by avatrombopag dose adjustment guidance for the Extension Phase (see Table 2). 
Lack of treatment effect was defined as: 
o Platelet count remained <30 × 109/L after more than 3 weeks at the maximum dose (subjects could 
be discontinued after 7 days of therapy at the maximum dose if they had dangerously low platelet counts 
in the opinion of the investigator) or 
o Subjects who required rescue therapy more than 3 times or continuous rescue therapy for more than 
3 weeks (Core Study only).

Permitted Concomitant Therapy 
Subjects were instructed to contact site personnel before starting any new treatments. Treatments not 
specified as prohibited were permitted during the study. 
Permitted ITP concomitant background therapies were as follows: 
• Corticosteroids and/or azathioprine taken at a stable dose for 4 weeks before randomization 
• MMF or danazol taken at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before randomization 
• CsA (due to the fact that it is a P-glycoprotein–mediated transport [P-gp] inhibitor) was to be avoided 
unless  deemed  medically  necessary;  CsA  taken  at  a  stable  dose  for  at  least  12  weeks  before 
randomization.  
At the discretion of the investigator, subjects were allowed to use aspirin, other salicylates, or approved 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists, (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel) during the study once 
their platelet count had risen. 
Subjects treated with PPIs and H2 antagonist therapy received a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior 
to randomization. Treatment with these therapies must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to 
randomization. 
Avatrombopag is a substrate and an inhibitor of P-gp. Co-administration with strong inhibitors of P-gp 
was  to  be  avoided  unless  deemed  medically  necessary.  If  a  strong  P-gp  inhibitor  was  added  to 
avatrombopag therapy or if the dose of a concomitantly-administered strong P-gp inhibitor was altered, 
platelet counts were monitored weekly for the following 3 weeks, as a dose adjustment of avatrombopag 
may have been required. If avatrombopag was administered with any concomitant medications which 
are  substrates  of  P-gp,  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  or  blood  levels  (if  available)  of  these  concomitant 
medications were assessed. 
Rescue Therapies 
Subjects were allowed to receive rescue therapy at the discretion of the investigator or subinvestigator 
based  on  clinical  assessment.  Rescue  therapy  was  to  be  considered  if  there  was  an  urgent  need  to 
increase platelet count, for example: 
• Life-threatening thrombocytopenia, such as a platelet count <10 × 109/L 
• Major bleed 
• Clinical signs or symptoms suggesting potential bleed (ie, wet purpura) 
Rescue therapy was defined as: 
•  The  addition  of  any  new  ITP  medication  or  medication  to  treat  thrombocytopenia  (for  example): 
Corticosteroids; IVIg therapy; Anti-D therapy; MMF; Azathioprine; Danazol; Dapsone; CsA (Due to the 
fact that it is a P-gp inhibitor, CsA was to be avoided unless deemed medically necessary and/or no other 
suitable  alternative  treatment  options  are  available);  Platelet  transfusion;  Any  increase  in  a  baseline 
dose of a concomitant ITP medication. TPO agonists were not allowed as rescue therapy. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy 
Platelet  transfusion  was  prohibited  within  7  days  before  the  first  dose  of  study  drug.  Antifibrinolytic 
agents (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and aminocaproic acid) and recombinant activated factor VII were 
prohibited  during  the  treatment  phase  of  the  study.  Heparin,  warfarin,  factor  Xa  inhibitors,  direct 
thrombin  inhibitors,  fresh  frozen  plasma  and  cryoprecipitate,  chronic  antiplatelet  therapy  (>4  weeks) 
with aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine, or glycoprotein Ib/IIIa antagonists (eg, tirofiban) were

prohibited during the treatment phase of the study. However, short-term use of aspirin, other salicylates, 
or  ADP  receptor  antagonists  were  permitted  only  if  the  platelet  count  had  risen  and  the  investigator 
judged  that  the  subject  was  at  risk  for  thromboembolism.  The  use  of  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory 
drugs other than aspirin for more than 7 days per month was prohibited. 
Some  ITP  therapies/procedures,  such  as  vinca  alkaloids,  cyclophosphamide,  rituximab,  splenectomy, 
and other TPO receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim) were prohibited during the treatment phase 
due  to  the  long-term  effects  of  these  treatments,  their  safety  profile,  and  their  potential  to  confound 
efficacy results. Subjects requiring these therapies were discontinued from the study.

Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) and Health Outcome Economics 
•  Medical  Outcomes  Study  36-Item  Short  Term  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  Treatment  Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TQSM), and European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scale scores 
• Health outcome economics 
Extension Phase Study Endpoints  
The  effectiveness  of  avatrombopag  was  assessed  by  measuring  platelet  counts,  reduction  in  use  of 
concomitant ITP medication, and bleeding events. Specifically, 
• Median platelet count of all subjects at selected time points (monthly) 
• Proportion of subjects needing rescue therapy 
• Incidence and severity of bleeding (in accordance with the WHO Bleeding Scale) 
Sample size 
Based on data from the completed avatrombopag Phase 2 chronic ITP clinical trial, Study 501-CL-003, 
the  cumulative  number  of  weeks  of  platelet  response  during  the  4-week  treatment  period  (primary 
endpoint, last observation carried forward [LOCF]) was confirmed for placebo and avatrombopag 20 mg, 
respectively as follows: 
Using a resampling method based on Study 501-CL-003 results, and assuming a 15% dropout rate with 
all dropout subjects being considered to have 0 weeks of platelet response, a total sample size of 45 
subjects, 15 subjects in the placebo group and 30 subjects in avatrombopag group, would have more 
than 95% power to detect a treatment difference between avatrombopag and placebo in the cumulative 
number of weeks of platelet response during the 4-week treatment period using Wilcoxon rank sum test 
at a 2-sided α=0.05 significant level. Conservatively, assuming a treatment difference in the cumulative 
number of weeks of platelet response would be preserved with longer duration of treatment, the sample 
size of 45 subjects would have more than 95% power to detect a treatment difference in the cumulative 
number of weeks of platelet response during 6 months of treatment between avatrombopag and placebo 
using Wilcoxon rank sum test at a 2-sided α=0.05 significant level. 
Assuming the platelet response rate at Day 8 was 20% for placebo and 86% for avatrombopag, a total 
sample size of 45 subjects would have more than 99% power to detect a treatment difference in platelet 
response rate at Day 8 using the Fisher’s exact method at the 2-sided α=0.05 significance level. 
Randomisation 
Subjects whose screening assessments and evaluations were completed and reviewed by the principal 
investigator  and  who  continued  to  meet  all  of  the  inclusion  and  none  of  the  exclusion  criteria  were 
entered into the Randomization Phase. 
Subjects were centrally stratified by splenectomy status and baseline platelet count (≤15 x 109/L or >15 
to <30 x 109/L), and use of concomitant ITP medication (ie, yes or no for the use of concomitant ITP 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 82/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medication) at baseline and were randomly assigned to either avatrombopag or placebo treatment group 
in a 2:1 ratio.  
Avatrombopag or placebo was administered orally in a flexible dose design. The Randomization Phase 
lasted  for  26  weeks  for  subjects  who  rolled  over  into  the  open-label  Extension  Phase  and  included  4 
periods: Baseline, Titration, Concomitant ITP Medication Reduction, and Maintenance. 
Subjects who did not achieve a platelet count of ≥30 × 109/L during the Randomization Phase despite 
upward titration to the maximum dose were classified as having a lack of treatment effect. Subjects who 
met the criteria for a lack of treatment effect were able to enter the open-label extension directly. 
For those subjects who did not roll over, the Randomization Phase was 26 weeks in duration, followed 
by a dose-taper period of up to 4 weeks and a 4-week Follow-up Period. Subjects who required study 
drug dose adjustments, who underwent concomitant ITP medication reduction, or who received rescue 
therapy during the periods of Concomitant Medication Reduction and Maintenance Periods were required 
to return for weekly visits for 3 consecutive weeks. 
Baseline/Randomization Period (Visit 2) 
During this period, baseline assessments, including platelet count and randomization, were performed. 
Blinded  study  drug  administration  was  started.  Subjects  were  required  to  have  their  platelet  counts 
available before randomization in order to be assessed for eligibility. 
Blinding (masking) 
During  the  Randomization  Phase,  the  subject  and  all  personnel  involved  with  the  conduct  and  the 
interpretation of the study, including the investigators, investigational site personnel, and sponsor staff, 
were blinded to the treatment codes (but not dose levels).  
Randomization data were kept strictly confidential, filed securely by an appropriate group at the sponsor 
or designated CRO, and accessible only to authorized persons (eg, Eisai Global Safety) until the time of 
unblinding, per SOPs. 
A  master  list  of  all  treatments  was  maintained  in  a  sealed  envelope  with  the  sponsor.  Corresponding 
subject  numbers  associated  with  treatment  were  blinded  in  the  IxRS  database.  In  the  event  that 
emergency conditions required knowledge of the study treatment given, the blind was broken via the 
code breaker facility within the IxRS. The Extension Phase was not blinded. 
An independent DSMB was established to monitor accumulating safety data. The DSMB safety interim 
analysis was performed by an independent statistician and governed by an external DSMB. To maintain 
the  blinding  and  integrity  of  the  study,  procedures  were  implemented  to  ensure  the  DSMB  and 
independent statistician has sole access to unblinded interim safety data. 
Statistical methods 
Definitions of Analysis Sets 
The populations of interest for Core Study will be defined as follows: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will include all subjects who are randomized into the study. The FAS 
will be analyzed as randomized. 
Per  Protocol  Set  (PP):  The  PP  set  will  include  all  randomized  subjects  who  receive  protocol-assigned 
study drug and who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
• Subjects who have any major protocol violations (major inclusion/exclusion violations, [eg, subject did 
not have cITP]) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 83/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Subjects who use a prohibited concomitant medication that affects the assessment of study endpoints 
• Subjects who skip more than 20% of their daily dose for a reason other than a high platelet count 
• Subjects who have major protocol deviations that impact the platelet count evaluation, such as both 
study drug and/or concomitant ITP medication dose-adjustment deviations. 
A comprehensive list of subjects to be excluded from the PP population will be agreed upon by the study 
team and documented prior to database lock. 
Safety Set: The safety set will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have a 
postdose safety assessment. The Safety Set will be analyzed as treated. 
The FAS will be used as the primary population for all efficacy analyses for Core Study, while the PP will 
be used in supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint.   
Primary endpoint: Cumulative number of weeks of platelet response 
The cumulative number of weeks of platelet response is defined as the cumulative number of weeks in 
which the platelet count ≥50 x 109/L during 6-month treatment (ie, at Visit 3 to 22 inclusive) of Core 
Study in the absence of rescue therapy. A platelet response is defined as a platelet count of ≥50 x 109/L. 
Nonresponse is defined as a platelet count of <50 x 109/L. 
The comparison of the cumulative number of weeks of platelet response of avatrombopag (in addition 
to  standard  of  care)  is  same  as  that  of  placebo  (in  addition  to  standard  of  care)  will  be  tested  using 
Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 2-sided α=0.05 significance level.  
Subjects using rescue therapy at any time during 6 months of treatment period will be considered to not 
have any platelet responses at all subsequent scheduled time points after rescue therapy. 
First key secondary efficacy endpoint: platelet response rate at Day 8 
Platelet response rate at Day 8, is defined as the proportion of subjects with a platelet count ≥50 x 109/L 
at Day 8.  
The platelet response rate at Day 8 of avatrombopag (in addition to standard of care) will be compared 
to that of placebo (in addition to standard of care) using CMH test adjusting for splenectomy status (yes 
and  no)  and  baseline  platelet  count  (≤15  x  109/L  and  >15  to  <30  x109/L)  at  the  2-sided  α=0.05 
significance level as long as none of the marginal cells equal to 0. If any of the marginal cells count is 
equal to 0, the Fisher’s exact test will be used. 
A 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in platelet response at Day 8 between placebo and avatrombopag 
will be calculated using normal approximation. In addition, a 2-sided 95% CI for platelet response at 
Day 8 will be calculated for each treatment group using normal approximation method. 
Second key secondary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects with a reduction in use of 
concomitant ITP medications from baseline 
Only subjects with use of concomitant ITP medications at baseline will be included in the analysis. If a 
subject has use of concomitant ITP medication at baseline, has no use of rescue therapy during the 6-
month treatment period, and has at least one concomitant ITP medication dose reduced from baseline 
level during  the whole maintenance period, this subject is considered as having a reduction in use of 
concomitant ITP medication from baseline. 
This endpoint will be analyzed the same way as for the first key secondary endpoint. 
Handling of Missing Data, Dropouts, and Outliers for all  
Unless  stated  otherwise,  for  platelet  counts,  missing  platelet  assessments  at  a  specific  visit  will  be 
considered to be a nonresponse at that visit. Subjects who discontinue the study or who are lost to follow 
up  before  the  6-month  treatment  period  will  have  all  subsequent  unobserved  scheduled  platelet 
assessments at the scheduled visits as having missing platelet values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 84/173 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless stated otherwise, a platelet count that occurs within 8 weeks after rescue therapies are used will 
be considered as a nonresponse in any analysis of platelet response.

Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
The single primary efficacy endpoint will be tested for superiority. Therefore, no adjustment on type I 
error for multiple comparison for primary efficacy analysis is necessary. 
For 2 key secondary endpoints, the multiplicity is adjusted in a fixed sequential fashion. The comparison 
platelet  response  at  Day 8  between  avatrombopag  and  placebo  will  be  performed  first  at  the  2-sided 
α=0.05 significance level. If this testing is significant, then the comparison of proportion of subjects with 
a reduction in use of concomitant ITP medications from baseline will be performed at the 2-sided α=0.05 
significance level. 
No  interim  efficacy  analysis  is  planned  for  the  Core  study,  thus  no  alpha  spending  or  multiplicity 
adjustment was necessary. 
Results 
Participant flow 
E5501-G000-302 was conducted between 06 Feb 2012 and 28 Nov 2013 at 27 study sites worldwide. 
Study completion was the date the last subject completed the Core Study, at which point, the open-label 
Extension  Phase  were  terminated.  Although  the  E5501-G000-302  study  was  completed,  1  subject 
remained ongoing until 09 April 2015. The disposition of subjects up to the database lock of 10 Mar 2014 
is displayed in Table 7. 
A total of 100 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these 100 subjects, 51 were screen 
failures and 49 were randomized into the study. Of the 51 screen failures, 42 (42.0%) subjects failed to 
meet inclusion or exclusion criteria, 6 (6.0%) failed for the reason of ‘Other’, 2 (2.0%) failed due to an 
AE, and 1 (1.0%) subject was excluded for withdrawal of consent.

10 subjects who received avatrombopag in the Core phase and discontinued the Core phase, 7 of 
whom entered the Extension phase. Three of these 7 subjects who entered the Extension phase 
completed, 3 subjects discontinued, and one subject continued to receive open-label avatrombopag 
after database lock. 
Two placebo subjects, including the one who completed the Core phase, did not enrol in the Extension 
phase and 15 entered the Extension phase after discontinuing the Core Phase. Of these 15 subjects who 
entered the Extension, 14 completed the Extension phase and one discontinued due to an AE after 155 
days. 
Recruitment 
This study was a multicenter study with 27 investigator sites participating. Due to the small expected 
number of subjects in each center, the efficacy analyses were performed with all centers pooled across 
the  study  unless  stated  otherwise  and  consistency  of  results  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  were 
examined by the geographic region. The first informed consent form (ICF) was signed on 06 Feb 2012. 
All subjects exited the study by 26 Nov 2013, except for 1 subject, who continued in the study under 
Protocol Amendment 01 until 09 Apr 2015. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The original protocol was dated 07 Jun 2011, and planned for 84 subjects in total, 28 placebo and 56 
active, and ending with 45 patients in the final protocol 302. Protocol Amendment 01 was dated 15 Jun 
2012 and Protocol Amendment 02 was dated 25 March 2013. The following significant changes to the 
protocol were a result of Amendment 01: 
• The ability of subjects to be permanently discontinued at the discretion of the investigator after 7 days 
of therapy at the maximum dose if they had dangerously low platelet counts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 86/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• P-gP wording was revised to include strong P-gP inhibitor was to be added to avatrombopag therapy 
or if the dose of a concomitantly administered strong P-gP inhibitor was altered, platelet counts would 
be monitored weekly for the next 3 weeks in the event a dose adjustment of avatrombopag was required. 
• Wording was added to the inclusion criteria that patients with neutrophil counts above the reference 
range may be enrolled upon review and discussion with the Eisai medical monitor. 
•  The  fasting  gastrin-17  exclusion  requirement  was  increased  to  1.5  times  ULN  for  those  subjects  on 
PPIs or H2 antagonists. 
• Time-to-first bleeding event and time-to-first bleeding event with WHO Bleeding Scale score endpoints 
were included to align the current study with analyses planned in the E5501-G000-305 study. 
•  Repeat  screening  laboratory  evaluations  due  to  potential  laboratory  error  or  a  transient  and/or 
reversible condition were to be made available prior to Randomization. 
• The ability to remove subjects based on gastric biomarkers was added. 
•  Lack  of  treatment  effect  was  defined  to  allow  subjects  with  very  low  platelet  counts  to  discontinue 
earlier due to lack of treatment effect and continue into the Extension Phase. 
• A follow-up endoscopy was requested if there was a significant abnormal endoscopy during the study. 
Per Amendment 02, dated 25 Mar 2013, the study was complete after the last subject completed the 
Core Study. The primary reason for the amendment was to change the primary endpoint to cumulative 
platelet  response  as  the  study  was  completed  after  the  last  subject  completed  the  Core  Study.  As  a 
result, other changes were also made to the protocol: 
• A secondary objective was made an exploratory objective. 
•  The  secondary  objective  for  the  Extension  Phase  to  assess  the  reduction  in  the  use  of  steroids  and 
concomitant ITP medication in subjects receiving avatrombopag was removed. 
• The effectiveness assessments for the Extension Phase were revised. 
• The key secondary endpoint was redefined as exploratory. 
• The target sample size was changed to 45 subjects. 
• The criterion that 35% of splenectomized subjects will be enrolled in the study was removed. 
• The inclusion criterion for subjects enrolling in the Extension Phase to align with study completion was 
clarified. 
• The population PK/PD analysis was revised. 
• Study completion was defined. 
Amendment 02 was not approved in the Netherlands by the ethics committee. One subject remained on 
study through the 2-year Extension Phase per Amendment 01. When all other subjects completed the 
study  per  Amendment  02,  the  database  was  locked  on  10  Mar  2014  and  the  data  were  analyzed, 
including Subject 16001001’s data up to that point in time. 
Other Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
There were no other changes in the conduct of the study.

Changes to the Planned Analyses 
The original SAP for the Core Study (Version 1.1) was based on the original protocol, and the original 
SAP for the Extension Phase (Version 1.0) was based on Protocol Amendment 01. With the significant 
changes including study objectives, primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, and sample size rationale, 
etc. made to Protocol Amendment 02, SAP (Version 2.0) was updated to reflect those changes and to 
integrate the planned analyses of the Core Study and Extension Phase into 1 document. Before the 
database lock and treatment unblinding, SAP (Version 2.1), was updated for the definition of “bone 
marrow pathology” to ensure there is no overlap between neoplastic events and bone marrow 
pathology AEs of special interest reporting, 1 of AEs of special interest. The significant changes to the 
planned analyses in SAP (Version 2.1) included the analyses not performed and the change of “bone 
marrow pathology” definition. 
The analyses of following efficacy endpoints and QoL outcome specified in study Protocol Amendment 
02 were not performed: 
Core Study 
• Per Protocol Set (PP) and sensitivity analyses based on PP analysis set 
• Alternative durable platelet response rate 
• Proportion of subjects who have at least 6 out of 8 (ie, ≥75%) weekly platelet responses (≥50 x 
109/L) during the last 8 weeks of treatment (ie, at Visit 15 to 22 inclusive) over the 6-month treatment 
period in the absence of rescue therapy and who do not have excessive bleeding (≥Grade 3 WHO 
Bleeding Scale score) 
• Time-to-first bleeding event 
• Time-to-first bleeding event with WHO Bleeding scale score ≥ Grade 3 
• Outcome of TSQM 
Extension Phase 
• Proportion of subjects needing rescue therapy 
• Incidence and severity of bleeding (in accordance with the WHO Bleeding Scale) The definition of 
bone marrow pathology was changed to bone marrow pathology (excluding neoplasms) to ensure 
there was no overlap between neoplastic events and bone marrow pathology AEs of special interest 
reporting. MedDRA SOC ‘Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)’ 
were excluded from the definition of bone marrow pathology, and the PTs listed in Appendix IV were 
updated to exclude PTs belonging to neoplastic events. 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations for the Core Study are presented in Table 14.1.1.3.1 and in Table 14.1.1.3.2 
for the Extension Phase. Major protocol deviations were conservatively defined as deviations from the 
protocol that included inadequate or improper informed consent procedure, missed visits or laboratory 
tests, study drug dispensed or dosing deviations, inclusion/exclusion issues, and failure to report any 
SAE according to the protocol. A total of 31 subjects (63.3%) had major protocol deviations.

The primary endpoint “cumulative number of weeks with platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L” is met, as the 
median number of weeks with platelet counts above threshold in the avatrombopag treatment group is 
significantly higher compared to the median number of weeks in the placebo group (12.4 and 0 weeks, 
respectively). This response was stable for at least half a year (core study) and was also be maintained 
for more than a year (extension study).

Adverse  events  of  special  interest  in  Study  302  included  Grade  3  or  4  bleeding  events  and  are 
summarised  for the Core and Extension phases in  Study 302 for treatment-emergent  and treatment-
related,  treatment-emergent  events,  respectively.    Three  patients  experienced  Grade  3  or  4  bleeding 
events,  with  preferred  terms  of  gingival  bleeding,  epistaxis,  and  gastritis  haemorrhagic  (Study  302).  
Only 1 patient experienced a treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 bleeding event, with a preferred term of 
epistaxis  (Study  302  CSR).    These  incidence  rates  are  similar,  despite  the  much  greater  exposure  to 
avatrombopag  in  the  Extension  phase,  to  the  Core  phase  of  the  study  in  which  one  patient  had  a 
treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 TEAE bleeding event of epistaxis.

Overall platelet response in the Core study was generally maintained throughout the extension up until 
around Week 36 (Figure 4). Beyond Week 38, platelet response was noted to be lower and considerably 
more variable, but these data are difficult to interpret due to the low number of subjects at these time 
points.

With regards to the use of rescue treatment, Study 302 Table 14.1.4.7 provides a summary of the ITP 
medications used during the extension phase that were considered rescue therapies.  A summary of ITP 
rescue medication use in the Extension phase compared to the Core phase alone is presented in Table 
43-3.  Of note, the analysis for Extension phase medications includes concomitant ITP medication use 
upon entry into the Extension phase and which were not necessarily used as a rescue treatment (e.g., 
corticosteroids).  As a result, the use of corticosteroids as a rescue treatment in the Extension phase is 
likely overestimated.

definitions 
A multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study of avatrombopag in male and female subjects ≥18 years of 
age with chronic ITP. The study consisted of 3 phases: Pre-randomization, 
Randomization (Core Study), and Extension. A placebo-controlled design was 
selected as the design of choice in order to obtain the best possible evidence on 
the potential efficacy and safety of avatrombopag. The study design allowed for 
the use of avatrombopag or placebo over and above existing standard of care 
for chronic ITP and rescue therapy in order to enable the use of placebo in the 
study design. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the efficacy of avatrombopag 
(in addition to standard of care) is superior to placebo (in addition to standard 
of care) for the treatment of chronic ITP as measured by cumulative number of 
weeks of platelet response over 6 months of once daily treatment in adult 
subjects who had received at least 1 prior ITP therapy.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Literature review 
A comprehensive search was conducted to identify scientific literature published between January 2000 
and October 2019 providing data on the efficacy of TPO receptor agonists in adult patients with ITP. In 
addition, reference lists of review articles were evaluated to identify other articles for inclusion in this 
summary.  Finally,  the  Summaries  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  for  Revolade  (eltrombopag,  May 
2019) and Nplate (romiplostim, July 2019) were reviewed. 
A comparison of Study 302 efficacy results to efficacy endpoints (primary or secondary) reported in the 
current  SmPCs  for  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim  is  presented,  recognizing  the  limitations  of  such 
historical  comparisons.  A  review  of  efficacy  results  from  published  randomised  controlled  studies  are 
then  presented  for  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim.  Only  publications  of  studies  which  allowed  for  dose 
titration (n=7) were included in this summary; fixed-dose randomised controlled studies were excluded 
(n=2). No data pooling or meta-analysis of the data from the included clinical studies is contained in this 
literature review.

Three predefined endpoints in the avatrombopag Phase 3 Study 302 have corresponding data presented 
in the labeling for eltrombopag and romiplostim that provide a benchmark for comparison. The Revolade 
SmPC contains data from a 26-week placebo-controlled study (RAISE) and the Nplate SmPC contains 
data from two 24-week placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2), all of which had similar eligibility 
criteria and durations of treatment to the avatrombopag Study 302.

Clinical Trial Simulations of Avatrombopag for a Non-Inferiority Comparison 
The objective of this simulation study was to evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag (test) compared to 
eltrombopag (control) as measured by the durable response rate. 
Methods: The published eltrombopag population PK (Gibiansky, Zhang et al. 2011) and population 
PK/PD models (Hayes, Ouellet et al. 2011) were used to simulate eltrombopag concentration-time and 
platelet-time profiles, respectively.

The population PK and PK/PD models for avatrombopag (AVA-PKPD-ITP-002) were used to simulate 
avatrombopag concentration-time and platelet-time profiles. 
In the population PK model for eltrombopag (Gibiansky, Zhang et al. 2011), body weight, dose<20 
mg, healthy subjects vs ITP patients, East Asians (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) vs non-East 
Asians, sex, and concomitant corticosteroids were significant covariates. In the population PK/PD 
model for eltrombopag (Hayes, Ouellet et al. 2011), sex and age were significant covariates. 
In the population PK model for avatrombopag (AVA-PKPD-ITP-002), body weight, healthy subjects vs 
ITP patients, formulation, and concomitant administration of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
were significant covariates. In the population PK/PD model for avatrombopag, baseline platelet count 
was the only significant covariate. 
Both models were built using data collected from similar populations of patients with ITP. 
The primary endpoint was the durable platelet response rate, which was defined as the proportion of 
patients who had at least 75% (e.g., 6 out of 8 weekly monitoring) platelet responses ≥50×109/L 
during the last 8 weeks of the 26-week treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. 
The primary analysis was pre-specified in the simulation plan. 
A total of 1000 simulated clinical trial datasets were generated. Each dataset was created by randomly 
sampling (with replacement) N=143 avatrombopag patients and N=143 eltrombopag patients from the 
10,000 simulated patients in each treatment group. The sample size for each treatment group 
(N=143) was the same as that planned for Study E5501-G000-305 (Eisai Inc. 2013). Each patient was 
identified as either having or not having a durable platelet response. The null hypothesis was that 
avatrombopag was not as effective as eltrombopag. The alternative hypothesis was that avatrombopag 
was at least as effective as eltrombopag. Non-inferiority would be demonstrated if the upper bound of 
the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (based on normal approximation) for the difference in the durable 
platelet response rate between eltrombopag and avatrombopag (control – test) was below 15%, the 
pre-specified non-inferiority margin in the Statistical Analysis Plan for the E5501-G000-305 Study 
(Eisai Inc. 2013). Conversely, noninferiority would be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% confidence interval for the difference in the durable platelet response rate between avatrombopag 
and eltrombopag (test – control) was above -15%. 
The choice of the non-inferiority margin of 15% was based on a combination of statistical reasoning 
and clinical judgment. For the active comparator, eltrombopag, the Historical Evidence of Sensitivity to 
Drug Effect (ICH E-10) was established in the RAISE study of 197 subjects (Cheng 2011). The RAISE 
study was a well-designed, placebo-controlled pivotal study evaluating the efficacy of eltrombopag in 
patients with chronic ITP during 6-months of treatment compared with placebo. The study found that 
the durable platelet response (defined as ≥75% of platelet assessments ≥50×109/L during the last 8 
weeks of treatment over the 6-month treatment period in the absence of rescue therapies) was 42% 
(57 out of 135 patients) and 7% (4 out of 62 patients) for eltrombopag and placebo, respectively. 
Further analysis of these study results gave rise to an estimate of the effect size of eltrombopag 
relative to placebo in terms of durable response rate being 35.8% with a 95% CI of (25.4%, 46.1%). 
Therefore, a conservative estimate of eltrombopag effect size relative to placebo (M1) was chosen to 
be 25.4%. 
The planned trial non-inferiority margin (M2) should be a fraction of M1 (i.e., <M1) and was chosen by 
clinical judgment. Avatrombopag has certain potential advantages over eltrombopag including an 
improved safety profile (e.g., no severe liver toxicity), a quicker onset of platelet response, decreased 
PK variability when taken with food and therefore allows for convenient administration with food. 
Avatrombopag has a more predictable PK for liver dysfunction subjects, and no PK race effect. Given

that ITP is an orphan disease, the retention of 41% of the comparator effect size as a choice of non-
inferiority margin M2 (delta=15%) was judged to be clinically acceptable. 
Results: 
• 
For avatrombopag, 79.4% of the simulated ITP patients were predicted to have a durable 
platelet response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who had at least 75% platelet 
responses ≥50×109/L during the last 8 weeks of treatment over the 26-week treatment period 
in the absence of rescue therapy. For eltrombopag, 52.5% and 64.7% of the simulated ITP 
patients were predicted to have a durable platelet response rate for the primary analysis (all 
patients, including 18.9% of patients who had a zero PD slope factor and thus not responding 
to eltrombopag treatment) and sensitivity analysis (excluding the patients with a zero PD slope 
factor), respectively. 
• 
For avatrombopag, the median platelet count was ≥76×109/L as early as Week 3 and 
sustained through Week 26. For eltrombopag, the median platelet count was 55×109/L as early 
as Week 4 and sustained through Week 26 for the primary analysis (all patients, including 
18.9% of patients who had a zero PD slope factor and thus not responding to eltrombopag 
treatment) and 67×109/L as early as Week 3 and sustained through Week 26 for the sensitivity 
analysis (excluding the patients with a zero PD slope factor), respectively. 
• 
The results of the simulated non-inferiority study demonstrate that avatrombopag is non-
inferior to eltrombopag. 
Network Meta-analysis 
An  independent  network  meta-analysis  was  conducted  by  Dr.  Haitao  Chu,  MD,  PhD  (University  of 
Minnesota) to compare the efficacy of avatrombopag to that of eltrombopag in the treatment of chronic 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). 
The  MAH  conducted  studies  for  direct  comparison  between  pre-defined  endpoints  across  studies  in 
comparable  patient  populations.  The  aim  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  avatrombopag  to  that  of 
eltrombopag. Efficacy data from the 4 avatrombopag ITP studies presented in this type II variation were 
compared with data from eltrombopag publications and the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) 
(EMA/CHMP/279276/2010) for Revolade (eltrombopag, April 2010), using an arm-based network meta-
analysis. The methodology for the literature search, study selection criteria, and the meta-analysis are 
fully described, along with patient population characteristics of each included study, in the Meta-analysis 
Report. 
A total of 6 studies evaluating eltrombopag in adult patients with ITP were included and compared to 
the 4 avatrombopag studies, assessing 6 outcome measures directly related to platelet count criteria. 
The  Cumulative  Weeks  of  Response  (achievement  of  a  platelet  count  ≥50×109/L)  was  the  primary 
efficacy  endpoint  for  Study  302,  which  provides  the  Pivotal  Efficacy  Data  for  this  application.  The 
cumulative weeks of response was reported in 5 studies in this meta-analysis. Due to the wide range of 
observed standard deviations (0.49 – 9.5 weeks) and a wide range of the average duration of exposures 
(4.1  -  24  weeks)  across  the  5  studies,  the  analysis  was  performed  based  on  3  statistical  models:  1) 
using  the  raw  data  but  assuming  a  truncated  normal  prior  distribution  to  incorporate  the  fact  that 
cumulative weeks of response is non-negative; 2) using standardised data, in which cumulative weeks 
of response is standardised by the average duration of exposure to treatment, with a truncated normal 
prior distribution; 3) using log transformed data, which assumes that the random variable of cumulative 
weeks of response is normal on a log-scale.  
As  examples  of  these  cross-studies  between  results  obtained  with  avatrombopag  and  eltrombopag,

Clinical studies in special populations 
Subgroup analysis according to stratification factors were performed in the pivotal Study 302, but no 
other  specific  studies  in  ITP  populations  have  been  presented.  Studies  specifically  in  a  paediatric 
population have not been included in the application, but are in preparation (EMA PIP November 2019).  
Additional Supportive Efficacy Data are available from clinical studies of avatrombopag for the treatment 
of thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease (CLD). Given that the mechanism of action of 
avatrombopag as a TPO receptor agonist results in the increased production of platelets in patients with 
thrombocytopenia, regardless of the causal disease state or endogenous TPO levels, efficacy results in 
patients  with  CLD  further  support  this  application  for  the  use  of  avatrombopag  in  the  treatment  of 
patients  with  chronic  ITP.  Support  for  the  approval  of  avatrombopag  for  the  treatment  of 
thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD came from data from 2 identically designed, global, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 studies (Study 310, N randomized=231, avatrombopag-
FAS=149, and Study 311, N randomized=204, avatrombopag-FAS=128). 
In  these  studies,  avatrombopag  reproducibly  met  all  primary  (the  proportion  of  subjects  who  did  not 
require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days 
following a scheduled procedure) and secondary (the proportion of subjects who achieved platelet counts 
of at least 50×109/L on Procedure Day [Day 10 to Day 13], and the change from Baseline in platelet 
count  on  Procedure  Day) study  endpoints,  and  resulted  in  measured  increases  in  platelet  counts  that 
were both clinically meaningful and statistically significant.

ITP Study 305 
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Parallel-Group Trial with an 
Open-Label Extension Phase to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral E5501 versus Eltrombopag, in 
Adults with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura). 
The Study was initiated in February 2012 and terminated in April 2015. This study was terminated 
early by the Sponsor due to significant enrolment challenges. 
The  target  population  for  this  study  was  adults  with  chronic  ITP  (ie,  ≥1  year)  who  had  received  at 
least 1 prior ITP therapy, and who had a platelet count less than 30×109/L. The rationale for this target 
population was based on an unmet medical need in these patients

Treatment: Avatrombopag tablets were administered orally as 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-mg doses and 
eltrombopag tablets were administered orally as 25-, 50-, or 75-mg doses, both in a flexible dose design. 
This study used the 2G commercial tablet formulation of avatrombopag and a 20 mg daily oral starting 
dose with dose titration (5 to 40 mg), and with identical stratification as in Study 302.

Extension Phase 
Primary Objective 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with avatrombopag in subjects with chronic 
ITP  
Secondary Objectives 
• To demonstrate the effectiveness of long-term therapy with avatrombopag as measured by platelet 
response, bleeding, and the use of rescue therapy 
•  To  assess  the  reduction  in  use  of  steroids  and  concomitant  ITP  medication  in  subjects  receiving 
avatrombopag. 
Statistical Methods 
This study was terminated on 22 Jan 2013 with 24 subjects randomized and 23 subjects treated. Due to 
termination of the study, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was revised to focus on the safety results 
with limited summaries provided for efficacy. 
Efficacy 
The Full Analysis Set (definition omitted) was used as the population for all efficacy data summaries for 
Core Study, and mFAS was used as the population for all efficacy data summaries for Extension Phase. 
For  the  Core  Study,  platelet  count  data  was  summarized  by  visit  and  treatment  group  for  FAS  using 
descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). For the Extension Phase, platelet 
count data was summarized for avatrombopag by visit for mFAS using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum).

In addition, platelet count was categorized and the number and percentage of subjects in each category 
was summarized by visit and treatment group for FAS for the Core Study and for avatrombopag by visit 
for mFAS for the Extension Phase.  
For the Core Study, the number and percentage of subjects with bleeding events associated with chronic 
ITP (including bruising and petechiae) after randomization was summarized by treatment group and by 
highest WHO bleeding grade for FAS. For the Extension Phase, the number and percentage of subjects 
with bleeding events associated with chronic ITP (including bruising and petechiae) after the enrollment 
into Extension Phase was summarized for avatrombopag by highest WHO bleeding grade for mFAS.

Comparison of Efficacy Results Across All ITP Studies 
No pooling of efficacy data was conducted across the 4 ITP studies. While the limitations regarding post-
hoc  analyses  and  comparisons  across  studies  with  differing  designs  are  clear,  analyses  of  common 
quantitative  endpoints  across  the  avatrombopag  ITP  studies  were  conducted  to  provide  some 
benchmarking data to assess the consistency of the avatrombopag treatment effect on increasing platelet 
counts in patients with ITP across the 4 studies. These analyses demonstrate the consistent efficacy of 
avatrombopag across the ITP studies, and serve to further reinforce the Pivotal Efficacy Data findings 
from Study 302 using the Supportive Efficacy Data from Study 305, Study CL-003, and Study CL-004. 
As  summarised,  demographic  and  Baseline  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  treatment 
groups and across the ITP studies. 
Cumulative Number of Weeks of Platelet Response – All ITP Studies 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the  pivotal  Phase  3  ITP  Study  302  was  the  Cumulative  Number  of 
Weeks of Platelet Response, defined as the cumulative number of weeks with a platelet count ≥50×109/L 
during 6 months of treatment in the absence of rescue therapy. Since this efficacy endpoint was based 
on quantitative laboratory assessments of platelet counts, a post-hoc analysis of the same endpoint was 
conducted on subjects in the other 3 ITP studies to provide some cross-study benchmarking data. This 
included 24 subjects in Study 305 who participated in the Core Study, and 64 subjects who participated 
in both Study CL-003 and its rollover Study CL-004. 
The  mean  and  median  Cumulative  Number  of  Weeks  of  Platelet  Response  in  the  Avatrombopag 
Treatment Group for the 6-month treatment period in the Study 302 Core Study were 12.0 and 12.4 
weeks,  respectively,  which  was  superior  to  placebo  with  a  highly  statistically  significant  treatment 
difference (P<0.0001). The mean and median Cumulative Number of Weeks of Platelet Response with 
avatrombopag treatment in the Study 305 Core Study were shorter (5.4 and 5.1 weeks, respectively) 
than the effect seen in Study 302, but comparable to that seen in the Study 305 Eltrombopag Treatment 
Group (4.3 and 0.0 weeks, respectively; P=0.3299).

Platelet Response by Study Day- All ITP Studies 
Additional cross-study comparisons were conducted on Platelet Response (≥50×109/L) at Study Day 8, 
Day 28, and Week 24 (6 months). Results for these endpoints all supported that of the primary endpoint 
and  the  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  across  studies.  A  greater  proportion  of  Responders  were 
seen in the Avatrombopag Treatment Group compared to the placebo group at Day 8, Day 28, and Week 
24 in Study 302 and Study CL-003, with numerically greater proportions of Responders at Day 8 and 
Day  28  for  the  Avatrombopag  Treatment  Group  compared  with  the  Eltrombopag  Treatment  Group  in 
Study 305. 
For the Avatrombopag Treatment Group in Study CL-003 (28 days of treatment) and Study CL-004 (6 
months of treatment), the mean and median Cumulative Number of Weeks of Platelet Response were 
10.9 and 11.0 weeks, respectively, which were comparable to that seen in Study 302.

2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Data are presented to support an authorisation of avatrombopag (Doptelet) by an extension of variation 
for  the  applied  indication:  “Doptelet  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  primary  chronic  immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins).”  
The wording of indication has been revised and now include the term “primary” in order to specifically 
reflest the target population. The wording of indication is now aligned with the authorised TPO-Ra, as 
“Avatrombopag  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  primary  chronic  immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  in 
adult patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).” All three

Page 121/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indications will characterize the ITP patients as refractory, a term used to associate the indication for 
treatment with the relapsing disease activity.  
The starting  dose  was  20mg  once  daily  followed  by  flexible-dosing  regimen  to  optimize  and  maintain 
platelet response for individual ITP subjects. Dose adjustment was done by up- or down-titrations of 1 
dose level (5-10mg, 10-20mg, 20-30mg and 30-40mg and vice versa). While dose adjustment can be 
followed, the selected starting dose of 20mg was not considered sufficiently justified by the CHMP (see 
also the discussion on PK). As discussed in detail in the pharmacology part, the 20mg starting dose was 
eventually considered acceptable. Considering that in clinical practice the major goal for treatment in 
primary ITP is to provide a sufficient platelet count to prevent or stop bleeding rather than correcting 
the platelet count to normal levels (in asymptomatic patients) the choice of the 20mg starting dose was 
endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  Nevertheless,  the  risk  for  thrombocytosis  remains  and  therefore  the  SmPC 
section 4.2 has been updated to state: Due to the potential risk of platelet counts above 400 x 109/L 
within the first weeks of treatment patients should be carefully monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
thrombocytosis. After a stable platelet count has been achieved, obtain platelet counts at least monthly. 
After discontinuation of avatrombopag, platelet counts should be obtained weekly for at least 4 weeks.  
The  revised  wording  adequately  reflects  the  need  for  careful  monitoring  as  well  as  the  risk  for 
thrombocytosis at the beginning of the treatment.  
The  pivotal  study  E5501-G000-302  was  a  placebo-controlled  phase  3  trial,  and  initiated  enrolment  in 
February 2012 and primary completion date in November 2013. Adult patients had to have a response 
to at least one prior treatment for ITP, be diagnosed more than 12 months previously and in need of 
treatment with a platelet count below 30 x109/L. Diagnostic criteria were in accordance to international 
standard of monosymptomatic, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and exclusion criteria acceptable for this 
benign condition.  
The patient population included 49 patients, randomised 2:1 for avatrombopag or placebo, as add-on to 
any SOC in the blinded trial. Baseline data reflect a representative, Caucasian population, almost one 
third had received five or more ITP treatments. Most patients were younger than 65-years at inclusion. 
A  large  fraction  of  patients  with  (chronic)  ITP  are  older  than  60-years,  with  greater  risk  for  serious 
bleeding complications and co-morbidities and co-medication, and these patients, with a risk for vascular 
events  and  drug-interactions  were  less  well  represented  due  to  exclusion  criteria,  and  the  issue  is 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The different phases in a 6-month core study may allow to capture relevant information on efficacy at 
different times, and safety, but reduction in any concomitant ITP medication may be time-consuming 
and  still  influence  the  effect  of  avatrombopag.  Data  in  the  pivotal  study,  during  the  core  study  of  26 
weeks, demonstrated the ability to dose reduce and even terminate concomitant ITP medication, when 
treating with avatrombopag. This is clinically relevant, especially in patients treated with corticosteroids 
due  to  the  risk  of  long  term-toxicity  (e.g.  osteoporosis),  or  immunosuppressants  (e.g.  infections). 
Preferably, long-term data in the extension phase would have been collected in more patients.  
The sample size calculations are considered adequate, however, the sample size of 49 patients in the 
main study is limited, and the number of patients causes a concern in the long-term follow-up in the 
extension phase, due to a low number of patients after one year. The sample size is acceptable following 
clarification  on  Amendments,  and  the  MAH  has  provided  more  statistical  analysis  with  the  correct 
methods to calculate CI, which are broad due to the limited number of patients.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  cumulative  number  of  weeks  of  platelet  response,  defined  as  the 
cumulative number of weeks with a platelet count ≥50 × 109/L during 6 months of treatment, in the 
absence of rescue therapy. The proposed primary endpoint differs from what was agreed on by the CHMP 
in  the  scientific  advice  from  2011  (EMEA/H/SA/1606/1/FU/1/2011/III;  “Durable  platelet  response, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7081/2021  
Page 122/173 
 
 
 
 
 
defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet responses (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L) during the last 8 
weeks of treatment, with no rescue medications administered at any time during the treatment period”, 
now included as other efficacy endpoint). This primary endpoint as agreed during the SA was comparable 
to the primary endpoint for both of the pivotal studies (20030105 and 20030212) that were evaluated 
for the MAA of Nplate (romiplostim). The primary endpoint of the study is acceptable. The secondary 
endpoints  were  a)  Proportion  of  patients  Day8  with  a  response  in  platelet  count  ≥50  x  109/L,  and  b) 
Proportion of subjects with a reduction in use of concomitant ITP medications from baseline, which is 
clinically meaningfull.  
Stratification  factors  at  randomization  of  the  49  patients  were:  splenectomy  status,  baseline  platelet 
count, and use of concomitant ITP medication. This is in accordance to the EMA guideline on ITP, and 
identical  factors  were  used  in  the  pivotal  RAISE  study  with  eltrombopag  in  chronic,  primary  ITP,  also 
placebo-controlled. 
The justification for a placebo-controlled study is in accordance with the 2014 EMA ITP guideline and is 
accepted considering the circumstances 10 years ago. Data from an active comparator study has been 
also  requested.  The  company  followed  this  advice  by  conducting  the  RCT  Study  305.  Study  305, 
randomized, blinded phase 3 study with eltrombopag as active comparator was terminated early after 
inclusion of 24 patients due to lack of recruitment. The problem was the interest in results by gastroscopy 
and bone marrow examination, driven by further (safety) information, and which may not be considered 
relevant  to-day  in  a  population,  strictly  defined  by  chronic,  primary  ITP  to  be  treated  with  TPO-Ra. 
Unfortunately,  a  robust  active  comparator  study  was  never  conducted.  The  MAH  has  made  statistical 
analysis  cross-studies  with  avatrombopag,  placebo  and  eltrombopag  to  support  the  efficacy  of 
avatrombopag in chronic ITP. Overall the statistical considerations for the design of Study 305 as well 
as the corresponding planned analysis are considered acceptable. Due to the early termination of the 
study  all  presented  analyses  of  results  need  to  be  considered  as  descriptive,  and  statistical  inference 
that would permit externally valid conclusions is no longer warranted. The results in Study 302 (main) 
and Study 305 (supportive) cannot be compared due to different trial populations and endpoint at fixed 
time-point. Nevertheless, the fact that results are by and large in line with results obtained from earlier 
studies, can be considered supportive of the overall conclusions on efficacy and safety. 
There  were  no  critical  protocol  deviations  (ie,  protocol  deviations  which  substantially  impacted  the 
primary endpoint or safety assessments).  
In order to outweigh the missing direct comparison against an approved TPO-R agonist, the following 
data were submitted: i) literature review review in order to contextualize the results of study 302 by 
available  data  from  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim,  ii)  independent  network  meta-analysis  and  iii)  a 
simulated non-inferiority comparison against eltrombopag. Statistical methods are well documented and 
justified.  
The  simulated  non-inferiority  analysis of  avatrombopag  against  eltrombopag  was  based  on  data  from 
PK/PD  modelling.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  durable  platelet  response  rate.  The  result  of  this 
endpoint derived by PK/PD modelling and simulation is completely different to that derived by results 
from study 302, which signicantly questions the reliability of this simulated non-inferiority analysis of 
avatrombopag  against  eltrombopag  and  results  are  therefore  not  considered  useful  to  deliver  any 
substantial evidence for B/R assessment. 
Based  on  prospectively  defined  search  and  selection  criteria  the  MAH  provided  a  literature  review  in 
order to contextualize the results of study 302 by available data from eltrombopag and romiplostim. This 
literature review is considered helpful for addressing the lack of a direct comparison against an approved 
TPO-R agonist. 
Assessment report

An independent network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of avatrombopag to that 
of  eltrombopag  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP.  From  a  methodological  perspective  the  presented 
network meta-analysis seems to have been carried out properly. Search strategy, in-/exclusion criteria 
for studies – albeit different from the literature review - appear plausible. Statistical methods are well 
documented and justified. Nevertheless, major issues concerning the comparability of results between 
studies are noticed. Specifically, differences in endpoint definitions and exposure times between studies 
hamper the comparability of results concerning the cumulative number of weeks with response and the 
proportion  of  subjects  with  durable  response.  In  contrast,  the  comparison  of  response  rates  at  fixed 
timepoints may be more reliably compared between studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was met in the pivotal Study 302, showing patients treated with avatrombopag 
(as add-on) had 12 weeks with platelet counts ≥50 x 109/L in the core study of six months, compared 
to  none  in  the  placebo  group.  Differences  were  noted  in  numbers  of  cumulative  weeks  with  “safe” 
platelet-count, which could indicate variable impact of treatment on disease mechanism, between the 
sub-groups  in  all  three  stratification  factors,  although  all  superior  to  placebo.  The  key  secondary 
endpoint,  response  Day8  was  also  statistically  significant  different  and  achieved  in  66%  in  the 
avatrombopag group, compared to none in the placebo group. A rapid response may be critical in ITP, 
in patients with bleeding, and such response is comparable to glucocorticoid or IVIg. It is acceptable that 
41%  in  placebo  group  and  47%  in  the  avatrombopag  group  received  concomitant  ITP  medication  at 
baseline,  which  reflects  variable  disease  activity  in  the  samle  population  and  because  these  patients 
were not manageable without treatment waiting for the inclusion in the trial.  Although more patients 
(30%) in the avatrombopag group had a reduction in the use of concomitant ITP medication, compared 
to none in the placebo group, this difference was not statistically different from placebo. It is important 
to  emphasize  that  the  trial  recommendations  for  dose-reduction  of  concomitant  ITP-medication  were 
conservative  for  safety  reasons  in  the  time-period  of  the  core-study  for  6  months,  and  that  30%  of 
patients  had  dose-reduction  or  termination  of  co-medicaiton.  The  dose-reduction  documented  in 
glucocorticoid in the avatrombopag-group is clinically meaningful, and will contribute to avoid long-term 
toxicity (osteoporosis, and increased risk in bacterial and re-activiation of viral infections, like herpes, 
metabolic)  (Rice  tal,  Clin  Ther  2017),  as  it  is  the  aim  in  all  combination  treatments  in  chroniv  ITP  – 
provided no long-term risks are demonstrated, e.g. in the TPO-Ra. The results in the placebo group are 
as expected in all three endpoints, with minimal if any impact.  
Over time, patient data became more limited, and during the extension phase a gradual declining median 
platelet count may indicate exhaustion of effect – or difficulties stabilizing the dose, which was confirmed 
to  be  the  reason  in  four  patients,  receiving  maximal  dose  of  avatrombopag  throught  the  study.  As  a 
treatment phenomenon, an exhaustion by avatrombopag could not be revealed previously in the studies 
in  chronic  liver  disease  due  to  different  dosing  and  pathophysiology.  A  declining  effect  effect  on 
thrombopoiesishas not been observed in other TPO-Ra. 
The interpretation of results in the group, treated with avatrombopag may be disentangled and clarified 
by  further  data  in  patients  in  avatrombopag  monotherapy  or  combination  therapy.  Patients  in 
avatrombopag monotherapy had more weeks with a safe platelet count >50 x109/L, (17 weeks/20 visits 
in the core study) than patients in combination treatment, and on average - although a simple analysis 
- 61% in the monotherapy group had a platelet count >50 compared to 46% in combination therapy, 
during the 20 visits. The response rate Day8 was lower in the group treated with avatrombopag as add-
on to SOC (53% combination versus 76% monotherapy), who had more rescue therapy, in particular 
within 60 days. Thus, rescue was provided earlier in subjects receiving avatrombopag as add-on to SOC, 
9 episodes / 13 before Day60, compared to 4 episodes (in all) after Day110 in the monotherapy group

– fluctuations are not unusual in treating this disease. These data reflect aspects of avatrombopag effect, 
which all support the efficacy and the role in the treatment of primary chronic ITP. It may be unexpected 
that the combination treatment by these three endpoints seems to be inferior to monotherapy, because 
a combination exploits the different mechanism of drugs in the combination. However, the explanation 
is (compatible with) a more aggressive disease acitivity in patients in the combination treatment, since 
this group of patients entered the trial, treated with a SOC.  Further, during the core phase of 26 weeks, 
the co-medication had been tapered, which was a secondary endpoint. There is no indication that the 
immunosuppressive  impact  of  glucocorticoid  may  inhibit  the  thrombopoietic  stimulating  effect  of 
avatrombopag, functionally or pharmacologically. And there is no test to confirm the disase activity in 
chronic ITP, only the clinical outcome of a treatment.  
Literature review: Main findings are based on results from study 302 and corresponding endpoints from 
eltrombopag and romiplostim studies as presented in their SmPCs. Both the comparison of cumulative 
number  of  weeks  with  a  platelet  count  above  50x109/L  and  use  of  rescue  medication  suggests 
comparable results for all TPO-R agonists.  
In contrast, there seems to be a difference between avatrombopag and eltrombopag in durable response. 
However, the number presented for eltrombopag (60%) needs to be questioned as the relative response 
rate is based on the number of subjects with complete follow-up and not on the total number of subjects 
randomized to treatment, which would be the relevant analysis population according to the ITT principle. 
The percentage of patients with durable response based on the total number of subjects (n=135) is 42 
and more in line with the result for avatrombopag (34%). 
Overall, results from this literature review provide reassuring evidence to some degree that the effect of 
avatrombopag seems to be comparable to that of other approved TPO-R agonists. 
Network Meta-Analysis: By and large response rates on day 8, day 28, week 6 and months 6 appear to 
be comparable between avatrombopag and eltrombopag. The results of this network meta-analysis do 
not  give  rise  to  concern  that  avatrombopag  treatment  response  is  substantially  worse  than  that  of 
eltrombopag. Treatment response seems to be rather comparable. 
The  randomized  trial  with  active  comparator  (eltrombopag),  Study  305  had  a  very  similar  design  as 
Study 302, is very small with only 24 patients. The results are difficult to compare cross-study with the 
placebo-controlled  avatrombopag  studies  or  the  pivotal  eltrombopag  study,  because  of  differences  in 
patient populations and endpoints. However, the data captured in Study-305 and the “virtual” data by 
literature  review  for  contextualization,  independent  network  meta-analysis  and  a  simulated  non-
inferiority  comparison  against  eltrombopag,  support  the  results  of  Study  302  that  avatrombopag  is 
effective and safe, and as effective and safe as eltrombopag in primary, chronic ITP in adults. 
The benefit of a rapid increase in platelet count to reduce the risk of bleeding must be balanced against 
the potential risk of causing adverse events related to platelet counts above the target range. Hence, 
the following recommendation is given in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “The recommended starting dose of 
Doptelet is 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily with food” and to monitor and make dose adjustment as follows: 
“After initiating therapy, assess platelet counts at least once weekly until a stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 
109/L and ≤ 150 x 109/L has been achieved. Twice weekly platelet count monitoring should be conducted 
during the first weeks of therapy in patients receiving avatrombopag only once or twice weekly. Twice 
weekly monitoring should also be conducted after dose adjustments during the treatment. Due to the 
potential risk of platelet counts above 400 x 109/L within the first weeks of treatment patients should be 
carefully monitored for any signs or symptoms of thrombocytosis. After a stable platelet count has been 
achieved, obtain platelet counts at least monthly. After discontinuation of avatrombopag, platelet counts 
should be obtained weekly for at least 4 weeks.”

CHMP recommends to further evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in the post-marketing setting with 
regards to the dosing recommendations, including the risks associated with the 20mg starting dose and 
platelet  fluctuations  in  the  initial  period  after  treatment  initiation  as  well  as  after  dose  adjustment  to 
once or twice weekly.  
2.5.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has been shown treating chronic primary ITP in adults with avatrombopag, as monotherapy or 
as add-on to concomitant ITP medication. The primary and key-secondary endpoint were met, reflected 
by a safe platelet count ≥ 50 x109/L rapidly after initiation of treatment in two out of three patients and 
maintained for half the time in the core study, without rescue. It is accepted that a direct comparison 
against  an  authorised  TPO-R  agonist  was  terminated  prematurely.  Supportive  data  addressing  a 
comparison against other authorised TPO-R agonists derive from the submitted literature review and the 
independent network-meta analysis and indicate comparable efficacy of avatrombopag and eltrombopag. 
Recommendations have been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC to monitor and make dose adjustments 
considering that no clinical data are available to support the dosing adjustments. CHMP recommends to 
further evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in the post-marketing setting with regards to the dosing 
recommendations and long-term efficacy of avatrombopag. 
2.6 Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Avatrombopag was authorised in June 2019 by the European Commission for the treatment of severe 
thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD (chronic liver disease) who are scheduled to undergo an invasive 
procedure. The safety data supporting the CLD indication were summarised in safety analysis Group 1 
(Fig. 2.7.4-1 below) and included data from 2 Phase 3 studies that reproducibly demonstrated a safety 
profile for avatrombopag that was comparable to placebo with no new or unexpected safety signals. The 
pooled safety data in Group 1 included a total of 430 randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of  study  drug  and  had  at  least  1  post-dose  safety  assessment,  with  274  subjects  treated  with 
avatrombopag  and  156  with  placebo.  The  frequency,  severity,  and  types  of  TEAEs  reported  were 
consistent with those reported in patients with CLD. In addition, a Phase 2 study conducted in subjects 
with thrombocytopenia and hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy also demonstrated the safety of chronic 
dosing of avatrombopag in another patient population with thrombocytopenia. 
Safety data from the avatrombopag clinical development program consists of 24 sponsor-initiated studies 
in patients and healthy volunteers, including Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies, with a total of over 
1100 subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of avatrombopag. This includes avatrombopag exposures in 
520 healthy volunteers, and 587 patients that included acute and chronic dosing for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia  in  several  different  patient  populations  and  indications,  including  CLD,  hepatitis  C, 
and chronic ITP.  
Safety data from the 24 studies in this comprehensive clinical development program were organized into 
6 pooled Safety Analysis Sets (SAS), based on the population studied, dose, schedule, formulation, and 
study phase, which were submitted with the original Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for the 
CLD indication (i.e. CLD MAA). For convenience, these groups were serially numbered Group 1 to Group 
6 for the CLD MAA, and to avoid confusion, the same safety group numbering was retained for this type 
II variation (Figure 2.7.4-1):

The  Primary  Safety  Data  for  this  type  II  variation  include  the  pooled  safety  data  in  Group  4 
(Thrombocytopenia in All Chronic ITP Studies, N=161, see Table 2.7.4-6) to support the registration of 
avatrombopag for the proposed new indication, ie, the treatment of chronic ITP in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments. Group 4 includes safety data over a range of avatrombopag exposures 
(5 to 40 mg) to maintain platelet counts between the target range of 50×109/L and <150×109/L.  
The Primary Safety Data include:  
-  Study  302:  A  Phase  3,  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Parallel-
Group  Trial  with  an  Open-label  Extension  Phase  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Oral 
avatrombopag Plus Standard Care for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Adults with Chronic 
Immune Thrombocytopenia 
-  Study 305: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Parallel-Group 
Trial  with  an  Open-Label  Extension  Phase  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Oral 
avatrombopag versus Eltrombopag, in Adults with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia 
o  The sponsor terminated this study early due to enrollment challenges. 
-  Study  CL-003:  A  Phase  2,  Double-Blind,  Randomized,  Dose-Ranging,  Placebo-Controlled, 
Parallel-Group Study of avatrombopag Tablets Taken Orally Once Daily for 28 Days in Patients 
with Chronic ITP 
-  Study  CL-004:  A  Phase  2,  Parallel-Group,  Rollover  Study  of  avatrombopag  in  Patients  with 
Chronic ITP Who Completed 28 Days’ of Study Treatment in Protocol AKR-501-CL-003

Patient exposure 
Safety  and  efficacy  data  were  collected  from  both single-  and  multiple-dose  Phase  1,  dose  escalation 
studies, and several Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with various avatrombopag formulations, doses, and 
dosing  regimens.  Exposure  to  avatrombopag  across  the  clinical  development  program  includes  doses 
from  1  to  100  mg  administered  as  single  or  repeat  daily  dosing  for  up  to  834  days  (2.3  years),  with 
19.6%  (115/587)  of  all  subjects  (Table  2.7.4-4)  and  63.3%  (81/128)  of  the  subjects  with  ITP  (Table 
2.7.4-14) receiving treatment for at least 180 days. The mean Duration of Exposure for subjects in each 
category is summarized in Table 2.7.4-3.

Pivotal efficacy RCT 302; Avatrombopag versus placebo: 
Extent of exposure was noticeably longer for avatrombopag subjects than for placebo subjects during 
the Core Study (Table 15). 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mean duration of exposure to avatrombopag during the combined Core Study and Extension Phase was 
43.9 weeks with the longest treatment exposure being 75.7 weeks (Table 16). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of study population (group 4) 
The  distribution  of  age,  sex,  ethnicity,  weight,  and  BMI  was  generally  balanced  across  the  various 
treatment groups. The mean (SD) overall age was 48.9 (17.65) years and most subjects were <65 years 
(78.7% [107/136] subjects). There were more females (62.5% [85/136] subjects) than males (37.5% 
[51/136] subjects) and most subjects were White (83.1% [113/136] subjects). Most subjects were from 
North  America  (United  States;  58.8%  [80/136]  subjects).  While  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the 
Avatrombopag Treatment Group (59.4% [76/128] subjects) and Eltrombopag Treatment Group (81.8% 
[9/11]  subjects)  were  from  North  America,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the  Placebo  Treatment  Group 
were from Europe (68.2% [15/22] subjects). 
The mean Baseline platelet counts were 18.5×109/L and they were similar between the Avatrombopag 
Treatment Group (18.3×109/L) and the Eltrombopag Treatment Group (18.2×109/L), and slightly lower 
in  the  Placebo  Treatment  Group  (15.0×109/L).  Splenectomy  status  was  balanced  across  groups  with 
most subjects reporting a status of “no” (67.6%, 92/136 subjects). Overall, more than half of subjects 
used  concomitant  medications  for  ITP  (65.4%,  89/136  subjects),  but  most  of  the  subjects  in  the 
Eltrombopag Treatment Group (90.9%, 10/11 subjects) did not use concomitant medications for ITP. 
Concomitant medications  
The  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  Avatrombopag  Treatment  Group  in  Group  4  (96.1%  [123/128] 
subjects)  who  took  concomitant  medications  during  the  study  was  higher  compared  with  the  Placebo 
Treatment Group (77.3% [17/22] subjects), and similar to the Eltrombopag Treatment Group (90.9% 
[10/11] subjects), although the differences in Duration of Exposure (ie, longer duration of exposure for 
avatrombopag-treated  subjects  compared  with  those  treated  with  placebo  or  eltrombopag  [see  also 
Table  2.7.4-14  above])  needs  to  be  considered  when  interpreting  these  data.  The  majority  of 
concomitant  medications  were  under  the  anatomical  classes  of  drugs  for  Alimentary  Tract  and 
Metabolism and Nervous System.  
138 
 
 
 
 
The  percentage  of  avatrombopag-,  placebo-,  and  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  taking  drugs  for 
Alimentary Tract and Metabolism were 32.8%, 27.3%, and 72.7%, respectively.  
The percentage of avatrombopag-, placebo- and eltrombopag-treated subjects taking drugs for Nervous 
System were 27.3%, 18.2%, and 63.6%, respectively. 
Adverse events 
Since the Duration of Exposure for avatrombopag-treated subjects was significantly longer than that of 
both placebo- and eltrombopag-treated subjects in the chronic ITP studies (see Table 2.7.4-14 in the 
Patient exposure section), the analyses of comparative safety profiles are subject to observation-time 
bias.  Therefore,  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  (number  of  subjects  with  an  adverse  event  [AE] 
divided  by  the  person-time  at  risk)  were  also  assessed  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  AE  frequencies 
among treatment groups.

Treatment-related  TEAEs  by  PT  in  Group  4  in  decreasing  order  that  were  reported  in  at  least  2%  of 
subjects in any treatment group are presented in Table 2.7.4-20. Overall, the percentage of treatment-
related TEAEs was similar between the Avatrombopag Treatment Group (66.4% [85/128] subjects) and 
the Eltrombopag Treatment Group (72.7% [8/11] subjects), and lower in the Placebo Treatment Group 
(18.2% [4/22] subjects).

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
As predefined in the 2 Phase 3 studies in patients with ITP (Study 302 and Study 305), AESI included 
Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia, Thromboembolic Events, Bleeding Events, Gastric Atrophy, Neoplastic 
Events, Bone Marrow Pathology (Excluding Neoplasms), and Clinically Significant Liver Tests. These AESI 
were specifically identified because they had all been reported as TEAEs with the other 2 TPO receptor 
agonists,  except  for  Gastric  Atrophy,  which  was  a  reversible  finding  in  the  multiple-dose  nonclinical 
avatrombopag toxicology studies. 
Although  AESI  were  not defined  in  the  original  Phase  2  Study CL-003  and  Study  CL-004  protocols  or 
flagged in the study level databases, they were, for completeness, retrospectively identified using the 
same definitions for this safety analysis. Group 4 treatment-emergent AESI are presented in Table 2.7.4-
22. 
146 
 
 
 
 
147 
 
 
 
 
Recurrence  of  (or  rebound)  thrombocytopenia  was  defined  as  a  platelet  count  <10×109/L  and 
10×109/L below Baseline which occurred after the stopping of study drug and up to 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug. AESI in the Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia category were reported in 8.6% 
(11/128) of subjects in the Avatrombopag Treatment Group (Table 2.7.4-22).  
In the Avatrombopag Treatment Group, 7.0% (9/128) of subjects reported treatment-emergent AESI in 
the  Thromboembolic  Events  category  (Table  2.7.4-22);  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  was 
0.124.  All  Thromboembolic  Event  AESI  were  reported  in  only  single  avatrombopag-treated  subjects 
(0.8%), except for cerebrovascular accident, which was reported by 2 (1.6%) subjects; there was no 
clustering a specific thromboembolic event type and no safety signal was identified. The time of onset 
of AESI in the Thromboembolic Events category was greater than 26 weeks for 2 subjects, 12 to less 
than 26 weeks for 4 subjects, 4 to less than 12 weeks for 1 subject, and 1 to less than 4 weeks for 2 
subjects.  
148 
 
 
 
 
Study  302  and  Study  305  assessed  a  panel  of  gastric  biomarkers  to  evaluate  for  potential  gastric 
toxicity,  based  on  the  reversible,  nonclinical  histologic  changes  identified  in  the  stomach  (gastric 
atrophy)  in  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies;  these  biomarkers  were  associated  with  decreased  gastric 
acid production and a compensatory increase in serum gastrin levels. In addition to serum gastrin levels, 
fasting gastrin-17, PG-I and PG-II, were also evaluated to further assess gastric safety. 
In the Avatrombopag Treatment Group, 4.7% (6/128) of subjects reported a treatment-emergent AESI 
in the Neoplastic Event category; the exposure-adjusted incidence rate was 0.083. All events occurred 
in  single  (0.8%)  subjects  only,  and  included  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia,  chronic  myelomonocytic 
leukemia, lipoma, myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and skin papilloma; no safety signal was 
identified. The time of onset of AESI in the Neoplastic Events category was greater than 26 weeks for 2 
subjects, 12 to less than 26 weeks for 1 subject, and 4 to less than 12 weeks for 3 subjects.  
No  treatment-emergent  bone  marrow  pathology  AESI  were  reported.  One  subject  in  Study  305 
experienced a non-treatment emergent TEAE of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis (Study 305 CSR), which 
was  reported  as  SAE  bone  marrow  reticulin  fibrosis  (Common  Terminology  Criteria  [CTC]  Grade3). 
However, the subject had no associated clinical signs or symptoms.  
The event was reported as ongoing at the time of the last available report. 
The  investigator  classified  the  event  of  bone  marrow  reticulin  fibrosis  to  be  probably  related  to 
avatrombopag.” 
The time of onset of AESI in the Clinically Significant Liver Tests category was greater than 26 weeks 
for 1 subject, 12 to less than 26 weeks for 2 subjects, 4 to less than 12 weeks for 1 subject, and 1 to 
less than 4 weeks for 1 subject. 
All  5  subjects  who  had  liver  enzyme  elevations  were  asymptomatic  and  recovered,  with  4  of  the  5 
subjects continuing their current dose of avatrombopag over the period of the elevations (1 subject had 
avatrombopag briefly interrupted and then restarted at the same dose), suggesting that avatrombopag 
administration was not the causative factor in these liver enzymes elevations; these elevations were not 
accompanied by increases in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. No significant signal of avatrombopag-
induced hepatotoxicity was identified across the 4 studies in patients with ITP.

Mean  values  over  time  for  all  hematology  parameters  were  similar  among  the  Avatrombopag, 
Eltrombopag, and Placebo Treatment Groups. 
There were subjects in all treatment groups in Group 4 with markedly abnormal hematology parameters 
(excluding platelet count). Markedly abnormal low hemoglobin was observed in a higher percentage of 
subjects in the Avatrombopag Treatment Group (9.5% [12/126] subjects) when compared to the Placebo 
Treatment Group (4.5% [1/22] subject) and Eltrombopag Treatment Group (0%). Markedly abnormal 
low neutrophils and leukocytes were observed in a lower percentage of avatrombopag- (2.4% [3/126] 
subjects each) and placebo-treated subjects (4.5% [1/22] subject each) when compared to those treated 
with eltrombopag (9.1% [1/11] subject.  
Clinical Chemistry – Group 4 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Mean  values  over  time  for  vital  sign  parameters  were  generally  similar  between  the  Avatrombopag, 
Eltrombopag, and Placebo Treatment Groups.  
Mean and mean change from Baseline ECG results were generally similar between the Avatrombopag, 
Eltrombopag,  and  Placebo  Treatment  Groups.  The  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  Avatrombopag, 
Eltrombopag, and Placebo Treatment Groups who had abnormal ECG results at Baseline (17.5%, 20.0%, 
and 19.0%, respectively) were generally comparable. At the EOT, a lower percentage of subjects in the 
Avatrombopag Treatment Group compared to the Placebo Treatment Group had abnormal ECG results 
(27.1%  [13/48]  subjects  and  38.1%  [8/21]  subjects,  respectively).  No  subjects  in  the  Eltrombopag 
Treatment Group had abnormal ECG results at EOT. No subjects in any treatment group had abnormal 
ECG results at follow-up.  
There were subjects in each treatment group with either abnormal post-Baseline QT interval corrected 
for heart rate using Bazett’s (QTcB) and Fridericia’s (QTcF) formula results; 1.0% (1/105) of subjects 
had  highly  abnormal  QTcB  results.  No  subjects  in  the  Eltrombopag  or  Placebo  Treatment  Groups  had 
QTcB results that were highly abnormal, and no subjects in any treatment group had highly abnormal 
QTcF results at Baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in special groups and situations was not evaluated in Group 4 because of the population size.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Avatrombopag has been shown to have potentially clinically important interactions with dual moderate 
or  strong  CYP3A4/5  and  CYP2C9  inhibitors  and  inducers,  with  less  significant  interactions  with  strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors.  
Moderate or Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors  
Concomitant use of avatrombopag with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors increased avatrombopag exposure. 
In an open-label cross-over study in healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of itraconazole, a strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitor 200 mg QD at steady state with a single 20 mg dose of avatrombopag resulted in a 
7.4%  and  37.4%  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUC(0-inf)  of  avatrombopag,  respectively.  Population-based 
PK/PD  simulations  at  steady  state  conditions  of  avatrombopag  indicated  that  co-administration  of 
avatrombopag with a CYP3A4/5 had only minimal impact on platelet counts, and thus modification of 
the  starting  dose  of  avatrombopag  (20  mg  QD)  is  not  recommended  (Study  AVA-PKPD-ITP-002).  As 
described  in  the  proposed  dosage  and  administration  recommendations,  platelet  counts  should  be 
assessed weekly until a stable platelet count has been achieved and then monthly thereafter. 
Dual Moderate or Strong CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 Inhibitors  
Concomitant  use  of  avatrombopag  with  dual  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A4/5  and  CYP2C9  inhibitors 
increased  avatrombopag  exposure.  In  an  open-label  cross-over  study  in  healthy  adult  volunteers, 
coadministration  of  fluconazole,  a  moderate  dual  inhibitor  of  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A4/5,  400  mg  QD  at 
steady state with a single 20-mg dose avatrombopag resulted in a 1.17- and 2.16-fold increase in Cmax 
and  AUC(0-inf)  of  avatrombopag,  respectively.  Population-based  PK/PD  simulations  at  steady  state 
conditions  of  avatrombopag  indicated  that  a  reduction  in  the  frequency  of  the  starting  dose  of 
avatrombopag to 20 mg three times a week would result in a higher percentage of patients achieving 
the target platelet count range (50 to <150×109/L) compared with 20 mg QD (Study AVA-PKPD-ITP-
002). As described in the proposed dosage and administration recommendations, platelet counts should 
be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count has been achieved and then monthly thereafter to ensure 
optimized dosing and maintenance of platelet counts in the target range.  
Moderate or Strong CYP2C9 Inhibitors  
Concomitant use of avatrombopag with moderate to strong CYP2C9 inhibitors increased avatrombopag 
exposure. Population-based PK/PD simulations at steady state conditions of avatrombopag indicated that 
co-administration of avatrombopag with a CYP2C9 inhibitor would have only minimal impact on platelet 
counts, and thus modification of the starting dose of avatrombopag (20 mg QD) is not recommended 
(Study  AVA-PKPD-ITP-002).  As  described  in  the  proposed  dosage  and  administration  instructions, 
platelet  counts  should  be  assessed  weekly  until  a  stable  platelet  count  has  been  achieved  and  then 
monthly thereafter to ensure optimized dosing and maintenance of platelet counts in the target range.  
Moderate or Strong Dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 Inducers  
Concomitant  use  of  avatrombopag  with  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A4/5  or  CYP2C9  inducers  reduced 
avatrombopag exposure. This may result in a decrease of efficacy. In an open label cross-over study in 
healthy  adult  volunteers,  co-administration  of  rifampin,  a  strong  CYP3A4/5  and  a  moderate  CYP2C9 
inducer, 600 mg QD at steady state with a single 20 mg dose of avatrombopag resulted in no change in 
Cmax, but an approximately 42.1% decrease in AUC(0-inf) of avatrombopag. Population-based PK/PD 
simulations  at  steady  state  conditions  of  avatrombopag  indicated  that  when  avatrombopag  is 
coadministered with moderate or strong dual CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 inducers, a significant reduction in 
overall  platelet  count  elevations  is  expected.  Thus,  concomitant  use  of  avatrombopag  with  either  a 
moderate or strong dual CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 inducer, requires a higher starting dose of avatrombopag 
(40 mg QD), which will result in a higher percent of patients achieving the target platelet count range of 
(50 to <150×109/L) compared with a 20 mg QD starting dose (Study AVA-PKPD-ITP-002). As described 
in the proposed dosage and administration instructions, platelet counts should be assessed weekly until 
a stable platelet count has been achieved and then monthly thereafter to ensure optimized dosing.

Literature review of safety in TPO-RAs 
Comparison of the Safety Profile of Avatrombopag in the Treatment of ITP Versus Published 
Data on Other TPO Receptor Agonists  
A comprehensive review of the published literature for the two approved TPO receptor agonists for the 
treatment of ITP, eltrombopag (Revolade; Novartis) and romiplostim (Nplate; Amgen), was conducted 
to provide a historical benchmark of the safety of these products for comparison with the safety profile 
of  avatrombopag  in  the  same  patient  population,  acknowledging  the  limitations  of  cross-study 
comparisons. 
This summary reviewed the overall incidences of AEs, deaths, and SAEs from 20 selected publications 
on TPO receptor agonist therapy in adult patients with ITP (see Table 2). 
155 
 
 
 
156 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the published literature briefly summarised below in table 4 supports the conclusion that the 
chronic administration of TPO receptor agonists is generally well tolerated for the treatment of ITP, and 
the  literature  review  provides  a  useful  historical  benchmark  supporting  the  Primary  Safety  Data  with 
avatrombopag in Group 4. There was a higher risk of clinically significant liver tests and hepatobiliary 
AEs reported with eltrombopag compared to romiplostim in the published studies, but other AEs were 
relatively  comparable  between  the  2  approved  TPO  receptor  agonists.  The  reported  overall  rates  and 
severity  of  AEs,  TEAEs,  SAEs,  and  AESI  with  these  products  were  generally  comparable  to  the 
avatrombopag  clinical  safety  data,  except  for  the  lack  of  significant  hepatotoxicity  or  an  increased 
incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding events in avatrombopag-treated subjects. In addition, review 
of the AESI identified no significant difference in safety profiles, and there were no new or unique AEs 
reported with avatrombopag that had not been previously reported with eltrombopag or romiplostim. 
157 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  common  AEs  reported  across  the  studies  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  diarrhea,  and 
nausea  with  eltrombopag,  and  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  fatigue,  and  peripheral  edema  with 
romiplostim.  For  reference,  Literature  Summary  of  Safety  Table  5  summarises  the  incidence  of  the 
common AEs by PT for avatrombopag (those reported at an incidence of 10% or higher) from the 4 ITP 
studies in Group 4, alongside data from the key published studies with eltrombopag and romiplostim; 
the types of AEs reported were similar across the various TPO receptor agonists with some variability in 
incidence, but no new safety signals were identified. 
158 
 
 
 
 
2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
Many of the most commonly observed AEs are well-known from one or both of the two approved TPO-
RAs (Very common or Common according to the SmPCs): Headache, Fatigue, Upper respiratory tract 
infection/  Nasopharyngitis,  Nausea,  Diarrhoea  and  Vomiting,  Arthralgia  and  Back  pain,  Oedema 
peripheral, Insomnia and Dizziness, and Cough.  
The  assessment  for  this  type  II  variation  will  focus  on  the  safety  data  provided  for  the  chronic  ITP 
population (Group 4), while keeping in mind the currently known safety profile for patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD). 
159 
 
 
 
 
The current safety profile is related to short-term treatment (40-60 mg for up to 5 days) in patients with 
chronic liver disease ahead of a surgical procedure. The treatment of ITP is continuous as long as there 
is effect (20 mg initially then modified depending on platelet count). Thus, the safety profile from these 
two different settings is not comparable. The MAH has presented an integrated safety summary based 
on four trials in ITP patients: two phase 2 trials; CL-003 (28 days treatment; 59 avatrombopag and 5 
placebo) and CL-004 (an extension of the previous trial up to 6 months, avatrombopag only) and two 
randomised trials; study 302, in which placebo was the comparator (N=17 vs N=32 in the avatrombopag 
arm in the core study and 47 in the extension part) and study 305, which was terminated early due to 
“significant enrolment challenges” after including 12 patients in the avatrombopag arm and 11 patients 
in the eltrombopag arm. Altogether 128 patients received avatrombopag of which 81 (63%) received it 
for more than 6 months compared to one patient in the placebo arm and one in the eltrombopag arm (3 
in each of the comparator arms received treatment for ≥90 days).  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events were calculated to account for differences in 
the duration of exposure across the various treatment groups in the chronic ITP studies. The exposure-
adjusted incidence rates enable a comparison between the different study groups and are endorsed in 
general.  However,  this  can  only  be  viewed  as  an  approximation,  due  to  the  very  limited  long-term 
exposure data for subjects in the placebo or eltrombopag  groups, which weakens the strength of the 
safety  data.  As  mentioned  earlier  the  RCT  305,  where  the  comparator  was  eltrombopag,  had  to  be 
discontinued due to “significant enrolment challenges”. Therefore, the MAH will conduct a PASS to further 
confirm the long-term safety profile (please see pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP section), particularly 
for adverse events which are rare, and clinical benefit of avatrombopag in patients with chronic ITP as a 
post-approval comitment and submit the results of the feasibility study for the PASS within 3 months 
after approval of the extension of indication.   
There were nine thromboembolic events; the potential contribution of avatrombopag is difficult to assess 
without a comparator given to a significant number of patients  for a substantial amount of time. The 
relatedness  of  3  cases  of  various  myeloproliferative  disease  (MPD)  is  also  not  assessable  and  longer 
exposure  in  more  patients  is  needed.  “Thrombotic/thromboembolic  events”  has  been  added  as  an 
important identified risk in the RMP. In addition, the following receommendation was already made in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC and is still considered adequate: “Consider the potential increased thrombotic 
risk when administering Doptelet to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including but 
not  limited  to  genetic  prothrombotic  conditions  (Factor  V  Leiden,  Prothrombin  20210A,  Antithrombin 
deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency) advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, 
malignancies, contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. 
Doptelet  should  not  be  administered  to  patients  with  chronic  liver  disease  or  chronic  immune 
thrombocytopenia in an attempt to normalise platelet counts”. In addition, further safety data will be 
provided as part of the planned PASS (please see pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP). 
Treatment with TPO agonists has been linked to formation of reticulin fibre in the bone marrow. Across 
the phase III studies, evaluation of fibrosis and reticulin fibre formation by bone marrow biopsies was 
done  in  subjects  willing  to  give  an  additional  informed  consent.  However,  only  very  limited  data  are 
available that do not allow for a reliable conclusion on the risk of avatrombopag inducing or promoting 
fibrosis in the bone marrow. However, to better inform clinicians on the potential risk of increased bone 
marrow reticulin, a precautionary statement has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. As mentioned 
before, the MAH will conduct a PASS study feasibility, which will investigate the potential to collect bone 
marrow biopsy data from ITP patients on avatrombopag in order to evaluate the long-term risk of bone 
marrow fibrosis. Further, ‘Bone marrow fibrosis related to long-term and repeat use’ and ‘Haematological 
Malignancies’ has been included in the RMP as important identified risk. 
160 
 
 
 
With regards to QTc prolongation with concomitant medications, the following recommendation has 
been added in section 4.4 of the SmpC: “At exposures similar to that achieved at the 40 mg and 
60 mg dose, Doptelet did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. Mean QTc 
prolongation effects > 20 ms are not anticipated with the highest recommended therapeutic dosing 
regimen based on analysis of data from the pooled clinical trials in patients with chronic liver disease. 
However, caution must be exercised when Doptelet is co-administered with moderate or strong dual 
CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 inhibitors, or with moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors, as these medications 
can increase avatrombopag exposures. Caution must also be exercised in patients with loss-of-function 
polymorphisms of CYP2C9, as these can increase avatrombopag exposure.” 
With regards to progression of existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); the effectiveness and safety 
of  Doptelet  have  not  been  established  for  the  treatment  of  thrombocytopenia  due  to  MDS.  Doptelet 
should not be used outside of clinical studies for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS (section 
4.4 of the SmPC). 
As stated in section 4.6 of the SmPC: “Doptelet is not recommended in pregnancy and in women who 
are able to have children and are not using contraception.” 
The occurrence of common AEs was similar between core and extension phase. However, for the safety 
assessment  of  long-term  treatment  of  chronic  ITP  with  Doptelet,  the  occurrence  of  less  frequent  but 
potentially more severe events such as progression of MDS, bone marrow fibrosis or thromboembolic 
events is of particular importance, especially because these less frequent events are harder to capture 
with  a  limited  safety  database  (in  terms  of  treatment  duration  and  number  of  enrolled  subjects). 
Therefore, a PASS has been requested (please refer to the pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP).  
All ADRs from the safety data set are reflected in the updated SmPC. 
2.6.2 Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  nature  and  frequency  of  the  reported  adverse  events  are  considered  to  be  consistent  with  those 
expected after treatment of chronic ITP patients with TPO receptor agonists. There were no new safety 
findings. However, the safety database is considered limited, and therefore a PASS is warranted in order 
to  gain  more  data  on  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  avatrombopag,  especially  to  assess  the  risk  of 
thromboembolic events, bone marrow fibrosis, and MPD (please refer to the pharmacovigilance plan in 
the RMP).

changes to the package leaflet are minimal, do not affect the readability and do not require user 
consultation with target patient groups. 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
2.8.2 Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Doptelet (avatrombopag) is already included 
in the additional monitoring list as  
• 
it contains a new active substance which on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1 Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1 Disease or condition 
The  aim  of  this  application  is  to  support  the  following  indication:  “Avatrombopag  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  of  primary  chronic  immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  in  adult  patients  who  are  refractory  to 
other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).”  
3.1.2 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Realising the autoimmune nature of chronic ITP divides the therapeutic  principles  in two. To increase 
platelet production or to reduce the destruction by phagocytosis of platelets – or both, in a combination 
therapy.  The  gold  standard  is  glucocorticoids,  which  was  introduced  first  as  an  immune  suppressive 
agent targeting the disease mechanism, in most patients with a rapid effect. Other immune-suppressants 
have  been  introduced,  like  azathioprine,  mycophenylat  and  cyclosporine  A  and  antiCD20  antibody 
(rituximab), whereas drugs which prevent phagocytosis and the increased degradation of thrombocytes 
include IVIg, anti-RhD immunoglobulin and dapsone. Danazol was the first drug introduced to stimulate 
thrombopoiesis and have later been – successfully – followed by TPO-Ra since 2008. Not all medicines 
are authorised for ITP.  
Oral  medication  is  optimal,  and  most  treatments  are  provided  in  tablets.  Parenteral  administration  is 
accepted  (e.g.  IVIg  and  antiCD20)  because  the  agents  cannot  be  absorbed  otherwise,  but  still  are 
particularly  important  in  the  treatment  armamentarium.  TPO-Ra  is  one  example  where  both 
administration  forms  are  provided.  Splenectomy  is  an  ultimate  procedure,  now  by  laparoscopy,  and 
despite the long-term risks of bacterial infections, it is still used, because of a high 60-70% and durable 
remission rate, provided strict precautions are taken for prophylaxis. However, apart from glucocorticoids 
and  IVIg  as  third  line  treatment  in  acute  ITP  or  for  rescue,  there  is  no  treatment  algorithm  agreed 
internationally  in  chronic  ITP,  because  no  agent  has  an  optimal  profile.  Chemotherapy  has  no  role  in 
primary ITP and platelet transfusion, from HLA-matched donors or pooled concentrate is only used in 
165 
 
 
 
critical siuations (Chaturvedi et al. Blood 2018; Cooper & Ghanima N Engl J Med 2019; Puavilai et al. 
Brit J Haematol 2020).  
Instead, the plethora of agents make room for an individualised therapeutic approach related to gender, 
age, pregnancy and co-morbidities. Today,  it may be considered that there is still an unmet medical 
need in chronic ITP, reflected in the development of novel compounds targeting mechanisms involved in 
chronic ITP as first-in-class – recently an inhibitor of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) (Bussel 
et  al.  Am  J  Hematol  2018),  The  medical  need  in  chronic  ITP  may  also  be  to  extend  the  spectrum  of 
available  options,  because  no  independent  prognostic  factor  has  been  identified  in  ITP  for  treatment 
response  to  medical  therapy.  In  addition,  adverse  events  even  in  the  same  class  of  drugs  may  be 
perceived differently and overall the aim is to tailor the treatment to the individual subject and contribute 
to an active weekday, with minimum bleeding and adverse events and to avoid morbidity and mortality 
due to medication or severe haemorrhage.  
3.1.3 Main clinical studies 
Main efficacy data derive from study 302, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study 
in primary chronic ITP patients (n=49, avatrombopag: n=32, placebo: n=17), including a core study (6 
months) and an open-label extension phase (terminated at the date when the last subject completed 
the core study). Those subjects who met all the eligibility requirements and who were willing and able 
entered  the  extension  phase.  Subjects  who  discontinued  the  core  study  early  because  of  lack  of 
treatment effect remained eligible to continue into the extension phase. Avatrombopag or placebo was 
administered as daily 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40mg doses in a flexible design. The starting dose was 20mg. 
Supportive  evidence  derives  from  study  CL-003,  a  phase  II,  double-blind,  randomized,  dose-ranging, 
placebo-controlled  study  with  a  duration  of  28  days  (n=64,  randomized  3:3:3:3:1  to  a  fixed  dose  of 
2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg or 20mg QD of avatrombopag or placebo, respectively); study CL-004, a rollover 
study  from  CL-003  (dose  titration  was  permitted,  treatment  duration  of  6  months,  n=53,  25/28  for 
responders/non-responders  per  primary  response  criteria  in  CL-003)  and  study  305,  a  phase  III, 
randomized, active-controlled (eltrombopag) study that was terminated prematurely due to recruitment 
challenges (n=24, avatrombopag, n=12, eltrombopag, n=11).  
In addition, a literature review from published data for the 2 TPO-R agonists authorized for treatment of 
ITP, an independent network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of avatrombopag to eltrombopag in 
ITP patients and a simulated NI analysis of avatrombopag versus eltrombopag were submitted. 
To support dosing recommendations and dose titration algorithm as proposed in the SmPC data from 
population PK model and PK/PD modelling and simulation were submitted. 
3.2 Favourable effects 
As a chronic condition (in most patients) an oral medication is preferred, and with an option to titrate 
individually  the  dosing  to  translate  into  a  stable  platelet  count  of  50-100  (150)  x109/L.  Treatment  is 
administered at home and blood sample for monitoring may be with weeks to months interval outside a 
clinical trial. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Study 302 was the cumulative number of weeks of platelet response, 
i.e. the target platelet count ≥50 x109/L during 6 months of treatment, in the absence of rescue therapy.  
Avatrombopag (n=32) was superior to placebo (n=17) with a significantly longer duration of weeks with 
a platelet count ≥50×109/L in the absence of rescue therapy (median 12.4 (SD 8.75 weeks) vs 0 weeks, 
respectively, p<0.0001). The majority of platelet counts in the avatrombopag treatment group remained 
166 
 
 
 
within  the  target  window  of  ≥50×109/L  to  ≤150×109/L  over  the  course  of  the  study.  The  supportive 
Study CL-003 demonstrated a median of 11 weeks in avatrombopag, and 0 in the placebo group.  
The first key secondary efficacy endpoint for Study 302 was the proportion of subjects with a platelet 
count  ≥50  x109/L)  at  Day8.  Avatrombopag  was  superior  to  placebo  at  Day  8  (65.6%  vs  0.0%, 
respectively),  (95%  CI:  49.17,  82.08),  which  was  statistically  significant  (P<0.0001).  The  supportive 
Study CL-003 showed a response rate at Day8 of 55.2% versus 0 in the placebo group.  
Analysis  based  on  stratification  factors  showed  in  each  subgroup  a  statistically  significant  response 
compared with placebo for the primary endpoint. However, the cumulative platelet response was notably 
lower in splenectomised subjects compared to non-splenectomised subjects (4.9 versus 15.9 weeks), 
subjects  with  baseline  platelet  count  ≤15  x109/L  compared  with  a  baseline  count  >15  to  <30  x109/L 
(5.3 versus 19.2 weeks), and in patients who used concomitant ITP medication at baseline compared to 
those who did not, i.e. avatrombopag monotherapy (4.9 versus 15.9 weeks). It is likely that differences 
in effect of avatrombopag in patients who have been splenectomised and are in need of treatment or 
have an (arbitrary) platelet count below 15, or are dependent upon a SOC entering the trial have a more 
active ITP disease. There is no test to measure e.g. antibody affinity and concentrations.  
The second key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a reduction in use of 
concomitant  ITP  medications  from  baseline.  An  equal  minority  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups 
(n=15/32  in  avatrombopag;  n=7/17  in  placebo)  were  treated  concomitantly  with  other  SOC  ITP 
medications  at  baseline.  The  results  showed  that  33.3%  (95%  CI  9.48,  57.19)  of  subjects  in  the 
avatrombopag treatment group reduced the concomitant use of ITP medication from baseline, compared 
with  0%  for  placebo-treated  subjects.  This  treatment  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(P=0.1348).  
In study CL-003 a dose-dependent rise of platelet counts was observed. 
Results  from  study  305  indicate  comparable  treatment  effect  on  median  platelet  counts  over  time  as 
seen in study 302. 
The durable platelet response was an exploratory endpoint, defined as the proportion of subjects who 
had at least 6 out of 8 weekly platelet responses during the last 8 weeks of treatment over the 6-month 
treatment period of the core study in the absence of rescue therapy. Avatrombopag was shown to be 
superior to placebo 11/32 (34.4%, 95% CI 17.92, 50.83) versus 0/17, respectively (P=0.009). 
Main findings of the literature review are based on results from study 302 and corresponding endpoints 
from  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim  studies  as  presented  in  their  SmPCs.  Both  the  comparison  of 
cumulative number of weeks with a platelet count above 50x109/L and use of rescue medication suggests 
comparable  results  for  all  TPO-R  agonists.  Also  results  for  durable  response  are  broadly  comparable 
between avatrombopag and eltrombopag. A network-meta-analysis gave response rates on day 8, day 
28, week 6 and months 6 comparable between avatrombopag and eltrombopag. 
3.3 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  number  of  the  pivotal  study  participants  is  limited.  Data  from  the  extension  study  become  more 
variable from week 38 of the extension study due to the low number of patients. A trend only for positive 
effect reducing the concomitant ITP medication was observed in the pivotal trial. CHMP recommends to 
further  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  avatrombopag  in  the  post-marketing  setting  to  document  the  use  of 
20mg tablets in the management of primary chonic ITP long-term, changes in the platelet count and the 
risk of bleeding events, and reduction in the use of concomitant ITP medications.  
167 
 
 
 
3.4 Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly observed AEs are well-known from one or both of the two approved TPO-RAs. Very 
common or Common AEs according to the SmPCs include headache, fatigue, gastro-intestinal symptoms, 
arthralgia,  back  pain  and  more,  which  were  mostly  mild  and  potentially  manageable  by  symptomatic 
treatment.  
Subjects with any TEAE included 63.6% (14/22) in the placebo group, compared to 97.7% (125/128) in 
the avatrombopag treated group, translating to an exposure-adjusted incidence of 4.233 in the placebo 
group  and  1.728  in  the  avatrombopag  group.  TEAEs  with  CTCAE  grade  3  or  more  were  reported  in 
45/128 (35%) patients treated by avatrombopag, compared to none in the placebo group, corresponding 
to  an  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  0.622  in  patients  treated  by  avatrombopag  and  0  in  the 
placebo-group.  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  was  captured  in  17  patients  (13%)  on 
avatrombopag, none in the placebo group.  
Recurrence of (or rebound) thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count <10 x109/L and 10 x109/L 
below baseline, occurring after termination and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Rebound 
thrombocytopenia were reported in 8.6% (11/128) of subjects, only after treatment with avatrombopag.  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  included  recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  (8.6%),  thromboembolic 
events (7%, with no clustering of a specific arterial or venous event), bleeding events (14.1%), gastric 
atrophy  events  (0%),  neoplastic  events  (4.7%),  and  clinically  significant  liver  test  (3.9%).  With 
exception of bleeding events reported in the placebo group, AESIs occurred only in the avatrombopag 
treatment group. With regard to clinically significant liver enzyme tests including increased ALT and AST, 
4/5 subjects continued their dose of avatrombopag without any deterioration of liver enzyme elevations. 
Treatment-emergent  AESI  in  the  Neoplastic  Event  category  were  reported  in  6/128  (4.7%)  patients 
treated  with  avatrombopag.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  was  0.083.  All  events  occurred  in 
single  (0.8%)  subjects  only,  and  included  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia,  chronic  myelomonocytic 
leukemia,  lipoma,  myelofibrosis,  an  unspecified  myeloproliferative  neoplasm,  and  skin  papilloma.  No 
safety signal was identified. The time of onset in the Neoplastic Events category was greater than 26 
weeks for 2 subjects, 12 to less than 26 weeks for 1 subject, and 4 to less than 12 weeks for 3 subjects. 
No reports in the placebo group. No treatment-emergent bone marrow pathology AESI were reported.  
The unfavourable effect of the product are already included in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
approved SmPC.  
3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The total number of patients exposed to avatrombopag for ≥52 weeks is limited (14 subjects, 10.9%). 
The treatment of ITP is continuous as long as there is effect (20 mg initially then titrated depending on 
platelet count). Therefore, a PASS is warranted in order to gain more data on the long-term safety profile 
of  avatrombopag,  especially  to  assess  the  risk  of  thromboembolic  events,  bone  marrow  fibrosis,  and 
MPD (please see pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP).    
Only very limited bone marrow biopsy data are available. Treatment with TPO agonists has been linked 
to formation of reticulin fiber. Lack of knowledge in this regard poses a safety concern. This concern has 
been  addressed  by  including  a  precautionary  statement  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  Additionally,  the 
RMP  does  now  include  ‘Bone  marrow  fibrosis  related  to  long-term  and  repeat  use’  as  an  important 
identified risk. 
Nine thromboembolic events were observed and six cases of neoplastic event. The potential contribution 
of avatrombopag is difficult to assess without a comparator given to a significant number of patients for 
168 
 
 
 
a  substantial  amount  of  time.  “Thrombotic/thromboembolic  events”  has  been  added  as  an  important 
identified risk in the RMP. In addition, the following receommendation was already made in section 4.4 
of the SmPC and is still considered adequate: “Consider the potential increased thrombotic risk when 
administering Doptelet to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including but not limited 
to genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or 
Protein C or S deficiency) advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, 
contraceptives  and  hormone  replacement  therapy,  surgery/trauma,  obesity  and  smoking.  Doptelet 
should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease or chronic immune thrombocytopenia 
in an attempt to normalise platelet counts”. In addition, further safety data will be provided as part of 
the planned PASS (please see pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP). 
Bleeding episodes may most likely be due to insufficient responses, not TEAEs to avatrombopag. Still, 
three patients were registered with bleeding grade II-III in Study 302, and three times more frequent 
bleeding  episodes  were  reported  in  the  safety  database  population,  associated  with  avatrombopag 
treatment. The current warning stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC is still considered adequate: “There is 
an increased risk of bleeding if avatrombopag treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants 
or anti platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and medically 
managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with avatrombopag. It is recommended 
that, if treatment with avatrombopag is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current 
treatment  guidelines.  Additional  medical  management  may  include  cessation  of  anticoagulant  and/or 
antiplatelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support.” 
Concurrent  anaemia  and  leukocytosis  have  been  reported  in  patients  exposed  to  other  TPO  receptor 
agonists  (within  a  4-week  window).  Leukocytosis  can  be  a  sign  for  progression  of  MDS  into  acute 
leukemia.  Considering  that  this  AE  occurred  in  the  clinical  trial  and  that  a  possible  involvement  of 
avatrombopag  in  the  progression  of  MDS  cannot  be  excluded,  this  remains  a  safety  concern.  The 
precautionary statements have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform about this possible 
risk and to indicate that bone marrow aspirates or biopsies should be considered, particularly in patients 
over 60 years of age or for those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral 
blast cells.

3.7 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The data show that avatrombopag by an oral, daily treatment increases the platelet count within a week 
in  severely  thrombocytopenic  adult  patients  with  primary  chronic  ITP  to  a  safe  level,  terminating  or 
mitigating the risk of bleeding. This effect may be achieved by avatrombopag monotherapy or as add-
on to any ongoing SOC ITP treatment, be maintained for months and without rescue therapy, in patients 
who respond.  
Although the primary endpoint of study 302 differs from what was agreed on during a previous scientific 
advice, it is considered adequate to address the primary objective of the study, and is clinically relevant  
170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as  the  cumulative  number  of  weeks  in  which  the  platelet  count  is  ≥50  x  109/L  during  6  months  of 
treatment in the absence of rescue therapy. The pivotal study met this primary endpoint.  
Consistent results are presented in supportive, phase II placebo-controlled studies and the pivotal phase 
III trial on the primary endpoint and response to initial treatment. Although the platelet count is a widely 
accepted  surrogate  endpoint,  the  major  goal  for  treatment  in  ITP  is  to  provide  a  sufficient  count  to 
prevent or stop bleeding rather than correct the platelet count to normal levels. No negative effect of 
avatrombopag was observed, but also, no reduced need for rescue medication can be concluded for the 
avatrombopag  treatment  compared  to  the  treatment  with  placebo.  Incidents  of  bleeding  events  were 
adjusted for the total duration of treatment, but due to the high difference in duration of exposure (2.6-
fold) also the exposure adjusted incidence rate remains inconclusive. The conclusions on bleeding events 
and rescue treatment are compromised by the low number of subjects in the placebo arm beyond the 
first two months after treatment start. Most of the subjects that started with placebo treatment soon 
entered the open-label extension phase due to lack of efficacy within the core study. The lack of a robust 
conclusion on clinically relevant endpoints (i.e. bleeding events and rescue medication) raises uncertainty 
about the possible clinical benefit from the treatment with avatrombopag. The requested analyses were 
provided and the observed results do not suggest a notably negative effect on bleeding events or need 
for rescue medication.  
While the Phase 3 ITP studies were conducted with multiple tablet strengths to allow for titration of the 
daily avatrombopag dose to maintain platelet counts in the target range, the dosage regimen proposed 
for commercial use utilises 1 avatrombopag tablet strength (20 mg). PK/PD simulations were conducted 
to support the proposed, alternative, intermittent dose titration algorithm for avatrombopag that is based 
on  patients’  platelet  counts  and  takes  into  consideration  the  single  20  mg  tablet  strength.  While  this 
approach is acceptable, CHMP recommends to further evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in the post-
marketing setting with regards to the dosing recommendations, including the risks associated with the 
20mg starting dose and platelet fluctuations in the initial period after treatment initiation as well as after 
dose  adjustment  to  once  or  twice  weekly.  An  attempt  to  conduct  an  active-comparator  study  with 
another TPO-Ra was rational but had to be closed prematurely. The results from this incomplete study 
are  based  on  limited  data,  although  they  did  show  that  avatrombopag  was  probably  non-inferior 
compared to another TPO-Ra (eltrombopag). The efficacy reflected in the ability to cause a rapid increase 
in thrombocyte count and to maintain this level over time was not consistent with results, provided in 
other  trials  –  with  avatrombopag,  or  the  comparator,  which  may  be  explained  by  different  trial 
populations.  
Thrombocyte-count-control over time by avatrombopag treatment in the extension phase was based on 
successively fewer patients, which support the need for a long-term safety follow-up study (please see 
pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP).  
The  placebo-controlled  pivotal  trial  was  planned  for  a  small  number  of  patients.  A  real-world,  robust 
study with an active comparator and sufficient number of patients included has not been done. It cannot 
be excluded that some results presented in endpoint analysis in the core studies and extension phase 
are influenced by the low number of patients, perhaps in combination with the study design. Any impact 
of a limited data-material may influence efficacy as well as safety issues. 
The long-term safety data is very limited. Rebound thrombocytopenia was noticed after cessation of six-
months avatrombopag treatment, over four weeks. This observation is in contrast to the experience in 
chronic liver disease and five-day treatment but is consistent with a risk for insufficient production after 
interfering with a feed-back control system. 
Bleeding  episodes  and  thromboembolic  events  were  observed  more  often  during  treatment  with 
avatrombopag  and  may  be  associated  with  an  inexpedient  effect.  These  circumstances  may  reflect 
171 
 
 
 
difficulties  to  manage  dose-titrations  of  avatrombopag,  both  in  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with 
concomitant ITP medication. Both may potentially be life-threatening, and thus most likely associated 
with  an  inadequate  disease  control  or  serious  adverse  event,  and  individually  associated  with  co-
morbidity and co-medication. These adverse events may be mild or fatal, and sometimes spontaneously 
reversible clinically or manifest by permanent sequalae, e.g. cerebral.  
The raised concerns were addressed by changing the wording in the SmPC (information about risk factors 
for  thromboembolic  events)  and  by  adding  a  statement  that  raises  the  awareness  for  platelet  count 
monitoring when other medications are taken concomitantly. 
The occurrence of neoplasia may be a haphazard event. Cases of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms 
were  registered  among  avatrombopag  treated  patients,  but  not  among  placebo  patients.  Being  a 
megakaryocyte  growth  and  development  factor  (thrombopoietin)  all  TPO-R  agonists  in  long-term 
treatment  may  potentially  increase  the  risk  treating  a  benign  disorder  (ITP)  to  develop  malignant, 
myeloid  haematopoietic  disease  (MDS,  MPN).  The  risk  to  develop  a  myeloid  condition  is  increased  in 
patients older than 60-years, never reversible spontaneously, causes withdrawal of the TPO-Ra currently 
given, and will most likely increase the mortality risk considerably compared to ITP. This risk has not 
been demonstrated with authorised TPO-Ra, but it further supports the request to perform a PASS, as a 
long-term follow-up study of avatrombopag as an original drug.  
3.7.2 Balance of benefits and risks 
The  studies  in  adult  patients  with  primary  chronic  ITP  have  shown  that  avatrombopag  treatment  is 
effective and safe during the planned follow-up, albeit in a limited number of patients. The magnitude 
of the effect increasing the platelet count rapidly, to maintain the effect without rescue treatment, and 
the  ability  individually  to  reduce  any  concomitant  ITP  medication  is  clinically  meaningful.  Remaining 
uncertainties on the long-term profile of efficacy and safety can be addressed in the post-authorisation 
phase. 
3.7.3 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8 Conclusions 
The overall B/R of avatrombopag in primary chronic ITP in adults is positive.

Summary of risk management plan for XALKORI 
This is a summary of the RMP for XALKORI.  The RMP details important risks of XALKORI, 
how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
XALKORI's risks.  
XALKORI's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how XALKORI should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for XALKORI should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
XALKORI's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
XALKORI is authorised for  
• 
• 
• 
the first-line treatment of adults with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, for the treatment 
of adults with previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC and for the treatment of 
adults with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC.  It contains crizotinib as the active 
substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
(proposed) treatment of paediatric patients (age ≥6 to <18 years) with relapsed or 
refractory systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL). 
(proposed) treatment of paediatric patients (age ≥6 to <18 years) with recurrent or 
refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive unresectable inflammatory 
myofibroblastic tumour (IMT). 
Further information about the evaluation of XALKORI’s benefits can be found in XALKORI’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page:

II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of XALKORI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about XALKORI's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
 
 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In the case of crizotinib, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, see below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of XALKORI are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of XALKORI. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Evidence for

Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
All non-clinical and all company-sponsored clinical studies; and post-marketing reports. 
There are currently no known risk groups or risk factors for the development of 
pneumonitis/ILD in patients receiving crizotinib.  Factors that could potentially be 
associated with an increased risk of developing pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease under 
ongoing treatment with crizotinib include a history of pre-existing pulmonary disease, 
prior or concomitant treatment with medications with known pulmonary toxicity: 
antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, amphotericin B, minocycline);  chemotherapy (bleomycin, 
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide);  antiarrhythmics (amiodarone), radiation therapy, 
immune suppression resulting in pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal), a 
predisoposition to allergic pulmonary disease, autoimmune diseases (SLE, rheumatoid 
arthritis, etc.), occupational exposure (smoke, dust, silicone, asbestos),  and other factors.  
Further, the underlying malignancy, particularly lymphangiosis carcinomatosa may also 
increase the risk of pneumonitis and additionally confound the diagnosis.

Evidence for

the medicine: 
Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
All non-clinical and all company-sponsored clinical studies; and post-marketing reports 
No specific risk factors have been identified which may predispose patients to develop 
symptomatic QTc prolongation as a result of treatment with crizotinib.  
Based on known general risk factors for QTc prolongation, patient factors that may 
potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing QTc prolongation under 
treatment with crizotinib may include pre-existing conditions such as a Long QT 
Syndrome, a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac ischemia, 
and the concomitant use of medications with the potential to prolong QTc.

Important Identified Risk:  Bradycardia 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
No specific risk groups or risk factors have been identified that might predispose patients 
to the development of bradycardia.  However, pre-existing bradycardia, sinus node 
dysfunction, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, as well as concomitant medications 
affecting heart rate, such as beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers may increase the risk of developing bradycardia. 
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8  
Risk minimisation 
measures: 
All non-clinical and all company-sponsored clinical studies; and post-marketing reports.  
It is possible that patients with pre-existing renal cysts are at increased risk of developing 
new (or enlarged) renal cysts under crizotinib.

All non-clinical and all company-sponsored clinical studies; and post-marketing reports.  
Patients with conditions such as history of diverticulitis, metastases to the gastrointestinal 
tract, or concomitant use of medications with a recognized risk of gastrointestinal 
perforation are predisposed to developing gastrointestinal perforation.   
All non-clinical and all company-sponsored clinical studies; and post-marketing reports.  
No clear risk factors have been identified.  It is theoretically possible that patients with a 
history of cardiac disease, cardiac risk factors, or prior therapy with cardiotoxic drugs have 
a higher risk developing ventricular dysfunction while receiving crizotinib.

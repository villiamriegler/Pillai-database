2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant adeno-
associated viral vector containing a codon-optimized Padua derivative of human coagulation factor 
IX cDNA was considered justified based on non-clinical data in valid models of the condition 
showing significant improvement of circulating factor IX protein levels, and of factor IX activity 
levels; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to spontaneous bleeding episodes 
as well as substantially prolonged bleeding upon injury; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing recombinant adeno-associated viral vector containing a codon-optimized Padua 
derivative of human coagulation factor IX cDNA will be of significant benefit to those affected by 
the condition. The product has a mechanism of action that offers the potential to reduce or 
eliminate the use of exogenous factor IX products currently authorised for the condition, and the 
sponsor has provided non-clinical data that demonstrate significant improvement of circulating 
factor IX protein and activity levels in valid models of the condition. The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Haemophilia B is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder, characterized by a decrease in Factor IX-
plasma levels that produce a variety of bleeding symptoms of different severity. The condition 
accounts for 10-15% of the total haemophilia patients and predominantly affects males. Haemophilia B 
is caused by heterogeneous mutations in the FIX gene and is divided into three categories according to 
the coagulation factor activity present in blood: severe (<1% of normal circulating FIX), moderate (1–
5% of normal circulating FIX), or mild (>5% to <40% of normal circulating FIX). Most bleeding occurs 
internally, into the joints or muscles and some bleeds can be life-threatening and require immediate 
treatment, generating relating complications: chronic synovitis, muscular atrophy, sites of bleeding in 
depth. Clinically apparent bleeding in haemophilia B typically correlates with the factor IX activity in 
plasma, although some patients may have variability in phenotypic bleeding with up to 10% of severe 
patients with a mild phenotype. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000087180 
Page 4/16 
 
 
 
 
 
With the deficiency of FIX, activation of FX becomes severely impaired; in consequence, the thrombin 
burst becomes delayed and insufficient for normal haemostasis. The haemostatic plug formed for 
affected patients is therefore fragile and easily dissolved by normal fibrinolytic activity, leading to 
impaired haemostasis and prolonged bleeding episodes.  
The approved therapeutic indication “Hemgenix is indicated for the treatment of severe and 
moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) in adult patients without a history 
of Factor IX inhibitors” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of 
haemophilia B”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is considered life-threatening and chronically debilitating by the COMP due to 
spontaneous bleeding episodes and substantially prolonged bleeding upon injury. Bleeding starts early 
in life and can include life threatening haemorrhages, such as intracranial and gastrointestinal 
haemorrhages. Adult patients are at risk for cerebral- or gastric haemorrhage, which can be life-
threatening.  
When severe, the disease leads to spontaneous life-threatening bleeding episodes leading to deaths 
and morbidity from chronic joint disease. When untreated, most individuals with severe haemophilia 
die from bleeding complications before 25 years of age. Compared to the general population, all-cause 
mortality is higher (by a factor of 2.69), and median life expectancy is lower (15 years less). Even in 
the era of adequate factor replacement products, the hallmark of haemophilia B is the lifelong 
propensity for bleeding.  
Since designation, there have been no changes in the chronically debilitating or life-threatening nature 
of haemophilia B.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of initial orphan designation in 2011, the prevalence was estimated to be 0.23 per 10,000 
persons in the EU community. The estimate has been re-reviewed as discussed below. 
A  comprehensive  literature  review  was  conducted  using  PubMed  and  Embase  to  identify  recent 
publications (2011-2022) reporting the prevalence of haemophilia B in the European Union, UK, Norway, 
Iceland  and  Liechtenstein.  Furthermore,  the  sponsor  presents  data  from  the  World  Federation  of 
Haemophilia (WFH) Global Annual Survey 2020 (WFH, 2020). 
Prevalence reported in the published literature:  
Studies conducted in individual EU countries and UK show a range of prevalence from as low as 0.06 per 
10,000 people in Poland up to 0.807 per 10,000 people in Ireland (Table 1).

*Prevalence at birth 
The prevalence of haemophilia B within the EU was reported to be between 2.69 and 8.07 per 100 000 
males  (Stonebraker  et  al,  2011a,  Stonebraker  et  al,  2011b).  Ireland  had  the  highest  reported 
haemophilia B prevalence with 8.07 per 100 000 males (Stonebraker et al, 2011a).   
Schramm et al, describes 9,448 patients with bleeding disorders during 2010 and 2011 (Schramm et al, 
2012), correlating to an estimated prevalence of 0.19 per 10,000 people with Haemophilia B based on a 
population of 80,222,065 people in Germany (Eurostat). 
Giampaolo  et  al  report  859  patients  with  haemophilia  B  in  the  Italian  National  Registry  of  Congenital 
Coagulopathies  (NRCC).  This  correlates  to  a  prevalence  of  haemophilia  B  in  Italy  of  0.14  per  10,000 
people based on an Italian population of 60,665,551 in 2016 (Eurostat). 
Reports of haemophilia in Poland have increased from 2006 to 2011 with a reported 2,366 haemophilia 
patients in Poland in 2011. Haemophilia B is claimed to be 9.8% of the cases and as such, this would 
equate to 232 patients with haemophilia B. The population of Poland in 2011 is estimated as 38,062,718 
people  and  as  such  this  would  equate  to  1  case  of  haemophilia  B  in  every  164,063  people  (0.06  per 
10,000 people), (Zdziarska et al, 2011). 
The proportion of cases of haemophilia B in the population of live male births over a period of time, also 
called prevalence at birth, was estimated by pooling data from national registries in France and the UK. 
This study reported prevalence at birth during 1991-2015 as 0.52 and 0.47 per 10,000 male births in 
France  and  the  UK  respectively  (Iorio  et  al,  2019).  Of  note,  a  birth  prevalence  around  0.5  in  10,000 
males translates to a complete prevalence of approximately 0.18 in 10,000 in the EU (based on recent 
EUROSTAT data of birth rate and general population). 
World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH): 
Based on the number of haemophilia patients identified in Europe from the WFH Global Annual Survey 
2020 (WFH, 2020), it is estimated that there are 3,733 patients in a population of 236,734,660 in 
Europe in 2020 with haemophilia B. This equates to a prevalence of 1 in 63,416 people (0.15 per 
10,000) for haemophilia B (Table 2).

In conclusion, the range of prevalence reported in the published literature is between 0.06-0.807 per 
10,000 people with an approximate average of 0.26 per 10,000 persons. The European data from the 
WFH Global Annual Survey 2020 (WFH, 2020) reports a prevalence of 0.15 per 10,000 persons for 
haemophilia B. Based on this data the COMP concluded that a prevalence estimate of less than 0.3 per 
10,000 adequately reflects the current prevalence of haemophilia B in the EU. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Standard therapy for patients with haemophilia B is Factor IX replacement therapy using recombinant 
FIX (rFIX) or plasma-derived products, and the sponsor provides a list of the authorised products 
(Table 1). Depending on the severity of the disease, patients may receive long term substitution 
(prophylaxis) and on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes. Factor VII is also authorised for use in 
patients with inhibitors.

In the context of this procedure, all authorized factor IX (FIX) products are considered satisfactory 
methods, which need to be considered for the significant benefit discussion of Hemgenix.

Significant benefit 
The sponsor claims that their data from the pivotal licensing studies demonstrates that Hemgenix 
provides a clinically relevant advantage for patients with severe and moderately severe haemophilia B, 
as compared to currently authorized standard of care continuous Factor IX routine prophylaxis, 
including products with extended half-life.   
The main evidence for efficacy stems from the pivotal clinical trial CT-AMT-061-02 (n=54; adult 
patients with severe or moderately severe FIX deficiency; non-randomized, open-label, single arm 
study; single dose of AMT-061 of 2 × 1013 gc/kg; intra-patient comparison, i.e. patients treated with 
Hemgenix are compared to their baseline parameters established during the 6 months lead-in period, 
where patients were treated with authorized Factor IX prophylaxis therapy; primary endpoint defined 
as: “annualized bleeding rate (ABR) comparison between AMT-061 and prophylaxis for non-inferiority 
between the 52 weeks following stable FIX expression (6-18 months) post treatment (AMT-061) 
follow-up and the lead-in phase”; at time of orphan maintenance review up to 2-year efficacy follow-up 
data available).

Figure 1.   
Table 2. Patient’s treatment history in the pivotal study CT-AMT-061-02 
The results of this pivotal clinical study show that a single administration of Hemgenix led to clinically 
relevant increases in endogenous Factor IX activity in the majority (52/54) of subjects and remained 
stable at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after treatment, with mean FIX activity 
levels of approximately 40% (Figure 2). No subject showed supraphysiologic FIX activity.

Figure 2.  Endogenous Factor IX activity following treatment with Hemgenix 
Following treatment with Hemgenix and stable FIX expression, ABR was significantly reduced for all 
bleeding types overall including FIX-treated, spontaneous, traumatic, and joint bleeding episodes 
(Month 7 to 18 post-dose, primary efficacy endpoint). In the pivotal trial CT-AMT-061-02, the pre-
specified non-inferiority analysis encompassing a comparison of ABR between the lead-in (4.19) and 
post-treatment (1.51) period was significant and non-inferiority to standard of care routine Factor IX 
prophylaxis could be declared. In addition, the secondary outcome of superiority over FIX prophylaxis 
could be shown. Importantly, superiority against the specific group of standard of care continuous 
routine Factor IX prophylaxis products with extended half-life could also be demonstrated. ABR was 
maintained for all bleeding types from Month 7 to 24 versus the Lead-in Period (64% reduction for all 
bleeding types vs the Lead-in Period), Table 3.

Table 3. Summary of bleeding episodes and annualized bleeding rate (pivotal study CT-AMT-061-02; full 
analysis set) 
Use of exogenous FIX as well as FIX infusion rate fell to approximately 3% of values reported during 
lead-in. The number of subjects who did not experience any bleeding event more than doubled during 
month 7-18 [34/54 (63.0%)] compared to baseline [14/54 (25.9%)]. This is considered a clinically 
relevant improvement over FIX-prophylaxis, because many spontaneous bleeds occur in joints and 
joint health continues to deteriorate over time despite the current standard of care FIX prophylaxis 
therapy. In fact, 20.4% of subjects reported joint bleeding episodes post-treatment until month 18, 
and 27.8% reported joint bleeds until month 24, while 59.3% of subjects reported such events during 
the lead-in period, which is a clear improvement and represents a clinically meaningful benefit.     
The ideal outcome of the therapy in the long-term, in addition to reduction of ABR, would be freedom 
of previous intravenous FIX substitution therapy. Importantly, 34/53 (64.2%) subjects whose baseline 
anti-AAV5 nAb titre was <3000 had 0 bleeding episodes during the Month 7 to 18 post-treatment 
period and 27/53 (50.9) subjects had zero bleeds during Month 7-24 period. 
Additionally, consumption of FIX replacement therapy was significantly lower following treatment with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec after the first year (i.e., between Month 7 and 18) following establishment 
of stable FIX expression (Month 0 to 6) as compared to standard of care routine FIX prophylaxis during 
the 6-month Lead-in Period (Table 4).

measures generalized estimating equations negative binomial regression model accounting for the paired design of the trial with 
an offset parameter to account for the differential collection periods. Treatment period was included as a categorical covariate. 
3  One-sided p-value ≤0.025 for post-treatment/lead-in <1 was regarded as statistically significant. For Month 7-18, p-value 
adjusted for multiplicity. 
Supportive data for efficacy is derived from the dose-response study CT-AMT-061-01 (n=3; adult 
patients with severe or moderately severe FIX deficiency, open-label, single arm study consisting of a 
screening phase, a treatment plus post-treatment follow-up phase, and a long-term follow-up phase; 
study did not contain a lead-in phase so no intra-patient comparisons to previous Factor IX therapy 
could be done; before treatment with Hemgenix patients received prophylactic and on-demand FIX 
replacement therapy (Alprolix, Idelvion); single IV dose of 2 × 10E13 gc/kg AMT-061; at time of 
orphan maintenance review up to 3-year efficacy follow-up data available). 
In study CT-AMT-061-01 mean FIX activity level at Week 6, the time of the primary endpoint read-out, 
was 30.6 % measured by the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by each subject 
at Week 6 were 23.9%, 30.0%, and 37.8%. At Week 52, FIX activity level was 40.8% measured by 
the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by each subject at Week 52 were 31.3%, 
40.8%, and 50.2%. At month 36, the mean FIX activity level was 36.90%, uncontaminated samples 
were available for 2 subjects and demonstrated that FIX activity levels continued to be elevated, at 
32.3% and 41.5%, respectively. The average ABR for the 3 subjects, calculated as the total number of 
bleeding episodes divided by the time (in years) at risk, was 0.27 over the period of 2.5 years (30 
months) of follow-up. The ABRs for spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 2.5 years (30 
months) were both 0.14. The average ABR for the 3 subjects, calculated as the total number of 
bleeding episodes divided by the time (in years) at risk, was 0.22 over the period of 3 years (36 
months) of follow-up. The ABRs for spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 3 years (36 
months) were both 0.11. There were no bleeding episodes between 2.5 and 3 years of follow-up (both 
bleeding episodes occurred in the first 18 months post-AMT-061 administration). As this trial had no 
run-in phase specified in the protocol, a comparison to meaningful pre-treatment data is not possible. 
In study CT-AMT-061-01 the annualized mean FIX replacement use was 306,204.9 IU/year in the 1 
year prior to screening. All subjects discontinued use of routine prophylaxis Factor IX use between 1 
and 4 days post-Hemgenix administration. Over 3 years (36 months) of follow-up, the annualized 
mean FIX use was 714.6 IU/year for the period following discontinuation of routine prophylaxis (post-
continuous FIX prophylaxis period). 3/3 patients remained free of intravenous FIX prophylaxis over 3 
years post-Hemgenix administration. The annualized on-demand FIX usage for participant 1, 2, and 3 
was 0, 0, and 2144 IU/year over 3 years, respectively.   
In conclusion, the COMP is of the opinion that Hemgenix provides a clinically relevant advantage as it 
has been shown that a single administration results in a significant reduction in annualized bleeding 
rate (ABR). In the pivotal trial CT-AMT-061-02, non-inferiority to FIX prophylaxis could be declared on 
the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. “Annualized bleeding rate comparison between AMT-061 and 
prophylaxis for non-inferiority between the lead-in phase and the 52 weeks following stable FIX 
expression, Months 6 to 18 post-treatment”). In addition, the secondary outcome of superiority over

FIX prophylaxis could also be shown. Superiority against the specific group of FIX products with 
extended half-life could also be demonstrated. ABR was maintained for all bleeding types from Month 7 
to 24 versus the Lead-in Period (64% reduction for all bleeding types vs the Lead-in Period). About 
50% of patients had zero bleeds during the Month 7-24 period following Hemgenix administration. 
Importantly, a significant reduction of patients experiencing joint bleeds through month 24 following 
Hemgenix administration has been observed as compared to previous FIX prophylaxis therapy (i.e. 
27.8% vs 59.3%). This is especially noteworthy as recurrent joint bleeding contributes to haemophilic 
arthropathy which severely affects patients’ quality of life (pain and limitation of motion). Furthermore, 
a single administration of Hemgenix resulted in a substantial reduction in the use of exogenous Factor 
IX products through month 24 post-dose. In fact, use of exogenous FIX as well as FIX infusion rate fell 
to approximately 3% of values reported during patient’s previous FIX prophylaxis therapy (lead-in 
period). FIX activity peaked at 12 months and while a limited decline could be observed at 18 months, 
the FIX activity levels have been maintained at 24 months. Supportive data from the dose-response 
study CT-AMT-061-01 in 3 patients showed that annualized bleeding rates remained low even through 
month 36 following the administration of Hemgenix.  Also, over 3 years (36 months) of follow-up, the 
annualized mean exogenous Factor IX use fell to below 1% of values reported during patient’s previous 
FIX prophylaxis therapy, in the 12 months period prior to the administration of Hemgenix (study CT-
AMT-061-01).  
Considering all the above, the COMP agreed that the data presented by the sponsor supports 
significant benefit for the purpose of orphan designation maintenance and that Hemgenix provides a 
clinically relevant advantage for patients.

4.  COMP position adopted on 19 December 2022 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) considered that the designated orphan condition 
“Treatment of haemophilia B” (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”).  
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of haemophilia B (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to spontaneous bleeding episodes 
as well as substantially prolonged bleeding upon injury; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Hemgenix may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. The 
sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate superior efficacy with regards to a reduction in 
annualized bleeding rate compared to standard of care with authorized Factor IX products, 
including those with extended half-life. A single administration of Hemgenix significantly reduced or 
eliminated the need for exogenous Factor IX products over a period of at least 18 months. Also, a 
significant reduction of patients experiencing joint bleeds for at least 18 months following 
Hemgenix administration has been observed, as compared to exogenous factor IX prophylaxis 
therapy. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the 
patients affected by the condition.   
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Hemgenix, recombinant adeno-
associated viral vector containing a codon-optimized Padua derivative of human coagulation factor IX 
cDNA, etranacogene dezaparvovec for treatment of haemophilia B (EU/3/18/1999) is not removed 
from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

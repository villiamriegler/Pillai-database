This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. 
See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 
1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Oxbryta 500 mg film-coated tablets 
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains 500 mg of voxelotor. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet. 
Light yellow to yellow, oval shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablet of approximately 18 mm × 10 mm, 
debossed with “GBT 500” on one side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Oxbryta is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults 
and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with 
hydroxycarbamide. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of SCD. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Oxbryta is 1,500 mg (three 500 mg film-coated tablets) taken orally once 
daily. 
If a dose is missed, treatment should be continued on the day following the missed dose. 
Paediatric population 
The recommended dose of Oxbryta in patients 12 to < 18 years of age is the same as for adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Oxbryta in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been 
established yet. No data are available. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Oxbryta has not 
been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Oxbryta is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. The recommended dose of voxelotor in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh C) is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg film-coated tablets) taken once daily (see section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oxbryta film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Oxbryta can be taken with or 
without food (see section 5.2). Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed because of the unpleasant 
taste. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
(see section 4.4.). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in < 1% of patients treated with voxelotor in 
clinical studies. Clinical manifestations may include generalised rash, urticaria, mild shortness of 
breath, mild facial swelling, and eosinophilia (see section 4.8). 
If hypersensitivity reactions occur, voxelotor must be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy 
must be administered. Voxelotor must not be reinitiated in patients who experience these symptoms 
with previous use. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan 
hypersensitivity, which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported in association  with Oxbryta 
(see section 4.8).  
At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored 
closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Oxbryta should 
be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered. If the patient has developed a 
serious reaction such as DRESS with the use of Oxbryta, treatment with Oxbryta must not be restarted 
in this patient at any time. 
Laboratory test interference 
Oxbryta administration may interfere with measurement of haemoglobin (Hb) subtypes (HbA, HbS, 
and HbF) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). If precise quantitation of Hb species is 
required, chromatography should be performed when the patient has not received Oxbryta therapy in 
the immediately preceding 10 days. 
Renal impairment 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor were observed in subjects 
without SCD with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is 
recommended. Safety of voxelotor has not been evaluated in SCD patients with ESRD requiring 
dialysis.

Hepatic impairment 
There are limited data on the safety of voxelotor in patients with SCD with different degrees of hepatic 
impairment. Based on pharmacokinetic data in subjects without SCD, severe hepatic impairment 
increases voxelotor exposures (see section 5.2). The voxelotor dose in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh C) should be adjusted (see section 4.2). 
Concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers with Oxbryta should be avoided due to the risk of 
decreased efficacy of voxelotor (see section 4.5). 
SCD genotypes 
Most patients (90.5%) in the pivotal Phase 3 study had SCD genotype HbSS (75.2%) or 
HbS/β0-thalassemia (15.3%). Therefore, safety and efficacy data on other SCD genotypes are limited. 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of voxelotor did not include patients > 65 years of age. 
Combination therapy with hydroxycarbamide 
When Oxbryta is administered in combination with hydroxycarbamide, the prescribing information of 
hydroxycarbamide should be consulted. 
Immunosuppressive effects 
Voxelotor decreased the humoral immune response to antigens in both rats and monkeys. Clinical 
relevance in already immunocompromised patients or in patients treated with immunosuppressive 
drugs cannot be excluded. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1,500 mg (daily dose), that is to 
say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on voxelotor 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease voxelotor exposures and may lead to 
reduced efficacy. 
Coadministration of voxelotor with strong CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., rifampicin, phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort extract) should be avoided. 
Other interactions studied 
Itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), omeprazole (acid reducing agent), and hydroxycarbamide 
had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor. 
Effect of voxelotor on other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrates 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Voxelotor increased the systemic exposure of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate). The 
observed exposure increase of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam was 1.6-fold in healthy subjects at a 
voxelotor sub-therapeutic dose (observed voxelotor Cmax 7.0 - 8.0 microgram/mL and AUC 
126.3 - 148.9 microgram⋅hr/mL). The effect at the full dose level of voxelotor is expected to be larger. 
Coadministration of voxelotor with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., 
alfentanil, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be avoided. If concomitant use is unavoidable, consider 
dose reduction of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate(s). 
CYP2B6 substrates 
In vitro studies indicated that voxelotor acts as an inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6 (see section 5.2). 
The clinical relevance is currently unknown, and caution is recommended when co-administering 
voxelotor with sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 such as bupropion and efavirenz. 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates 
Voxelotor is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 at maximal systemic 
concentrations. There was no observed change on the exposures of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) 
and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) in healthy volunteers at a sub therapeutic voxelotor dose 
(observed voxelotor Cmax 7.0 - 8.0 microgram/mL and AUC 126.3 - 148.9 microgram⋅hr/mL). The 
effect at the full dose level of voxelotor is currently unknown. Caution is recommended when 
co-administering voxelotor with sensitive substrates of CYP enzymes. 
Transporter-mediated drug interactions 
In vitro studies indicated that voxelotor may act as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1 
transporters (see section 5.2). Therefore, caution is recommended when co-administering voxelotor 
with sensitive substrates of these transporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic 
index. 
Concomitant use of voxelotor with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) did not alter digoxin to a clinically 
relevant extent. Voxelotor is not an inhibitor of bile salt export pump (BSEP). It is not known if 
voxelotor affects the oral absorption of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrates. 
Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents 
Specific interaction studies with oral contraceptives have not been performed. However, based on the 
results of in vitro studies, a negative impact of voxelotor on contraceptive efficacy is not expected. 
Other interactions studied 
Voxelotor did not change the systemic exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) and metoprolol 
(CYP2D6 substrate). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of voxelotor in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Oxbryta during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether voxelotor/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of voxelotor in milk and 
subsequent uptake in pups (for details see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Voxelotor should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No human data are available on the effect of voxelotor on fertility. In rats, effects on sperm motility 
and morphology were observed. These effects did not, however, affect the reproductive performance 
(see section 5.3). Relevance to human is not known. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Oxbryta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions include headache (31.8%), diarrhoea (22.7%) and abdominal 
pain (22.7%). Serious adverse reactions include headache (1.1%) and drug hypersensitivity (1.1%). 
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.3% of patients. 
Dose modifications (dose reduction or dosing interruption) due to an adverse reaction occurred in 
13.6% of patients who received voxelotor in the pivotal study. The adverse reactions requiring dose 
modification included rash (4.5%), diarrhoea (3.4%), headache (2.3%), nausea (2.3%), abdominal pain 
(1.1%), and drug hypersensitivity (1.1%). 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs): drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
(DRESS) has been reported in association with Oxbryta treatment (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 lists adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients treated with voxelotor 1,500 mg during a 
72-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 study (n=88), as well as 
adverse reactions from postmarketing experience. 
Adverse reactions reported with voxelotor are listed by system organ class and preferred term. Within 
each system organ class, adverse reactions are listed under frequency categories. Frequencies are 
defined as very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
clinical study data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders 
In the pivotal Phase 3 study, the most commonly reported GI adverse reactions were diarrhoea, 
abdominal pain and nausea with diarrhoea and nausea showing a dose-dependent effect. The majority 
of reported GI events were Grade 1 or 2 and were manageable without the need for dose interruption, 
reduction or treatment discontinuation and resolved with continued use. Gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions resulting in dose reductions occurred in 4.5% of patients. Diarrhoea was the most common 
adverse reaction and was reported in 22.7%, and 11.0% of patients in the voxelotor 1,500 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively. There was 1 (1.1%) report of Grade 3 diarrhoea. A serious adverse 
reaction of nausea resulting in hospitalization occurred in 1 (1.1%) patient in the voxelotor 1,500 mg 
group. 
Drug hypersensitivity 
In the pivotal Phase 3 study, 1 patient (1.1%) experienced drug hypersensitivity on Study Day 40. 
Observed symptoms included generalized morbilliform rash, urticaria, mild shortness of breath, mild 
facial swelling, pyrexia, headache, and diarrhoea. Elevated eosinophils were noted. Symptoms abated 
after voxelotor was withheld, and recurrence was observed after reintroduction of voxelotor. Event 
resolved with antihistamine and oral corticosteroids. 
Rash 
In the pivotal Phase 3 Study, rash was reported in 14.8% and 11.0% of patients in the voxelotor 
1,500 mg and placebo groups, respectively. The majority of rash events were similar in appearance 
(consistent with typical maculopapular drug eruptions) and distribution, were not associated with 
extradermal symptoms, and were clinically manageable with or without treatment including oral 
antihistamines or topical corticosteroids. Exposure-response analysis did not reveal a statistically 
significant dose- or exposure-response relationship. 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile observed in paediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age treated with voxelotor in the 
clinical studies was similar to that seen in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There was one report of overdose in the pivotal Phase 3 study where a patient took a total of 3,000 mg 
of voxelotor at one time. There were no adverse reactions associated with this event. 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures 
instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX03 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Voxelotor is a haemoglobin S (HbS) polymerisation inhibitor that binds to HbS with a 1:1 
stoichiometry and exhibits preferential partitioning to red blood cells (RBCs). By increasing the 
affinity of Hb for oxygen, voxelotor demonstrates dose-dependent inhibition of HbS polymerisation. 
Voxelotor inhibits RBC sickling and improves RBC deformability. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic effect of voxelotor treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in 
Hb oxygen affinity as determined by the change in p20 and p50 (partial pressure of oxygen at which 
Hb oxygen saturation of 20% or 50% is achieved) that was linearly correlated with voxelotor exposure 
leading to inhibition of HbS polymerisation. The impact of the anti-polymerisation effect is to reduce 
measures of haemolysis (indirect bilirubin) with a concomitant decrease in percent reticulocyte count 
and an increase in Hb consistent with improvement in haemolytic anaemia. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
At plasma concentrations approximately 2-fold above therapeutic concentrations, voxelotor does not 
prolong QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of voxelotor in patients with SCD was evaluated in a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (EudraCT2016-003370-40). In this study, 
274 patients were randomised to daily oral administration of voxelotor 1,500 mg (N=90), voxelotor 
900 mg (N=92), or placebo (N=92). Patients were included if they had baseline Hb ≥ 5.5 g/dL 
(3.41 mmol/L) to ≤ 10.5 g/dL (6.52 mmol/L) and 1 to 10 vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events within 
12 months prior to enrolment. Otherwise eligible patients on stable doses of hydroxycarbamide for at 
least 90 days were allowed to continue hydroxycarbamide therapy throughout the study. 
Randomization was stratified by patients already receiving hydroxycarbamide (yes, no), geographic 
region (North America, Europe, Other), and age (12 to < 18 years, 18 to 65 years). Key exclusion 
criteria included patients who (1) were receiving regular RBC transfusions, (2) received RBC 
transfusions within 60 days, (3) received erythropoietin within 28 days of enrolment, (4) had known 
active hepatitis A, B, or C or who were known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive 
(5) had severe renal insufficiency, (6) had uncontrolled liver disease, (7) were pregnant, or (8) were 
breast-feeding. 
Seventy-five percent of patients had HbSS genotype, 15% had HbS/β0-thalassemia, 4% 
HbS/β+-thalassemia, 3% HbSC, and 3% other sickle cell variants. The majority were receiving 
hydroxycarbamide therapy (65%). The median age was 24 years (range: 12 to 64 years); 46 (17%) 
patients were 12 to < 18 years of age. Median baseline Hb was 8.5 g/dL (5.28 mmol/L) (5.9 to 
10.8 g/dL [3.66 to 6.70 mmol/L]). One hundred and fifteen (42%) had 1 VOC event and 159 (58%) 
had 2 to 10 events within 12 months prior to enrolment. Of the 274 patients, 75 (27.4%) discontinued 
the study early. The main reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (10.2%) and adverse 
events (8.4%). 
Efficacy was based on the following primary endpoint: Hb response rate defined as a Hb increase of 
> 1 g/dL (0.62 mmol/L) from baseline to Week 24 in patients treated with voxelotor 1,500 mg versus 
placebo. The response rate for voxelotor 1,500 mg was 51.1% (46/90) compared to 6.5% (6/92) in the 
placebo group (p < 0.001). No outlier subgroups were observed (Figure 1). The increase in Hb was 
observed beginning at Week 2 and maintained through Week 72. The distribution of Hb change from 
baseline for individual patients completing 24 weeks of treatment with voxelotor 1,500 mg or placebo 
is depicted in Figure 2.

The total number and annualized incidence rate (IR) of on-treatment VOCs were as follows: 219 
events with adjusted IR of 2.4 events/year in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group and 293 events with 
adjusted IR of 2.8 events/year in the placebo group. No statistically significant difference was 
observed between the treatment groups; however, the study was not designed to detect a difference.  
In the pivotal study leg ulcers were observed at baseline: 4 in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group, 3 in the 
placebo group. In the voxelotor group, all 4 patients with leg ulcers at baseline improved after 
treatment (3 patients had resolution by Week 72 and 1 patient with moderate severity at baseline 
improved to mild). One patient developed new leg ulcers during treatment. In contrast, in the placebo 
group, only 1 of the 3 patients with leg ulcers at baseline had improvement and 5 patients developed 
new leg ulcers. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
voxelotor in paediatric population from birth to < 6 months of age in the treatment of haemolytic 
anaemia due to SCD. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
voxelotor in paediatric population from 6 months of age to < 12 years of age in the treatment of 
haemolytic anaemia due to SCD, as well as further data from studies in the paediatric population less 
than 18 years of age. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Study GBT440 007 
Study GBT440 007 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicentre, open-label single- and multiple-dose study 
designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of voxelotor in paediatric patients with 
SCD. Efficacy and safety data from the completed multiple-dose part in patients 12 to < 18 years of 
age with SCD (HbSS or HbS/β0-thalassemia) who received voxelotor 900 mg or 1,500 mg for 
24 weeks are discussed here. 
In total, 25 patients received voxelotor 900 mg and 15 patients received voxelotor 1,500 mg. The 
median age in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group was 14 years (range: 12-17 years), 33% were male and 
73% were Black. Most patients in the 1,500 mg group had HbSS genotype (80%) and all used 
hydroxycarbamide at baseline. Thirty-three percent (33%) had no history of VOC within the 
12 months prior to screening and 33% had 1 or 2 VOCs in the 12 months prior to screening. Median 
baseline Hb level was 8.8 g/dL (5.46 mmol/L). Eighty-eight percent (88.0%) of patients in the 
voxelotor 900 mg group and 80.0% of patients in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group completed the study 
with 24 weeks of dosing. One patient in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group discontinued due to an adverse 
reaction (Grade 1 diarrhoea). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy assessments included clinical measures of anaemia (Hb) and haemolysis (percent reticulocyte 
count and indirect bilirubin). Consistent with the results of the Phase 3 Study of voxelotor, 
improvements in Hb were observed as early as Week 2 and were maintained through Week 24: 
median change in Hb from baseline to Week 20/Week 24 average was 0.7 g/dL (0.43 mmol/L) for the 
1,500 mg group, decrease in percent reticulocyte count at 24 weeks was -17.4% (-35.6, -36.5) and 
decrease in indirect bilirubin was -42.8% (-50.5, -15.4) in the voxelotor 1,500 mg group. The safety 
profile was consistent with that observed in the Phase 3 Study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The median plasma and whole blood Tmax of voxelotor after oral administration is 2 hours. The mean 
peak concentrations in whole blood and RBCs are observed between 6 and 18 hours after oral 
administration. The PK are linear over the dose range of 100 mg to 2,800 mg. Steady-state after 
repeated administration is reached within 8 days and exposures of voxelotor plasma and whole blood 
(Table 3) are consistent with accumulation predicted based on single dose data in patients with SCD.

Effect of food 
In healthy subjects, administration of a single 900 mg dose of Oxbryta with a high-fat meal resulted in 
a 45% and 42% increase in whole blood Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared to fasted conditions. 
In clinical studies, subjects with SCD took voxelotor without instructions with respect to food intake 
and had plasma and whole blood voxelotor exposures similar to subjects with SCD who took 
voxelotor after an overnight fast. The difference is less than 20% for any of the parameters and not 
considered to be clinically significant. Therefore, voxelotor can be taken with or without food. 
Distribution 
Voxelotor is absorbed into plasma and is then distributed predominantly into RBCs due to its 
preferential binding to Hb. Voxelotor apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment and 
peripheral compartment in patients with SCD are 333 L and 72.3 L in plasma, respectively. Protein 
binding is 99.8% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 15:1 in patients with SCD. 
The pharmacokinetics of voxelotor in healthy subjects is different from patients with SCD due to the 
differences in blood-to-plasma partitioning (ratio 32:1). The volume of distribution in healthy subjects 
is approximately 754 L. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that voxelotor is extensively metabolized through Phase I 
(oxidation and reduction), Phase II (glucuronidation) and combinations of Phase I and II metabolism. 
Oxidation of voxelotor is mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contribution from CYP2C19, 
CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. Sulfatation of voxelotor is mediated primarily by SULT1B1 and SULT1C4 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and direct glucuronidation of voxelotor is mediated by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. The major plasma 
metabolite results from O-dealkylation-sulfation and represents 16.8% of voxelotor-related material in 
plasma. Five further metabolites accounted for a total of 23% of voxelotor-related material in plasma, 
with individual contributions up to 9%. All other metabolites were less than 5%. 
Elimination 
The major route of elimination of voxelotor is by metabolism with subsequent excretion of metabolites 
into urine and faeces. The excretion of unchanged voxelotor is minimal (< 1% of dose in urine). The 
geometric mean (%CV) terminal elimination half-life of voxelotor in patients with SCD is 38.7 hours 
(30.2%) with concentrations in plasma, and whole blood declining in parallel. The apparent oral 
clearance of voxelotor was estimated as 6.1 L/h in plasma in patients with SCD. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
There was no clinically significant effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor in subjects 
without SCD and patients with SCD. Following a single 900 mg dose of voxelotor, whole blood 
exposures in subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 25% lower 
compared to healthy controls. The unbound plasma concentrations were comparable. In patients with 
SCD, a trend for higher voxelotor exposure was observed with lower Cystatin C levels. Higher levels 
of Cystatin C typically observed with renal impairment were not associated with higher voxelotor 
exposure. 
Voxelotor has not been evaluated in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
In plasma, the Cmax was 1.2-fold higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), 
1.5-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) and 1.4-fold higher in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), and the AUCinf was 1.1-fold higher in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 1.2-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
and 1.9-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. In whole blood, increase in exposure 
was similar to that in plasma. No dose adjustment is warranted in subjects with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment, but it is recommended to reduce the daily dose of voxelotor to 1,000 mg in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). The plasma and whole blood Cmax values in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment after dose adjustment are expected to be similar to those in 
patients with normal hepatic function treated at the recommended dose of 1,500 mg daily. The plasma 
and whole blood AUC are expected to be ~25% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
after dose adjustment compared to those in patients with normal hepatic function treated at the 
recommended dose of 1,500 mg daily. 
Effect of gender, race, and body weight 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor were observed based on 
gender, race, and body weight (28 to 135 kg). 
Effect of age 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor were observed based on age 
(12 to 59 years). 
Effect of haematocrit 
The blood-to-plasma partitioning of voxelotor increases with increasing haematocrit. As haematocrit 
increased from 30.5% in SCD patients (median at 1,500 mg daily) to the maximum haematocrit 
measured at 1,500 mg daily (35.1%), the blood-to-plasma partitioning increased from 14.8 to 16.4 
(11% increase). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with HbSC genotype 
Voxelotor steady state whole blood AUC and Cmax were 50% and 45% higher in HbSC genotype 
patients (n=11) compared to HbSS genotype (n=220) patients and voxelotor steady state plasma AUC 
and Cmax were 23% and 15% higher in HbSC genotype patients compared to HbSS genotype patients. 
In vitro drug interactions 
CYP enzymes: In vitro, voxelotor is an inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6 and an inhibitor of CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The clinical relevance is currently unknown (see section 4.5). 
UGT enzymes: In vitro data indicate that voxelotor is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B7 at maximal systemic concentration. Due to solubility issues, no concentrations up to 
maximal intestinal concentrations could be investigated for UGT1A1. No inhibition was observed 
towards UGT1A1 up to 100 micromol (the highest concentration investigated). 
Transporter-mediated interactions: Voxelotor is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT2, 
OAT1, MATE2-K, or BSEP. Voxelotor act as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1 
transporters (see section 4.5). Voxelotor is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1A2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, or BSEP. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
Repeated dose toxicity 
The major findings associated with repeat-dose administration of voxelotor was compensatory 
erythropoiesis, manifested as increased red blood cell mass (↑ RBC, HCT, Hb, RET) correlated 
microscopically with hypercellular bone marrow and splenic red pulp and  increased splenic weight in 
rats, mice and cynomolgus monkeys. In monkeys, early stages of this effect were seen at dose levels 
comparable with clinical exposure (exposure multiple of ~0.6 based on the plasma Cmax values). 
Voxelotor also caused GI intolerance attributed to local irritation. Other findings attributed to 
voxelotor include induction of CYP enzymes in the liver of mice and rats, altered T cell-dependent 
antigen response in rodents and monkeys and prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) intervals in 
monkeys. Following the immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), voxelotor caused the 
significantly reduced IgG (rats, monkeys) and IgM (monkeys) titres, a delayed peak in the antibody 
response (monkeys) and the changes in the relative lymphocyte distribution (rats). These effects were 
seen at the exposure multiple of the anticipated clinical exposure ~0.6 in monkeys and ~4.0 in rats 
based on plasma Cmax value. Treatment with voxelotor at the exposure multiple ~2.5 of the anticipated 
clinical exposure led to the QT and QTc intervals prolongation in monkeys. 
Reproduction and development 
Treatment of rats with voxelotor at exposure multiple ~4 of the anticipated clinical exposure caused a 
reduced sperm motility and an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, as well as an increased 
testicular and prostate weight and reduced seminal vesicles weight. These effects did not, however, 
affect the reproductive performance. Voxelotor was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposure 
levels causing maternal toxicity (exposure multiple based on blood AUC of 2.8 in rats and 0.3 in 
rabbits). Voxelotor is excreted in milk of lactating rats. Milk exposure was up to 0.4-fold plasma 
exposure of the dams, leading to subsequent plasma exposure in pups. In the pre- and postnatal 
developmental toxicity study, adverse effects on the progeny, manifested as reduced pup viability 
index and persistently lower pup weight, were seen at the predicted exposure multiple of ~2.6 of the 
anticipated human exposure. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental risk assessment 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that voxelotor is not bioaccumulative and toxic to 
the environment; however, it has the potential to be persistent in sediments (see section 6.6).

1. 
What Oxbryta is and what it is used for 
What Oxbryta is and how it works 
Oxbryta contains the active substance voxelotor. Voxelotor works on a protein in red blood cells 
called haemoglobin to help it take up oxygen that red blood cells can deliver throughout the body. 
Patients with the condition called sickle cell disease have an altered form of haemoglobin called sickle 
haemoglobin which is different from the normal haemoglobin. When the sickle haemoglobin gives up 
oxygen to the tissues, it sticks together to form long rods and causes red blood cells to alter their shape 
to that of a crescent moon making these cells rigid and sickled shape. Sickle red blood cells cannot 
deliver oxygen as well as healthy red blood cells and are also broken down more quickly, leading to 
lowered levels of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia). By improving the way the altered 
haemoglobin holds onto oxygen, Oxbryta improves the function of red blood cells and prolongs their 
lifespan. 
What Oxbryta is used for 
Oxbryta, alone or together with hydroxycarbamide (also known as hydroxyurea), is used to treat 
haemolytic anaemia in adults and children from 12 years with sickle cell disease.  
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Oxbryta 
Do not take Oxbryta 
• 
if you are allergic to voxelotor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Oxbryta if you have: 
• 
• 
severe kidney problems 
severe liver problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Oxbryta. 
If you get any symptoms of allergic reactions, stop taking Oxbryta and talk to your doctor or get 
emergency medical help immediately. Symptoms are for example rash, including nettle rash (hives), 
shortness of the breath and swelling of the face. 
Serious skin reaction such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), has 
been reported in association with Oxbryta treatment. Stop using Oxbryta and seek medical attention 
immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to this serious skin reaction described in 
section 4. 
If you are receiving blood transfusions, talk to your doctor about possible difficulties with the 
interpretation of certain blood tests when taking this medicine. 
Children under 12 years 
This medicine is not recommended for children under 12 years due to lack of data in this age group. 
Other medicines and Oxbryta 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Some medicines can affect how Oxbryta works or may make side effects more likely. In particular, tell 
your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: 
• 
rifampicin (used to treat bacterial infections) 
• 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy and other illnesses) 
• 
sirolimus, tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation) 
• 
St John’s wort (a herbal medicine to treat depression) 
• 
alfentanil (a painkiller used during an operation with anaesthetics) 
Tell your doctor that you are taking Oxbryta if you are having a medical procedure or surgery. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
• 
Pregnancy 
Your doctor will help you to decide whether you should stop taking Oxbryta during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while taking Oxbryta because it is not known if voxelotor passes into breast 
milk and could affect the baby. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Oxbryta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Oxbryta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of three tablets, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Oxbryta 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
The recommended dose for adults and children from 12 years is: 
Three 500 mg tablets taken once daily by mouth. 
Swallow the tablets whole with one glass of water, with or without food. Do not cut, crush or chew the 
tablets because of bad taste. 
If you take more Oxbryta than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Oxbryta 
Continue with your normal dosing schedule on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up for 
a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Oxbryta 
Do not stop taking this medicine without your doctor’s advice. It is important to take Oxbryta daily. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for voxelotor, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Based on the PRAC review of data on safety and efficacy, the PRAC considers that the risk-benefit 
balance of medicinal products containing voxelotor remains unchanged but recommends that the terms 
of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied as follows: 
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
In view of available data on Drug reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), in 
particular 3 spontaneous reports including a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or 
re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between voxelotor and Drug reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing voxelotor should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for voxelotor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing voxelotor is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

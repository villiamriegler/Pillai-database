Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically and with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), plaque psoriasis (Ps), and Crohn's disease (CD), the other primary form of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
Problem statement 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the first of the two primary forms of idiopathic IBD. It is a chronic, relapsing 
inflammatory disease of the rectum and/or large intestine characterized by inflammation and 
ulceration of the mucosal and submucosal intestinal layers. The clinical symptoms include inflammatory 
diarrhoea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus. The clinical course is marked by exacerbation 
and remission. The onset of UC can occur in all ages, but is most commonly diagnosed in late 
adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence in Europe is estimated at 1.5 to 20.3 cases per 
100,000 person-years.   
The diagnosis of UC is established after colonoscopy and histology of colonic mucosa. Clinical features 
can vary among individuals, and in general do not reflect the histological and endoscopic findings. 
Common symptoms can include inflammatory diarrhoea (rectal bleeding, presence of mucus) and 
sometimes abdominal pain. Disease of moderate or severe activity may be associated with anorexia, 
nausea, weight loss, and rarely fever.The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic 
megacolon and perforation. Extraintestinal complications include arthritis (sacroiliitis and ankylosing 
spondylitis), dermatological conditions (pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, aphthous 
stomatitis), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Patients with UC are at an increased risk for 
colon cancer and more rarely lymphoma. UC can be considered an autoimmune disease, harbouring in 
genetically susceptible individuals. The inflammatory process plays a key role in the injury of colonic 
mucosa that characterises the UC. In this cascade, the tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFα) appears to be 
critical to the amplification of mucosal inflammation.  
The aim of medical treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission. Conventional therapies often 
do not completely abate the inflammatory process and have significant side effects. Conventional 
therapies for the induction of remission have included anti-inflammatory agents (5-aminosalicylic acid 
[5-ASA] derivatives and corticosteroids) and the immunomodulatory agent cyclosporine. 5-ASA 
derivatives as well as immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) have been 
used for the maintenance of remission. Corticosteroids are not effective for the maintenance of 
remission.  Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNFα antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC and is approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderate to severe UC who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
The main option of the surgical treatment consists of a total colectomy that is a curative approach. 
However, this radical procedure can be associated with significant decrease of the quality of life and 
transient morbidities.

Scope of the variation  
In this submission the MAH applies for a new therapeutic indication for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or 
who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated accordingly as well as Annex II and IIIB. 
The SmPC has been revised to incorporate all information relevant to the UC indication. Some editorial 
changes have also been made to make the text flow better, including a re-ordering of SmPC section 
4.1 to group the indications by therapy area.  
The initially applied wording for extension of indication reads as follows: 
Ulcerative colitis 
Humira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6- 
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies.

Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/85/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/85/2010 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Development programme and compliance with CHMP guidance and scientific advice 
The  clinical  development  program  for  adalimumab  in  the  sought  UC  indication  includes  3  clinical 
studies:  
- 
Two pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; both completed: 
o  Study M06-826 (induction of remission study) 
o  Study M06-827 (induction and maintenance of remission study) 
- 
An ongoing supportive long-term open-label (OL) extension study: Study M10-223 (with a data 
cut-off of 31 December 2009 for the data included in this submission).   
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected only in Study M06-827. Study M06-826 compared the 
efficacy and safety of adalimumab 160/80/40 mg and adalimumab 80/40 mg to placebo and consisted 
of an 8- or 12-week double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled period followed by an OL period (duration 
depended on the version/amendment of the protocol) through 52 weeks. Study M06-827 compared the 
efficacy and safety of adalimumab 160/80/40 to placebo and consisted of a DB, placebo-controlled 
period of up to 52 weeks, with the option to switch to OL adalimumab in the event of a disease flare

starting at Week 12. In the OL extension study subjects received adalimumab 40 mg eow or ew, if 
required. 
Compliance with scientific advice  
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP in June 2006 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/233559/2006) 
before the start of the UC clinical development program. The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical 
aspects of the dossier. Based on this scientific advice, the maintenance Study M06-827 was designed 
so that the placebo-controlled portion of the study began at Week 0 and continued through Week 52, 
rather than having an open-label run-in phase up to Week 8. It was expected that this design would 
best provide information on the benefit of continuing adalimumab beyond 8 weeks in subjects who did 
or did not respond by Week 8. Overall, the pivotal studies submitted (the induction study of at least 8 
weeks and a second induction and maintenance of at least 52 weeks) are consistent with the plan 
agreed by the SAWP in 2006. 
Compliance with CHMP guideline  
Applicable for this development is the Guideline on the development of medicinal products for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006). In line with this regulatory guideline, one 
study was conducted to investigate induction of clinical remission at Week 8 (study M06-826) and a 
separate study provided data on the maintenance of clinical remission (study M06-827). Key design 
aspects are discussed in the Discussion on Clinical Efficacy. 
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The clinical trial submitted in support of this variation was performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the applicant. The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted 
outside the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 
2001/20/EC. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of adalimumab has earlier been characterised in patients with RA, AS, JIA, Ps and CD. After 
subcutaneous (SC) administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab is 
slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average 
absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg 
subcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, 
concentrations were dose proportional. Estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution 
(Vss/F) values are fairly similar between indications. CL/F has been estimated on average from 11-18 
mL/h and Vss/F around 10 L. The mean terminal phase half-life is approximately two weeks. CL/F 
increases with body weight and is approximately doubled in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibody. 
Furthermore, concomitant methotrexate treatment has been observed to decrease CL/F by 44%. 
The adalimumab PK was evaluated in subjects with moderately to severely active UC in Study M06-827. 
The population PK of adalimumab was also evaluated for UC subjects using a non-linear mixed effects 
modeling (NONMEM) approach using data from PK Study M06-827. The impact of covariates on 
adalimumab PK was assessed. The PK results from M06-827 were compared with results from previous 
studies in subjects with CD in which subjects were administered a 4-week 160 mg/80 mg induction 
regimen (PK Study M02-403) and a 52-week 40 mg maintenance regimen (PK Study M02-433). The 
Assessment report

PK of adalimumab following a 4-week induction regimen were also evaluated in subjects with moderate 
to severe CD who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab in PK Study M04-691. The 
immunogenicity of adalimumab was examined in all aforementioned studies (M06-827, M02-403, M02-
433 and M04-691). 
Study M06-827 
The PK of adalimumab following SC administration was evaluated in 487 subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC in study M06-827. Subjects were stratified by prior exposure to infliximab and/or 
other anti-TNF agents, and randomized 1:1 to receive adalimumab or placebo by SC injection. Subjects 
assigned to the adalimumab treatment arm received 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg 
every other week (eow) between Weeks 4 and 50. At or after Week 10, subjects were to be evaluated 
to determine if they met the criteria for inadequate response and then switched to open-label 
adalimumab 40 mg eow beginning at Week 12. Subjects who demonstrated inadequate response at 
two consecutive visits at least 14 days apart while on open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow were to dose 
escalate to adalimumab 40 mg weekly. 
Blood samples were collected from all subjects immediately prior to dosing at Weeks 0 (Baseline), 2, 4, 
8, 32, and 52 (or Early Termination Visits) for adalimumab assay and at Weeks 0 (Baseline), 8, 32, 
and 52 (or Early Termination Visits) for anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) assay. Blood samples were 
also collected for infliximab and human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) assays at Week 0 (Baseline) and 
measured by validated assay methods. Adalimumab serum concentrations were determined using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  
Trough serum concentrations of adalimumab were summarized by treatment group at each time point 
using descriptive statistics. The trough values from study M06-827 are presented in Table 1 and 
Figure 1.

Figure 1 
Mean (SD) serum adalimumab trough concentrations versus time by dose in 
subjects with Ulcerative Colitis (Left panel: double-blind 160/80/40 mg group; 
Right panel: double-blind placebo group). 
A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieved 
serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg/ml during the induction period. Mean 
steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 µg/ml were observed in UC patients who received a 
maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Adalimumab concentrations at Week 52 
were approximately double in subjects who dose escalated to 40 mg weekly compared to those who 
received 40 mg eow. Among 245 subjects randomized to the adalimumab 160/80/40 mg eow 
treatment group, 110 were anti-TNF experienced. Among 242 subjects in the placebo treatment group, 
108 were anti-TNF experienced. Data showed that the mean adalimumab trough concentrations were 
similar in anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF–experienced subjects. 
PK in HACA+ vs. HACA- patients.  
Among 245 subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 mg eow treatment group, 52 (21.2%) subjects had 
measurable HACA (HACA+) at Baseline. Among 242 subjects in the placebo treatment group, 44 
(18.2%) subjects were HACA+.  
Population PK analysis 
Population PK analyses were performed to estimate the CL/F and apparent volume of distribution of 
central compartment (V2/F) of adalimumab in subjects with UC. All subjects with at least one 
measurable serum adalimumab concentration during the study (week 0-52) were included in a 
population PK analysis using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. 
The data were described with a two-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination. 
Inter-individual variability was included solely for CL/F and residual error was described with a 
combination of additive and proportional terms. The typical Vss/F was 8.98 L. Body weight, occurrence 
of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA), and plasma albumin were significant covariates on the CL/F. The 
CL/F for typical patient weighing 73 kg, having an albumin level of 4.2 g/dL and being AAA negative 
was 0.37 L/day (15.2 mL/h). The model predicted CL/F was 0.258 L/day and 0.504 L/day for typical 
patients weighing 50 and 100 kg, respectively. The presence of AAA would lead to approximately 
doubling of CL/F for the typical individual. Body weight and AAA have been known to impact

adalimumab PK parameters in a similar way as observed in Crohn’s disease.  Plasma albumin was 
tested as a covariate for the first time and an increase in plasma albumin concentration by 1 g/dL is 
expected to decrease CL/F of adalimumab by approximately 41%, and the predicted CL/F was 0.476 
and 0.251 L/day for a typical subject with an albumin level of 3.5 and 5.0 g/dL, respectively.  
Comparison to PK data in CD patients 
Induction Regimen: PK during the first 4 weeks of the induction period were evaluated in 245 subjects 
(PK Study M06-827) with moderately to severely active UC, 159 subjects (Study M04-691) with 
moderately to severely active CD who had previously responded to infliximab but stopped responding 
or were intolerant to infliximab and in 71 infliximab-naïve subjects (PK Study M02-403). During the 
induction phase, the mean trough concentrations of adalimumab were similar between UC subjects 
(11.7 μg/mL at Week 4) and CD subjects (infliximab intolerant or naïve) (12.6 μg/mL at Week 4) 
following the induction dose of 160 mg/80 mg administered at Week 0/Week 2. 
Maintenance Regimen: The PK of adalimumab were evaluated during Week 4 to Week 52 maintenance 
regimen in subjects with moderately to severely active UC (Study M06-827) and during a 52-week 
maintenance regimen in subjects with moderately to severely active CD (PK Study M02-433). Week 4 
of Study M02-403 was the Baseline visit for Study M02-433. Serum concentrations of adalimumab 
were consistent between subjects with UC (mean ± SD, 7.97 ± 6.09 μg/mL at Week 52, Study M06-
827 PK Report) and subjects with CD (mean ± SD, 7.22 ± 4.58 μg/mL at Week 56, Study M02-433) 
who remained on 40 mg eow SC for the duration of the maintenance studies. In subjects escalated to 
40 mg weekly, trough concentrations appear to be slightly higher in UC than in CD patients. 
Effects of concomitantly-administered immunosuppressants 
The effects of concomitantly-administered immunosuppressants on the PK of adalimumab were also 
evaluated. For subjects with UC in PK Study M06-827, adalimumab clearance was approximately 17% 
lower in subjects on concomitant immunosuppressants including azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine 
(6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX). Following longer-term treatment with adalimumab in the 
maintenance PK Study M02-433, neither AZA nor 6-MP had effects on adalimumab CL/F (p>0.09). The 
numbers of subjects on MTX were too small to make conclusions regarding its effects on adalimumab 
clearance. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity of adalimumab in subjects with UC (Study M06-827) was assessed and compared to 
that observed in subjects with CD (Study M02-403, Study M04-691 and Study M02-433). AAA were 
measured by a double antigen sandwich ELISA method using adalimumab as capture and detector 
antigen. 
Study M06-827 
The overall AAA-positive rate in subjects with UC across the adalimumab and placebo treatment groups 
in study M06-827 was 3.9% (19/487). The AAA-positive rate was 3.7% (8/218) in subjects with 
previous anti-TNF use, and 4.1% (11/269) in the anti-TNF naïve subjects. By comparison, in the CD 
population, the immunogenicity rate was 2.6% (7 of 269 subjects) in subjects who received 
adalimumab treatment up to 56 weeks in Study M02-433. 
For subjects who had measurable HACA at Week 0, 6 were AAA-positive (6/96, 6.5%), whereas, for 
subjects who were HACA-negative, 13 were AAA-positive (13/345, 3.80%). One AAA-positive subject 
(80616) received concomitant methotrexate (1/19, 5.3%) while the remaining 18 AAA-positive 
subjects did not receive concomitant immunosuppressants (18/19, 94.7%). The earliest time point at 
Assessment report

which a subject was identified as AAA-positive was at Week 8. The majority of subjects (10/19, 52.6%) 
became AAA-positive at Week 32. Six (6/19, 31.6%) subjects were AAA-positive at the early 
termination visit. The disposition of AAA-positive subjects is summarized in Table 2. 
Table 2 
AAA positive subject disposition and information 
AAA = anti-adalimumab antibody; HACA = human anti-chimeric antibody; a. Methotrexate, 6-MP, and/or azathioprine.  b. One 
subject was a remitter at Week 8 and Week 52.  c. Three subjects achieved clinical response at Week 8 and Week 52.  d. One 
subject was included as infliximab experienced since there was measurable baseline HACA result even though the subject was anti-
TNF naïve in the clinical data base.  e. One subject was excluded from the AAA analysis due to site non-compliance.  f. One subject 
had no HACA result.  g. One subject received concomitant methotrexate. 
Overall, adalimumab concentrations appeared to decline rapidly in subjects who developed AAA. Three 
(3/19, 15.8%) AAA-positive subjects were in remission at Week 8 and 2 subjects (2/19, 10.5%) at 
Week 52. One subject (1/19, 5.3%) was in remission at both Week 8 and Week 52. AAA did not affect 
the tolerability to adalimumab and there were no indications of any clinically important differences in 
safety between subjects who developed AAA versus those who did not. The number of AAA-positive 
subjects in each treatment group are too small (N≤7) to conclude on the impact of immunogenicity on 
serum adalimumab concentrations and its efficacy. 
Justification for an alternative induction dose regimen 
The treatment for subjects with UC consists of an induction dose regimen of 160/80 mg adalimumab 
administered at Week 0/Week 2. The 160 mg dose requires four injections on a single day, which may 
be inconvenient and could lead to non-compliance in some patients. Therefore simulations were 
performed using the final population pharmacokinetic model to justify the administration of 160 mg 
dose given on 2 consecutive days. According to the MAH, a similar approach was also taken to support 
the initial dose of 160 mg administered over 2 days in CD patients. 
Two induction regimens were simulated: (1) 160 mg on Day 0 and 80 mg on Day 14; and (2) 80 mg 
on Day 0, 80 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Day 14. A total of 2,500 subjects were simulated for each 
regimen; 100% compliance was assumed. The mean, median, 5th, 25th, 75th and 95th percentile 
concentration values at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 from the simulations were compared with those observed in 
Study M06-827. 
The simulated serum adalimumab concentrations for the 4-week induction periods following 160 mg 
adalimumab given over 1 or 2 days was presented, along with the observed adalimumab 
concentrations following 160 mg adalimumab given over 1 day in Study M06-827. The results 
demonstrate that by Week 1 serum adalimumab concentrations are similar whether 160 mg 
adalimumab is given over 1 or 2 days. Therefore, it is considered that splitting the 160 mg induction 
dose to two 80 mg doses administered over 2 days would have minimal impact on efficacy.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of adalimumab has been characterised in previous submissions. Adalimumab PK data 
were collected in the pivotal maintenance study M06-827. In the current application only trough levels 
were analysed in Study M06-827. The results were compared with results from previous studies in 
subjects with CD in which subjects were administered a 4-week 160 mg/80 mg induction regimen 
(Study M02-403) and a 52-week 40 mg maintenance regimen (Study M02-433). PK data from study 
M06-827 were also used for population PK analyses. As only clearance may theoretically vary due to 
the pathology, the aim of the PK study in UC patients was to confirm that, in these patients, the 
clearance is similar to that reported in patients with other pathologies (in particular CD patients). An 
additional aim of the PK study was to achieve data allowing defining a relationship between trough 
levels and efficacy. Therefore, the analysis of only trough levels is considered justified.  
Data from Study M06-827 showed that mean serum adalimumab trough concentration have a good 
relationship to the administered dose. During the induction and maintenance period, the mean trough 
concentrations of adalimumab were similar between UC and CD subjects. Overall, the results were 
comparable to the adalimumab PK reported for CD patients. 
Population PK analyses were performed to estimate the CL/F and apparent volume of distribution of 
central compartment (V2/F) of adalimumab in subjects with UC. Body weight, occurrence of AAA, and 
plasma concentration of albumin were determined as significant covariates on the apparent clearance. 
An increase of body weight by 10 kg is expected to increase CL/F by approximately 13%. The presence 
of AAA would lead to approximately double of CL/F. A similar impact of body weight and AAA on 
adalimumab PK parameters has been observed in subjects with RA, JIA, AS, Ps, and CD. Plasma 
albumin was tested as a covariate for the first time for adalimumab. The findings and the wide 
therapeutic window of adalimumab support the notion that dosing does not need to be adjusted by 
serum albumin concentrations and/or body weight. Therefore, dose adjustments should be made on 
the basis of clinical outcomes, i.e., those patients not achieving satisfactory response or experiencing 
flare should be considered for dose escalation to weekly adalimumab. Overall, based on these results, 
it is considered that no dosage adjustment of adalimumab based on covariates analysis is warranted. 
Immunogenicity of adalimumab in subjects with UC in Study M06-827 was assessed and compared to 
that observed in subjects with CD (Study M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433).The overall AAA-positive 
rate in subjects with UC across the treatment groups was 3.9% (19/487). By comparison, in the CD 
population, the immunogenicity rate was 2.6% (7 of 269 subjects). The immunogenicity rates appear 
to be similar in both UC and CD patients. 
Data from the simulations regarding the alternative induction dose regimen (160 mg on day 1 or 80 
mg on days 1 and 2) have shown that splitting the first induction dose of 160 mg to 2 doses of 80 mg 
administered over 2 days has no significant impact on the PK of adalimumab. 
Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data presented in  this application showed that adalimumab PK parameters in UC patients are 
comparable  with  those  previously  observed  in  CD  patients;  a  population  for  which  adalimumab  is 
approved. Also the data confirmed that trough serum levels increase in a rather proportional manner 
with  the  dose.  Presence  or  absence  of  AAA  is  confirmed  as  the  main  factor  influencing  trough  levels. 
The immunogenicity rates appear to be similar in both UC and CD patients.

Overall based on the data submitted it is agreed that adalimumab induction dose regimen for adult 
patients with moderate to severe UC is 160 mg at Week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections 
in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at Week 2. After induction 
treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg eow. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may 
be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. Some patients who experience decrease in 
their response may benefit from an increase in dosing frequency to 40 mg ew. Additionally, the 
160/80/40 mg and 80/40 mg dosing induction regimens are in accordance with the CD dosage 
recommendations in the current SmPC (80/40 mg or 160/80/40 mg if a rapid response is required). 
1.2.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Main pivotal studies 
Study M06-826 
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
2 dosing regimen of adalimumab for the induction of clinical remission in subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC. 
Methods 
Patients received a double-blind therapy (160/80/40 mg or 80/40 mg or placebo) from baseline until 
week 8 and the open-label adalimumab therapy from week 8 until the end of the study. The second 
treatment arm (80/40 mg) was introduced through a protocol amendment. Figure 2 displays the 
schematic design of the study. Patients that completed both the controlled and the open-label periods 
of the study were invited to participate in an open-label extension study (M10-223) and continue to 
receive adalimumab. 
All patients underwent colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy (for patients that had had a colonoscopy 
during the previous 6 months) during the screening period and a flexible sigmoidoscopy at weeks 8 
and 52 (or at the early termination visit).

Treatments 
The adalimumab 160/80/40 mg and 80/40 mg dosing induction regimens were selected based on a 
combination of expert clinical advice, clinical data from the adalimumab development program in CD, 
PK data accumulated in the adalimumab RA and CD development programs along with PK modelling. 
They were in accordance with the dosage recommendations in the SmPC for induction therapy in CD. 
Prior to protocol Amendment 3, patients received induction therapy of 160/80 mg or placebo. At week 
8, placebo treated patients received 160 mg adalimumab and at week 10 placebo treated patients 
received 80 mg adalimumab while the actively treated patients continued to receive 40 mg eow. At 
week 12 all patients received open label 40 mg adalimumab eow. From week 14, dose escalation was 
allowed for patients with inadequate response to treatment (40 mg ew).   
Amendment 3 introduced an additional treatment arm on which patients received induction therapy of 
80/40 mg. After the week 8 assessment, all patients received open label 40 mg adalimumab every 
other week until week 52. From week 12, dose escalation was allowed for patients with inadequate 
response to treatment (40 mg ew). 
Patients taking aminosalicylates, azathioprine, or 6-MP who qualified for enrolment into the study were 
to continue their medication dose. Patients were not permitted to change the dosage of UC-specific 
concomitant medications throughout the study with the following 2 exceptions: decrease in 
corticosteroid dose between Weeks 8 and 52, and a dose decrease of other UC-related concomitant 
treatments in the event of UC treatment-related toxicities. 
Objectives 
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab dosing regimen 
(160/80/40 and 80/40) versus placebo for the induction of clinical remission in patients with 
moderately to severely active UC. Supportive information concerning the maintenance of remission 
was collected during the OL phase of the study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  Proportion of patients in clinical remission per Mayo score at week 8 
Main secondary endpoints: 
-  proportion of patients with clinical response per Mayo score at week 8  
-  proportion of patients with mucosal healing at week 8  
-  proportion of patients with rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) indicative of mild disease (≤1) at week 8  
-  proportion of patients with Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore indicative of mild disease 
(≤1) at week 8  
-  proportion of patients with stool frequency subscore indicative of mild disease (≤1) at week 8  
-  proportion of Inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) responders at week 8  
The following definitions were used to describe the primary and secondary endpoints:

Sample size 
The sample size was calculated using nQuery Advisory 4.0. Assuming 15% of patients in the placebo 
group achieved clinical remission at Week 8, a sample size of 125 in each treatment group in the ITT 
population would be adequate to detect a 15% difference using a chi-square test with 80% power at a 
0.05 two-sided significance level. A total of 375 subjects were to be randomized following Amendment 
3 of the study. 
Randomisation 
All subjects were assigned a unique identification number as they were screened for the study. The 
number assigned at screening was used during the screening period only. A new unique identification 
number was assigned to each subject upon randomization and used throughout the study. All subjects 
were centrally randomized at baseline (Week 0) and assigned to a treatment group according to the 
randomization scheme generated by the MAH before the start of the study. 
Blinding 
Throughout the duration of the study, the investigator, site study personnel and patients remained 
blinded to patient's treatment allocation. The MAH remained blinded until the database of the 8-week 
DB study phase was locked and the interim analysis was conducted. 
Statistical methods 
The analyses were carried out in the following hierarchical order to handle the multiplicity issues 
induced by the 2 comparisons to placebo. 
1. Compare the remission rates of adalimumab 160/80/40 mg group and placebo at Week 8. 
2. Compare the remission rates of adalimumab 80/40 mg group and placebo at Week 8. 
For both comparisons the superiority over placebo was to be established by the Chi-square test (two-
sided) at an alpha level of 0.05. A p value ≤0.05 from comparison 1 was necessary to initiate 
comparison 2 at a significance level of 0.05. Since a hierarchical procedure was used, each comparison 
was to be tested at a significance level of 0.05 and overall alpha level of 0.05 could be preserved. 
The secondary efficacy analysis was to be performed in the ITT-A3 population. Statistically significant 
results (p value ≤0.05) had to be achieved for a comparison in the higher rank in order to initiate the 
next comparison in the lower rank. The difference in proportion of subjects achieving response 
between adalimumab group and placebo group was to be assessed using the chi-square test, or 
Fisher's exact test as appropriate.

Other ranked dichotomous variables that included proportion of subjects with mucosal healing, 
proportion of subjects having mild disease indicated by components of the Mayo score (RBS, PGA and 
stool frequency subscore), and proportion of IBDQ responders, were to be analyzed using the same 
method used to analyze clinical response. Non-ranked dichotomous efficacy variables were analyzed 
using the same methods listed above. Change from baseline in the IBDQ scores; SF-36 scores; Mayo 
score and partial Mayo score were to be summarized using descriptive statistics. The treatment 
difference in mean change was to be analyzed using the ANOVA model including factors of treatment 
and baseline scores, or non-parametric test, as appropriate. Both the data as-observed and the LOCF 
method could be used as appropriate. The median time to achieve response per partial Mayo score 
from baseline was to be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Descriptive statistics were to be presented for the variables analyzed from the open-label period of the 
study. The response rate based on Mayo score and the colectomy rate during the study was to be 
tabulated and could be tested using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

Numbers analysed 
The data sets seen in Table 3 were analysed. 
Table 3 
Number of subjects by analysis set 
The Intent-To-Treat A3 (ITT-A3) analysis set included all subjects with confirmed UC at Baseline who 
were randomized under Protocol Amendments 3 or 4 and received at least 1 injection of study drug 
(adalimumab 160/80/40 mg, adalimumab 80/40 mg, or placebo). The ITT-A3 analysis set was used for 
the primary analyses of the induction endpoints of the DB period through Week 8 of the study. 
According to the MAH, it allowed for a comparison of a homogeneous population. A second analysis 
set, the Intent-to-Treat Extended (ITT-E) analysis set, was used for the analyses of maintenance 
during the open-label period through Week 52 of the study. This analysis set included all subjects with 
confirmed UC at Baseline who were randomized under any version of the protocol and received at least 
1 injection of study drug (adalimumab 160/80/40 mg, adalimumab 80/40 mg, or placebo). The 
differences between ITT-A3 and ITT-E populations are shown in Table 4.

Reasons for discontinuation recorded as "other" included: diagnosis of CD and investigator decision. 
A total of 575 subjects enrolled in the study and were included in the efficacy analysis (ITT-E set), of 
whom 54 (9.4%) discontinued prior to week 8. The most frequently reported reasons for 
discontinuation during the DB period through Week 8 in the ITT-E set were AEs, lack of efficacy, and 
withdrawn consent. More subjects in the adalimumab 80/40 treatment group withdrew consent than in 
the adalimumab 160/80/40 or placebo treatment groups. There was no death during the DB period 
through Week 8 of the study. The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation during the 
whole study in the ITT-E set were lack of efficacy, AEs, and withdrawn consent; all other reasons for 
discontinuation were each reported by <2% of subjects in the ITT-E set overall. The global

discontinuation rate from the study rate was approximately 34% (31.1% placebo and 33.8% and 
35.9% in the active treatment group). 
Conduct of the study 
During the study there were 4 protocol amendments. Amendment 1, 2 and 4 had no major impact on 
the assessment of the study results. Amendment 3 contained a major revision to the protocol: 
inclusion of the 80/40 mg adalimumab induction dosing, revision of the objective to include two 
induction-dosing regimens, change of the blinded period from 12 weeks to 8 weeks. The statistical 
methods were also changed.

6-MP = 6-mercaptopurine. a. WHODRUG dictionary Q1 2009. 
Overall subjects were predominantly white and male with moderate to severe UC (Mayo score ≥6 and 
an endoscopy subscore ≥2). Subjects in the ITT-A3 and ITT-E Sets had a mean duration of UC of 8.06 
and 8.25 years, respectively, with disease comprising primarily pancolitis (52.1% and 55.0%, 
respectively). All but 1 subject in the ITT-A3 Set had confirmed UC using biopsy results, and 1 subject 
in the ITT-E Set had evidence of dysplasia and was discontinued after the Baseline visit due to this 
finding. In the ITT-A3 Set, the DB treatment groups had comparable UC histories, although placebo 
subjects had a slightly lesser mean duration of disease, with a notable difference between the 
frequency of subjects reporting pancolitis versus UC of the descending colon. By comparison, subjects 
in the adalimumab treatment groups had smaller differences between pancolitis and descending colon. 
A statistically significant difference (P = 0.009) was observed across treatment groups in baseline PGA 
subscore in the ITT-E Set. A greater proportion of subjects randomized to adalimumab had mild 
disease or severe disease compared with subjects randomized to placebo (7.9% versus 3.6% and 
34.6% versus 26.1%, respectively), whereas a greater proportion of subjects randomized to placebo 
had moderate disease compared with subjects randomized to adalimumab (70.3% versus 57.2%, 
respectively). 
Subjects mostly received previous corticosteroids or azathioprine prior to study entry. No significant 
differences in demographics, medical history, mean baseline disease activity scores, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), tuberculosis (TB) skin test for positivity at baseline, chest x-ray (CXR), and prior/concomitant 
medications observed between the placebo, adalimumab 80/40, and adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment 
groups was observed.

adalimumab 160/80/40 versus placebo is from CMH test with subjects in/not in the ITT-A3 set as the stratification 
factor; and the P value to compare adalimumab 80/40 versus placebo is from chi-square test (or Fisher's  
exact test if ≥ 20% of cells had expected cell count < 5). b. Per the LOCF analysis, the last non-missing post- 
Baseline values were carried forward. 
A statistically significantly higher percentage of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment 
group compared with placebo achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per Mayo score at 
Week 8 (18.5% versus 9.2%; P=0.031). No statistically significant difference was observed for this 
endpoint between the adalimumab 80/40 treatment group and the placebo group (10.0% versus 9.2%; 
P = 0.833). 
Similar results were seen in the PP analysis set and in the intent-to-treat A3 (ITT-A3) set when last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used instead of the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
method. In 4 subgroups, the difference in clinical remission at Week 8 between either of the 
adalimumab treatment groups and placebo was >10%, with the lower bound of the 95% CI for the 
difference greater than zero: subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group with CRP 
<10mg/L, nicotine users, use of azathioprine or 6-MP at Baseline, or no aminosalicylate use at Baseline; 
and subjects in the adalimumab 80/40 treatment group with no aminosalicylate use at Baseline. In all 
other subgroups including corticosteroid use at Baseline, the majority of the differences in clinical 
remission at Week 8 between adalimumab and placebo were ≤10%, and the 95% CIs for the 
difference included zero. 
Secondary endpoints 
Twelve ranked secondary variables were to be tested in a hierarchical order to account for multiple 
testing. The first ranked secondary endpoint “clinical response per Mayo score at Week 8” in the 
adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group versus placebo did not meet the criteria for statistical 
significance (44.6% for placebo compared with 54.6% for adalimumab 160/80/40 mg; P = 0.107).

In both adalimumab treatment groups, the proportion of subjects with clinical remission per Mayo 
score increased from Week 8 to Week 52. In the placebo treatment group, the proportion of subjects 
with clinical remission per Mayo score increased after subjects switched from placebo to adalimumab at 
Week 8. This improvement was similar between subjects who switched from placebo to adalimumab 40

mg eow directly and those who switched to the adalimumab 160/80/40 induction regimen. A 
numerically higher percentage of subjects who switched to adalimumab 40 mg eow directly were in 
remission at both Week 8 and Week 52 compared with those who switched to adalimumab 160/80/40; 
however, a higher proportion of placebo patients who directly went to 40 mg eow had already been in 
remission at Week 8 compared to placebo patients who went on to adalimumab 160/80/40 therapy. 
Fewer subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group required dose escalation (from 40 mg 
eow to 40 mg weekly) as compared to the adalimumab 80/40 or placebo groups (22.9% versus 30.0% 
and 31.1%, respectively). Within the placebo group, a lower proportion of subjects who received 
adalimumab 160/80/40 at the start of the OL period dose escalated as compared to those who 
switched directly to adalimumab 40 mg eow (21.7% versus 37.7%, respectively). When analyzed 
using the NRI method, the clinical remission rate per Mayo score at Week 52 among all subjects 
combined was 24.2% (139/575 subjects). When analyzed using the modified NRI method under which 
dose escalators were not considered non-responders, the clinical remission rate per Mayo score at 
Week 52 was 27.5% (158/575 subjects). 
Study M06-827 
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
adalimumab verus placebo for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC 
Methods 
Patients received double-blind treatment (active/placebo) for up to 52 weeks. Patients underwent 
colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy during the screening period and a flexible sigmoidoscopy at 
Weeks 8, 32, and 52/Early Termination Visits to assess disease activity.  From week 10 and onwards, 
patients that met the criteria for inadequate response could receive open-label treatment with 
adalimumab 40 mg eow. Patients with an inadequate response at 2 consecutive visits 14 days apart 
could receive dose escalation to 40 mg ew. Figure 3 displays the schematic design of the study. 
Inadequate response was defined as: 
- 
- 
partial Mayo score ≥ their baseline score on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for 
subjects with a partial Mayo score of 4 to 7 at baseline). 
partial Mayo score ≥7 on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for subjects with a partial 
Mayo score of 8 or 9 at baseline). 
Upon completion of the study, patients were invited to enrol into Study M10-223 and continue to 
receive adalimumab treatment.

Subjects were not permitted to change their corticosteroid dose during the first 8 weeks of the study. 
At or after Week 8, subjects who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline were permitted to taper 
their corticosteroid dose at the discretion of the investigator. Steroid-free remission was evaluated at 
Week 32 and Week 52 but could not be assessed at Week 8 since subjects taking concomitant 
corticosteroids at baseline could not change the dose until after Week 8. 
Study participants 
Adult patients with moderate to severe UC were enrolled at 103 centres worldwide. 
Inclusion criteria 
The same inclusion criteria as in Study M06-826 were used apart from the following: 
Previous use of anti-TNF agents other than adalimumab was permitted if the patient had discontinued 
its use due to a loss of response or intolerance to the agent, defined as follows: 
Loss of response was defined as meeting either of the following criteria after the last dose (a 
subject with prior infliximab exposure must have responded to a dose of ≥5 mg/kg and 
demonstrated loss of response ≥14 days after receiving at least 2 subsequent and sequential 
doses of ≥5 mg/kg at an interval not exceeding 56 days): 
• 
• 
experienced an overall lack of improvement 
experienced a worsening of the following, but not inclusive, UC-related signs/symptoms: 
stool frequency, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fever, and/or weight loss. 
Intolerance to anti-TNF agent was considered when therapy was discontinued as a result of a 
significant acute or delayed reaction to the medication. A reaction was considered significant if at 
least 1 of the clinical characteristics listed below was captured in the medical history and 
documented: 
•  Acute reaction: An adverse reaction, whether immunologically or non-immunologically 
based, which occurs during or within 24 hours of administration of an anti-TNF agent that 
is manifested by ≥1 of the sign/symptoms and is judged to be related to the medication: 
fever >100°F, chills or rigors, itching, rash, flushing, urticaria or angioedema, breathing 
difficulties (dyspnea, chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor), 
and/or clinical hypotension (pallor, diaphoresis, faintness, syncope), or orthostatic 
decrease in blood pressure. 
•  Delayed reaction: An adverse reaction occurring more than 24 hours and <14 days after 
anti-TNF agent administration manifested by ≥1 of the following signs/symptoms and 
judged to be related to the medication: myalgias, arthralgias, fever >100°F, malaise, 
and/or rash. 
Exclusion criteria 
The same exclusion criteria as in Study M06-826 were used apart from the following: 
- 
- 
- 
previous treatment with adalimumab or previous participation in an adalimumab study 
used infliximab or any other anti-TNF agent during the previous 56 days 
previously  used  infliximab  or  any  other  anti-TNF  agent  without  clinical  response  at  any  time 
(‘primary non-responder’) unless patient experienced a treatment-limiting reaction  
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012

Treatments 
Patients randomized to active treatment received 160 mg adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 
and 40 mg thereafter eow with start from week 4. Patients with an inadequate response at 2 
consecutive visits, 14 days apart, were permitted to dose escalation (40 mg ew). Patients randomized 
to the placebo arm received matching treatment during the same period. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the 
induction and maintenance of clinical remission in patients with moderately to severely active UC. 
The secondary objective was to assess the PK of adalimumab following subcutaneous administration. 
Outcomes/endpoints

The following ranked efficacy endpoints were used: 
-  proportion of patients in remission at week 8 
-  proportion of patients in remission at week 52

-  proportion of patients in clinical response by Mayo score (at weeks 8 and 52, sustained at both 
weeks 8 and 52) 
-  proportion of patients with mucosal healing (at weeks 8 and 52, sustained at both weeks 8 and 52) 
-  proportion of patients who discontinued corticosteroid use before and were in remission at week 52  
-  proportion of patients with PGA subscore indicative of mild disease (≤ 1) at Week 8  
-  proportion of patients who were IBDQ responders at weeks 8 and 52 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated using nQuery Advisory 4.0. Assuming that 5% of the patients in the 
placebo group achieved clinical remission at Week 52 or Week 8, a sample size of 250 in each 
treatment group was adequate to detect a difference of at least 7 percentage points from the 
adalimumab group using Chi-square test with 80% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level. A total 
of 500 subjects were to be randomized in this study. 
Randomisation 
All subjects were assigned a unique identification number as they were screened for the study. The 
number assigned at screening was used during the screening period only. A new unique identification 
number was assigned to each subject upon randomization and used throughout the study. All subjects 
were centrally randomized at baseline (Week 0) and assigned to a treatment group after stratifying by 
prior exposure to infliximab and/or other anti-TNF agents according to the randomization scheme 
generated by the MAH before the start of the study.

The MAH, the investigator, site study personnel, and patient were to remain blinded to each patient’s 
treatment throughout the course of the study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set and consisted of two ranked 
efficacy endpoints: (1) proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 8 and (2) proportion 
of subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 52. Hypothesis testing for the ranked endpoints was 
carried out in a hierarchical order using a two-sided Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for 
prior exposure to infliximab or other anti-TNF agents. The remission rate at Week 8 was tested first. If 
the null hypothesis of no difference between adalimumab and placebo was rejected at α=0.05, then 
the remission rate at Week 52 was to be tested at a significance level of 0.05. 
However, in order to claim maintenance of remission, it was necessary to reject not only both 
hypotheses on the two ranked co-primary endpoints but also to reject the hypothesis on the first 
ranked secondary endpoint: proportion of subjects in remission at both Week 8 and 52. This first 
ranked secondary endpoint was incorporated in the confirmatory testing procedure conducted in 
hierarchical order from the first to the second ranked co-primary efficacy endpoint, and then to the 
ranked secondary endpoints, and stopped whenever a hypothesis could not be rejected at a 
significance level of 0.05. If a ranked endpoint did not meet the criteria for statistical significance, the 
analyses of the rest of the ranked secondary endpoints would be considered exploratory. This ensured 
that the multiple significance level was controlled at 0.05. 
The following non-responder imputation method was used in the analysis. Using the analysis of clinical 
remission at Week 52 as an example, subjects who discontinued the study for any reason prior to 
Week 52, and subjects with a missing Mayo Score at Week 52 were counted as "no" to remission. 
Subjects who switched to open-label drug were counted as "no" to remission from the time of 
switching onward.  
The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for sensitivity analyses. For subjects 
who switched to OL drug, the non-missing value at the visit when the subject switched to the OL drug 
was to be carried forward in the LOCF analysis. 
The secondary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set. The testing of ranked 
secondary endpoints was initiated only in case of statistically significant differences between the 
treatment groups for both ranked co-primary endpoints.

The modified analysis set consisted of patients from the ITT set that had received at least one dose of 
the study drug or placebo. Exploratory analyses were performed on this population.

a. Primary reason. b. Reasons for discontinuation recorded as "other" included: diagnosis of CD, loss of 
response, primary nonresponder, UC symptoms not improving, investigator decision, subject non- 
compliance, positive TB skin test, subject wanted to start family, or total colectomy surgery within the 
70-day follow-up period. 
A total of 518 subjects were randomized into the study. A total of 11.9% of subjects in the ITT analysis 
set discontinued prior to Week 8, most frequently due to lack of efficacy, which occurred at a higher 
incidence rate in the placebo group compared to the adalimumab group. By the end of the study 
(Week 52), a total of 42.3% of subjects discontinued prematurely. The most frequently reported 
reasons for premature discontinuation were lack of efficacy, AE, and other, all of which were 
experienced in a numerically greater proportion of subjects randomized to the placebo group. All other 
reasons for discontinuation were each reported by <3.5% of subjects. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol underwent 3 amendments. In Amendment 1 a clarification that current therapy 
with either a corticosteroid or an immunosuppressant would satisfy this inclusion criteria and 
expansion of prohibited therapies to include natalizumab and abatacept. In Amendment 2 the primary 
and secondary efficacy variables were revised in accordance with EMA guidelines. Strict ordering of 
ranked co-primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were implemented. Amendment No 3 introduced 
the final statistical plan and was added before the blind was broken.

A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group were in clinical 
remission per Mayo score at Week 8 and Week 52 compared to subjects in the placebo group in all 
analysis sets (16.5% vs 9.3% and 17.3% vs 8.5% respectively). In the adalimumab arm, 41 patients 
out of 248 patients and 43 patients out of 248 patients were in clinical remission per Mayo score at 
Week 8 and Week 52 i.e. approximately 16.9% patients achieved a remission.  
Secondary endpoints 
Of the 15 ranked secondary variables, the first 8 met criteria for statistical significance as compared 
with placebo.

IBDQ = Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; PGA = physician's global assessment subscore; RBS = 
Rectal bleeding subscore; SFS = stool frequency subscore. a. Listed in ranked order, as indicated by the  
number preceding each endpoint variable. 
The eight secondary variables which met the criteria for statistical significance were: sustained clinical 
remission per Mayo score at both Week 8 and Week 52, clinical response per Mayo score at Week 8 
and at Week 52, sustained clinical response per Mayo score at Week 8 and at Week 52, mucosal 
healing (defined as endoscopy subscore ≤1) at Week 8 and at Week 52, sustained mucosal healing at 
both Week 8 and Week 52, and corticosteroid-free clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 52. 
Concerning the first ranked secondary endpoint, of the 41 patients who achieved remission at week 8, 
21 patients in the adalimumab group (8.5% of the whole population treated with adalimumab) 
maintained a sustained remission up to week 52. 
Ranked endpoint No. 9 (PGA≤1 at Week 8 in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group versus 
placebo) missed statistical significance (P=0.058), although it exhibited a numerical benefit of the 
adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group versus placebo (37.4% placebo compared with 46.0% 
adalimumab). The adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group had a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of subjects meeting the rest of the ranked endpoints (P value ranged from 0.002 to 0.035) 
compared with placebo.

Among subjects who were naive to anti-TNF agents at study entry, the proportion of those achieving 
the ranked co-primary and most ranked secondary endpoints was statistically significantly greater in 
the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group. Among subjects who had previously used anti-
TNF agents, a statistically significantly greater proportion of adalimumab-treated subjects compared to 
placebo-treated subjects achieved clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 52, clinical response per 
Mayo score at Week 52, and sustained clinical response per Mayo score at both Week 8 and Week 52).

After Week 12 of the study, 135/246 (54.9%) subjects in the placebo and 116/248 (46.8%) subjects 
in the adalimumab treatment group had inadequate clinical response and switched to the OL 
adalimumab administration. Of these 251 subjects who switched, 84 (34.1%) and 68 (27.4%) in the 
placebo and adalimumab group, respectively, dose escalated from 40 mg eow to 40 mg ew. Of the 
subjects who dose escalated to OL adalimumab ew, a greater proportion of subjects previously 
randomized to the placebo group than to the adalimumab group achieved clinical remission (34.1% 
versus 12.2%, respectively) and clinical response per Mayo score (61.4% versus 46.3%, respectively) 
at Week 52. A total of 158 patients dose escalated from adalimumab eow to ew.

In addition, an analysis of the percentage of patients who acquired remission as per Mayo score and 
maintained it up to week 52 was performed by stratifying data according to the anatomical extent of 
the disease: pancolitis, descending colon and other. 
Among subjects with pancolitis, despite the small subgroup, >10% more subjects treated with 
adalimumab achieved clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 8 compared with placebo. Nearly 10% 
more subjects treated with adalimumab achieved clinical remission at Week 52 compared with placebo.

Supportive study 
Study M10-223 (open label extension study) 
A multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of repeated 
administration of adalimumab as maintenance therapy in subjects with UC who completed studies 
M06-826 and M06-827. 
Methods 
Patients were administered 40 mg eow or ew by SC injection. Data presented have been collected 
through 31 December 2009 a cut-off date. 
The day 1/baseline visit for patients entering M10-223 is Week 52 of Studies M06-826 or M06-827. 
Patients can participate for up to 240 weeks in the study. 
Patients who entered this study from a blinded cohort were assigned to open-label adalimumab, 40 mg 
eow. Patients, who were inadequate responders upon entering the study and who do not show 
response during the study, or who show a response and then have a disease flare, may have their 
adalimumab dose increased to 40 mg ew, but no earlier than the Week 12 visit. Patients that continue 
to show inadequate response, or continue to have a flare while on 40 mg every week, may be 
discontinued from the study. 
Beginning at Week 12 of participation in Study M10-223, UC-related concomitant medications, 
including immunosuppressants, may be decreased in dose or discontinued in those patients who show 
clinical response. Patients in whom corticosteroid tapering was started in the previous studies may 
continue their corticosteroid taper immediately upon enrolment into the extension study. If the 
patients experience loss of response the corticosteroid dose may be increased. 
Study Participants 
Subjects were eligible for enrolment if they successfully completed either Study M06-826 or M06-827. 
Patients who had not responded to dosing ew in the preceding study were not eligible for inclusion. 
Treatment 
All subjects are receiving adalimumab 40 mg eow or adalimumab 40 mg ew, administered as a single 
SC injection. For inadequate responder, the dose may be escalated to 40 mg ew starting at Week 12 
(or at Week 2 for subjects who enter this study from an OL cohort and are inadequate responders). 
Objective 
The aim of this ongoing study is to demonstrate the long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of 
repeated administration of adalimumab in subjects with UC who completed one of 2 double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies (Study M06-826 or M06-827).

baseline disease activity was lower than the moderate to severe disease activity (mayo score of 6 to 12) 
that was required for inclusion into studies M06-826 and M06-827.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Results of the partial Mayo score is shown in the table below.

Notes: At Weeks 2 through 60, only subjects with both Baseline and Visit Values are shown.  The observation period 
stopped on 31 December 2009. No data were carried forward beyond this point. Data after Week 60 are not shown, 
because less than 10% of subjects had reached a visit later than Week 60 as of the cut-off date. 
Mean partial Mayo score at baseline (mean score of 2.5) was improved compared with baseline of the 
lead-in Studies M06-826 and M06-827 (mean scores of 6.4 and 6.5, respectively). This improved mean 
partial Mayo score was generally maintained from baseline to Week 60 with only slight fluctuations 
over time, while median partial Mayo scores remained stable through Week 60. Mean and median 
Mayo scores were low at Baseline of Study M06-223 compared to the moderate to severe disease 
activity (Mayo score of 6 to 12) required for entry into Study M06-826 and Study M06-827, and these 
scores were maintained from Baseline to Week 48. 
A total of 42/498 subjects (8.4%) required dose escalation from 40 mg eow to 40 mg ew. Partial Mayo 
scores decreased by >40% among subjects in the ITT-1 analysis set who switched from eow dosing to 
ew dosing. Five patients underwent colectomies (ITT-1). Endoscopy subscores were maintained 
through week 48 (mean score 1.0). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
Subjects undergoing colectomies 
An analysis has been conducted to evaluate subject outcomes with respect to colectomy. All 
colectomies were performed during the follow-up period after the last dose of the study drug. None of 
the patients in studies M06-826 and M06-827 that underwent colectomies were enrolled in study M10-
223. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance due to the low event rates, the 
incidence rate of colectomies was numerically lower, at a risk reduction of 22%, in the adalimumab 
treatment group compared with placebo.

Efficacy analyses for escalation to weekly dosing of adalimumab 
Dose escalation from adalimumab 40 mg eow to adalimumab 40 ew was permitted in these studies if a 
subject experienced disease flare. A total of 354/978 (38.2%) subjects in the all adalimumab analysis 
Set required dose escalation to adalimumab 40 mg weekly over the course of Studies M06-826, M06-
827, or M10-223. 
The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission or clinical response per Mayo score or clinical 
remission or response per partial Mayo score after dose escalation increased continuously through 52 
weeks of exposure to adalimumab 40 mg and was maintained thereafter. Based on the LOCF analysis, 
15.7% of subjects were in clinical remission per Mayo score and 34.2% of subjects had achieved 
clinical response per Mayo score after 52 weeks of weekly adalimumab treatment, rates that were 
maintained over time through 100 weeks of weekly dosing (16.0% and 33.1%, respectively). Similar 
findings were observed for the rates of clinical remission and clinical response per partial Mayo score 
following dose escalation. Among subjects who required dose escalation to adalimumab 40 mg weekly, 
a mean decrease in Mayo score from Baseline was observed 12 weeks after dose escalation  
(–0.7 ± 3.38), which improved through 52 weeks of ew dosing (–1.8 ± 3.58) and was maintained over 
time through 100 weeks of weekly therapy (–1.8 ± 3.60) . 
These results according to the MAH support increasing the adalimumab dosing from 40 mg eow to 40 
mg ew in those subjects who do not achieve or lose sufficient response on the adalimumab 40 mg eow 
regimen. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program for adalimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC 
(defined as a Mayo of 6 to 12 points with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points) included a pivotal 
induction study (M06-826), a pivotal maintenance study (M06-827), and a supportive long-term OL 
extension study (M10-223). Both pivotal studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies. Study M10-223 was ongoing at the time of submission of this application. A data cut-off of 31 
December 2009 was used for this submission. Data from these studies form the basis for all efficacy 
data to support the claimed indication. This program is in line with the guideline on the development of 
new medicinal products for the treatment of ulcerative colitis which recommends studying induction of 
remission and prevention of relapse in separate randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and/or 
active comparator phase III trials (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006). 
Study M06-826  
Study M06-826 compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 160/80/40 (160 mg at Week 0, 
80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg eow thereafter) and adalimumab 80/40 (80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg 
eow thereafter) to placebo and consisted of an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled period followed 
by an OL period through 52 weeks. The placebo controlled study design is appropriate and according to 
the guideline. The inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the primary (remission at week 8) and 
secondary endpoints are also considered adequate and in line with the guideline.  
A statistically significantly higher percentage of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 mg treatment 
group compared with placebo achieved clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 8 (18.5% versus 
9.2%; P=0.031). Although there was a statistically significant difference between the effect of 
adalimumab (160/80/40 dose) and placebo treatment on the primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of 
patients in clinical remission at week 8), the overall difference was <10 % irrespective of analysis set 
(9.2% placebo vs 18.5% adalimumab 160/80/40 mg, p=0.031). The results of study M06-826 for 
Assessment report

induction of clinical remission therefore showed a limited treatment effect of adalimumab. The effect of 
the lower induction dose 80/40 mg was similar to that of placebo (9.2% placebo vs 10.0% adalimumab 
80/40 mg). The difference was not statistically significant. 
Results of the secondary efficacy endpoints also showed modest treatment effect. For instance, clinical 
response at week 8 did not meet the criteria for statistical significance (44.6% for placebo compared 
with 54.6% for adalimumab 160/80/40 mg) in the ITT-A3 population. In the adalimumab 160/80/40 
treatment group a statistically significant greater proportion of subjects met the endpoints at Week 8 
only for RBS ≤ 1 (P = 0.038) and PGA subscore ≤ 1 (P = 0.035) but all other secondary endpoints did 
not meet statistical significance. Since the first ranked secondary endpoint failed to reach statistical 
significance the p-values of all the following ranked secondary endpoints should be considered only as 
descriptive. Secondary endpoints data for the ITT-E population showed similar results i.e. limited but 
consistent effect of the treatment on secondary endpoints. Overall a consistency across the results was 
observed through the secondary endpoints although statistical significance was not achieved for all of 
them.  
Concerning the open-label maintenance period, of patients randomized to the 160/80/40 mg, 
80/40 mg and placebo group there were 23, 30 and 31% respectively, that required dose escalation. 
At week 52, approximately one fourth (n=139, 24%, ITT-E, NRI) of the actively-treated patients were 
in remission as per Mayo score. Additional endpoints, including quality-of-life questionnaires, provided 
supportive evidence for the superiority of the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group compared with 
placebo at Week 8 (mean change from Baseline in IBDQ score 35.9 versus 26.6; mean change from 
baseline in SF-36 physical component score 6.53 versus 3.78; mean change from baseline in SF-36 
mental component score 7.62 versus 5.79). Although the clinical relevance of these observations 
should be taken with caution due to the open-label design of this part of the study they provide 
supportive evidence of efficacy of the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group. 
Study M06-827 
Study M06-827 compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 160/80/40 (160 mg at Week 0, 
80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg eow thereafter) to placebo and consisted of a 52-week double-blind 
placebo-controlled period.  
The two ranked co-primary endpoints of the study M06-827 were remission per Mayo score at week 8 
and 52. The CHMP noted that the primary efficacy parameter should have been the proportion of 
patients maintaining remission throughout the period as per the guideline in force. The MAH clarified 
that the guideline was not in effect at the time of study initiation. As specified in the statistical plan, 
the success of study M06-827 was dependent on the achievement of both ranked co-primary endpoints 
as well as the first ranked secondary endpoint. The first ranked secondary endpoint of sustained 
clinical remission at both Week 8 and 52 should therefore be viewed in conjunction with the 2 co-
primary endpoints which demonstrates both that remission is present at Week 52 and that it is 
maintained from Week 8 through Week 52. This was accepted by the CHMP.  
The efficacy result of study M06-827 showed a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients 
in the adalimumab group in clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 8 and Week 52 compared to the 
placebo group (16.5% vs 9.3% and 17.3% vs 8.5% respectively). At week 8, 41 patients out of 248 
were in remission. At week 52, 43 patients (17.3%) were in remission as compared to 139 patients 
(24%) after open-label treatment in study M06-826. Overall approximately 17% of adalimumab 
treated patients achieved remission at week 8 and at week 52. Of the 41 patients who achieved 
remission at week 8, 21 patients in the adalimumab group (8.5 %) maintained a sustained remission 
(first ranked secondary endpoint) up to week 52 compared with 4.1% for the placebo group, the

difference with placebo accounting for less than 5%. Therefore approximately half of the patients that 
achieved remission at week 8 maintain this remission at week 52. A gain of less than 10% (7.2% and 
8.8%) over placebo was achieved in the remission per Mayo score at Week 8 and 52 respectively in 
patients treated with adalimumab. Importantly, when patients achieving sustained remission per Mayo 
score both at Week 8 and Week 52 are considered, the gain of adalimumab over placebo was 4.4 % 
(p=0.047). Overall, the percentage of patients that achieved and maintained clinical remission is 
modest.  
The primary efficacy endpoints were supported by the results of the first 8 ranked secondary 
endpoints. Statistically significant differences between active and placebo treatment were 
demonstrated although the difference in actual numbers of patients between the groups was limited. 
The percentage of patients in clinical response week 8 was 34.6% for placebo and 50.4% for 
adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (16% observed difference), and week 52 was 18.3% for placebo and 
30.2% for adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (11.9% observed difference). Since the 9th ranked secondary 
endpoint failed to reach statistical significance, the other following secondary p-values should be 
considered only as descriptive. Nevertheless they provided consistent supportive evidence of efficacy of 
the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group. 
Results in study M06-827 were stratified by presence or absence of previous treatment with other anti-
TNF agents. For anti-TNF naïve patients, the remission results were statistically significant at week 8 
and 52, with observed difference of 10.3% and 9.6% respectively. For anti-TNF experienced subjects, 
the difference is limited and statistically non-significant i.e. 2.3% and 7.2 % more subjects reached 
remission at weeks 8 and 52 respectively. For sustained remission, results were non-significant in 
these subgroups (observed difference 4.5% for naïve and 4% for experienced). Based on these data it 
is uncertain whether prior treatment with anti-TNF agent could decrease the efficacy of subsequent 
adalimumab treatment. 
According to the guideline CHMP/EWP/18463/2006, the study population should be defined "in terms 
of severity and anatomical extent of the disease." The anatomical extent of the disease was defined in 
this application by three categories: pancolitis, descending colon, and “other”. The MAH clarified that of 
120 patients with a UC localization of "other" in both studies, only 5 subjects did not have sufficient 
information to confirm presence of the requested UC localization while 115 subjects (95.8%) definitely 
met inclusion criteria and could have been classified among "descending colon" or "pancolitis. 
An analysis of the percentage of patients who acquired remission as per Mayo score and maintained it 
up to week 52 was performed by stratifying data according to the anatomical extent of the disease: 
pancolitis, descending colon and other. The data presented support that adalimumab effect in patients 
with pancolitis is comparable to the global population studied in M06-827 (observed differences for 
remission weeks 8 and 52, 10-12%). The MAH also showed that there is no correlation between 
disease severity and anatomical extent of the disease. Data showed that clinical remission at week 52 
was achieved by 14.2% of patients with pancolitis and by 20.3% of patients with no pancolitis. The 
same pattern, of a higher remission rate in patients with no pancolitis, was seen in the placebo 
subgroups (5 % and 11.9%, for those with pancolitis and no pancolitis, respectively). The observed 
difference between active and placebo in these two subgroups was closely similar (9.2 % and 8.4 %, 
respectively). These results may suggest that, in the remission setting, patients with a partial 
anatomical extent of the disease may benefit more from the treatment than those with pancolitis.  
Because maintenance of clinical remission without corticosteroids is desired with UC, subjects who 
were responders at or after Week 8 were to be permitted to taper corticosteroids. Steroid-free 
remission was evaluated at Week 32 and Week 52. At week 32 a positive trend in the corticosteroids 
discontinuation for adalimumab versus placebo-treated patients was observed, regardless of whether 
they were steroid-free for more than or less than 90 days. However, statistical significance was not

Page 39/65 
 
 
 
 
achieved. In patients achieving clinical remission at Week 52, the difference between adalimumab and 
placebo patients discontinuing corticosteroids was statistically significant (p=0.035). 
In response to questions from the CHMP regarding the patient population included in the pivotal 
studies, the MAH presented data showing that reasons for discontinuing prior UC therapy was 
inadequate response or intolerance/medical complication rather than suboptimal treatment. Concerns 
on the accuracy of the diagnosis, as suggested by uncertainties on the number of biopsy per patient, 
lower number of dysplastic lesions than that expected in the UC target population, absence of focus on 
the different spread of the disease in the inclusion criteria were also addressed by the MAH. The MAH 
has presented data regarding baseline / prior to treatment, together with further explanation regarding 
dysplasia screen, which respond to the issues raised. Based on these clarifications, the patient 
population included was considered appropriate by the CHMP.  
There were no major apparent differences of the study populations other than the inclusion criteria 
concerning anti-TNF treatment in the 2 pivotal studies. Two hundred patients included in study M06-
827 had a history of previous anti-TNF treatment. In general anti-TNF treatment is a second-line 
alternative and it would therefore be expected that patients in study M06-827 would have more severe 
disease. However, a larger portion of patients in study M06-826 had pancolitis and severe disease 
measured by endoscopy subscore at baseline. There appeared to be a lower response rate in the anti-
TNF subgroup as discussed above. 
The MAH has presented data on colectomies in studies M06-826 and M06-827;38 colectomies in total 
appear to have been undertaken across all data sets . For the data presented, it is acknowledged that 
the rate of colectomies was low during the studies with a lower rate in actively treated patients 
compared with placebo treated. However, due to the low numbers, no definite conclusion can be drawn. 
The MAH discussed the high rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or UC worsening that was 
initially reported >33% in the adalimumab and >30% in the placebo treatment groups.  An updated 
analysis regarding the discontinuation rate was presented to include those patients that had escaped to 
open label treatment.  In both Studies M06-826 and M06-827, at week 8 the overall discontinuation 
rate was <10 % in all treatment group (except for placebo in M06-827 which was almost 15%) and at 
week 52 was 47% in the placebo treatment group and 38% at week 52 in the adalimumab treatment 
group. In M06-826 the discontinuation rate due to lack of efficacy was at week 8: 3.2% (placebo), 
3.8% (adalimumab 80/40), 1.5% (adalimumab 160/80/40) in the ITT-E set. In M06-827 the 
discontinuation rate due to lack of efficacy was at week 8: 7.6% (placebo), 5.6% (adalimumab). In 
Study M06-827, the exposure-adjusted rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or UC worsening 
while on DB treatment was higher in the placebo than in the adalimumab treatment group (1.48 
versus 1.09 E/100 PY).   
The MAH presented an integrated analysis of the double blinded data at Week 8 from both studies for 
the induction of remission. For the maintenance of remission the integrated analysis combined the 52-
week double blinded data from Study M06-827 with the 52-week double blinded (up to Week 8) + OL 
(after Week 8) data from Study M06-826. As stated in the relevant guideline, the induction of 
remission and prevention of relapse should be assessed in two separate phase III trials. The 
integration of data from the two trials can only be regarded as descriptive. Overall, the MAH analyzed 
the association between adalimumab higher induction dose (160mg, 80mg followed by 40 mg eow) 
and lower induction dose (80 mg followed by 40 mg eow) with the percentage of patients who needed 
to switch to adalimumab 40 mg every week. Patients receiving the higher induction dose seem to be 
less prone to increase the adalimumab dose according to a weekly schedule. 
Although statistical significance was demonstrated on the primary endpoints for both pivotal trials, the 
CHMP expressed concerns regarding the modest effect size over placebo observed in the both studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 40/65 
 
 
 
 
To address this concern, the MAH submitted updated analyses mainly focused on efficacy data on the 
subgroup of early responders.   
Based on this analysis the MAH addressed for how long it may be meaningful to continue treatment in 
a patient not responding. Analyses conducted for Study M06-827 indicated that among patients who 
had not achieved clinical remission at Week 8, 22/207 (10.6%) of subjects who were randomized to 
receive adalimumab achieved clinical remission at Week 52, as compared to 11/223 (4.9%) of subjects 
who were randomized to receive placebo. The MAH therefore proposed to add the recommendation in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that continued therapy is not recommended in patients not responding within 
2-8 weeks of treatment as available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within this 
time period.  
In this set of new analyses, the MAH selected “early” responders and long-term outcome in this 
subgroup has been compared with that in the placebo group. The selection of a subgroup based on 
early response, means that there are no longer comparisons of randomised groups. Therefore, these 
analyses can only be regarded as supportive. Nevertheless, this analysis in early responder suggests 
that patients demonstrating early responses benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. In order to 
ensure that patients not responding will not be put on maintenance treatment, discontinuation of 
treatment in non-responders within 2-8 weeks is agreed by the CHMP. 
Study M10-223 
Results from study M10-223 (open-label extension study) indicate that patients included benefited 
from adalimumab treatment. Disease activity measured with Mayo scores was reduced at baseline and 
remained relatively stable up to week 60 in a subset of patients, indicating that the therapy was 
effective in a selected population of responders. However, there was also a large proportion of patients 
who did not benefit from the treatment and discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy (23%). 
Overall, due to the open-label design of the study the clinical relevance of the observed effect is 
difficult to ascertain. 
Conclusion on clinical efficacy  
The UC clinical program showed that induction of clinical remission at week 8 (per Mayo score) was 
statistically significantly different between the adalimumab (160/80/40 mg) and placebo. The CHMP 
noted that the overall difference compared to placebo was <10 % irrespective of analysis set. The 
effect of the lower induction dose 80/40 mg was similar to that of placebo. A consistency across the 
beneficial effect was observed through the secondary endpoints although statistical significance was 
not achieved for all of them. 
Concerning maintenance of remission, statistically significant differences as compared to placebo were 
demonstrated for the ranked primary endpoints as well as for the first ranked secondary endpoint 
(sustained remission weeks 8 and 52). As for the induction treatment the CHMP noted that the actual 
number of patients in remission was limited. A gain of less than 10% (8.8%) over placebo was 
achieved in the remission at Week 52. When patients achieving sustained remission both at Week 8 
and Week 52 are considered, the gain of adalimumab over placebo was 4.4 % (p=0.047). Thus, the 
percentage of patients that achieved and maintained clinical remission is modest. The observed 
beneficial effect was supported by a statistically significant difference over placebo treatment for the 
first 8 ranked secondary endpoints. Consistency across the result of all other endpoints was seen 
although could not be considered statistically significant since the 9th secondary endpoint missed 
statistical significance. Steroid-free remission was evaluated at Week 32 and Week 52. At week 32 a 
positive trend for adalimumab versus placebo-treated patients was observed, but statistical

significance was not achieved. At Week 52, the difference between adalimumab and placebo patients 
discontinuing corticosteroids was statistically significant. 
Concerning  Study  M10-223,  clinical  remission  per  partial  Mayo  scores  was  increasing  over  time. 
However, these observations are difficult to ascertain due to the open nature of this follow up study.  
The MAH submitted several additional analyses to address the questions raised by the CHMP on the 
modest effect size of the observed clinical benefit. The MAH’s response was mainly focused on efficacy 
data on the subgroup of early responders (responders per PM and TM score at W2 and W 4, up to W 8). 
These data were considered of interest even though it was acknowledged that such analysis was not a 
predefined analysis in the original statistical plan and lacks a randomized comparison.  
Overall the CHMP acknowledges that there is a benefit of adalimumab in the claimed indication as 
shown by the statistically significant results observed over placebo for both induction and maintenance 
of remission. Based on the data presented this beneficial effect was considered modest compared to 
placebo, however, taking all the data presented together there was a recognised consistency toward a 
beneficial effect across the results of all endpoints in the UC clinical program. The additional analyses 
on the early responders can only be regarded as descriptive but overall provide further insight in the 
therapeutic effect of adalimumab in patients with UC. Data showed that patients demonstrating early 
responses benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. Therefore it is considered appropriate that 
early responder patients who have shown inadequate response/intolerance to conventional UC 
therapies including corticosteroids or immunomodulators should be given the option of adalimumab 
maintenance treatment. In patients not responding within 2-8 weeks it is considered appropriate by 
the CHMP that adalimumab therapy should not be continued in order to ensure maintenance treatment 
only in patients with highest expected benefit. 
1.2.3.   
Clinical safety 
The safety of adalimumab in UC was determined using data from 3 clinical studies: 2 completed 
controlled Phase 3 studies (Study M06-826 and Study M06-827) and 1 ongoing open-label extension 
study (Study M10-223) with a cut-off date of 31 December 2009. These 3 studies were conducted in 
adult subjects with moderately to severely active UC, defined as a Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and 
endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, despite treatment with oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants 
or both (or having failed to respond to or been unable to tolerate these treatments), and confirmed by 
colonoscopy with biopsy or by flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. Two hundred patients included in 
study M06-827 had a history of previous anti-TNF treatment. Safety of adalimumab throughout the 
studies was monitored and assessed by adverse events (AEs), physical examination, laboratory data, 
and vital signs. 
Patient exposure 
Four sets of data have been analysed: 
- 
Induction set (n=1093), all patients receiving at least one dose of placebo or adalimumab 
between week 0 and 8. 
-  Maintenance set (n=457), patients that received at least one dose of placebo or adalimumab 
between week 8 and 52 in study M06-827. 
- 
- 
All adalimumab set (n=995), all patients that received at least one dose of adalimumab. 
Placebo set (n=483) patients receiving at least one dose of placebo.

The percentages of subjects who experienced TEAEs ranged from 54% to 58% across treatment 
groups in the induction set. Injection site reactions were reported by a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group compared with the placebo 
group (6.3% versus 3.1%; P=0.022), and UC worsening/flare reported by a statistically significantly 
smaller proportion of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group compared with the placebo group 
(7.3% versus 12.2%; P=0.012). No other differences in AE categories were found to be statistically 
significant among treatment groups in the induction set. In both, the placebo and adalimumab 
160/80/40 treatment groups, a greater proportion of prior anti-TNF users had TEAEs compared with 
subjects who were naïve to anti-TNF agents (not reported in the table above).

With the longer duration of treatment in the maintenance set, greater proportions of subjects in both 
the placebo and adalimumab groups experienced TEAEs (68.2% and 73.5%, respectively). Compared 
to the placebo group, a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab 
160/80/40 treatment group experienced related AEs (30.8% versus 21.5%; P=0.026) and injection 
site reactions (6.8% versus 1.3%; P=0.004). No other differences in any AE categories were found to 
be statistically significant between treatment groups in the maintenance set. Among prior anti-TNF 
users in the maintenance set, the proportions reporting TEAEs were similar between the placebo and 
adalimumab treatment groups (67.9% and 68.2%). Among subjects who were naïve to anti-TNF 
agents, TEAEs were reported by a smaller proportion of placebo-treated subjects compared to 
adalimumab-treated subjects (68.3% versus 76.5%).

In the all adalimumab set, 81.0% of subjects reported TEAEs, with a higher percentage among 
subjects who dose escalated to the ew regimen compared with those who remained on the eow 
regimen (86.1% and 78.1%, respectively). Among subjects with prior anti-TNF agent experience, the 
proportions reporting TEAEs were similar between the 40 mg ew and 40 mg eow groups (89.9% and 
86.0%, respectively). Among subjects who were naïve to anti-TNF agents, TEAEs were reported by a 
larger proportion of subjects who dose escalated to the ew regimen compared to those who remained 
on the eow regimen (85.1% versus 76.9%, respectively).  
Overall, the majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity. In the induction set, a slightly higher 
percentage of placebo-treated subjects (8.5%) reported severe TEAEs, mostly UC, as compared with 
adalimumab-treated subjects (7.2%). In the maintenance set, severe TEAEs were also reported by a 
greater proportion of adalimumab-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects (10.3% 
versus 7.2%, respectively), although the incidence was higher in placebo-treated subjects (27.01 
E/100 PYs versus 29.30 E/100 PYs, respectively). In the all adalimumab set, severe TEAEs were 
reported by 23.1% of subjects who dose escalated to 40 mg ew and 22.0% of subjects who remained 
on 40 mg eow.  
The most frequently reported TEAE in all analysis sets was colitis ulcerative (range across treatment 
groups, 7.3% to 12.2% in the induction set; 16.6% to 16.7% in the maintenance set; and 26.4% in 
the all adalimumab set). The preferred term colitis ulcerative comprises the category of UC

worsening/flare, where it is discussed as an adverse event of special interest. Other commonly 
reported TEAEs (≥ 5% in any treatment group) in the induction set were nasopharyngitis (5.2% with 
any adalimumab versus 4.8% with placebo) and headache (4.8% and 8.7%, respectively), with 
additional common events in the maintenance set of abdominal pain (7.7% with any adalimumab and 
5.4% with placebo), arthralgia (7.3% and 4.0%, respectively), and nausea (3.8% and 5.4%, 
respectively).   
Other reported TEAEs (≥2% of subjects per treatment group) in the induction set were injection site 
pain (2.3%) in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group, rash (3.1%) in the adalimumab 80/40 
group, and headache (4.1%) and injection site pain (2.3%) in the placebo group. In the maintenance 
set it was: injection site erythema (3.0%), colitis ulcerative (2.6%), injection site reaction (2.6%), 
arthralgia (2.1%), and rash (2.1%) in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group. 
Injection site reactions were reported in a statistically significantly greater proportion of adalimumab 
160/80/40-treated subjects compared with placebo during the induction period (6.3% versus 3.1%) as 
well as the maintenance period (6.8% versus 1.3%); however, none of these events was serious. 
The incidence of AEs considered to be related to study drug was comparable between adalimumab and 
placebo groups during the induction period but was statistically significantly higher in the adalimumab 
160/80/40 treatment group compared with placebo during the maintenance period. 
Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious AEs were reported by 3.8% to 8.3% of subjects across treatment groups in the induction and 
maintenance sets and by 18.2% of subjects in the all adalimumab set. A similar percentage of subjects 
who dose escalated to adalimumab 40 mg weekly experienced SAEs compared with subjects who 
remained on adalimumab 40 mg eow (18.3% versus 18.1%). The most frequently reported SAE in all 
analysis sets was ulcerative colitis (8.2%), followed by anemia (0.6%), appendicitis (0.6%), deep vein 
thrombosis [DVT] (0.5%), and pneumonia (0.4%). SAEs of abdominal abscess, abdominal pain, 
abortion induced, B-cell lymphoma, colitis, and inguinal hernia were reported by 3 subjects each 
(0.3%). All other SAEs were reported by 1 or 2 subjects only. Of the 5 subjects with SAEs of DVT, all 
had recent concomitant corticosteroids use, 1 had a history of DVT, and another had recent trauma 
and surgery of a thigh wound.

death by cardio-respiratory arrest. The investigator assessed the event as possibly related to study 
drug. After autopsy the probable cause of death was shock associated with bilateral adrenal 
hemorrhage secondary to an infectious process (since the day before his death the subject had 
presented a picture of fever and muscle pain), whose etiology could not be determined. 
Events of special interest 
Infections 
Infections were reported with a similar frequency in the induction set across the treatment group (18% 
for 80/40 dose, 20% for 160/80/40 and 17% for placebo), whereas the percentage was slightly higher 
in the 160/80/40 adalimumab (38%) vs placebo (30.5%) in the maintenance set. They were reported 
Assessment report

Page 48/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in 45.2% of all patients (all adalimumab set). The majority of infections were nasopharyngitis and 
upper respiratory tract infections.  
Among subjects who dose escalated to 40 mg ew, 55.7% of prior anti-TNF users and 48.4% of anti-
TNF naïve subjects had infections whereas among subjects who remained at 40 mg eow, lower 
frequency were observed (46.5% prior anti-TNF users and 41.9% of those who were naïve to anti-TNF 
agents had infections).  
Serious infections occurred in 40 patients [4%] (all adalimumab set). Twenty (50.0%) of these 
patients were on concomitant immunosuppressant at baseline and 23 (57.5%) were receiving 
corticosteroids. The most common infections were appendicitis (n=6), pneumonia (n=4, in addition 
there were 2 patients with lobar pneumonia and one patient had bacterial and one Legionella 
pneumonia), abdominal abscess (n=3), and anal abscess, cytomegalovirus colitis, herpes zoster, 
perirectal abscess and respiratory tract infection in 2 patients each. All other serious infections 
occurred in 1 subject only. 
Twenty-one patients (2.1%) had an opportunistic infections (all adalimumab set). Of 21, 6 (28.6%) 
were receiving concomitant immunosuppressant at Baseline and 14 (66.7%) were receiving 
corticosteroids. Two subjects had SAEs of cytomegalovirus colitis; 1 was using concomitant 
prednisolone and AZA, and the other subject was receiving concomitant prednisolone and had also 
dose escalated to 40 mg ew adalimumab. All other opportunistic infections were candida infections: 
gastrointestinal candidiasis in 1 subject, esophageal candidiasis in 2 subjects, oral candidiasis in 12 
subjects, and unspecified candidiasis in 6 subjects. There have been no reports of TB. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies occurred in 10 patients (1.0%) all adalimumab set. Two of the cases (squamous cell 
carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) were not assessed as being related to the study drug and did not 
lead to discontinuation. The remaining 8 cases were reported as SAEs and the patients discontinued 
the study. The malignancies were B-cell lymphoma (n=3) and breast cancer, breast cancer in situ, 
gastric cancer, spindle cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma in one patient each. 
The lymphomas were assessed as being related to the study drug nevertheless all 3 patients had 
confounding factors with history of previous AZA treatment and were smokers. Two of the patients had 
UC diagnosed at least 8 years earlier and the third patient was >70 years. All three patients received 
active treatment and concomitant immunomodulating therapy at baseline. According to investigators' 
assessments, the case of spindle cell sarcoma was considered not related to study drug, and the case 
of gastric cancer was considered probably not related to study drug. Colon cancer cases were not 
reported in the study.  
Injection site reactions 
Ten percent of the patients had injection site reactions (all adalimumab set). None of the reactions 
were serious although in 4 cases the event led to discontinuation of the study. One subject had a 
severe event of injection site pruritus, and 2 had severe events of injection site reaction; all other 
events were mild or moderate in severity. 
Worsening of ulcerative colitis 
In the induction set, UC worsening/flare was experienced by 12.2%, 7.7%, and 7.3% of subjects in the 
placebo, adalimumab 80/40, and adalimumab 160/80/40 groups, respectively; the difference between 
the placebo and adalimumab 160/80/40 group was statistically significant (P=0.012). In the 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 49/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
maintenance set, UC worsening/flare was experienced by 16.6% of subjects in the placebo group and 
16.7% of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group. However, when using the events per 100 
patient-years (E/100PYs) measure, the incidence rate was higher in placebo patients (50.1E/100PYs) 
compared to ADA patients (38.2E/100PYs). Higher proportions of subjects who were prior anti-TNF 
users had UC worsening/flare (21.4% in the placebo group and 18.8% in the adalimumab 160/80/40 
group) compared with subjects who were anti-TNF naïve (13.7% in the placebo group and 15.4% in 
the adalimumab 160/80/40 group). Overall, 26.4% of subjects in the all adalimumab set had UC 
worsening/flare, with a higher percentage among subjects who dose escalated to 40 mg ew compared 
with those who received 40 mg eow (33.3% vs 22.5%). Higher proportions of subjects in the all 
adalimumab set who were prior anti-TNF users had UC worsening/flare compared with subjects who 
were anti-TNF naïve (35.8% versus 24.6%). 
Congestive heart failure 
In total there were 2 cases with congestive heart failures. Both of the cases were non-serious and 
considered to be unrelated. One patient that had a history of COPD and mitral valve prolapsed 
experienced right ventricular overload on day 73 of active treatment. The patient continued to receive 
active treatment. The second patient had a history of hypertension and asthma and had an event of 
pulmonary congestion on day 198 of treatment. The patient was lost to follow-up.  
Demyelinating diseases 
There was one case of leukoencephalopathy, reported as serious but mild in severity and possibly 
related to the study drug. The patient had a history of numbness of his soles of the feet and chronic 
inflammatory CNS disease, felt numbness in the legs 12 days after the last dose of adalimumab. The 
patient required hospitalization and improved on corticosteroid therapy. The causality assessment 
cannot be definitely established as the reported leukoencephalopathy but rather suggestive of multiple 
sclerosis; a separate autoimmune process but also possibly linked to adalimumab use.  
Hepatic events 
Hepatic events were reported in 43 (4.3%) patients. In 3 cases, the events were reported as serious 
but not related to the study drug: cholelithiasis in 2 subjects; 2 separate SAEs of cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis in 1 subject and portal vein thrombosis in 1 subject. No hepatic events resulted in study 
drug discontinuation. Concomitant immonumodulators were used by 23 of the 43 subjects (53.5%) 
with hepatic events. Events in 28 subjects (65.1%) resolved while on treatment. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions were reported in 13 (1.3%) patients (all adalimumab set), these included 4 patients 
with hypersensitivity. One was an itching response to a non-study drug, 2 were skin reactions to 
adalimumab, and 1 was a mild allergic reaction to adalimumab. None of the reactions were serious but 
in 2 cases the patients discontinued the study. Four events were assessed as probably related to study 
drug; all others were considered probably not or not related. Three of the 13 subjects had previously 
used anti-TNF agents. 
There are antibody data available for 6 of 7 patients in Study M06-827 who had allergic TEAEs. None of 
the 6 subjects were AAA positive at baseline. One subject from the adalimumab 160/80/40 group, who 
had an event of urticaria, became AAA positive.

Lupus-like syndrome 
There were 2 reports of lupus-like syndrome. Subjects discontinued the study, one case remained 
unresolved and one resolved after treatment. Both were assessed as probably related to the study 
drug.  
Haematological events 
Overall there were 20 patients (2%) with haematological events. Sixteen had leucopenia, 3 
neutropenia and 1 had thrombocytopenia. In 4 cases were the events reported as severe and in one 
case also as serious. Events in 6 subjects were assessed as possibly related to study drug; all others 
were assessed as probably not or not related to study drug. Of the 20 adalimumab-treated subjects 
who experienced hematological events, 19 were receiving concomitant immunomodulators. 
Diverticulitis and intestinal perforation 
Three patients (0.3%) in the all adalimumab set had diverticulitis. One subject had a known history of 
diverticulitis, and all events were deemed not related or probably not related to the study drug. Two of 
the 3 subjects were receiving concomitant corticosteroids at baseline, and 2 subjects were obese.  
Four actively treated patients experienced intestinal perforation. All were reported as a SAE. Of the 4 
subjects, 1 was receiving concomitant corticosteroids at baseline, and 3 were receiving concomitant 
mesalazine. One placebo treated patient experienced a SAE of rectal perforation. 
Pancreatitis 
One adalimumab-treated subject (all Adalimumab Set), with a history of alcohol-induced pancreatitis, 
experienced a non-serious event of pancreatitis which resolved. The pancreatitis was assessed as not 
related to study drug. One placebo-treated subject in the Maintenance Set had a SAE of pancreatitis 
acute. 
Laboratory findings 
Evaluation of the clinical laboratory data did not reveal any safety concerns. Overall, there were no 
clinically meaningful changes from a safety standpoint in measures for hematological, clinical 
chemistry or urinalysis parameters. 
Immunological events 
In study M06-827 the numbers of AAA positive patients was assessed. In all there were 19 of 487 
(3.9%) that were positive for AAA. TEAEs were stratified by AAA status for the double-blind and the 
open-label period of study M06-827. There were 6 subjects who received placebo treatment in the 
double-blind period and developed AAA after switching to open-label adalimumab treatment; they were 
not AAA+ during the double-blind period. 
For the double-blind period, the percentage of TEAE was lower in AAA– than AAA+ subjects (82.6% vs 
100.0%). Injection site reactions were higher in the AAA+ than the AAA– group (23.1% vs 11.6%). 
The rate of severe AE, serious AE and AE leading to discontinuation was lower in the AAA+ group. 
However, the number of AAA+ subjects (n=1) in each category was too small to make any meaningful 
assessment. Infections rate was comparable between AAA+ and AAA– subjects (38.5% vs 45.9%). 
Allergic reaction, opportunistic infection, CHF, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, serious infection, 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012

hematologic related AE and hepatic event was less than 10% in both AAA– and AAA+ groups. No 
incidence of demyelinating disease, lymphomas, AEs leading to deaths and deaths were reported 
during the double-blind period. 
For the open-label period, the overall percentage of AEs was comparable between AAA– and AAA+ 
subjects (73.3% vs 78.6%). Injection site reactions were higher in the AAA+ than the AAA– group 
(14.3% vs 6.6%); however, the overall percentage was higher in the placebo (9.3%) than the 
adalimumab group (4.3%). A comparison of the rate of severe AE, serious AE, AE leading to 
discontinuation, serious infection and hematologic related AE between the AAA+ and AAA– group was 
inconclusive as the number of AAA+ subjects (n≤2) in each category was too small. The rate of 
infectious AE was similar between AAA+ and AAA– subjects (42.9% vs 38.7%). Allergic reaction, 
opportunistic infection, malignancies and hepatic related AE was less than 10% in both AAA– and 
AAA+ groups. No incidence of demyelinating disease, CHF, lupus-like syndrome, lymphomas, AEs 
leading to deaths and deaths were reported during the open-label period. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Female subjects were required to have a negative pregnancy test at Screening for all studies and were 
requested to use a reliable method of contraception during the studies and up to 150 days after the 
last dose. If a pregnancy occurred, the subject discontinued from the study. There were 9 pregnancies 
reported in the UC clinical program. Five were terminated by elective abortion, 3 resulted in live birth 
of a healthy infant with no complications or birth defects (including 1 placebo-treated subject), and in 
1 case the outcome is unknown. 
The adalimumab SmpC does not recommend the use of adalimumab during pregnancy and lactation, 
and no change in the prescribing information is recommended at this time. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs were infrequent in the induction and maintenance sets in all treatment 
groups In the Induction Set, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug were reported 
for 6.6%, 6.2%, and 4.8% of subjects in the placebo, adalimumab 80/40, and adalimumab 160/80/40 
groups, respectively. In the Maintenance Set, 6.3% of subjects in the placebo group (24.42 E/100 PYs) 
and 5.1% of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group (12.11 E/100 PYs) experienced AEs leading 
to premature discontinuation of study drug. Discontinuation was experienced by more placebo-treated 
subjects than adalimumab-treated subjects in both the induction and maintenance sets. Worsening UC 
led to discontinuation in the greatest percentages of subjects. 
In the all adalimumab set, 15.1% of subjects experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. 
The percentage of subjects who had AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was generally similar 
for subjects who dose escalated to 40 mg weekly (15.6%) compared with those who remained on 
Adalimumab 40 mg eow (14.8%). The most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation was 
colitis ulcerative (8.3%), followed by colitis (1%). Rash, B-cell lymphoma, and Crohn's disease led to 
discontinuation in 3 subjects each (0.3%). All other AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by no 
more than 2 subjects each. 
Observations Related to Safety 
Analyses were performed to assess whether there was any impact of prior use of anti-TNF agents or 
concomitant corticosteroids and immunomodulators use at baseline on the AE profile of adalimumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 52/65 
 
 
 
 
Prior use of anti-TNF Agents 
In the induction set, the percentages of subjects who had at least 1 TEAE were higher among prior 
anti-TNF users compared with non-users in both the placebo (76.0% vs 53.6%) and adalimumab 
160/80/40 (68.4% vs 51.8%) treatment groups. In the maintenance set, TEAEs were reported by 
similar proportions of prior anti-TNF users and non-users in the placebo group (67.9% and 68.3%), 
although the incidence of events was almost twice as high among those with prior anti-TNF experience. 
In the adalimumab 160/80/40 group, 68.2% of those with prior anti-TNF experience had 1 or more 
TEAEs compared with 76.5% of those who were naïve, again with a higher incidence of events among 
those with prior anti-TNF experience. 
Among subjects receiving adalimumab 160/80/40 in the induction set, higher percentages of prior 
anti-TNF users compared with those who were anti-TNF naïve experienced injection site reactions 
(10.2% vs 5.2%), infections (26.5% vs 14.7%), serious infections (3.1% vs 0%), and opportunistic 
infections (3.1% vs 0.5%). A similar pattern with regard to infections was apparent in the all 
adalimumab set, with infections reported by 50.9% of prior anti-TNF users and 44.1% of naïve 
subjects. In the maintenance set, infections were reported by 36.5% of those with prior anti-TNF 
experience compared with 38.9% of anti-TNF naïve subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group. UC 
worsening/flare was reported by higher percentages of subjects who were prior anti-TNF users 
compared with non-users in both placebo and adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment groups in all analysis 
sets. 
Concomitant use of immunosuppressants and corticosteroids 
Greater percentages of subjects who were receiving concomitant immunomodulators at baseline (all 
adalimumab set) reported the following events compared with subjects who were not receiving 
immunomodulators: injection site reactions (13.5% versus 8.2%), haematological events (4.9% 
versus 0.2%), and hepatic events (6.0% versus 3.3%). 
A smaller percentage of subjects who were receiving concomitant corticosteroids at baseline (all 
adalimumab set) compared to those who were not receiving concomitant corticosteroids reported 
TEAEs (77.5% versus 85.7%) and infections (42.7% versus 48.6%). 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Data from the studies M06-826, M06-827 and M10-223 support the safety of adalimumab in adult 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC, defined as a Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and 
endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, despite treatment with oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants 
or both (or having failed to respond to or been unable to tolerate these treatments), and confirmed by 
colonoscopy with biopsy or by flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. The safety of adalimumab 
throughout the studies was monitored and assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory data, 
and vital signs. 
The most frequently reported TEAE (≥5%) in both the induction and maintenance analyses sets was 
colitis ulcerative (that includes disease worsening or flare). The incidence of UC worsening/flare was 
statistically significantly lower in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group compared with placebo during the 
induction period (7.3% with adalimumab versus 12.2% with placebo) but was similar in these 2 groups 
during the maintenance period (16.7% versus 16.6% respectively). However, the events/patient-year 
rate was higher in placebo-treated patients. Other commonly reported TEAEs (≥5%) were 
nasopharyngitis and headache in the induction set. In the maintenance set, the most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥5%) were: nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and headache. Infections 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 53/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were reported in 45.2 % of all patients (all adalimumab set). The majority of infections were 
nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. Among adalimumab-treated subjects in all sets, 
a greater proportion of those with prior anti-TNF use, compared to those who were anti-TNF naïve, 
experienced infections. Serious infections occurred in 4% (all adalimumab set). In most of the case 
patients were on concomitant immunosuppressant at baseline or receiving corticosteroids. No cases of 
TB infection were reported. Ten (10) % of the patients had injection site reactions in a statistically 
significantly greater proportion of adalimumab 160/80/40-treated subjects compared with placebo. The 
overall frequency of TEAEs was consistent with the known established profile of adalimumab. Overall 
these adverse drug reactions reported are consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab and 
in line with the current adalimumab SmPC. 
One death occurred. The patient was young without relevant concomitant morbidities and with a 20-
year history of UC. The report concluded that the subject died of shock associated with bilateral 
adrenal haemorrhage secondary to an infectious process. The infection’s aetiology could not be 
determined. 
The most frequently reported SAE in all analysis sets was colitis ulcerative (8.2%), followed by anemia, 
appendicitis, DVT and pneumonia. Stratifying patients by prior use of anti-TNF-alfa vs naïve patients a 
significant difference is noted in UC occurrence: 21.2% in prior anti-TNF-alfa users versus 9.8% in 
patients anti-TNF-alfa naïve. Overall, approximately 26% of the patients experienced worsening/flare 
of UC in the all adalimumab set. One third of it being patients escalated to 40 mg ew. A higher 
proportion of patients who were prior anti-TNF users had UC worsening/flare compared with subjects 
who were anti-TNF naïve (35.8% versus 24.6%). The incidence rate for UC worsening/flare as AE in 
the integrated maintenance set was higher in the placebo group than in the adalimumab group (50 
versus 38 E/100pty). The MAH has presented further data that indicate that the incidence of UC 
worsening/flares is influenced by prior use of anti-TNF (75 events/ 100 pty versus 56 E/100 pty for 
adalimumab) compared with anti-TNF-naïve subjects (39 placebo versus 31 E/100 pty for adalimumab). 
The CHMP acknowledged that the incidence rate of UC worsening is influenced by previous treatment 
with anti-TNF therapy. The discontinuation rate of both placebo and adalimumab treatment groups 
during the double-blind period of Study M06-827 was clarified by the MAH. Total discontinuation from 
double-blind treatment was shown to be higher in the placebo group than in the adalimumab 
treatment group, when all adalimumab-treated subjects or the subgroups of adalimumab Week 8 TM 
and PM responders are considered (1.48 placebo vs 1.09. all adalimumab vs 0.50 adalimumab week 8 
TM responders)  
One (1) % of malignancies was observed (all adalimumab sets). Eight cases were reported as SAEs, 
related to the study drug and the patients discontinued the study. The malignancies were B-cell 
lymphoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, spindle cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.  
B -cell lymphoma was diagnosed in 3 subjects. All 3 patients had confounding factors with a history of 
previous AZA treatment and were all smokers. One was over 70 years. An increased risk of lymphoma 
has been described among UC patients treated with azathioprine/6-MP. However, there is uncertainty 
regarding how disease severity, duration, and other individual risk factors, as well as the degree of 
immunosuppression, contribute to the risk of developing lymphoma in UC subjects. The data presented 
do not allow drawing conclusions on a potential impact of concomitant use of immunomodulators and 
adalimumab and lymphomas. The risk of lymphoma is a safety concern that is already addressed in the 
product information and the RMP. No new signal is identified based on the data provided in this 
application and it is considered that this risk is addressed satisfactorily for the time being. The MAH will 
continue to monitor lymphoma as part of ongoing routine pharmacovigilance activities and long-term 
clinical studies and registries as addressed in the RMP.

No case of colon cancer was reported in the studies. It is nevertheless known that patients with UC are 
at an increased risk for certain malignancies, such as colon cancer, which increases with the duration 
of disease, use of immunomodulators, and the extent of colon affected by the disease. It is recognized 
that with the current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing 
dysplasia or colon cancer. This potential risk was further discussed by the MAH and addressed in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC with a precautionary statement informing that patients who are at increased 
risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before 
therapy and throughout their disease course. The MAH will continue to closely monitor the occurrence 
of malignancies and in particular colon cancer in the ongoing study M10-223. In addition, the MAH 
included colon cancer as an important potential risk in UC patients in the RMP. The risk is followed by 
the MAH through routine pharmacovigilance activities and monitoring through long-term clinical studies 
and registries. The MAH will also monitor this risk through the Ulcerative Colitis Registry Program 
(further described below). Overall, based on the number of malignancies reported in the UC clinical 
program, there is no signal for an increased malignancy rate linked with adalimumab use. The risk is 
addressed in the PI and the RMP and will be followed on the long term through the UC registry 
program. The CHMP considered these measures as sufficient at the present time.  
A case of leukoencephalopathy with adalimumab was reported as serious but mild in severity and 
possibly related. The patient was reported to have a prior history of numbness in the soles of the feet 
and chronic inflammatory CNS disease. The clinical presentation of the reported case included myelitis, 
lesion of the optical nerve on both sides associated with motor disorder and supra-tentorial infra-
tentorial MRI lesions. Several studies suggested a potential role for anti-TNF agents in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease. These disorders include, among others, 
multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and various forms of peripheral demyelinating neuropathy. 
Demyelinating disorders have been described in both postmarketing surveillance and isolated case 
reports for the main anti-TNF agents. As of July 2009, over 140 cases had been reported of 
demyelinating CNS processes, including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, after starting biological 
therapies (Bosch X et al, Nature Rev Neurol 2011). Demyelinating disorder including multiple sclerosis 
is already reported in section 4.8 of the current SmPC as a rare adverse event together with a 
precautionary statement in section 4.4. Additionally it is reported in the RMP as an important identified 
risk monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities and through long-term clinical studies and 
registries. Overall based on the data provided in this application no new safety signal is identified and 
no change to the way this risk is currently addressed is deemed necessary. The MAH will continue to 
monitor demyelinating disorder as part of ongoing routine pharmacovigilance activities with infliximab 
as addressed in the RMP. 
Two cases of congestive heart failures were reported. Cases of worsening CHF have previously been 
reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Adalimumab is already contraindicated in moderate to 
severe heart failure and must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening of CHF. This 
identified risk is followed through routine pharmacovigilance activities and through long-term clinical 
studies and registries. As an additional risk minimization activity an educational program to prescribers 
is also running. These measures are considered sufficient to address this known risk. The presented 
data do not trigger amendment to these measures.   
Hepatic toxicity has been reported in the clinical UC program. Approximately 50% of patients reporting 
hepatic events were taking concomitant immunomodulators. The reported increases of ALT and AST in 
patients taking concomitant immunomodulators are expected. The reported serious events of 
cholecystitis and cholelithiasis are already listed in the current SmPC as uncommon events. No 
amendment to the SmPC is deemed necessary.

Hypersensibility and autoimmune symptoms/signs were reported in a small percentage of subjects. 
Allergic reaction TEAEs were reported in 7 patients. AAA were detected at baseline on 6 of these 7 
patients and all tested samples were negative for AAA. Analysis of the TEAEs stratified by AAA status 
showed that overall, AAA did not affect the tolerability to adalimumab and there were no indications of 
any clinically important differences in safety between subjects who developed AAA versus those who 
did not. 
In two subjects lupus-like syndrome was reported. Lupus like syndrome has been described previously 
in association with anti-TNF agents. The SmPC already include a precautionary statement informing 
that if a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome and is positive for antibodies 
against double-stranded DNA, adalimumab treatment should be discontinued. This important identified 
risk is also listed in the RMP and monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities and long-term 
clinical studies and registries. 
In order to further characterize the long-term safety profile in a clinical real setting the MAH presented 
a planned Ulcerative Colitis Registry Program Study P11-282. This program is a multicenter, non-
interventional registry of patients with UC treated in a routine clinical setting with adalimumab. The 
primary objective of this Registry is to evaluate the long-term safety of Humira in UC adult patients 
(18 years of age or older). The secondary objective is to evaluate long-term effectiveness of Humira in 
patients with moderately to severely active UC. Approximately 8250 patients in the US and Europe will 
be enrolled. The proposed registry is aimed at collecting safety information for a period of 6 years. In 
addition, physicians will be asked to continue to collect safety data from patients who discontinue from 
the registry. The sample size includes 5,500 patients with UC for at least 6 months and on 
immunomodulators who will receive Humira, and 2,750 patients with UC who will be used as the 
comparator group (immunomodulators received for at least 6 months). The addition of the comparator 
group was on the request of the CHMP to allow for better assessment of both safety and effectiveness. 
Also clarifications were made concerning the sample size calculation, the representativeness of the 
participating physicians as well as how loss to follow-up of AEs will be minimised in order to reduce the 
risk of underestimating the incidence of safety concerns. 
Ulcerative colitis is a disease with natural remissions that can last several years. The MAH discussed 
the risk of rebound effect with worsening of symptoms in patients stopping therapy as well as the risk 
for infusion reactions and reduced efficacy due to e.g. antibody formation related to re-treatment after 
a longer period without treatment. The effects of withdrawal and re-treatment with adalimumab were 
studied in psoriasis in the absence of data in UC. Results indicated that discontinuation was associated 
with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful loss of response. Looking at time to loss of 
response showed that the proportion of subjects losing adequate response increased over time. No 
rebound effects were observed. When patients were re-treated with adalimumab, clinical response was 
generally attained in the long-term but success of re-treatment and timing of re-gaining response is 
partially affected by the amount of disease recurrence while off adalimumab therapy. Additionally, 
“episodic dosing” data will be followed in the proposed UC Registry P11-282. Patients who interrupt 
adalimumab at least once for at least 12 weeks and receive at least 1 dose of adalimumab after the 
treatment interruption, and who do not receive any other biologics during the treatment interruption 
will be described. Analyses are expected to provide information on whether there is a rebound effect or 
reduced efficacy in those patients. 
During the procedure the MAH submitted analysis on “AE-free remission days”. In addition to the 
remission rate at fixed time points, the "days in remission" were evaluated by the MAH for both 
placebo and adalimumab-treated subjects. Particularly, a new indicator of benefit/risk defined as AE-
free remission days (AE-free remission days for a subject were defined as the difference of total days 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 56/65 
 
 
 
 
 
in remission and total days with an underlying AE) was considered as a parameter of therapy benefit 
over the full course of therapy which is able to describe the duration of the remission period adjusted 
for safety events. The CHMP acknowledged that the benefit/risk analysis by mean AE-free remission 
days indicator favours adalimumab treatment. The mean AE-free remission days almost double 
compared to the one observed in the placebo group. Among the ITT population in Study M06-827, 
more than 30 days of remission without AEs were achieved in the adalimumab arm beyond those in 
the placebo group, demonstrating a more than 60% increase in the AE-free days in remission. A new 
benefit/risk analysis was proposed by the MAH by defining the following ratio between: the number of 
AEs per subject that led to discontinuation during the study period and the number of subjects who 
achieved a therapeutic benefit (response or remission) at both Week 8 and Week 52. AEs that led to 
discontinuation represent a composite of the most relevant AEs, including lack of efficacy events and 
all impactful serious adverse events. The ratio of these two numbers was considered by the MAH as a 
measure of adalimumab benefit/risk. This analysis showed that placebo subjects had approximately 4-
times more AEs per remitter compared with adalimumab-treated subjects, showing the maintenance 
benefits of treatment with adalimumab compared with placebo. For example, 4.4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation per 1 sustained remitter on placebo were observed compared with only 1.1 AEs leading 
to discontinuation per 1 sustained remitter treated with adalimumab, supporting a positive benefit/risk 
profile of adalimumab compared with placebo.  
From a methodological perspective, the CHMP noted that these new proposed indicators introduce the 
time length of remission adjusted for AE occurrence, substituting the previously reported dichotomous 
time length-independent outcome (remission rate). The CHMP noted that these new parameters, 
although of significance in the evaluation of clinical response in patients affected by a chronic 
inflammatory disease, were not previously specified in the submitted statistical plan and for this reason 
should be considered of limited value as surrogate indicators of the benefit/risk of adalimumab 
treatment in the sought indication.  
The MAH also presented an analysis showing the reduction in the rate of hospitalisation with 
adalimumab therapy. All hospitalizations were reviewed and adjudicated as to whether they were 
related to UC or not in a blinded manner. These events were analyzed based on exposure to 
adalimumab or placebo. All analyses reveal that adalimumab therapy prevents hospitalization 
regardless of whether they were UC-related or not. Overall, statistically significant risk reductions in 
hospitalization rates versus placebo were noted, whether UC-related or not, in all adalimumab-treated 
subjects (relative risk of adalimumab over placebo was 0.5 to 0.7) and ADA Week 8 TM and PM 
responders (relative risk of adalimumab over placebo was 0.2 to 0.4). Statistically significant 
reductions in all-cause hospitalization were observed with adalimumab treatment, which is unique for 
anti-TNF treatment in UC patients. 
The ADR table in section 4.8 was updated to include data from the clinical data. The following preferred 
terms (PT) diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
polyneuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy have been combined under the new grouped term 
"Neuropathy" describing the similar medical concept of these PTs. Based on a doubling of the rate in 
the adalimumab group (0.4%) compared to the control group (0.23%) the term was added as to the 
ADR table as an uncommon event. A warning for serious polyneuropathies like Guillain-Barré 
Syndrome already exists in the SmPC. The current RMP contains already the important identified risk 
of central and peripheral demyelinating disorders including serious polyneuropathies like the Guillain-
Barré syndrome together with adequate risk minimization activities. This addresses satisfactorily the 
reported term of neuropathy. The update also included: the term "dehydration" changed from 
uncommon to common and systemic lupus erythematosus changed from rare to uncommon. Two 
changes were also made to correct two oversights from variation EMEA/H/C/00481/II/61: “blood 
potassium increased” is deleted as was wrongly added previously (it was overlooked initially that no 
Assessment report

related events were reported in clinical studies) and "vascular arterial occlusion", "thrombophlebitis" 
and "aortic aneurysm" are reported as uncommon instead of rare.   
Conclusion on clinical safety  
There is no new safety signal identified in the UC clinical development program submitted. Adalimumab 
has a well characterised safety profile in several authorised indications, including adult CD. Data 
submitted in this application confirm the known safety profile observed with the approved indications. 
Overall, the safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis seems to be similar to 
that for other approved indications. 
Events more related to the underlying disease i.e. worsening of UC (adverse events and serious 
adverse events), were reported in both placebo and actively-treated patients, and represented the 
most common reported adverse events leading to adalimumab discontinuation. The CHMP 
acknowledged that the incidence rate of UC worsening is influenced by previous treatment with anti-
TNF therapy. 
Of special concern in the UC population, is the potential risk of malignancy associated with the disease. 
No signal for lymphoma was observed in the presented data. Lymphoma is a known important 
identified risk. It is already addressed in the product information and the RMP. Based on the data 
provided in this application it is considered that this risk is currently addressed satisfactorily. No case 
of colon cancer was reported in the studies submitted. Nevertheless, it is well documented that there is 
an increased risk of developing cancer, such as colon cancer, in ulcerative colitis patients when 
compared to the general population. This risk is enhanced by different factors such as the concomitant 
immunomodulators therapy, extent and time to onset of the disease. The MAH addressed this risk in 
the RMP and the product information with addition of a precautionary statement requiring those UC 
patients who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma to be screened for dysplasia at 
regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. The MAH will continue to closely 
monitor the occurrence of malignancies and in particular colon cancer in the ongoing study. In addition 
this risk be also followed through the Ulcerative Colitis Registry Program Study P11-282 
The results showing that the proportions of patients with disease-related and all-cause hospitalisation 
were reduced in actively treated patients are acknowledged by the CHMP. These data were considered 
as supportive.

2.  OVERALL conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the induction study M06-826 a statistically significantly higher percentage of subjects in the 
adalimumab 160/80/40 mg treatment group compared to placebo achieved clinical remission per Mayo 
score at Week 8 (18.5% versus 9.2%). 
In the maintenance pivotal study M06-827 a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in 
the adalimumab group were in clinical remission per Mayo score at Week 8 and Week 52 compared to 
subjects in the placebo group (16.5% vs. 9.3% and 17.3% vs. 8.5% respectively). A statistically 
significant higher number of patients treated with adalimumab 160/80/40 mg achieved remission at 
week 8 and maintained a sustained remission up to week 52 compared to placebo. 
The results of the analysis on the rate of hospitalisation with adalimumab therapy showed that the 
proportions of patients with disease-related and all-cause hospitalisation were reduced in adalimumab 
treated patients. These results are considered supportive of the beneficial effect of adalimumab.  
Results from the ongoing open-label study M10-223 showed that, at baseline, the disease activity was 
reduced and remained stable on treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week or every week, 
in some patients up to 60 weeks. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In study M06-826, although there was a statistically significant difference between the effect of 
adalimumab (160/80/40 mg dose) and placebo treatment on the proportion of patients in clinical 
remission at week 8, the overall difference was <10 % (18.5% adalimumab 160/80/40 mg vs 9.2% 
placebo, p=0.031). In study M06-827, a gain of less than 10% over placebo was achieved in the 
remission per Mayo score at Week 8 (7.2% difference) and 52 (8.8%) respectively in patients treated 
with adalimumab. Overall approximately 17% of adalimumab treated patients achieved remission at 
week 8 and at week 52. In the maintenance setting, the gain in the clinical benefit of adalimumab over 
placebo decreases i.e. 8.5% of patients maintained remission per Mayo score in the adalimumab group, 
with a difference of only 4.4% (p=0.047) over placebo.   
The MAH has presented further data to support that patients demonstrating early responses benefit the 
most from the treatment. Recommending the discontinuation of the treatment in patients who do not 
respond within a time period of 2 to 8 weeks ensures that these patients are not put on maintenance 
treatment. 
Results in study M06-827 suggest that prior treatment with anti-TNF agents could decrease the 
efficacy of subsequent adalimumab therapy. Therefore, uncertainty was expressed on the possibility 
that patients switched to a different anti-TNF agent, as not showing early response with prior

Page 59/65 
 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab treatment, would show a decreased response in terms of magnitude of effect. There is 
currently no known mechanistic reason to suspect that such tolerance would develop.   
There were 38 patients who underwent a colectomy; all were performed during the follow-up period 
after the last dose of the study drug. Data were presented for colectomies undertaken within studies 
M06-826 and M06-827, where it is possible to compare placebo and adalimumab groups. It is evident 
that the rate of colectomies was low during the studies with a lower rate in adalimumab treated 
patients compared with placebo treated. However, due to the low numbers, no firm conclusions can be 
drawn whether adalimumab affects the need for colectomy. This also cannot be expected to be 
addressed within these types of clinical studies, and therefore colectomy requires to be further 
followed in the planned UC registry as described in the RMP. 
Ulcerative colitis is a disease with natural remissions that can last several years. Uncertainties related 
to the risk of rebound effect when stopping therapy and to the risk of infusion reaction/reduced 
efficacy (e.g. due to antibody formation) when administration re-start after a long period off treatment 
were discussed. The MAH presented the experience from a study in patients with psoriasis which 
addresses these points satisfactorily. In addition, data will become available from the UC registry as 
these parameters will be monitored, as described in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There were no new safety signals observed during the study period. The observed safety events were 
consistent with the well-characterised adalimumab safety’s profile. However, events more related to 
the underlying disease i.e. worsening of UC (adverse events and serious adverse events), were 
frequently reported in both placebo and actively-treated patients (more so in placebo patients). They 
also represented the most common reported adverse events leading to adalimumab discontinuation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Treatment with adalimumab is connected with several serious risks i.e. increased risk of infections and 
the potential risk of lymphoproliferative disorders or malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell 
lymphoma. More rare potential safety concerns include risk for demyelination. All these risks are 
already addressed in the adalimumab product information as well as in the RMP. Based on the data 
analysed in this application this is considered sufficient at the present time. 
No signal of dysplasia and colo-rectal cancer was observed in the population studied. No signal for 
increased rate of dysplasia and colon rectal cancer was observed in clinical studies. The potential risk 
of malignancy, which is also associated with the disease, has been addressed in the product 
information and the RMP. Based on the data analysed in this application this is considered sufficient at 
the present time. The MAH will continue to monitor gastrointestinal dysplasia or malignancy as part of 
ongoing routine pharmacovigilance activities as described in the RMP. In addition the MAH will provide 
regular safety update through the Ulcerative Colitis Registry Program Study P11-282 as described in 
the RMP.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with adalimumab induced a clinical remission at week 8 and maintained remission at week 
52. These findings were statistically significant. The magnitude of the remission rate for 160/80/40 mg 
adalimumab was <10% compared to placebo. A difference of 4.4% in favour of adalimumab compared 
to placebo is observed in the patients achieving sustained remission per Mayo score both at Week 8 
and 52. Among patients actively treated who were in remission at Week 8, 51% were in remission at 
Assessment report  
EMA/217675/2012  
Page 60/65 
 
 
 
 
Week 52. Secondary endpoints, in the induction and the maintenance phase, show a modest treatment 
effect of adalimumab, nevertheless, a consistency across the results toward a beneficial effect was 
observed through the secondary endpoints. Data showed that patients demonstrating early responses 
benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. Discontinuation of treatment in non-responder patients 
within 2-8 weeks ensure that patients not responding will not be put on maintenance treatment. 
The safety profile of adalimumab is well established, and treatment with adalimumab is connected with 
several potentially serious risks. Moreover, UC worsening/UC flare remain the most commonly reported 
AEs leading to adalimumab discontinuation, as well as the SAE reported by the highest percentage of 
subjects in all 3 treatment groups. The safety of adalimumab in comparison with the safety of 
alternatives for the treatment of UC is of clinical relevance. The disadvantages with steroid treatment 
are the systemic adverse events i.e. osteoporosis and increased risk of infections. The safety profile for 
AZA/6-MP is also serious with increased risks of bone marrow suppression, 
malignancy/lymphoproliferation, hepatic events and pancreatitis.  
Although the incidence rate of colectomies was numerically lower, with a risk reduction of 22%, in the 
adalimumab treatment group compared with placebo, it is not known, at present, whether adalimumab 
can delay or prevent colectomy in patients with UC. Since this is of clinical importance and could not be 
assessed within the clinical studies undertaken due to the few cases occurring, the MAH will follow this 
within the UC registry as described in the RMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Although the demonstrated effect of adalimumab was modest in that the number of patients benefiting 
from the treatment was limited, the CHMP considered it appropriate that patients who have shown 
inadequate response/intolerance to conventional UC therapies including corticosteroids or 
immunomodulators should be given the option of adalimumab treatment.  
The MAH has presented further data to support that patients demonstrating early responses benefit the 
most from the treatment. Recommending the discontinuation of the treatment in patients who do not 
respond within a time period of 2 to 8 weeks ensures that these patients are not put on maintenance 
treatment. 
Furthermore, the possibility of self-administration of a subcutaneous injection is another benefit of 
adalimumab which also should be taken into account. For patients responding, the safety profile is 
considered acceptable, with the proposed product information, and proposed RMP measures.  
The analysis on the rate of hospitalisation with adalimumab therapy showed that the proportions of 
patients with hospitalisation were reduced in adalimumab treated patients. These results are 
considered supportive of the beneficial effect of adalimumab. 
Overall, based on the available efficacy data and the extensive knowledge about the safety profile of 
adalimumab, the benefit/risk balance of adalimumab in the sought indication is considered positive for 
the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP) 
or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. 
3.  Conclusion 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore does recommend, by a majority, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation,

Divergent Positions 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion on the variation 
of the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
In the pivotal studies, more than 80% of UC patients in the adalimumab arm had no significant clinical 
improvement.  
In the induction of remission setting, the integrated analyses of the efficacy of adalimumab showed a 
very limited gain of adalimumab treatment over placebo, about or less than 10%, the clinical relevance 
of which is highly questionable. 
Sustained remission is the goal of UC treatment, however, in the maintenance setting, the gain in the 
clinical benefit of adalimumab over placebo further decreases. Only 8.5% of patients maintained 
remission per Mayo score in the adalimumab group, with a difference of only 4.4% (p=0.047) over 
placebo. Similar or even less pronounced beneficial effects of adalimumab were observed for the 
secondary endpoints 
The absence of an active comparator further hinders the interpretation of the magnitude of the efficacy 
seen with adalimumab. 
The proposal to restrict the indication of adalimumab in UC patient early responders and to not 
recommend the continuation of therapy in patients not responding within 2-8 weeks raises a concern 
on patients selection and clinical management. 
Differences  in  the  selection  of  the  placebo  and  adalimumab  arms  hamper  the  interpretation  of  the 
results obtained in the early responders. 
The medical choice of starting adalimumab would not be based on indicators/markers of response as 
no predictive parameters of response are available to identify the early responder population. No 
characterization of the earlier responder population has been provided by the MAH. Early response 
(Weeks 2 to 8) is thus the sole parameter to drive clinical decision to continue long term adalimumab 
therapy. However:  
1.  Data show that even in the population of earlier responder a significant percentage, roughly 
50%, of patients will not achieve sustained remission. This further questions the benefit of 
adalimumab treatment even in the restricted indication. 
2.  Data indicate that previous exposure to anti-TNF alpha therapies decreases the efficacy of 
adalimumab therapy, thus there is the possibility that patients exposed to adalimumab who do 
not show an early response and are thus discontinued from adalimumab treatment, if switched 
to a different anti-TNF alpha, will show a decreased response in terms of magnitude of effect. 
Thus a detrimental effect of adalimumab in these patients cannot be ruled out.  
The totally humanized nature of adalimumab could confer an advantage for patients in terms of 
reduced infusion-related side effects, however, the absence of a direct comparison with the other  
anti-TNF alpha drug that is present on the market, prevents the evaluation of the impact of this 
potential benefit of adalimumab in the clinical setting. 
In light of all the above mentioned considerations, the clinical benefit/risk ratio of adalimumab is 
considered negative.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was 
characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients 
initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack 
that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. 
Posology 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow 
tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to 
the patient needs for the first month of treatment. 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after 
each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif 
administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
• 
patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients 
initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack 
that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. 
Posology 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing 
adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously 
and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following

Weeks 3–4 
Weeks 5+ 
First demyelinating event 
The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif 
given three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  
Relapsing multiple sclerosis 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after 
each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif 
administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is 
slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory 
tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and 
complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals 
(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the 
absence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. 
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) 
receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  
Class effects 
The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, 
vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  
An increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration.

The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation. 
Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this 
study are as follows:

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease.

Posology 
The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When 
first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse 
reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the 
dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 
Recommended 
Titration 
(% of final dose) 
20% 
50% 
100% 
Titration dose for Rebif 
44 micrograms 
three times per week (tiw) 
8.8 micrograms tiw 
22 micrograms tiw 
44 micrograms tiw 
Weeks 1-2 
Weeks 3–4 
Weeks 5+ 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after 
each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif 
administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) 
receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  
Class effects 
The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, 
vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  
An increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation. 
Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this 
study are as follows:

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was 
characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Posology 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow 
tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to 
the patient needs for the first month of treatment. 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the 
RebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual 
(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients.

Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which  might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
• 
patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are 
available in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy.  
Posology 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing 
adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously 
and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following 
schedule:

First demyelinating event 
The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif 
given three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  
Relapsing multiple sclerosis 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist.  
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the 
RebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual 
(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons.  The overall incidence of these is 
slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory 
tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and 
complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals 
(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the 
absence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. 
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which  might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding.   
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation.  
56

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
• 
patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Posology 
The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When 
first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse 
reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the 
dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule:

Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the 
RebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual 
(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding.   
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) 
receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  
Class effects 
The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, 
vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  
An increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation.  
Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this 
study are as follows:

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was 
characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients 
initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a 
package that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. 
Posology 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow 
tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to 
the patient needs for the first month of treatment. 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
RebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and 
should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be 
followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients.

Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which  might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding.   
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

interferon beta.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
• 
patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease. 
Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients 
initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a 
package that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. 
Posology 
When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing 
adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously 
and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following 
schedule:

First demyelinating event 
The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif 
given three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  
Relapsing multiple sclerosis 
The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous 
injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, 
is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist.  
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
RebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and 
should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be 
followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is 
slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory 
tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and 
complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals 
(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the 
absence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. 
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which  might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation.  
91

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
• 
patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or 
more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
• 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease.

Posology 
The Rebif initiation packs correspond to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When first 
starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse 
reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the 
dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 
Recommended 
Titration 
(% of final dose) 
20% 
50% 
100% 
Titration dose for Rebif 
44 micrograms 
three times per week (tiw) 
8.8 micrograms tiw 
22 micrograms tiw 
44 micrograms tiw 
Weeks 1-2 
Weeks 3–4 
Weeks 5+ 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records 
in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 
children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 
44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif 
should not be used in this age group. 
Method of administration 
RebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and 
should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. 
For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be 
followed. 
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with 
Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should 
be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and 
a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating 
physician. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

General recommendations 
Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta 
administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 
to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued 
treatment. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to 
several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include 
thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, 
paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased 
platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes 
(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, 
further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If 
TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate 
discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 
Depression and suicidal ideation 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in 
particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation 
of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Seizure disorders 
Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Cardiac disease 
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. 
Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to 
patients with cardiac conditions. 
Injection site necrosis 
Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise 
the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: 
• 
• 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred.  
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before 
continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too 
extensive. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 
transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, 
serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy 
and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times 
the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated 
with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver 
disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be 
stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. 
Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic 
failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six 
months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No 
specific risk factors have been identified. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme 
monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at 
regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically 
thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  
Thyroid disorders 
Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. 
Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following 
initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be 
performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). 
Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression 
Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to 
patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 
Neutralising antibodies 
Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of 
antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to 
interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 
response to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance 
of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies 
is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to 
therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the 
benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity 
limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. 
Other forms of multiple sclerosis 
Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
and should not be used in these patients. 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. 
Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, 
which  might  accumulate  over  time  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis.  Use  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which  might 
accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with 
medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. 
The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been 
studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very 
limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated.  
Rebif can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Central nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta 
(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like 
syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in 
frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to 
experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. 
Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild 
inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and 
decreases in white blood cells are also common. 
The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, 
and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of 
Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 
List of adverse reactions

receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  
Class effects 
The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, 
vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  
An increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive 
treatment should be given. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 
Interferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and 
antiproliferative properties. 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human 
interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore 
glycosylated like the natural protein. 
Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the 
administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2’5’OAS synthetase 
and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to 
decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological 
responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. 
Biological response markers (e.g., 2’,5’-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are 
induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer 
subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours 
for neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2’5’OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and 
OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after 
first and sixth administration. 
The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times 
per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event 
occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of 
Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to 
initial randomisation.  
Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this 
study are as follows:

For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously 
three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at 
least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of 
patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed 
three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 
reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 
29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated 
with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence 
of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the 
preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was 
reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and 
those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in 
patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at 
the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 
44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be 
interpreted cautiously. 
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should 
not be used in these patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp 
multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  
Distribution 
Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum 
concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. 
Elimination 
After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) 
increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated 
apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple 
dosing. 
Metabolism 
Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. 
A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An 
increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No 
information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rebif is and what it is used for 
Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under “How to use 
Rebif” in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue 
destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling 
local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines. 
152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. 
the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
3. 
How to use Rebif 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has 
prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower 
dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. 
153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) 
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare 
professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif 
syringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. 
For administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: 
This medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible 
signs of deterioration should be used. 
How to inject Rebif 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the 
possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs 
and the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or 
dart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your 
injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently 
in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm 
knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional 
about anything you find. 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a 
bit). 
Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at 
a right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. 
Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the 
plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). 
Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from 
the skin. 
154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 
Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the 
syringe in an appropriate disposal unit. 
If you use more Rebif than you should 
In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to use Rebif 
If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Rebif 
The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but 
continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please 
consult your doctor.  
You should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. 
• 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) 
• 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
• 
Itching, rash (skin eruptions) 
• 
Muscle and joints pain 
• 
Fatigue, fever, chills 
• 
Hair loss 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hives 
Epileptic seizures 
Liver inflammation (hepatitis) 
Breathing difficulties 
Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis 
Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent 
vision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) 
Increased sweating 
• 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. 
The following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Dizziness  
Nervousness 
Loss of appetite 
Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation  
Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs 
resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, 
including several years after starting treatment with Rebif. 
Inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard 
and possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. 
• 
You should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor’s advice. 
Children and teenagers 
Side effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rebif is and what it is used for 
Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients 
who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under “How to use 
Rebif” in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue 
destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling 
local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines.

• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of

the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
3. 
How to use Rebif 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
Patients who have experienced a single clinical event  
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. 
Patients with multiple sclerosis 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  
160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients 
who cannot tolerate the higher dose. 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) 
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare 
professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif 
syringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. 
For administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: 
This medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible 
signs of deterioration should be used. 
How to inject Rebif 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the 
possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs 
and the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or 
dart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your 
injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently 
in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm 
knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional 
about anything you find. 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
• 
• 
Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a 
bit). 
Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at 
a right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. 
161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the 
plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). 
Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from 
the skin. 
• 
• 
Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 
Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the 
syringe in an appropriate disposal unit. 
If you use more Rebif than you should 
In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to use Rebif 
If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Rebif 
The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but 
continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please 
consult your doctor.  
You should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) 
• 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
• 
Itching, rash (skin eruptions) 
• 
Muscle and joints pain 
• 
Fatigue, fever, chills 
• 
Hair loss

Increased sweating 
• 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
• 
• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem.

Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 1.0 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.2 mL and 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose 
of 0.5 mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver

Initiating treatment 
Treatment is initiated by gradual increase of the dose (a so-called ‘dose titration’) over a period of 4 
weeks in order to reduce some of the side effects it is recommended that:  
• 
• 
During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms should be injected three times per week. 
During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms should be injected three times per week. 
From the fifth week onwards, after you have completed your initiation period, you will follow the 
usual dose regimen prescribed by your doctor. 
Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  
A lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients 
with multiple sclerosis who cannot tolerate the higher dose 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) 
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: 
• 
• 
Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion.

• 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
•

• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem.

How to store Rebif 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rebif is and what it is used for 
Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under “How to use 
Rebif” in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue 
destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling 
local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines. 
174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of  
•

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. 
the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”).  
3. 
How to use Rebif 
This medicine is for multidose use. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has 
prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower 
dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose 
175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
• 
• 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer 
can use Rebif cartridges with your device to administer the medicine at home. 
The cartridge is to be used with the RebiSmart electronic injection device. 
Full instructions for use are provided with your device. Please follow these carefully. 
Short instructions on how to use Rebif cartridges are given below. 
Before you start 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove the Rebif cartridge from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Check (just after removing from the refrigerator) that the cartridge is not accidentally frozen in 
the pack or inside the device. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without 
visible signs of deterioration should be used. 
To place the cartridge in the device and perform the injection follow the instruction manual 
(Instructions for Use) provided with your device. 
Where to inject Rebif 
• 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the 
possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs 
and the lower abdomen). It is recommended that you keep 
track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not 
injected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of 
injection site necrosis. 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm 
knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional 
about anything you find. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at 
the injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on 
the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
How to inject Rebif 
• 
Your doctor will tell you how to choose the correct dose of 22 micrograms. Please read also the 
instructions in the manual provided with your device (RebiSmart). 
176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RebiSmart 
• 
Please ensure that the dose displayed on the screen of the device 
corresponds to the prescribed dose of 22 micrograms before the 
injection. 
Place RebiSmart at a right angle (90°) to the skin. 
Press the injection button. During the injection, the button will flash. 
• 
• 
•  Wait until the light switches off. This tells you that the injection is 
completed.  
Remove RebiSmart from the injection site. 
• 
After the injection of Rebif with RebiSmart 
• 
• 
• 
Remove and discard the needle according to the instruction manual provided with your device.

If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
If you use more Rebif than you should 
In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to use Rebif 
If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Rebif 
The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore you should not stop using Rebif but 
continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please 
consult your doctor.  
You should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients 
who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under “How to use 
Rebif” in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue 
destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling 
local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines.

• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of

the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
3. 
How to use Rebif 
This medicine is for multidose use. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
Patients who have experienced a single clinical event  
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.

Patients with multiple sclerosis 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  
A lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients 
who cannot tolerate the higher dose. 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
• 
• 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer 
can use Rebif cartridges with your device to administer the medicine at home. 
The cartridge is to be used with the RebiSmart electronic injection device. 
Full instructions for use are provided with your device. Please follow these carefully.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
185 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use.  
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) 
• 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
• 
Itching, rash (skin eruptions) 
• 
Muscle and joints pain 
• 
Fatigue, fever, chills 
• 
Hair loss

Increased sweating 
• 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
• 
• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem.

rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use.  
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. 
• 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) 
• 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
• 
Itching, rash (skin eruptions) 
• 
Muscle and joints pain 
• 
Fatigue, fever, chills 
• 
Hair loss 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):

Increased sweating 
• 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
• 
• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
• 
195 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rebif is and what it is used for 
Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the “RebiDose Instructions for Use” 
provided in a separate booklet, in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin 
breakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you 
experience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines. 
198 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of

so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. 
the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
3. 
How to use Rebif 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has 
prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower 
dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. 
199 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
• 
• 
on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) 
at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). 
Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   
Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. 
Method of administration 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pre-filled pen called 
“RebiDose”. 
Use each RebiDose only once. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer 
can use Rebif pre-filled pen to administer the medicine at home. 
•  When you do this please read carefully and follow the “RebiDose Instructions for Use” 
provided separately in the booklet. 
Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible signs of deterioration should be 
used. 
If you use more Rebif than you should 
In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to use Rebif 
If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Rebif 
The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but 
continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please 
consult your doctor.

RebiDose Instructions for use 
HOW TO USE REBIF PRE-FILLED PEN (RebiDose) 
•  This section tells you how to use RebiDose.  
•  Rebif is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). 
•  Use each RebiDose only once. 
•  The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer 
can use RebiDose to administer the medicine at home. If you have questions about how to inject, 
please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for assistance. 
•  Read all the following instructions carefully before using RebiDose. 
Equipment 
To give yourself an injection you will need: 
• 
• 
• 
A new RebiDose and 
Alcohol wipes or similar. 
a dry cotton ball or gauze 
Below is a picture showing what RebiDose looks like.

F. Button 
G. Safety guard 
H. Needle 
Before you start 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove RebiDose from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Check the appearance of Rebif through the transparent window. It must be clear to opalescent, 
without particles and without any visible signs of deterioration. If there are particles or other 
205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visible signs of deteriorations, do not use it and contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
assistance. 
Check the expiry date on the RebiDose label or on the outer box (as indicated as “EXP”). Do 
not use RebiDose if the expiry date has passed. 
• 
Where to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on 
the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper 
thighs and the lower abdomen.)  
Keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one 
area is not injected too often. This is to minimise the risk 
of skin damage (necrosis). 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, 
firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare 
professional about anything you find. 
How to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
Do not remove the cap until you are ready to administer the injection. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
• 
Hold RebiDose by the main body and use your other hand 
to remove the cap. 
• 
Hold RebiDose at a right angle (90 degrees) to the injection 
site. Push the pen against your skin until you feel resistance. 
This action unlocks the button. 
206 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Keep enough pressure on the skin and press the button with 
your thumb. You will hear a click which indicates the start 
of the injection and the plunger will start moving. Keep 
RebiDose pressed against the skin for at least 10 seconds in 
order to inject all of the medicine. 
It is not necessary to keep the button pressed down with 
your thumb after the injection has begun. 
Remove RebiDose from the injection site. 
The safety guard automatically surrounds the needle and 
locks into place to protect you from the needle. 
After the injection 
• 
• 
Look through the transparent window to make sure that the 
plunger has moved to the bottom as indicated in the figure. 
Visually check that there is no liquid left. If there is liquid 
left, not all of the medicine has been injected and you 
should consult your doctor or nurse for assistance. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 
Do not put the needle cap back on the used RebiDose. This is because the needle is now 
covered by the safety guard. Do not put your fingers in the safety guard. 
RebiDose is for single use only and should never be reused. 
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard RebiDose. Ask your pharmacist 
how to safely dispose of RebiDose. 
If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rebif is and what it is used for 
Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit 
messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune 
system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  
Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients 
who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rebif 
Do not use Rebif 
• 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are severely depressed at present. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. 
• 
• 
• 
Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. 
Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the “RebiDose Instructions for Use” 
provided in a separate booklet, in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin 
breakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you 
experience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines.

• 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. 
Inform your doctor if you have a disease of

the bone marrow,  
kidney,  
liver,  
heart,  
thyroid, 
or if you have experienced depression,  
or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  
Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. 
Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
“gasping syndrome”) in young children.  
Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
3.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: 
• 
Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, 
contact your doctor for advice. 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor.

Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem.

• 
• 
• 
• 
Dizziness  
Nervousness 
Loss of appetite 
Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation  
Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs 
resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs.

H. Needle 
Before you start 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove RebiDose from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Check the appearance of Rebif through the transparent window. It must be clear to opalescent, 
without particles and without any visible signs of deterioration. If there are particles or other 
215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visible signs of deteriorations, do not use it and contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
assistance. 
Check the expiry date on the RebiDose label or on the outer box (as indicated as “EXP”). Do 
not use RebiDose if the expiry date has passed. 
• 
Where to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on 
the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper 
thighs and the lower abdomen.)  
Keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one 
area is not injected too often. This is to minimise the risk 
of skin damage (necrosis). 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, 
firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare 
professional about anything you find. 
How to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
Do not remove the cap until you are ready to administer the injection. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
• 
Hold RebiDose by the main body and use your other hand 
to remove the cap. 
• 
Hold RebiDose at a right angle (90 degrees) to the injection 
site. Push the pen against your skin until you feel resistance. 
This action unlocks the button. 
216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Keep enough pressure on the skin and press the button with 
your thumb. You will hear a click which indicates the start 
of the injection and the plunger will start moving. Keep 
RebiDose pressed against the skin for at least 10 seconds in 
order to inject all of the medicine. 
It is not necessary to keep the button pressed down with 
your thumb after the injection has begun. 
Remove RebiDose from the injection site. 
The safety guard automatically surrounds the needle and 
locks into place to protect you from the needle. 
After the injection 
• 
• 
Look through the transparent window to make sure that the 
plunger has moved to the bottom as indicated in the figure. 
Visually check that there is no liquid left. If there is liquid 
left, not all of the medicine has been injected and you 
should consult your doctor or nurse for assistance. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 
Do not put the needle cap back on the used RebiDose. This is because the needle is now 
covered by the safety guard. Do not put your fingers in the safety guard. 
RebiDose is for single use only and should never be reused. 
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard RebiDose. Ask your pharmacist 
how to safely dispose of RebiDose. 
If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

From the fifth week onwards, after you have completed your initiation period, you will follow the 
usual dose regimen.  
Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  
A lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients 
with multiple sclerosis who cannot tolerate the higher dose.

faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. 
Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  
Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.  
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section “Warnings and precautions” to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, 
contact your doctor for advice. 
Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above “Tell your doctor immediately...”). 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. 
221 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. 
Other possible side effects include: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Headache 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) 
• 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
• 
Itching, rash (skin eruptions) 
• 
Muscle and joints pain 
• 
Fatigue, fever, chills 
• 
Hair loss 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hives 
Epileptic seizures 
Liver inflammation (hepatitis) 
Breathing difficulties 
Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis 
Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent 
vision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) 
Increased sweating 
• 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
• 
• 
• 
Suicide attempt 
Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:  
- 
foamy urine  
- 
fatigue  
- 
swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem.

•  Use each RebiDose only once. 
•  The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer 
can use RebiDose to administer the medicine at home. If you have questions about how to inject, 
please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for assistance. 
•  Read all the following instructions carefully before using RebiDose.

Before you start 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Remove RebiDose from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. 
Check the appearance of Rebif through the transparent window. It must be clear to opalescent, 
without particles and without any visible signs of deterioration. If there are particles or other 
225 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visible signs of deteriorations, do not use it and contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
assistance. 
Check the expiry date on the RebiDose label or on the outer box (as indicated as “EXP”). Do 
not use RebiDose if the expiry date has passed. 
• 
Where to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
• 
Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on 
the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper 
thighs and the lower abdomen.)  
Keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one 
area is not injected too often. This is to minimise the risk 
of skin damage (necrosis). 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, 
firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare 
professional about anything you find. 
How to inject with RebiDose 
• 
• 
Do not remove the cap until you are ready to administer the injection. 
Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. 
• 
Hold RebiDose by the main body and use your other hand 
to remove the cap. 
• 
Hold RebiDose at a right angle (90 degrees) to the injection 
site. Push the pen against your skin until you feel resistance. 
This action unlocks the button. 
226 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Keep enough pressure on the skin and press the button with 
your thumb. You will hear a click which indicates the start 
of the injection and the plunger will start moving. Keep 
RebiDose pressed against the skin for at least 10 seconds in 
order to inject all of the medicine. 
It is not necessary to keep the button pressed down with 
your thumb after the injection has begun. 
Remove RebiDose from the injection site. 
The safety guard automatically surrounds the needle and 
locks into place to protect you from the needle. 
After the injection 
• 
• 
Look through the transparent window to make sure that the 
plunger has moved to the bottom as indicated in the figure. 
Visually check that there is no liquid left. If there is liquid 
left, not all of the medicine has been injected and you 
should consult your doctor or nurse for assistance. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 
Do not put the needle cap back on the used RebiDose. This is because the needle is now 
covered by the safety guard. Do not put your fingers in the safety guard. 
RebiDose is for single use only and should never be reused. 
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard RebiDose. Ask your pharmacist 
how to safely dispose of RebiDose. 
If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

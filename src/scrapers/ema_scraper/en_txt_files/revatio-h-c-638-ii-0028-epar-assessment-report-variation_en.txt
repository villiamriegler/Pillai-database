1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Sildenafil citrate is a potent and specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). It was originally 
approved  in  1998  for  the  treatment  of  male  erectile  dysfunction  (MED),  under  the  invented  name 
Viagra,  in  both  the  United  States  (US)  and  the  European  Union  (EU)  (EMEA/H/C/202  authorised 
14/09/1998).  Sildenafil  is  approved  in  the  EU  since  2005  for  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH) 
under the invented of Revatio (EU/1/05/318/001; 28-Oct-2005). The currently approved indication of 
Revatio  (last  revised  21/12/2009)  is  for:  Treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in 
primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective  tissue 
disease.  The  approved  dosage  regimen  for  oral  Revatio  consists  of  one  20  mg  tablet  administered 
three times daily (TID). 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is a rare, progressive and life threatening disease. Currently there 
are  no  approved  therapies  for  PAH  in  children.  Although  the  EU  SmPC  for  the  endothelin  receptor 
antagonist  bosentan  has  dosing  information  for  children  over  12 years,  it  has  no  formal  paediatric 
indication.  Extrapolation from adults to children in PAH is not straightforward for several reasons: 1) 
The prevalence of the subtypes of PAH is different among both populations (e.g the idiopathic form is 
more  prevalent  in  adults,  whilst  PAH  associated  with  congenital  heart  disease  is  more  frequent  in 
children);  2)  the  anticipated  lifespan  of  children  is  longer;  and  3)  before  the  advent  of  long-term 
vasodilator/antiproliferative  therapy,  the  natural  history  remained  significantly  worse  for  children 
compared to adult patients. 
This  Type  II  variation  application  is  being  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  16  of  Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2008. This Type II variation is intended to extend the indication of Revatio 
(sildenafil  citrate)  in  a  new  population,  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  in  paediatric  patients 
based on quality and clinical data.  
The  intended  new  indication  is  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  aged  1-17  with  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension. The proposed posology is 10 mg TID for low weight patients (<20 kg) and 20 mg TID in 
patients whose weight is 20 kg.  
The present clinical application is based on paediatric studies including clinical pharmacology data from 
studies  A1481134  and  A1481157  with  intravenous  sildenafil  in  PAH  (supportive  for  clinical 
pharmacology  and  safety  data)  and  a  pivotal  study  A1481131  for  PK/PD  data  with  oral  sildenafil, 
establishing  population  PK  and  PK-PD  models,  and  driving  the  oral  dose  recommendation for  the 
paediatric population. Interim clinical data from study A1481156, which is the long term extension of 
study A1481131 are also submitted.  
Development  of  an  age  appropriate  powder  for  oral  suspension  (POS)  is  currently  underway,  with 
submission  anticipated  in  Q3  2011.  Until  the  POS  formulation  is  available,  the  MAH  proposes  an  oral 
suspension  formulation  which  is  extemporaneously  prepared  from  the  20  mg  tablet  using  Ora-Sweet 
and Ora-Plus diluents (Paddock Laboratories) to reach a concentration of 10 mg/ml.   
The spirit of the Paediatric Regulation encourages the industrial development, manufacture and control 
of  specific  age-appropriate  formulations  for  paediatric  use. However,  in  the interim  period  when  such 
specific  formulations  are  being  developed,  in  exceptional  cases  it  may  be  allowed  to  have  an 
extemporaneous  form  for  this  purpose.  Of  course,  this  is  intended  as  a  temporary  measure  only,  on 
the  condition  that  the  applicant  has  committed  to  the  development  of  an  industrially-prepared  and 
validated  product  within  a  strict  and  agreed  timeframe.  Furthermore,  for  example  the  suitability, 
stability  of  the  extemporaneous  form  must  be  demonstrated  by  appropriate  studies.  Since  these 
conditions  are  met  in  the  present  case,  an  extemporaneous  form  may  be  allowed.  This  is  further 
discussed in the report.  
Consequently, the present application for the paediatric indication concerns the oral tablet formulation 
only and not the IV formulation.

The scope of the present application is the following: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, annex II, labelling and Package Leaflet to introduce a 
new indication in paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
This application is based on quality and clinical data based on 3 clinical studies A1481134, A1481157 
and A1481131.  
The above extension of indication applies to the oral tablet formulation only.  
In  addition,  minor  amendments  are  introduced  in  the  product  information  for  both  tablets  and  IV 
formulation based on QRD comments received from the renewal application as agreed with the CHMP 
as FUM. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision number P33/2010 for the following condition: 
 
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). The PIP is not yet completed. 
Information related to orphan market exclusivity  
Sildenafil  was  granted  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/03/178)  by  the  European  Commission  on  12 
December  2003  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  chronic  thromboembolic 
pulmonary  hypertension.  In  addition,  the  CHMP,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  EC  No 
141/2000,  considered  Revatio  not  to  be  similar  (as  defined  in  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  EC 
No. 847/2000) to authorized orphan medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. 
Since then, an additional product volibris (ambrisentan) was granted orphan designation for pulmonary 
arterial hypertension.  
Similarity was again assessed during the extension of indication for Revatio (variation II21) in class II 
PAH with the following conclusion. “Having considered the arguments presented by the MAH of Revatio 
on  10  December  2008,  it  is  concluded  that  sildenafil  does  not  share  the  same  principal  molecular 
structural  features  as  ambrisentan  and  bosentan  and  the  differences  in  molecular  structure  are  not 
only minor. Sildenafil is regarded as structurally not similar to ambrisentan and bosentan. As defined in 
Art.  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000),  Revatio  is  considered  as  non-similar  to  Volibris 
and Tracleer”.  
This conclusion remains valid in the present application for an extension of indication. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The claimed indication of Revatio in paediatric patients aged one to 17 years old does not overlap with 
the indications granted to EU authorised orphan medicinal products; Tracleer (bosentan) and Ventavis 
(iloprost), Volibris (ambrisentan) and treprostinil (Remodulin).   
There  is  currently  no  approved  treatment  for  use  in  paediatric  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension.  The 
paediatric pharmaceutical formulation registered for Tracleer does not constitute a paediatric indication 
in PAH (refer to EPAR Tracleer). Paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension remains an area of unmet 
medical need. 
Having considered the arguments presented by the MAH of Revatio and with reference to Article 3 of 
Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000  on  orphan  medicinal  products,  The  CHMP  considers  that 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 3/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sildenafil  is  not  a  similar  product  to  any  orphan  medicinal  product  approved  in  the  EU  for  paediatric 
pulmonary hypertension.  Sildenafil is the first orphan medicinal product approved in EU for paediatric 
pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
With reference to article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the granting of the extension of indication 
of Revatio in children aged one to 17 years old does not overlap with any existing marketing 
authorisation for any orphan medications authorised for PAH. 
1.2.  Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
The  medicinal  product  Revatio  20 mg  film-coated  tablets  contains  20 mg  of  sildenafil  (as  citrate)  as 
active substance and is presented as white, round, biconvex film-coated tablets. Other ingredients are 
summarised  in  section  6.1  of  the  SmPC  for  Revatio  20 mg  film-coated  tablets.  Revatio  20  mg  film-
coated  tablet  was  approved  via  the  centralised  procedure  on  28th  October  2005  (EU/1/05/318/001). 
The  applicant  applied  for  a  Type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  for  Revatio  20  mg  film-coated 
tablets in paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
In  the  absence  of  an  industrially-prepared  and  controlled  age-appropriate  dosage  form,  it  was 
exceptionally  agreed  to  allow  an  extemporaneous  form  to  be  prepared  from  the  current  tablet  for 
paediatric patients, i.e. the subset that cannot swallow the tablet, or who require a dose of less than 
20 mg.  
Development  experience  with  sildenafil  citrate  indicated  that  formulation  of  an  oral  liquid  would  be 
difficult due to issues of palatability and stability and that the  best oral liquid formulation would be a 
powder  for  oral  suspension.  As  agreed  with  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  an  appropriate  powder 
for  oral  suspension  is  currently  being  developed.  Until  the  powder  for  oral  suspension  formulation  is 
available, an extemporaneously prepared formulation is allowed for use in the interim period to ensure 
rapid  access  to  Revatio  for  paediatric  patients  unable  to  swallow  intact  immediate  release  Revatio 
20 mg film-coated tablets. The extemporaneously prepared formulation is an oral suspension with final 
concentration 10 mg/ml. For paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old, the recommended dose in 
patients ≤ 20 kg is 10 mg (1 ml of compounded suspension) three times a day and for patients > 20 
kg is 20 mg (2 ml of compounded suspension or 1 tablet) three times a day. 
In  support  of  this  Type  II  variation  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  submitted  an  updated  Module 
2.3 Quality Overall Summary and an addendum to Module 3.2.P.2 Pharmaceutical development. 
  Extemporaneous Preparation 
The  extemporaneously-prepared  formulation  (final  concentration  10  mg/ml)  requires  that  it  be 
prepared from readily available components and be easily prepared by a compounding pharmacy. The 
proposed suspension is prepared by suspending crushed Revatio 20 mg tablets in a 75:25 mixture of 
commercially  sweetening  and  suspending  vehicles;  Ora-Sweet  and  Ora-  Plus.  Ora-Sweet  is  a  citrus-
berry  flavoured  sweetening  vehicle  and  contains  sweeteners  and  preservatives.  Ora-Plus  is  a 
suspending  vehicle  and  contains  suspending  agents,  preservatives  and  antifoaming  agents.  Both 
vehicles are buffered to a slightly acidic pH. For the quantitative composition of both vehicles reference 
is made to section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
The extemporaneously prepared suspension is designed to be prepared in a compounding pharmacy by 
a  licensed  pharmacist.  Compounding  instructions  are  provided  in  section  6.6  of  the  SmPC  and  in  the 
package leaflet of Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets. The compounding instructions are considered to 
be clear and provide sufficient detail. The pharmacist is recommended to deliver the extemporaneous 
oral suspension in amber glass or HDPE bottles and should consider dispensing the suspension with an 
appropriate graduated oral syringe for measuring the required volumes of suspension.  
The  development  studies  include  tests  for  taste  evaluation  and  palatability,  formulation  robustness, 
compatibility  with  packaging  materials,  and  tests  to  define  the  storage  conditions.  A  technical  report 
detailing  the  development  of  the  extemporaneously  prepared  is  provided  as  an  appendix  to  Module 
3.2.P.2.  
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 4/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Suitability Studies with the Extemporaneous Preparation 
The extemporaneous oral suspension has been tested for the following parameters: potency and purity 
(HPLC), content uniformity, dose delivery, evaluation of the active substance solid form (powder X-ray 
diffraction),  microscopy,  pH,  viscosity,  density  and  preservative  efficacy  (Ph.Eur.).  These  parameters 
were  evaluated  over  time  to  ensure  that  both  the  10  mg  (1  ml)  and  20  mg  (2  ml)  doses  could  be 
delivered  accurately  over  the  in-use  period  specified  in  section  6.3  of  the  SmPC.  The  commercially 
available sweetening and suspending vehicles that are to be used to formulate the extemporaneously 
prepared suspension, as described in the SmPC contain excipients which are compliant with the USP or 
NF specifications, or are food grade.  
There  is  evidence  that  the  in  vitro  dissolution  of  sildenafil  from  the  suspension  in  acid,  pH  4.5  and 
pH 6.8  is  comparable  to  that  from  the  tablet  under  the  same  conditions,  in  some  cases  faster,  as 
expected.  This  finding  is  considered  to  be  not  clinically  relevant.  Furthermore,  the  relative 
bioavailability of the extemporaneously prepared oral suspension was compared to a crushed Revatio 
20 mg film-coated tablet mixed with apple sauce and to an intact Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablet, in 
healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. 
  Stability  
The compatibility of the extemporaneous oral suspension in various types of bottles was studied. The 
extemporaneous  oral  suspension  was  evaluated  in  HDPE,  PETG  and  amber  glass  vials  at  25°C  and 
40°C.  No  degradation  products  greater  than  0.05%  were  formed  during  the  study  period  in  all 
packaging.  Storage  of  the  compounded  extemporaneous  oral  suspension  in  HDPE  or  amber  glass 
bottles  is  specified  in  the  Revatio  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  SmPC  section  6.6.  HDPE  or  amber  glass 
bottles are considered readily availably materials in pharmacies.  
Stability  studies  have  been  performed  on  samples  of  the  extemporaneous  oral  suspension  prepared 
following the compounding instructions and stored in conventional HDPE bottles and caps. The samples 
were stored at several conditions 5°C, 25°C, 30°C and 40°C up to six weeks without a significant loss 
of  potency  and  without  the  formation  of  drug  related  degradation  products  greater  than  0.05%.  The 
extemporaneous  oral  suspension  was  also  evaluated  after  three  cycles  of  freezing  and  thawing,  no 
changes  were  observed.  When  the  extemporaneous  oral  suspension  was  stressed  under  light 
conditions  a  colour  change  was  noted  due  to  photodegradation  of  the  sweetening  and  suspending 
vehicles, Ora-Sweet and Ora- Plus. Based on the stability data provided, the proposed in-use shelf-life 
and  storage  conditions  after  preparation  (as  defined  in  section  6.3  of  the  SmPC)  are  considered 
acceptable. 
1.2.2.  Overall conclusions on Quality 
The  extemporaneous  oral  suspension  shows  to  have  adequate  palatability,  chemical  and  physical 
stability,  microbiological  quality  and  accuracy  of  dose  delivery.  The  commercially  available  vehicles 
which  are  to  be  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  extemporaneous  oral  suspension  are  appropriate  and 
the compounding instructions are clear. The results indicate that the extemporaneous oral suspension, 
compounded following the detailed instructions provided, is appropriate for use with adequate stability 
and accurate dose delivery over the desired use period and in the proposed storage conditions. At the 
time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues having an impact on the benefit/risk 
ratio of the product.  
The present changes are affecting the oral tablets presentation only.  
Furthermore,  the  proposed  extemporaneous  formulation  is  considered  a  temporary  measure  and  the 
company  has  been  requested  to  develop  an  age  appropriate  formulation  which  is  reflected  in  the 
attached  letter  of  undertaking.  This  age  appropriate  formulation  is  being  developed  as  a  powder  for 
oral solution and is planned for regulatory submission in Q32011.  
1.3.   Non clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted for this Type II variation application. All documentation 
concerning  this  new  therapeutic  indication,  paediatric  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
(PAH)  is  supported  by  nonclinical  data  previously  submitted  (Revatio  film-coated  tablets  and  solution 
for injection, EMEA/H/C/638) and clinical data. In this way, an additional comparison between plasma

concentrations of sildenafil in animals (rats and dogs) and in paediatrics has been made to specifically 
support the Revatio paediatric submission EMEA/H/C/638. 
An environmental risk assessment that has been conducted in accordance with Article 8 (ca) and (g) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended has been provided.  
1.3.1.  Pharmacology 
All of the pharmacology information contained within this section has been previously submitted in the 
either the oral Revatio EMEA/H/C/638 or Viagra EMEA/C/202 submissions. A combined summary is 
provided below based on these existing submissions. 
● Primary Pharmacodynamics 
UMechanism of Action 
Sildenafil  inhibits  cyclic  GMP  phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE5).  PDE5  is  found  in  human  pulmonary 
arterial smooth muscle (PASM) (Rabe et al, 1994) and hydrolyses cGMP which is the mediator of nitric 
oxide (NO) and atrial natriuretic factor activity. The action of sildenafil results in an increase in cGMP 
within  the  PASM  cell  and  a  consequent  relaxation  in  PASM  tone  leading  to  a  decrease  in  pulmonary 
vascular resistance and, therefore, pulmonary artery pressure. PDE5 is found in other types of vascular 
smooth muscle, in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of the penis and in platelets and visceral smooth 
muscle, but not in human heart.  
Phosphodiesterase Selectivity 
PDE5  is  a  member  of  the  superfamily  of  cyclic  nucleotide  phosphodiesterases  which  contains  11 
families (PDE1 to PDE11). Sildenafil, across species, consistently and potently inhibits PDE5 in human, 
rat,  dog,  and  rabbit  (IC50  range  3.5-10.9  nM).  Sildenafil  has  selectivity  for  human  PDE5  over  other 
human PDEs. 
The  circulating  metabolite,  UK-103,320,  was  slightly  weaker  than  parent  sildenafil  as  an  inhibitor  of 
PDE5. UK-103,320 has a similar PDE selectivity profile to sildenafil parent. 
In Vivo Pulmonary Vasodilator Effects of Sildenafil 
Sildenafil, administered i.v. at 4 dose levels attenuated hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction in 
anesthetized dogs producing only minor effects on systemic haemodynamic parameters. 
●   Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
Relevant Functional Effect of PDE5 Inhibition 
In  vitro,  sildenafil  potentiated  the  relaxant  actions  of  NO  in  rabbit  and  human  isolated  corpus 
cavernosal smooth muscle. In anesthetized dogs enhances the increase in intracavernosal pressure. 
Sildenafil  increased  the  levels  of  cGMP  in  canine  isolated  coronary  artery  sections  with  no  effects  on 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)  levels  and  had  no  inotropic  activity  on  dog  isolated 
trabeculae.  Sildenafil  displayed  arteriovenous  dilator  properties  in  vivo  and  at  higher  doses  caused  a 
modest fall on blood pressure in rat. In conscious dog, sildenafil produced modest, dose-related, falls 
in systemic vascular resistance and LV and diastolic pressure, which were accompanied by increases in 
cardiac  contractility  (LV  dP/dt  max)  and  heart  rate.  There  was  no  evidence  that  sildenafil  directly 
affected electrical conductance in the heart. 
Sildenafil  had  no  effect  per  se  on  agonist-induced  aggregation  of  rabbit  or  human  platelets  although, 
as expected, it potentiated the platelet anti-aggregatory effects of the NO donor, SNP, in vitro and ex 
vivo.  
Sildenafil was neither synergistic with heparin nor aspirin with respect to bleeding time in the rat, but 
its effect on this parameter was additive with that of heparin. 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 6/50
 
 
 
 
 
Higher  concentrations  of  sildenafil  caused  smooth  muscle  relaxation  in  rat,  mouse,  guinea  pig,  and 
dog,  and  can  slow  intestinal  transit  in  rodents,  resulting  in  mortality  associated  with  gastrointestinal 
dilation.  It  has  been  shown  in  a  mouse  carcinogenicity  study.  However,  sildenafil  has  not  been 
associated  with  any  significant  adverse  gastrointestinal  effects  when  used  for  the  treatment  of  PAH 
apart from dyspepsia. 
Sildenafil was demonstrated to be a selective pulmonary vasodilator in dogs. However, the absence of 
PDE5  in  cardiac  muscle,  along  with  the  lack  of  a  direct  effect  on  cardiac  contractility  supported  the 
view that it would not have adverse cardiac effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
Functional Effects of PDE6 Inhibition 
Sildenafil inhibits  PDE6  expressed  in  human,  rat,  and  dog  retina,  resulting in  a  decrease  in  the  cGMP 
concentration (Koutalos and Yau, 1996) and hyperpolarisation of the photoreceptor membrane. In vitro 
and  in  vivo  studies  in  dogs  showed  that  sildenafil  affects  retinal  function,  without  causing  structural 
changes  to  the  retina.  Sildenafil  did  not  affect  eye development  in  rat  or  rabbit  and  ophthalmological 
assessment  in  juvenile  and  young  adult  animals  did not  reveal  any  treatment-related  findings.  Visual 
effects  have  been  observed  in  humans  although  were  always  transient,  reversible  and  without 
significant alterations in visual function.  
●   Safety Pharmacology 
The  safety  pharmacology  studies  are  unremarkable  except  for  a  moderate  affinity  of  sildenafil  for 
adenosine A2a receptors, although this finding is unlikely to have any functional consequences. 
In  animal  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  the  central  and  peripheral  nervous  systems  and  on 
cardiovascular,  renal,  gastrointestinal,  and  pulmonary  function,  sildenafil  was  well-tolerated  in  mice 
and rats. The only effects of sildenafil noted were consistent with its known vasodilator action. 
1.3.2.  Drug interactions 
No relevant pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in animals. 
1.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
●   Absorption 
All of the nonclinical information contained within this section has been previously submitted (Revatio 
Oral  and  Solution  for  Injection  EMEA/H/C/638).  Some  additional  comparisons  have  been  made  to 
specifically support the Revatio paediatric submission EMEA/H/C/638. 
Oral  absorption  of  sildenafil  is  rapid  and  high  in  all  species.  Systemic  bioavailability  is  attenuated  by 
pre-systemic  hepatic  metabolism  to  an  extent  consistent  with  the  plasma  clearance  value  in  each 
species.  A  species-specific  gender  difference  in  pharmacokinetics  in  the  rat  reflects  the  more  rapid 
metabolism to UK-103,320 in males. 
Plasma Concentrations in Toxicology Studies 
Plasma  concentrations  of  sildenafil  and  the  metabolite  UK-103,320,  the  major  circulating  active 
metabolites in humans, were assayed during toxicology studies as is shown in the table below.

A  gender  difference  in  plasma  exposure  of  both  parent  drug  and  metabolite  was  apparent  in  rat,  but 
not  in  dog,  for  which  data  from  both  genders  have  been  averaged.  Relative  to  males,  female  rats 
showed  in  general  a  much  higher  plasma  exposure  of  sildenafil  and  a  somewhat  lower  plasma 
exposure  of  the  metabolite  UK-103,320.  Plasma  exposure  of  parent  compound  exceeded  that  of  the 
metabolite in  female  rats,  whereas  the  reverse  was  generally  the  case  in  males.  This  species-specific 
gender  difference  reflects  the  faster  metabolism  of  sildenafil  to  UK-103,320  observed  in  vivo  and  in 
vitro in male rats. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  sildenafil  and  UK-103,320  were  determined  following  16-week  oral  TID 
administration  to  paediatric  subjects  with  PAH  (the  pivotal  study  A1481131).  Each  subject  was 
allocated into one of three weight categories and received either placebo or low, medium or high doses 
of  sildenafil.  Due  to  sparse  pharmacokinetic  sampling  in  the  paediatric  study,  the  human  Cmax  and 
AUC  values  were  predicted  using  the  population  pharmacokinetic/  pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  model 
described  in  study  report:  Supplemental_PK_Report_A1481131.  The  maximum  modelled  unbound 
exposure within each of the weight categories, that is, 20 mg TID for 20 kg subjects and 80 mg TID 
for 20 kg subjects from this clinical study are shown in Table III.2.1. 
Comparison of Plasma Concentrations in Toxicology Studies and in Humans 
For  paediatric  subjects  two  oral  doses  of  sildenafil,  10  mg  TID  for  subjects  weighing  less  than  20  kg 
and  20  mg  TID  for  subjects  weighing  greater  than  20  kg  have  been  proposed.  A  comparison  of  the 
maximum  modelled  unbound  exposure  of  sildenafil  and  UK-103,320  to  the  exposures  determined  in 
the  toxicology  studies  at  the  no  observable  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL),  was  made  in  A1481131 
study, where subjects weighing 20 kg received 20 mg TID of sildenafil and subjects weighing 20 kg 
received 80 mg TID of sildenafil. Note this is higher than the actual proposed clinical doses resulting in 
a conservative estimate of the exposure multiples. The results of this exposure comparison are shown 
in the Table 2 below.

a. Dose multiple based on 10 mg dose for paediatrics weighing 8 kg. 
The  low  exposure  multiple  for  sildenafil  in  the  male  rat  at  the  NOAEL  is  a  consequence  of  a  species-
specific sex difference which results in higher concentrations of the metabolite in the male (previously 
presented in Revatio EMEA/H/C/638). Consequently, in the male rat, an appreciable exposure multiple 
does  exist  for  UK-103,320.  In  female  rat  and  dog,  exposure  in  terms  of  both  Cmax  and  AUC  of 
sildenafil  is  greater  than  that  observed  in  paediatrics  in  both  weight  categories.  Thus,  overall,  when 
data  for  both  parent  compound  and  UK-103,320  are  considered,  the  exposure  multiples  indicate  a 
clear separation between clinical exposure in paediatrics and the exposure associated with NOAELs in 
rat and dog up to the expected maximum clinical doses. 
●   Distribution 
Volume  of  distribution  is  similar  in  rodents  and  humans  but  is  higher  in  dog.  The  pattern  of  tissue 
distribution  of  drug  is  widespread,  including  an  affinity  for  melanin  which  is  believed  to  have  no 
toxicological significance. 
●   Metabolism 
In  all  species  studied,  clearance  of  sildenafil  is  via  five  principal  pathways  of  oxidative  metabolism. 
Metabolism  in  man  is  mediated  by  CYP3A4,  present  at  similar  levels  from  two  years  to  adults,  and 
CYP2C9. Sildenafil also can be substrate of CYP3A7 presents in the foetus and newborn infants. Based 
on  these  metabolism  data,  it  is  expected  that  sildenafil  metabolic  pathways  will  be  similar  in  both 
paediatrics  and  adults.  Circulating  metabolites  are  present,  but  only  one  (UK-103,320)  would  be 
expected to make a contribution to therapeutic activity. 
●   Excretion 
The majority of the dose of sildenafil is excreted in the faeces over 48 hours. 
1.3.4.  Toxicology 
All of the toxicity information contained within this section was generated for the Viagra EMEA/C/202 
submission and was re-submitted in full for the Revatio EMEA/H/C/638 marketing authorization for the 
treatment of PAH. Consequently, only a brief summary is provided below. 
The toxicology of sildenafil has been investigated by the oral and i.v. route. The minimal lethal dose of 
sildenafil  was  500-1000  mg/kg  in  mice  and  300-500  mg/kg  in  rats  by  the  oral  route.  No  signs  of 
toxicity  or  mortality  were  reported  in  single  dose  i.v.  administration,  and  the  NOEL  was  20  mg/kg  in 
mice and 10 mg/kg in rats. In oral repeated-dose toxicity studies, the top dose levels were limited by 
isolated deaths at 200 mg/kg in rats and by gastric intolerance in dogs at 80 mg/kg. The main effect 
was  hepatic  centrilobular  hypertrophy  in  rats  and  heart  rate  increased  without  changes  in  blood 
EMA/482372/2011

pressure in dogs. In oral studies, the NOAELs were 60 mg/kg in rats and 15 mg/kg in dogs and are the 
basis  of  the  margins  presented  in  comparison  of  plasma  concentrations  in  toxicology  studies  and  in 
humans. Treatment-related mortality noted on repeat studies in mice was due to the pharmacological 
activity of sildenafil on the intestinal musculature. This effect was not noted in rats, dogs and clinically. 
No treatment-induced local irritation was noted in an intra-arterial tolerance study in rabbits. 
Sildenafil did not adversely affect fertility in rats and was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Treatment 
at the high dose caused a decrease in viable litter size at birth, decreased pup survival from postnatal 
Days 1-4 and a reduced birth weight. NOAEL for developmental toxicity was established at 30 mg/kg. 
Although  exposure  was  not  monitored  in  this  study,  the  minimal  effects  on postnatal  development  at 
60 mg/kg equates to an unbound Cmax of approximately 24 and 50 times the paediatric exposure for 
an  oral  dose  of  10  mg  or  20  mg  TID,  respectively,  and  thus  provide  a  sufficient  margin  of  safety  for 
paediatric investigations. 
Sildenafil was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests and had no antigenic potential. There was no 
carcinogenic  effect  in  mice.  The  Mortality  in  this  study  was  associated  with  gastrointestinal  dilation 
since  mice  are  particularly  sensitive  to  effects  of  sildenafil  on  the  gastrointestinal  tract. Sildenafil  has 
no carcinogenic potential for humans.  
Sildenafil  has  effects  in  retina  which  were  reversible  and  proportional  to  plasma  sildenafil 
concentrations.  These  are  higher  than  those  active  on  the  pulmonary  vasculature.  (Isaacs,  1997; 
1998a; 1998b; 1998c). The arteritis in the vessels of the optic nerve was considered a manifestation of 
a stress-related and dog-specific condition known as Beagle Pain Syndrome (Hayes et al, 1989; Snyder 
et al, 1995). 
Studies in Juvenile Animals 
An  extensive  range  of  nonclinical  studies  has  already  been  conducted  in  support  of  the  clinical 
development  of  sildenafil,  which  adequately  addressed  the  potential  risks  for  the  paediatric 
populations. 
Clinical trials in paediatric patients with PAH did not identify any new safety signals that had not been 
identified  already  in  the  adult  PAH  population.  Consequently,  juvenile  toxicity  studies  were  not 
conducted to support the paediatric submission. 
●   Other Toxicity Studies 
Phototoxicity 
No  studies  have  been  conducted.  No  phototoxicity/phototoxic  reactions  associated  with  the  use  of 
sildenafil  have  been  found  in  a  search  of  the  medical literature and  in  the  post-marketing  experience 
during more than 10 years of commercial use in over 37 million patients worldwide. 
Immunotoxicity 
There were no findings in the repeat-dose studies or in an antigenicity study in guinea pigs to indicate 
immunotoxicity and therefore no specific immunotoxicity studies were conducted. 
1.3.5.  Environmental Risk Assessment  
An environmental risk assessment that has been conducted in accordance with Article 8 (ca) and (g) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been provided by the Applicant.

The PECsurface water is calculated using the default Fpen of 0.01.  
This  ERA  includes  a  Phase  I  Environmental  Exposure  Assessment.  No  environmentally  related  labels 
are  proposed  for  orphan  medicinal  product  Revatio  based  on  the  outcome  of  the  Phase  I  exposure 
assessment (PECsurfacewater=0.003 µg/L, below action limit of 0.01 µg/L, according to the Guideline 
on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447). It 
is agreed that based on the published prevalence data, the addition of the pediatric population to the 
indication will not lead to a prevalence of higher than 1 in 10,000 assuming that all patients covered by 
the prevalence will use the product 365 days per year, leads to an Fpen equal to the prevalence, i.e. 1 
in  10,000  or  0.0001.  Therefore,  in  this  Type  II  variation  application,  the  PEC  surfacewater  is  derived 
using a refined Fpen of 0.0001.  
This  worst-case  Fpen  leads  to  a  PECsurface  water  of  3  ng  L-1,  which  is  below  the  action  limit.  A  Phase  II 
assessment is not deemed necessary. 
1.3.6.  Discussion on non clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted for this Type II variation application.  
The Applicant has provided a comparison of AUC and Cmax data for sildenafil in the blood samples of 
rats,  dogs  and  paediatric  subjects  (study  A1481131).  According  to  these  data,  there  is  no  safety 
margin  between  blood  samples  of  male  rats  and  paediatric  subjects  and  this  margin  is  less  than  the 
safety margin reported for adult patients. Although this finding is a consequence of a species-specific 
sex difference which results in higher concentrations of the metabolite in the male rats, the applicant 
provided clarification on the clinical relevance of this finding. 
Clinical data indicate that exposure is not higher, and possibly even lower, in young children compared 
to older children or adults. This indicates that exposure multiples from data presently in the dossier will 
suffice for the paediatric indication, except for the male rat. However, in the male rat, the exposure to 
the  metabolite  is  high,  indicating  that  sildenafil  was  quickly  metabolised  into  N-desmethyl  metabolite 
UK-103,320 which represents 50% of the potency of sildenafil as a PDE5 inhibitor. Therefore, male rats 
were  also  at  least  partly  exposed  to  the  pharmacologic  action  of  the  compound.  In  summary,  up  to 
now there are no signals that an extra risk is expected in paediatric patients and no additional data are 
necessary. 
1.3.7.  Conclusion on non clinical aspects 
Based on present non-clinical data, no additional risks on top of those already identified are expected 
for  paediatric  patients.  However,  there  is  some  concern  regarding  the  youngest  patients,  since  the 
pulmonary system is still in development up to 2 years and the cardiovascular system up to 5 years. 
This is further addressed in the safety section of the clinical part.

A1481134 and A1481157  with intravenous sildenafil in PAH (supportive for clinical pharmacology and 
safety data) and pivotal study A1481131 for PK/PD data with oral sildenafil, establishing population PK 
and  PK-PD  models,  and  driving  the  oral  dose  recommendation for  the  paediatric  population.  Neither 
data from Study A1481134 nor Study A1481157 have been used to derive the dose recommendation 
or  have  been  directly  used  for  the  corresponding  population  PK  model  building  and  will  not  be 
discussed here.  
1.4.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
Study  A1481131: A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging, parallel group study 
of oral sildenafil in the treatment of children, aged 1-17 years, with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Primary  Objective:  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  16  weeks  of  chronic  treatment  with  oral  sildenafil  in 
paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years, with PAH.   
Secondary  Objectives:  to  assess  safety,  tolerability,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  16  weeks  of  chronic 
treatment  with  oral  sildenafil  in  paediatric  subjects,  aged  1  to  17  years  with  PAH,  and  to  assess  the 
survival status of subjects who did not enter Study A1481156. 
Study  Design:    A  randomised,  double-blind,  multi-centre,  placebo  controlled  parallel  group,  dose 
ranging  study.  The  study  included  subjects,  aged  1  to  17  years  with  body  weight  ≥8  kg,  and  with 
primary PAH or PAH secondary to congenital heart disease. 
Pharmacokinetic  Evaluations:  Blood  samples  for  pharmacokinetic  evaluations  were  collected  pre-dose 
at  baseline,  and  at  Weeks  4,  8  and  16,  and  additionally  after  the  first  dose  of  the  day  at  Week  16 
during the following sampling windows: 15 minutes to 3 hours, 3 to 6 hours and >6 to 8 hours. 
Study medications: Subjects were randomised to receive either 1 of 3 sildenafil doses (low, medium or 
high, also depending on body weight ranges) TID (see Table 2), or placebo. 
Preparation of study medications: For subjects able to swallow tablets, sildenafil or placebo were dosed 
TID with water, at least 2 hours after food intake, and 2 hours prior to next food intake. For subjects 
unable  to  swallow  tablets,  caregivers  were  provided  with  a  tablet  crusher  and  written  instructions  on

how to prepare and administer the powder obtained (see the full description of the study methods in 
the “Clinical Efficacy” section of current AR). 
Results  and  Conclusions:  A  population  PK  analysis  was  completed  for  Study  A1481131.    A  one 
compartment model with first order absorption and a lag-time, with weight and dose as covariates was 
developed for sildenafil.  
This model is different from the population PK model developed in PPHN (A1481157 study), as this is a 
model  describing  the  oral  dosing  in  children  (1  year  to  17  years),  where  the  former  model  describes 
the IV dosing in neonates. A similar model was also developed for the metabolite UK-103,320.  
The  following  PK  parameters  for  sildenafil  and  UK-103,320  were  calculated  for  each  subject  using 
either  the  observed  concentration  time  data  or  predicted  from  the  population  PK  model:    apparent 
clearance, apparent volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, maximum observed concentration 
at steady state, maximum predicted concentration at steady state, time for Cmax, minimum predicted 
concentration at steady state, area under plasma concentration-time profile within the dosing interval, 
and elimination half-life. The details of establishing population PK and PK-PD models, and deriving the 
dose recommendation for the paediatric population can be found in the subsection below.       
Population PK and PK/PD analysis of sildenafil in children 
An analysis of the PK and PK/PD from Study A1481131 was conducted in order to assess the PK and 
efficacy  of  sildenafil  in  relation  to  plasma  exposure  and  to  establish  the  recommended  dose  in 
paediatric  PAH  patients.  The  analysis  utilised  a  nonlinear  mixed  effect  modelling  approach  on  the 
population PK and PD endpoint data (peak volume of oxygen consumed [pVO2]) obtained from Study 
A1481131.  
Based  on  the  results  from  previous  adult  PAH  patients  (Study  A1481140)  with  the  oral  formulation, 
body  weight  (range  41  –  122  kg)  and  age  did  not  affect  apparent  oral  plasma  clearance  (CL/F).  In 
contrast,  after  administering  the  IV  formulation  in  neonate  patients  (Study  A1481157)  plasma 
clearance  (CL)  showed  a  rapid,  3  fold  increase  within  7  days  after  birth  and  the  CL  showed  a  high 
correlation  with  body  weight.    Results  from  Study A1481131  suggested  that  the  children  over  1  year 
already show a relatively high CL/F and a shallow increase would be expected with further body weight 
increase.  In addition, the increase would reach a constant value at some body weight.  
The analysis was conducted in 2 parts:  
 
 
The  first  part  focused  on  the  population  PK  data  from  Study  A1481131  in  conjunction  with  data 
gathered  in  the  adult  PAH  population  (Study  A1481140).  Both  datasets  were  analysed 
simultaneously as the weight range observed in Study A1481140 overlapped with that observed in 
Study A1481131.  
In  Study  A1481131,  the  6  minute  walk  distance  (6MWD)  was  not  considered  a  feasible  endpoint 
and the pVO2 assessed during a cycle ergometry in cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test was used 
as  the  primary  endpoint.    However,  only  115  out  of  234  subjects  were  developmentally  able  to 
perform the test. Thus, the second part of the PK/PD analysis focused on these 115 subjects. 
The objectives of the PK analysis were: 
 
 
To investigate the PK of sildenafil in children with PAH after TID dosing. 
To develop a population PK model which can be used to describe PK data in both paediatric and the 
adult PAH populations. 
To predict the range of mean steady-state concentrations (Cav,ss) throughout the observed weight 
range. 
To provide typical values (TV) and Bayesian estimates (EBE) of Cav,ss as an exposure measure for 
each patient to be utilised in the subsequent PK/PD analysis.

Methods:  The  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  the  combined  data  from  both  adult 
(Study A1481140)  and  paediatric  (Study  A1481131)  patients  in  order  to  develop  a  model  which 
describes  the  relationship  between  weight  and  PK  parameters  such  as  CL/F  and  V/F.  A  one 
compartment, first order absorption model with a lag time was applied as the structural PK model. The 
dependency  of  CL/F  with  body  weight  increase  was  expressed  by  a  sigmoid  model  with  an  intercept.  
The  CL/F  is  expected  to  be  already  relatively  high  at  an  age  of  1 year,  which,  as  mentioned  earlier, 
reflects the early maturation of metabolic processes in the postnatal period.  Applying this model the 
CL/F  increases  with  body  weight  and  reaches  a  plateau  at  some  value  of  weight.  In  the  combined 
analysis  of  A1481131  and  A1481140  data,  body  weight  is  a  convenient  explanatory  factor  which 
integrates both datasets.   
Data:  Pharmacokinetic  data  from  380  patients  (A1481131:  173,  A1481140:  207)  were  collected 
(placebo  group  was  not  counted).    A  total  of  1931  concentrations  were  included  in  the  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis.    Between  3  and  6  serum  samples  per  subject  were  collected.    In  Study 
A1481131,  Visit  1  (Week  0),  Visit  2  (Week  4)  and  Visit  3  (Week  8)  included  1  sample  and  Visit  4 
(Week  16)  included  4  samples,  at  1-2,  3-5,  and  6-8  hours  after  dose.    In  Study  A1481140,  Visit  1 
(Week 0) included 3 samples, Visit 3 (Week 8) 2 samples and Visit 4 (Week 12) 5 samples.  
Results:  The  PK  model  described  above  showed  a  good  fit  with  the  observed  plasma  concentrations. 
The typical estimates ( SE) of maximum CL/F, the intercept of CL/F, the body weight at half of max 
CL/F and the Hill coefficient were estimated at 57.8 (2.67) L/h, 13.9 (1.98) L/h, 21.3 (1.76) kg and 
3.7 (0.87), respectively (See Module 5.3.4.2 for the detailed PK analysis results).Using the estimated 
CL/F  it  is  possible  to  estimate  the  average  plasma  concentration  during  one  day  at  steady  state 
(Cav,ss) for each dosage. The typical values of decay half-life from model prediction were 4.2 hours for 
10  kg  and  4.4  hours  for  70  kg  of  body  weight,  showing  no  weight-related  relevant  difference. 
Maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  after  20  mg  sildenafil  PO  was  estimated  at  49,  104  and  165 
ng/mL  for  70,  20  and  10  kg  patients,  respectively.  The  time  of  peak  concentration  (Tmax)  was 
calculated to be approximately 1 hour and was almost independent of body weight (Cmax in adults is 
113 ng/ml and half-life is 3-5 h at steady state).

The  CL/F  in heavier  children  (30  kg)  is  similar  to  adults.  In lighter  children,  the  change  in  CL/F  was 
less  than  proportional  to  changes  in  body  weight.  Thus  to  achieve  the  same  exposure  as  given  by 
Cav,ss, in the lighter children, the dose would need to be halved. 
PK/PD profile in children 
The analysis focuses on the relationship between the Cav,ss and the change in peak VO2 (pVO2) only.  
The objectives of the PK/PD analysis were: 
 
 
To investigate the PK/PD relationship between Cav,ss and pVO2 increase. 
To  estimate  the  placebo  and  maximum  response  in  pVO2  at  Week  16  compared  to  change  from 
baseline. 
To estimate the threshold Cav,ss at which pVO2 reaches 90% response (EC90).  
To  evaluate  the  efficiency  of  various  dosing  regimens  utilising  success  criteria  as  defined  as  an 
improvement in pVO2 over a certain percentage compared to placebo. 
 
 
Methods: Peak VO2 values at baseline and at week 16 were included in the PK/PD modelling exercise. 
EBE  and  TV  predictions  of  Cav,ss  were  derived  from  the  population  PK  model.  TVs  are  based  on  the 
covariates  (dose  and  weight)  only.  A  sigmoid  Emax  model  was  used  as  the  structural  PK/PD  model.  
The data from the placebo group was included. 
Simulations  and  inferences:  Stochastic  simulations  were  performed  to  assess  the  performance  of 
various  dosing  regimens  given  the  estimated  population  PK  and  PK/PD  models.  Success  on  an 
individual level within the simulations is defined as a 10% improvement on pVO2. 
Results: The sigmoid Emax model could successfully be applied to the pVO2 data. The representation 
of the sigmoid Emax model results are shown in Figure 2. The results from the model fits obtained for 
both EBE and TV Cav,ss are listed in Table 4. In all subsequent simulations, the TV Css,av have been 
used because the TV model had a 2 points lower objective function value compared to the EBE model. 
For  both  models,  E0  (placebo  effect)  was  not  significant  from  zero.  Under  the  null  hypothesis 
(Emax=0)  a  delta  (increase)  in  the  -2LL  of  15.803  points  was  obtained,  i.e.  Emax  was  significant 
(p<0.001,  df=3).  The  typical  value  Emax  was  estimated  to  be  around  8-9%.  EC50  and  EC90  were 
estimated at around 25-30 and 30-40 (95%CI: 20-55) ng/mL, respectively (Table 3).

as obtained from a 
simulation of the final

symbols reflect the 
observed change from 
baseline.  The colour 
represents the 
randomised dose 
groups (Δ: low, +: 
mid, ×: high) and the 
placebo group ((cid:31)). 
The latter is set for 
convenience at 3 
ng/mL. 
Simulations: The prediction interval for 2 dose regimens is included in Figure 3: 1) 10 mg TID up to a 
weight of 20 kg, and 20 mg TID for a weight of 20 kg and above, 2) 20 mg TID up to a weight of 20 
kg, and 40 mg TID for a weight of 20 kg and above. Under the low dose regimen (10/20 mg TID), a 
small fraction would not exceed the threshold based on the EC90 derived from the PK/PD model, while 
under high dose regimen (20/40 mg TID) nearly all subjects would exceed the target concentration. 
Dosing Recommendation Based on Clinical Pharmacology Data 
A population PK and PK/PD analysis was applied to the data from Study A1481131 (and A1481140 for 
PK).  The  maximum  CL/F  estimated  in  this  combined  analysis  of  57.8  L/h  is  consistent  with  the 
previously reported value of 50.9 L/h obtained in adults (A1481140 population PK report). 
Figure 3: Relation Between Body weight and Cav,ss for Each Dose Strategy 
Black  line  shows  90%PI 
and  the  red  line  shows 
the population mean.  The 
pink dotted line expresses 
the  expected  EC90  (point 
estimation 
without 
uncertainty)  as  derived  in 
the  section  of  PK/PD 
analysis.  
Using a dose of 10 mg TID for children up to 20 kg and 20 mg TID above 20 kg, a 90% PI of Cav,ss 
would result as depicted on the left panel of Figure 3. With this strategy almost 90% of patients would 
achieve Cav,ss equivalent to EC90. However, as depicted by the right panel, when a dose of 20 mg TID 
up to 20 kg and 40 mg TID above 20 kg is used the 90% PI of Cav,ss would result. With this dosing 
regimen almost all patients would achieve an exposure over EC90.

Figure 4  shows  the  responder  rate  for  an  increase  in  pVO2  of  over  10%.    Over  43%  would  be 
responders  at  20  mg  TID  and  over  48%  at  40  mg  TID  and  above.  The  right  panel  shows  the 
probabilities  normalised  on  maximum  responder  fraction  for  each  dose  strategy.  The  responder  ratio 
with 10/20 mg TID reaches 87% of the maximum ratio, which is achieved with 20/40 mg TID. 
Figure 4: Success rate across dose & weight assuming an individual response at an improvement in pVO2 of more 
than  10%  for  each  dose  group  (left  panel)  and  dose  strategy  (right  panel,  normalised  on  maximum  responder 
fraction) 
The  fraction  of  responders  above  the  10%  threshold  is  given  for  all  dose  groups  across  the  weight 
range  of  10  to  80  kg  on  the  left  panel  of  Figure 4.    Normalising  the  probabilities  for  the  2  dose 
regimens (10/20 mg or 20/40 mg TID) on the maximally achievable responder fraction is shown on the 
right panel. In summary at 20/40 mg TID, a close to maximum responder ratio is achieved, while 87% 
of the maximum responder ratio is achieved on 10/20 mg TID. 
With 10/20  mg TID dosage, the upper limit of 90% PI for Cav,ss is less than 4 fold greater than the 
efficacious exposure (EC90).  However, with 20/40 mg TID, the upper limit is more than 8 fold greater 
than EC90 and 5% of patients are expected to achieve Cav,ss of more than 8 times the EC90, although 
no significant exposure-safety relationship has been found so far.   
Therefore, based on the PK/PD analysis, the recommended dosing regimen in children is 10 mg TID for 
children weighing less than 20 kg and 20 mg TID for children weighing 20 kg or more. 
1.4.2.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
From  the  analysis  of  the  PK  profile  of  sildenafil  in  patients  involved  in  the  paediatric  clinical  trial 
A1481131,  body  weight  was  shown  to  be  a  good  predictor  of  drug  exposure  in  children.  Sildenafil 
plasma concentration half-life values were estimated to range from 4.2 to 4.4 hours for a range of 10 
to 70 kg of body weight. Cmax after a single 20 mg sildenafil dose administered PO was estimated at 
49,  104  and  165 ng/ml  for  70,  20  and  10 kg  patients,  respectively.  Cmax  after  a  single  10 mg 
sildenafil dose administered PO was estimated at 24, 53 and 85 ng/ml for 70, 20 and 10 kg patients, 
respectively.  Tmax  was  estimated  at  approximately  1 hour  and  was  almost  independent  from  body 
weight. The values for Tmax and half-life obtained in children are similar to those in adults (in adults, 
Tmax is 60 minutes and half-life is 3-5 h at steady state). 
In children above 45 kg, a 10 mg TID dose was considered a “low-dose”, but it is probably a “medium” 
dose; a dose of 40 mg TID dose (medium) is probably a high dose (2-fold dose compared to the 20 mg 
TID  dose  used  in  adults)  and  the  high  dose  (80  mg  TID)  is  probably  a  very  high  dose  (3-fold  dose 
compared to adults). This may have been resulted in an overexposure in children treated with sildenafil.  
The  Applicant  considered  that  a  dose  of  10  mg  TID  should  be  administered  to  children  weighing  less 
than 20 kg and that 20 mg TID should be administered to children weighing 20 kg or more. However 
the  rationale  for  dose  recommendation  in  children  should  be  ultimately  based  on  efficacy  and  safety 
data from study A1481131 and is further discussed in the report (low, intermediate and high sildenafil 
dose) in the efficacy and safety section.

The oral bioavailability of the 20 mg tablets is approximately 41%. In study A1481131, children unable 
to swallow the tablets received a powder obtained with a tablet crusher, mixed with 5 mL spoonful of 
soft  food  for  immediate  use.  The  “formulation”  intended  for  authorisation  is  an  oral  suspension 
formulation  which  is  extemporaneously  prepared  by  a  pharmacist  from  the  20  mg  tablet  using  Ora-
Sweet and Ora-Plus diluents to reach a concentration of 10 mg/ml.  
The  applicant  has  shown that  there  are  minor  differences  in  relative  bioavailability  among  the  10  mg 
tablet  strength  and  the  other  strengths  that  are  likely  due  to  nonlinearity  of  PK  of  sildenafil.  In  any 
case, these differences are not considered to be of clinical significance. 
It is important to highlight that the suspension for extemporaneous formulation is an interim measure 
temporally  accepted.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  develop  a  suitable  age  appropriate  formulation  in  a 
form of a powder for oral suspension (POS) which is currently under development.  
1.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study supporting the efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in children with PAH is the study 
A1481131,  which  has  a long-term  extension  (study  A1481156).  There  are  two  additional  supportive 
studies  (A1481134  and  A1481157)  with  intravenous  sildenafil  that  were  already  included  in  the 
intravenous Revatio submission and previously assessed, therefore not further described here.  
1.5.1.  Main study – Study A1481131 
1.5.1.1.  Methodology  
This  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  multi-center,  placebo  controlled  parallel  group,  dose  ranging 
study  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH  aged  1  to  17  years  with  body  weight  ≥  8  kg.  The  study  lasted 
from 2003-2008. 
Recruited  patients  included  primary  PAH  and  secondary  PAH  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-
pulmonary  shunts  with  a  baseline  resting  room  air  oxygen  saturation  (SaO2)  ≥88  or  with  d-
transposition of the great arteries repaired within the first 30 days of life; patients who had undergone 
surgical  repair  of  other  congenital  heart  lesions  ≥6  months  prior  to  screening  and  did  not  have 
clinically significant residual left-sided heart disease consistent with the exclusion criteria, aged from 1 
to 17 years (subject to country specific protocols) and weighing ≥8 kg who had symptomatic PAH were 
also included.  
The  inclusion  criteria  did  not  specify  limitations  regarding  exercise  capacity  or  WHO  functional  class, 
the  main  requisite  being  symptomatic  PAH.  The  doses  used  are  based  on  in  vitro  PDE  inhibition.  The 
medium  dose  treatment  groups  were  calculated  to  achieve  target  sildenafil  steady-state  maximum 
concentrations of 140 ng/mL. This is the most comparable to the 113 ng/ml achieved in adults patients 
administered  the  approved  Revatio  dose  of  20  mg  TID  (Revatio  SPC).  Based  on  the  PK/PD  analysis 
(see before) this was later also decided to be the recommended dose. 
Subjects  were  excluded  from  the  study  if  they  had  PH  secondary  to  other  diseases,  left-sided  heart 
disease  and  other  similar  heart-related  diseases,  or  had  treatment  with  off-label  sildenafil,  an 
endothelin-A  receptor  antagonists  or  prostacyclin/prostacyclin  analogue  within  30  days  prior  to 
randomization,  or  who  were  taking  medications  such  as  parenteral  inotropic  medication,  parenteral 
vasodilators  within  3  months  prior  to  screening,  alpha-blockers  or  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A4 
inhibitors. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of study A1481131 was to assess the efficacy of 16 weeks of chronic treatment 
with oral sildenafil in paediatric PAH patients, aged 1 to 17 years. 
Secondary  objectives  included  assessment  of  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  pharmacokinetics  (PK/PD 
analysis), in addition to survival status of subjects who did not enter the long term extension study. 
The  choice  of  the  efficacy  endpoint  cardiopulmonary  exercise  CPX  testing  resulted  in  prolongation  of 
the recruitment period to 5 years. During this period, many developments occurred in the field of PAH 
although  still  no  drugs  are  approved  for  paediatrics.  The  use  of  a  placebo-controlled  design  in  drug 
naive paediatrics is accordingly justified.

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  percent  change  in  peak  VO2  (normalised  to  body  weight)  from 
baseline  at  Week  16  assessed  by  cardiopulmonary  exercise  CPX  testing  by  bicycle  ergometry, 
evaluated in those subjects who were developmentally able to perform the CPX test. 
The primary efficacy parameter (peak VO2) and all CPX test parameters were analysed for all subjects 
developmentally able to perform the CPX test (approximately >7 years). Subjects were assumed to be 
developmentally able if they had an adequate CPX test at any visit during the study. 
For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  the  applicant  considered  that  peak  VO2,  as  determined  by  CPX,  was 
deemed  a  more  objective  method  for  accurate  assessment  of  exercise  capacity  in  children  as  it  was 
reasoned that children would be unable to perform the 6MWD consistently and reproducibly, and that 
their cooperation and motivation may vary. 
CPX testing is a comprehensive exercise test that measures cardiopulmonary performance at rest and 
during  exercise.  The  reduction  in  peak  VO2  reflects  the  blunting  of  increases  in  cardiac  output  and 
perfusion of the pulmonary vascular bed during exercise, which is a key manifestation of the disease. 
As such these measures can be used to track the physiological responses to treatment of the disease 
and  small  open  label  studies  have  demonstrated  improvements  in  CPX  following  treatment  with 
sildenafil  (Hoeper  et  al,  2004;  Oudiz  et  al.,  2007).  CPX  testing  was  standardised  across  centers  with 
the  provision  of  standard  equipment  and  training  to  the  technicians.  The  cycle  ergometry  protocol 
imposed  a  progressively  increasing  workload  on  the  subject  until  the  limit  of  their  tolerance  was 
reached. Data were collected and sent to a core laboratory for interpretation. If the test was deemed 
inadequate  by  the  core  laboratory  (eg,  endpoint  could  not  be  determined),  the  subject  was  asked  to 
repeat the test on the same day, no less than 4 hours apart.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included invasive haemodynamic measurements for all the patients, WHO 
functional class and Child Health Questionnaire.  
Doses administered:  
Subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  either  1  of  3  sildenafil  doses  (low,  medium  or  high)  TID,  or 
placebo.  The  randomisation  was  stratified  according  to  weight  group  and  developmental  ability  to 
perform  cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing  (table  5).  Target  plasma  concentrations  of  sildenafil  were 
selected based on in vitro PDE5 inhibition data. Sildenafil dose levels were then selected based on body 
weight such that target plasma concentrations would be achieved at steady state: 
- Patients in the low weight stratum (≥8-20 kg) were randomised in a 1:2:1 ratio to receive sildenafil 
medium or high doses, or placebo. Modeling of the plasma concentrations for each dose level showed 
that the low and medium doses were predicted to be similar for the 8 to 20 kg subjects (ie, subjects 
would receive the same dose because of the available tablet strengths); consequently there was no low 
dose for this weight strata. 
- Patients in the medium (>20-45 kg) and high (>45 kg) weight strata were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 
ratio to receive sildenafil low, medium or high doses, or placebo. 
For  subjects  able  to  swallow  tablets,  1  tablet  of  sildenafil  (10,  20,  40  or  80  mg)  or  placebo  was 
administered. For subjects unable to swallow tablets, tablets were crushed and mixed with a small (5 
mL) spoonful of soft food, and the entire food portion was consumed immediately.

a Modeling of the plasma concentrations for each dose level showed that the low and medium doses were predicted 
to be similar for the 8 to 20 kg subjects (ie, subjects would receive the same dose because of the available tablet

Sample size:  
There was only minimal guidance available from the literature to assist in sample size determination. 
Several assumptions were made and sample size estimation was revised several times. Originally, the 
following assumptions were made:   
- Subjects in the placebo group would have a 5% worsening in their exercise capacity as measured by 
the percent change from baseline in peak VO2; 
- Subjects in the highest sildenafil dose group would have a 15% improvement in exercise capacity as 
measured by the percent change from baseline in peak VO2; 
-The common standard deviation was assumed to be 27%.  
Due to the limited data on the variability of the primary endpoint, an interim sample size re-estimation 
was planned in the protocol. It was decided during the study that the primary analysis would compare 
the combined sildenafil dose groups to placebo (though the ratio of sildenafil to placebo subjects would 
remain  3:1);  subjects  in  the  sildenafil  combined  group  would  have  a  10%  improvement  in  exercise 
capacity as measured by the percent change from baseline in peak VO2. Three further re-estimations 
were  performed  throughout  the  study  to  adjust  for  the  large  discrepancy  between  the  assumed  and 
the observed variability (17.4%; 20.2% and 18.8% instead of 27%). Ultimately the sample size of 104 
evaluable patients was calculated to be sufficient to yield the power specified in the protocol. 
Statistical methods:  
The  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  using  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  in  which  the  response 
(defined  as  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  peak  VO2  at  Week  16)  in  the  3  sildenafil  treatment 
groups  (low,  medium  and  high  dose)  was  contrasted  to  that  in  the  placebo  group  (with  contrast 
coefficients  1/3,  1/3,  1/3  and  -1).  Comparisons  of  the  individual  dose  groups  to  the  placebo  group 
were also made. The ANCOVA model included terms for treatment, baseline peak VO2, aetiology and 
weight group. Center was not included as a covariate due to the small number of subjects anticipated 
at each center (in accordance with ICH E9). Statistical hypothesis testing was performed at the 2-sided 
5% significance level. The above analysis was performed for all subjects in the ITT population with a 
Week 16/End of treatment (EOT) measurement. 
1.5.1.2.  Study results 
Of the 324 subjects screened, 235 subjects were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups (Table 6) and 
234 subjects were treated (and hence included in the ITT population). Of the 234 subjects, a total of 
115 were developmentally able to perform CTX. A total of 228 subjects completed the study, of which 
220 subjects entered the long-term extension Study A1481156. 
Table 6: Subject Disposition in Study A1481131 
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  each  age  and  ability  subgroup  was  uneven  over  the  treatment  groups 
(table  7).  This  imbalance  was  predominantly  due  to  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  subjects  <7  years 
weighed between 8 and 20 kg and no subjects with weight ≤20 kg were randomised to the sildenafil 
low  dose  group  and  proportionally  more  of  these  subjects  were  randomised  to  the  sildenafil  high 
treatment group than to the other treatment groups.

Primary diagnoses were similar for all treatment groups with approximately a third of subjects having 
primary PAH (Table 9). The mean durations since first diagnosis for subjects with secondary PAH (5.1 
to 7.5 years) were generally greater than those for subjects with primary PAH (1.1 to 2.2 years). Only 
1 subject (in the placebo group) had duration since first diagnosis of primary PAH longer than 10 years.

  Main efficacy results 
a) Peak V02 
There  were  mean  increases  in  peak  VO2  percentage  change  from  baseline  with  all  3  sildenafil  dose 
groups  (table  11;  fig  5)  with  little  change  with  placebo  (0.53%).  In  the  primary  analysis,  which 
adjusted for baseline peak VO2, aetiology and weight group, the increase in percentage change in peak 
VO2  on  sildenafil  (combined  sildenafil  groups)  compared  to  placebo  was  7.71%  (95%  CI:  -0.19%  to 
15.60%; p-value =0.056).  
While  the  reduced  effect  with  the  low  dose  sildenafil  group  was  useful  with  respect  to  making  dose 
recommendations,  the  lack  of  treatment  effect  in  this  group  diminished  the  effect  of  the  sildenafil 
combined group versus placebo leading to the overall borderline non-significance.

Figure 5: Treatment Difference in Percentage Change from Baseline in Peak VO2 at Week 16: Mean and 95% CI ITT 
Based on etiology, a better response was observed in the subgroup of primary PAH and surgical repairs 
in the mean percent change from baseline compared to placebo [12.5% (95% CI: -3.1%, 28.2% and 
9.8%  (95%  CI:  -1.7%,  21.3%)]  respectively,  unlike  the  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunt 
subgroup of a 2.0% (95% CI: -12.6%, 16.6%) (fig 6).

b) Time to Peak VO2 
The  sildenafil  combined  group  showed  a  9.24%  mean  increase  compared  to  placebo  in  percentage 
change in time to peak VO2 (95% CI: -3.05%, 21.54%; p= 0.139). 
Mean RER (ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed [VCO2/VO2]), values are consistent 
with  achievement  of  maximal  exercise  (RER  >1)  in  all  treatment  groups,  although  the  range  across 
individuals was 0.7 to 1.6, suggesting that some subjects did not reach maximum exercise. 
c) Haemodynamic Endpoints: mPAP, PVRI and Cardiac Index 
mPAP and PVRI demonstrated a dose response over the dose range. Increases from baseline in mean 
cardiac  index  were  observed  for  all  sildenafil  groups,  though  a  dose  response  was  not  as  clear.  The 
combined sildenafil showed significant changes in PVRI and CI compared to placebo (tables 12, 13 and 
14).

incidences 
Subjects  in  the  ≥7  year  developmentally  able  subgroup  (n=115)  demonstrated  dose  related 
improvements in mPAP and PVRI which were associated with increases in Cardiac Index. The combined 
sildenafil group, in comparison to placebo, was statistically significant for all endpoints. Mean changes 
from baseline in the <7 years of age subgroup (n=63), in comparison to placebo, were small in mPAP, 
PVRI  and  Cardiac  Index.  This  may  be  due  in  part  to  the  fact  that  subjects  in  the  <7  years  of  age 
subgroup had lower mean mPAP and PVRI values at baseline than the other subgroups and for Cardiac 
Index, mean baseline values were generally higher. As there were only 2 evaluable subjects in the low 
dose group with this subgroup only the medium and high dose groups are potentially interpretable. 
These  improvements  in  haemodynamic  parameters  (Table  15)  are  consistent  with  those  seen  in  the 
adult PAH sildenafil pivotal study (study A1481140). 
Table 15: Mean Changes from Baseline in Haemodynamics 
No  clear  relationship  to  the  sub-etiology  was  observed  in  the  haemodynamic  parameters  i.e  patients 
with congenital heart disease showed comparable improvements.  
The  applicant  submitted  several  analyses  that  could  explain  the  better  results  of  Revatio  in  primary 
PAH compared to the secondary forms. The sub-analysis involved very few patients, which complicate 
their interpretation. In general, it can be observed that recruited patients with primary PAH might have 
EMA/482372/2011

suffered  from  more  severe  disease,  indicated  by  worse  haemodynamic  data  and  FC;  such  patients 
usually show better response. Another possible reason could be the inclusion of a higher proportion of 
patients  with  Down  syndrome  in  the  secondary  forms.  These  patients  may  be  less  responsive  to 
vasodilator therapy. In an analysis excluding patients with Down’s syndrome from the secondary forms, 
results  of  PVRI  and  CI  appear  comparable  for  both  primary  and  secondary  aetiologies.  Regarding  the 
worse haemodynamic response in general, this could be attributed to inclusion of patients with Down 
syndrome  who  may  be  less  responsive  to  vasodilator  therapy.  Haemodynamic  effect  in  non-
developmentally able subjects who did not have Down syndrome was comparable to the effect shown 
in developmentally subjects irrespective of age. 
In  conclusion,  the  explanations  are  plausible.  However  no  robust  conclusions  can  be  made  regarding 
possible different efficacy based on aetiology due to the limited number of patients. 
e) Changes from baseline in WHO Class  
Overall  32.6%,  51.7%,  15.2%  and  0.4%  of  subjects  had  WHO  Class  I,  II,  III  and  IV  respectively  at 
baseline.  The  weighting  towards  Class  I  was  highest  in  the  placebo  group.  The  data  suggest  a  dose 
response with changes in functional class, with odds ratios for the sildenafil low, medium and high dose 
groups compared to placebo of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.18, 2.01), 2.25 (95% CI: 0.75, 6.69) and 4.52 (95% 
CI: 1.56, 13.10), respectively (table 16).

1.5.1.3.  Discussion on efficacy results 
Choice of primary end points  
In  the  developmentally  able  children  (mostly  above  7  years),  the  primary  efficacy  results  showed  a 
borderline non-significant increase in peak  VO2 of the combined sildenafil group compared to placebo 
(7.7% CI: -0.19- 15.6; p=0.056). Several issues could have influenced the results. CPX may not have 
been  a  good  choice  as  a  primary  endpoint.  Differences  in  center  training  are  important  factors  that 
could impact the results. Considering that 32 centers contributed to the current paediatric trial, it is not 
feasible  to  request  analysis  by  center.  Recruiting  patients  in  less  severe  forms  i.e  WHO  I  could  have 
also  influenced  the  results  as  these  patients  are  already  known  to  exhibit  lesser  improvements  in 
exercise capacity compared to the more severe forms.  
However,  the  improvement  seen  in  VO2  can  be  considered  numerically  in  line  with  another  study 
performed in children, but in a different indication (Moalla at al., 2005). Focusing on the medium dose 
which is  the  currently  advocated  dose  by  the  MAH,  it  is  agreed  that  the  results  of  this  group  are  the 
best ones.  
Haemodynamic  parameters  are  considered  by  some  experts  to  be  the  appropriate  primary  endpoints 
for paediatric studies, considering the difficulty in performing exercise tests.  
EMA/482372/2011

Upon  CHMP  request,  additional  data  provided  in  the  group  of  children  who  could  exercise  showed 
modest  correlations  between  PVRI/CI/FC/physician  global  assessment  and  VO2.  However  the  results 
are in line with the adult pivotal study which is reassuring regarding clinical relevance of the results.  
The applicant pointed out several points which may theoretically favor the use of CPET over 6MWT in 
children.  Results  of  CPET  are  expected  to  give  a  broader  assessment  of  the  patient  than  those  of  6-
MWT.  However  the  6-MWT  is  more  widely  used  in  PAH  probably  because  of  its  convenience  and 
consequently no PAH drug has been approved based on CPET results. In one of the pivotal studies of 
the  sitaxentan  initial  application  both  tests  were  performed.  Sitaxentan  showed  significant 
improvement  using  the  6MWT  while  results  of  CPET  were  equivocal.  The  question  remains  about  this 
disparity  of  the  results  for  which  the  most  relevant  explanation  given  at  that  time  was  the  improper 
training  in  the  performance  of  CPET  of  some  centers.  This  issue  can  not  be  excluded  either  in  this 
application.  
Study results  
Children above 7 years  
The  results  in  the  paediatric  study  show  a  positive  trend  for  improvement  in  exercise  capacity, 
generally accompanied with improvements in other endpoints, mainly the haemodynamic parameters.  
Results  are  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  adult  studies,  indicating  a  significant  clinical 
improvement  (analysis  shows  equivalent  exercise  response  in  adults  (6MWT)  and  paediatrics  (CPET) 
compared to placebo). 
Children below 7 years 
It  is  recognized  that  exercise  testing  in  children  below  7  years  is  problematic  and  there  is  some 
understanding  that  in  this  age  category,  haemodynamic  data  may  be  the  only  available  proof  of 
efficacy.  In  the  present  study,  no  significant  haemodynamic  improvements  was  shown  in  terms  of 
absolute  differences    in  children  below  7  years,  but  the  data  were  found  to  be  skewed  and  baseline 
differences  should  be  taken  into  account.  A  difference  in  the  efficacy  of  sildenafil  is  not  foreseen 
between  patients  above  and  below  7  years,  except  when  this  is  confounded  by  difference  in  disease 
stage.  Younger  patients  may  present  less  advanced  disease  as  manifested  by  better  preserved 
haemodynamics  compared  to  the  older  group.  The  number  of  patients  below  7  years  administered 
sildenafil is limited (n=35) in the present application. 
At recruitment, haemodynamic parameters were better in patients <7 years, PVRI: 12.3 compared to 
20.7  wood  units.m2 in  patients  ≥  7  years;  CI:  4.2  L·m2/min  versus  3.2  L·m2/min;  mPAP  54.2  mmHg 
versus  64.7  mmHg.  This  may  partly  explain  the  lack  of  significant  effect  in  the  lower  age  group.  To 
assess  the  differences  in  treatment  effect  sizes  across  populations,  baseline  was  used  as  a  covariate  
and  the  resulting  performed  analysis  (including  baseline  as  a  covariate)  showed  that  effects  on  PVRI 
and CI were consistent in the 2 populations (<7 and ≥7 years). With the medium dose, PVRI (ratio to 
placebo) was 0.77 compared to 0.83 respectively and CI (ratio to placebo) was 1.06 compared to 1.04 
for 7 and ≥7 years respectively.  
The  changes  in  mPAP  are  not  comparable  between  the  groups,  and  no  dose  response  is  shown  in 
patients younger than 7 years. It is recognized that both PVR and CI constitute more sensitive indices 
for response of treatment.  
Based  on  the  above,  it  can  be  accepted  that  the  efficacy  of  Revatio  was  also  shown  in  patients  <7 
years. This is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
WHO functional class  
Regarding WHO functional class, a dose response in improvement in WHO Functional class (FC) could 
be observed. The results are supportive to the general efficacy data. 
It can be agreed with the applicant that the evidence based recommendations of the ESC guideline are 
limited by the availability of data from randomised clinical trials. There are many similarities between 
the adult and paediatric forms of PAH, but patient presentation may be different. Exercise intolerance 
and  fatigue  frequent  symptoms  in  adults  may  be  less  manifest  in  children,  who  present  with  more 
severe  symptoms  like  syncope  or  pre  syncope.  This  is  however,  accompanied  with  preserved  right 
ventricular function and better haemodynamics.  
The rate of deterioration in children is also faster than in adults. Without treatment, estimated median 
survival  after  diagnosis  of  patients  with  iPAH  is  reported  to  be  0.8  years  in  children  compared  to  2.8 
years in adult. These issues probably prompt earlier intervention with specific PAH therapies, although 
this  is  not  specifically  mentioned  in  PAH  treatment  guidelines.  Also,  this  may  hinder  recruitment  of 
paediatrics in clinical trials even in the earlier stages of disease.  
The  recruited  paediatric  patients  reflect  the  recruitment  criteria  in  clinical  practice  according  to  one 
database  (Barst  et  al.,  2009).  However,  according  to  a  Dutch  registry  (van  Loon  et  al.,  2010)  and  a 
Swiss registry (Fasnacht et al 2007) for paediatric PAH patients, the diagnosis of paediatric patients in 
Functional Class I is rare (2% and zero respectively). Data stratified by FC show inconsistent VO2 peak

values  and  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  considering  the  small  number  of  patients. 
Generally,  the  result  show  that  patients  with  severe  FC  groups  have  the  most  benefit,  as  could  be 
expected. Haemodynamic data show that improvements in both PVRI and CI in patients with FC I are 
comparable  in  magnitude  to  those  seen  in  FC  II-IV  when  medium  or  high  doses  of  sildenafil  are 
administered. It was not considered feasible to include FC in the paediatric indication, considering that 
there are no clear treatment recommendations for patients in FC I. This choice was also taken to avoid 
a  complicated  wording  of  the  indication  considering  that  different  endpoints  were  investigated  in 
different age groups, and that FC is essentially applicable in the developmentally able patients. Still, a 
description  of  the  number  and  percent  of  children  included  in  study  A1481131  by  functional  class  at 
baseline is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Regional differences 
The study was conducted in 32 centres from 16 different countries. Given that management of PAH in 
children may differ depending on the geographic region, the applicant provided additional information 
by country and geographic region (US, European Union and rest of the world) for the main efficacy and 
safety  results.  Differences  in  medical  practice  between  the  16  participating  centers  throughout  the  5 
years can not be excluded. However importantly, no PAH specific therapy was allowed.  
For  VO2  peak,  it  is  difficult  to  comment  on  the  results  considering  the  very  low  numbers.  For  the 
presented  haemodynamic  data,  some  dose  response  relation  can  be  observed,  however  again  the 
numbers are too low to draw definite conclusions. 
The  applicant  submitted  the  number  and  nature  of  the  patient’s  subgroup:  secondary  PAH  with 
congenital  systemic  to  pulmonary  shunt.  In  many  cases  the  shunt  was  categorized  “other”  or  “shunt 
not  specified  or  not  recorded”  as  according  to  the  applicant  this  information  was  not  required  to  be 
collected. 
Concomitant medications:  
TTSpecific therapy for PAH (eg, bosentan, NO donors or prostacyclins) was prohibited during the study. 
The use of non-specific background therapy to treat hypertension (including calcium channel blockers), 
diuretics,  ACEi,  digoxin, beta-blockers  or  warfarin  were  permitted  but  not  very  frequently  used, 
according to the data provided. Most children were not in an advanced stage of the PAH disease in the 
study  and  the  use  of  concomitant  therapies  was  balanced  between  groups.  Therefore,  an  effect  of 
concomitant medications of study results can be reasonably excluded.  
A paragraph is included in the description of the study in section 5.1 of the SPC regarding the "naive" 
nature  of  children  recruited  into  the  study  with  respect  to  specific  PAH  therapies  (i.e.  endothelin-A 
receptor antagonists, NO donors or prostacyclins). 
1.5.2.  Study A1481156- Extension to A1481131 
1.5.2.1.  Methodology 
This was a multi-center, long-term extension study including subjects who completed study A1481131. 
To  prevent  un-blinding  in  study  A1481131,  subjects  received  the  different  doses  of  sildenafil  in  a 
blinded phase until study A1481131 was un-blinded (02 August 2008), after which subjects were also 
un-blinded  to  treatment  in  study  A1481156.  Subjects  randomised  to  receive  sildenafil  in  study 
A1481131,  who  consented  to  participate  in  this  extension  study,  were  maintained  on  their  A1481131 
sildenafil dose. Subjects in the A1481131 placebo  group were stratified by their weight prior to entry 
into  Study  A1481156  (≥8-20  kg,  >20-45  kg,  >45  kg),  to  ensure  a  balance  across  treatment  groups 
with  respect  to  this  factor  and  randomised  to  receive  1  of  the  3  doses  of  sildenafil.  Subjects  were 
randomly assigned to treatment groups according to the following schedule: 
- Subjects in the low weight stratum (≥8-20 kg) were assigned to sildenafil medium dose, or sildenafil 
high  dose  in  a  1:2  ratio  (sildenafil  medium  dose:sildenafil  high  dose),  according  to  the  schedule  in 
Table 2. 
- Subjects in the medium (>20-45 kg) and high (>45 kg) weight strata were assigned to sildenafil low 
dose, sildenafil medium dose, or sildenafil high dose in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
The  placebo  patients  were  randomised  to  blinded  doses  of  sildenafil  following  completion  of  the  16 
week  treatment  period  in  Study  A1481131  and  therefore  at  1  year  had  received  36  weeks  of  active 
treatment. This study is currently ongoing. 
The primary  objective of Study A1481156 was to assess the safety and tolerability of oral sildenafil 
in  the  chronic  treatment  of  paediatric  subjects  with  PAH.  The  secondary  objective  was  to  describe 
long-term (≥1 year) efficacy of oral sildenafil in these subjects.

In addition to the Week 8 and Week 16 CPX tests in Study A1481131 a further CPX test was performed 
for developmentally able subjects at Week 36 (Week 52 following randomisation in study A1481131). 
Other  endpoints  included  WHO  functional  class,  patients  assessments  and  change  in  background 
therapy.    All  randomised  and  treated  subjects  in  Study  A1481131  (placebo  or  sildenafil)  were  also 
included, where appropriate, in survival analyses, including data of post-discontinuation survival status 
where  available.  The  statistical  methods  for  the  analysis  of  efficacy  data  mainly  comprised  of  simple 
descriptive summaries and estimated treatment group differences (with 95% CIs) for each parameter. 
1.5.2.2.  Results 
Of the 228 subjects who completed Study A1481131, 220 entered the extension Study A1481156 and 
55 placebo subjects from Study A1481131 were allocated to low (13 subjects), medium (19 subjects) 
and  high  (23  subjects)  dose  sildenafil.  As  of  this  data-cut  (15  May  2009)  206  patients  (94%)  have 
received ≥1 year of therapy (from the start of Study A1481131), 129 (59%) have received ≥2 years of 
therapy  and  88  (20%)  have  received  ≥3  years  of  therapy  within  Study  A1481131/A1481156.  Across 
Studies A1481131 and A1481156, duration of treatment for individual subjects currently ranges from 
3-1815 days. The baseline demographic characteristics are presented in table 17. 
Table 17: Patient Demography by A1481156 Treatment Group 
By this data cut-off, just over two-thirds of subjects were still ongoing (159/234 subjects, 67.9%) and 
just  under  one-third  of  subjects  had  discontinued  (75/234  subjects,  32.1%).  The  percentage  of 
discontinuations  was  similar  for  all  weight  subgroups  (around  30%)  (table  16,  in  safety).  A  greater 
proportion  of  primary  PAH  subjects  withdrew  (30/77  subjects,  39.0%)  compared  to  subjects  with 
secondary  PAH  (21/68  subjects  [30.9%]  for  surgical  repair,  19/84  subjects  [22.6%]  for  congenital 
systemic-to-pulmonary  shunt).  Of  the  15  withdrawals  due  to  death,  10  subjects  had  primary  PAH 
(13.0% of the primary PAH subjects). 
Main efficacy results 
a) PeakV02 
Increases  in  mean  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  peak  VO2  at  Year  1  were  observed  for  all 
sildenafil  treatment  groups  (maximum  percentage  change  of  11.2%  in  the  sildenafil  low  dose  group 
(Table 18). For the sildenafil low, medium, and high dose groups, improvements >10% at Year 1 were 
similar across treatment groups: 15/38 subjects (39.5%), 12/36 subjects (33.3%), and 13/40 subjects 
(32.5%). The low dose group showed a greater proportion of subjects improving between 0%-10% at 
1  year  (28.9%)  compared  to  the  medium  (11.1%)  and  high  (17.5%)  dose  groups.  Hence  no 
deterioration (ie, no change or some improvement) was observed for 26/38 subjects (68.4%), 16/36 
subjects  (44.4%),  and  20/40  subjects  (50.0%),  in  the  low,  medium,  and  high  dose  groups, 
respectively.  A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  had  discontinued,  died  or  had  missing  values  at  Year  1 
across the three groups (approximately 11%-13%). It is important to highlight that these data should 
be interpreted with caution as all discontinuations and missing values were taken as deteriorations and 
hence values are possibly biased.

Improvements  at  Year  1  from  baseline,  with  the  low  dose  group  were  observed  with  both  those 
subjects who were randomised to the low dose in Study A1481131 and those who received placebo in 
Study  A1481131  and  then  received  low  dose  in  Study  A1481156.  Improvements  at  Year  1  from 
baseline were also seen for the medium and high dose groups. Subjects who received placebo in Study 
A1481131,  and  then  went  on  to  receive  medium  or  high  dose  in  Study  A1481156  showed  mean 
deteriorations from baseline at Year 1 (table 19 and fig 8).

The percentage of subjects showing maintenance (no change or improvement) was generally similar

50.0% in Year 3, for the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively.

c) Survival Status 
The  investigation  of  time  to  death  included  the  234  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
medication  in  Study  A1481131.  The  analysis  included  post-treatment  survival  follow-up  data  from 
subjects  who  discontinued  study  treatment.  Time  to  death  was  taken  relative  to  either  the  start  of 
sildenafil treatment or from the start of Study A1481131, and was censored on the last day on which 
the subject was known to be alive. Across all dose groups, the probability of survival at Year 1, Year 2 
and Year 3, relative to Day 1 of active therapy (derived from the life table estimates of deaths), was 
99.6%,  94.8%,  and  90.2%,  respectively.  However,  these  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  as 
subjects  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  were  censored  at  the  last  date  they  were  known  to  be  alive.  If 
their  survival  was  worse  than  those  for  whom  survival  is  still  being  assessed  then  the  survival 
estimates above will be upwardly biased. 
1.5.2.3.  Discussion 
Most  of  the  patients  who  finished  A1481131  (n=228)  were  recruited  in its long  term  extension  study 
A1481156 (n=220), which is still ongoing. The cut-off date of the presented data is 15 May 2009. The 
study  is  open  label  and  not  controlled  limiting  its  value  for  interpretation  of  efficacy,  but  can  still  be 
helpful in providing data on maintenance of efficacy.  
Increases  in  peak  VO2  are  observed  at  one  year  ranging  from  2.56%  to  11.19%.  Time  to  maximum 
peak VO2 was also increased ranging from 3.74% to 24.43, however with an inverse dose response in 
both cases.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  inverse  dose  response  for  peak  VO2  and  time  to  peak  VO2  was  not 
significantly different. The applicant explored several factors that could explain such an observation e.g 
evaluable  population,  baseline  demographics  and  baseline  severity.  A  possible  influence  of  either  the 
evaluable population or their baseline severity could be excluded. Younger patients were administered 
the lower dose however, using the age as covariate, there was still a difference between doses. Using 
other parameters of efficacy (WHO, FC and physician global assessment questionnaire) did not indicate 
the same direction of results. In summary, in the long term study, there was an unexplained trend for 
better VO2 results with lower doses however this did not correlate with other efficacy assessments. 
Patients  originally  randomised  to  placebo  in  the  short  term  placebo-controlled  study  A1481131  kept 
exhibiting lower  VO2  than  those  originally  randomised  to  active  treatment  during  the  follow  up in  the 
long term extension study. This is in line with the observations of the adult studies. 
According to the MAH, the overall efficacy data generated from studies A1481131 and A1481156 show 
that administration of Revatio is associated with improvements in clinical endpoints that are relevant to 
the  treatment  of  PAH,  including  exercise  capacity,  pulmonary  haemodynamics  and  WHO  functional 
class. The consistency of these effects with specific reference to exercise capacity and haemodynamics 
is illustrated in figure 9.

The  applicant  was  also  requested  to  present  an  analysis  of  time  to  clinical  worsening  (TTCW).  Four 
different  definitions  of  time  to  clinical  worsening  (TTCW)  (frequency  of  patients  experiencing  first 
event)  were  investigated  post-hoc,  of  which  definition  2  (Death  and/or  heart/lung  transplant  and/or 
SAE  associated  with  disease  progression  and/or  addition  of  PAH  specific  therapy  and/or 
discontinuations due to an adverse event associated with disease progression/death; data censored at 
time  of  discontinuation;  ‘ordinary’  discontinuations  not  counted  as  events;  sildenafil  up-titrations 
excluded as events) was most similar to that used in study A1481131.  
With  this  definition,  the  highest  hazard  ratio  comparing  the  high  and  low  dose  groups  was  1.59 
(95%CI:  0.70  to  3.63),  compared  to  1.28  (95%CI:  0.64  to  2.58)  in  the  high-  and  medium-dose 
groups.  Based  on  this  post-hoc  analysis  of  TTCW  events,  there  is  no  compelling  evidence  that  the 
higher doses of sildenafil, relative to lower doses, are related to a beneficial effect in the TTCW. 
1.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main study in the current application study A1481131 is the largest placebo-controlled paediatric 
study  conducted  so  far,  recruiting  around  230  drug-naive  patients  and  lasting  5  years.  The  efforts  of 
the company are acknowledged.  
Several critical issues have been raised during the initial assessment of this application. The choice of 
CPET  as  a  measure  of  exercise  capacity  in  PAH  clinical  studies  has  always  been  problematic. 
Theoretically,  CPET  can  give  more  broad  information  about  the  patients  exercise  capacity  than  the 
6MWT, however the 6MWT is easier to use and is accordingly more popular in clinical trials. The clinical 
significance  of  the  results  of  the  CPET  is  also  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  limited  experience.  The 
results of CPET in this paediatric study do show a positive trend for improvement in exercise capacity, 
of  unclear  significance.  They  were  generally  accompanied  with  improvements  in  other  endpoints  as 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 32/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
well,  mainly  the  haemodynamic  parameters  which  are  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  adult 
studies. For the group of children who could exercise, modest but significant correlations were shown 
between PVRI/CI/Functional class/Physician global assessment and VO2. The same modest correlations 
were also shown in the pivotal adult study, which is reassuring.  
Another  issue  is  the  recruitment  of  patients  in  functional  class  WHO  I  (32.6%).  Paediatric  treatment 
guidelines  usually  follow  those  of  the  adult  guidelines,  due  to  the  similarities  in  the  disease,  though 
patient  presentation  may  be  different.  The  rate  of  deterioration  in  children  is  also  faster.  This  may 
justify earlier intervention, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the guidelines. Data stratified by 
FC  show  inconsistent  VO2  peak  values,  but  it  can  be  generally  seen  that  patients  with  severe  FC 
groups  have  the  most  benefit,  as  could  be  expected.  Haemodynamic  data  show  that  there  are 
improvements in both PVRI and CI in patients with FC I comparable in magnitude to that seen in FCII-
IV when medium or high doses of sildenafil are administered. These results could justify their inclusion. 
Importantly,  analysis  of  patients  in  WHO  II/III,  who  are  the  target  group  show  appropriate 
haemodynamic responses. 
Another major issue was the efficacy in children below 7 years. In this patient group, haemodynamic 
results  appeared  equivocal.  A  difference  in  the  efficacy  of  sildenafil  is  not  foreseen  between  patients 
above  and  below  7  years,  however  further  analysis  was  requested.  The  responses  of  the  applicant 
show that at recruitment, haemodynamic parameters were better in patients <7 years. This may partly 
explain  the  lack  of  significant  effect  in  the  lower  age  group.  Further  analysis  (including  baseline  as  a 
co-variety) shows that effects on PVRI and CI were consistent in the 2 populations (<7 and ≥7 years). 
Based on analysis of the haemodynamic data, it can be accepted that efficacy in patients less than 7 
years was demonstrated. The limited experience in this patient group should be mentioned in the SPC. 
In  the  long  term  study,  there  was  an  unexplained trend  for  better  VO2  results  with  lower  doses,  but 
this  was  not  seen  with  other  efficacy  assessments  (WHO  FC  and  physician  global  assessment 
questionnaire). 
There was a trend for higher mortality, higher rate of SAEs and higher rate of patients with first events 
of clinical worsening with the higher sildenafil dose as compared with the lower doses in the initial and 
long-term  extension  treatment  sequence  (A1481131/A1481156),  but  a  direct  causal  relation  is  not 
made  in  any  of  the  cases.  The  data  should  be  interpreted  cautiously,  considering  the  uncontrolled 
nature of the long-term extension study, and the possible confounding by disease severity. However, 
the  overall  long-term  data  do  no  support  that  the  higher  sildenafil  doses  provide  a  significant  benefit 
over lower doses. Appropriate information has been included in sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The  proposed  dose  based  on  the  PK/PD  simulations  is  accepted.  The  medium  dose  shows  the  best 
results in exercise testing, supported by appropriate haemodynamic data against an acceptable safety 
profile. 
1.6.1.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In  the  developmentally  able  children  (mostly  above  7  years),  the  primary  efficacy  results  showed  a 
borderline non-significant increase in peak VO2 of the combined sildenafil group compared to placebo. 
Several  issues  could  have  influenced  the  results  and  were  further  investigated  and  discussed. 
Additional post hoc analyses on haemodynamic end points by age groups provided further confirmation 
of clinical relevance of the efficacy data in developmentally able children (mostly above 7 years), and 
not  developmentally  able  children  (mostly  below  7  years).  Exploratory  analyses  in  different 
subpopulations  data  suggest  that  some  beneficial  effects  on  peak  VO2  and  on  some  haemodynamic 
parameters may exist in some subgroups. 
In  conclusion,  the  overall  efficacy  data  generated  from  studies  A1481131  and  A1481156  show  that 
administration of Revatio is associated with improvements in clinical endpoints that are relevant to the 
treatment  of  PAH,  including  exercise  capacity,  pulmonary  haemodynamics  and  WHO  functional  class. 
The  consistency  of  these  effects  with specific  reference  to  exercise  capacity  and  haemodynamics  was 
further discussed and finally agreed. 
It  is  agreed  that  the  data  support  an  indication  in  children  aged  1  to  17  years  old  with  pulmonary 
arterial hypertension.  
1.7.  Clinical safety 
1.7.1.  Patient exposure 
The  safety  database  comprises  six  completed  studies,  of  which  four  were  conducted  in  the  paediatric 
population. Two studies (a controlled study A1481131 and its long-term extension A1481156, ongoing 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 33/50
  
 
 
 
 
and  presented  with  a  cut-off  date  of  15  May  2009)  were  for  oral  sildenafil  for  the  treatment  of 
paediatric PAH. The MAH refers to IV administration in paediatrics, but the focus will be on the two oral 
studies. In addition, the MAH makes reference to post marketing data, as well as to available literature. 
Study A1481131 and A1481156 combined 
The  paediatric  clinical  development  program  included  234  treated  subjects  in  the  placebo-controlled 
Study A1481131. The majority (228; 97.4%) completed 16 weeks of per protocol treatment in study 
A1481131, and 220 of these subjects continued into the extension Study A1481156. 
Sixty of the 234 treated subjects in Study A1481131 received placebo. Subjects who received placebo 
in Study A1481131 were randomly assigned to a sildenafil dose level for the long-term extension study 
A1481156.  
As  of  15  May  2009  interim  data-cut,  206  of  these  234  patients  (88%)  have  received  ≥1  year  of 
therapy  (from  the  start  of  A1481131),  129  (59%)  have  received  ≥2  years  of  therapy  and  88  (20%) 
have received ≥3 years of therapy (for the 60 placebo-treated subjects in A1481131, this includes 12 
weeks  of  placebo  treatment).  This  corresponds  to  206/234  (88.0%),  129/173  (74.6%)  and  88/133 
(66.2%) of those subjects who had the potential to reach 1, 2 and 3 years duration, respectively. 
The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  death  (15  subjects)  and  subjects  not  willing  to 
continue participation in the study (14 subjects). Seven subjects withdrew due to ‘lack of efficacy’ (3 
and 4 subjects receiving low and high dose sildenafil, respectively) and 4 subjects withdrew due to AEs 
considered to be treatment related (2 subjects in each of the low and high dose groups). 
Two subjects were reported as protocol violators due to treatment non-compliance, which was not due 
to  tolerability  issues:  all  other  subjects  received  80%-120%  of  their  prescribed  dose.  A  total  of  28 
subjects temporarily discontinued dosage for >5 days (table 20).

Sequence 
1.7.2.  Adverse Events  
The  most  common  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  URTI  (58/229  subjects,  25.3%), 
headache (53/229 subjects, 23.1%), and vomiting (52/229 subjects, 22.7%). 
For  the  all  causality  AEs,  an  apparent  dose  response  was  observed  for  some  AEs  (eg,  URTI,  nausea, 
pneumonia). None of the episodes of URTI or pneumonia were considered to be treatment-related, and 
there was no evidence of a relationship between dose and treatment-related episodes of nausea. 
The  most  common  treatment-related  AEs  TRAEs  were  headache  (30/229  subjects,  13.1%)  and 
vomiting (15/229 subjects, 6.6%). No dose response was observed. Most of these TRAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity (table 21).

AE=Adverse event a AEs that occurred in ≥3% of subjects in any treatment group 
Events  that  depend  on  self-reporting  (for  example,  headache,  upper  abdominal  pain,  and  dizziness) 
are  more  frequent  in  the  adult  population,  while  more  objective  events  such  as  URTI,  pyrexia  and 
vomiting  are  more  frequent  in  the  paediatric  population.  There  were  no  treatment-emergent  deaths 
during Study A1481131.  
When  comparing  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  paediatric  and  adult  clinical  trials  it  is  worth  noting  that  the 
incidence  of  URTI  (with  or  without  pharyngitis  and  nasopharyngitis),  bronchitis,  pyrexia and  vomiting 
are  apparently  more  frequent  among  paediatric  patients  than  in  the  adult  population.  The  MAH 
attributes  this  misbalance  to  the  fact  that  more  objective  events  (such  as  those  showing  a  higher 
incidence among paediatric patients) are more frequent in the paediatric population.  
As  requested,  the  MAH  has  included  other  URTI  terms  such  as  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  rhinitis, 
laryngitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, viral sinusitis, and viral URTI, leading to a higher number of patients in 
each  treatment  arm.  When  all  these  terms  were  included  the  incidence  of  URTI  is  still  slightly  higher

among  sildenafil  treated  patients  compared  to  placebo  (table  23)  and  it  seems  that  this  difference  is 
mainly due to a high incidence of URTI in low weight patients (table 24). 
Table 23: URTI Adverse Events in Study A1481131 
Table 24: Subjects with URTI Adverse Events in Study A1481131 by Weight Group 
A higher incidence of all causality bronchitis and pneumonia was also reported (4.6% and 2.9% in the 
combined sildenafil group vs 1.7% and 0 in the placebo group, respectively). None of these cases were 
considered  treatment  related  by  the  investigator,  and  also  a  causal  relationship  is  not  foreseen. 
However, considering that at least bronchitis is included as a common AE in the adult data, the MAH is 
requested to submit further analysis (see further discussion under RMP section)  
1.7.3.  Severe adverse events and deaths.  
Treatment  related  SAEs  (convulsion,  hypersensitivity,  stridor,  hypoxia,  ventricular  arrhythmia, 
respiratory tract infection, and unspecified death (included in the total of 23 deaths)) were reported by 
6 subjects. 
In total 23 deaths have been reported, of which 17 deaths have been reported in the safety database 
(not  including  the  2  subjects  who  died  before  they  were  randomised  into  study  A1481131).  None  of 
the deaths were considered to be treatment related by the investigator. An additional 6 deaths, none 
of which were on study treatment, were reported when subjects who discontinued were followed up for 
survival  status.  The  number  of  deaths  in  each  of  the  treatment  groups  at  the  cut-off  for  this 
submission  is  13/100  (13%)  in  the  high  dose  treatment  group,  7/74  (9%)  in  the  medium  dose 
treatment group and 3/55 (5%) in the low dose treatment group (table 25).

Table 25: Studies A1481131 and A1481156 Combined: Deaths Resulting from an On-Treatment Serious Adverse 
Events 
The  interim  results  of  the  study  A1481156  raised  concerns  about  a  possible  relationship  between 
increased  sildenafil  doses  and  decreased  survival  and  additional  data  were  therefore  provided  during 
the procedure. As of 11 October 2010, 31 deaths were reported, whether on-treatment or reported as 
part of the survival follow-up. The incidence of deaths in the high, medium and low dose groups were 
17% (17 of 100), 12% (9 of 74) and 9% (5 of 55) respectively. None of the deaths were considered to 
be treatment-related by the investigator. The majority of deaths were associated with functional class 
III or IV at baseline and primary pulmonary hypertension aetiology. After careful clinical review of the 
disease courses and causes for death, no biologically plausible explanation for the observed imbalance 
of deaths related to sildenafil dose has been found. As a precautionary measure, the higher sildenafil 
doses are not recommended in paediatrics with PAH. This information is included in section 5.1, in the 
subsection related to long-term extension data with a cross reference to section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The incidence of subjects with at least one SAE and the estimated number of subjects experiencing an 
SAE per 100 years is given below for each treatment sequence in Table 26. 
Table 26: Estimated Number of Subjects Experiencing SAEs per 100 Years Exposure by A1481131/A1481156 
Treatment Sequence – Studies A1481131 and A1481156 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 37/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The estimated number of subjects/100 years exposure experiencing an SAE in the low/low treatment 
sequence  (8.57)  is  fewer  than  the  approximately  equivalent  medium/medium  (14.33)  and  high/high 
(12.82)  treatment  sequences.  The  stratified  hazard  ratios  (CI)  by  Cox  regression  stratified  by  weight 
group  comparing  high  with  low  and  medium  with  low  are  1.71  (0.88,  3.36)  and  1.69  (0.87,  3.27) 
respectively.  As  the  confidence  intervals  both  include  1  then  one  can't  preclude  this  being  a  chance 
finding. The HR for SAEs between the high and low-dose of sildenafil (1.71) is consistent with the HR 
for  the  frequency  of  patients  experiencing  clinical  worsening  events  (1.59)  and  death  (1.9;  17%  vs. 
9%). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Dose Reductions or Temporary Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
Over  both  A1481131  and  A1481156,  31/234  subjects  (13.2%)  had  1  or  more  dose  reductions  or 
temporary discontinuation due to an AE. The AE of stridor (sildenafil high/high dose) resulted in both a 
temporary  discontinuation  and  a  subsequent  permanent  discontinuation.  For  9/234  subjects  (3.8%), 
s
uch reductions/discontinuations were due to treatment-related AE. Six of these subjects were on the 
sequence sildenafil high/high dose. 
Permanent  discontinuations.  Overall,  12  subjects  permanently  discontinued  from  Studies  A1481131 
and  A1481156  combined  due  to  AEs.  These  discontinuations  were  mainly  considered  to  be  related  to 
th
e disease under study. Adverse events that were considered related to study drug included  episodes 
of weight decreased, strid
or, dyspnoea, hypoxia, and rash macular.  
Specific Adverse Events. 
Bleeding Events.   
In study A1481131 the overall risk of bleeding events was 11.5% in the combined sildenafil arm and 
10% in the placebo arm. During Study A1481156, an additional 23 bleeding events were reported by 
20  subjects:  3  events  occurred  with  the  low-dose  [epistaxis  (1);  anemia  (1)  menorrhagia  (1)];  12 
events occurred with the medium dose [epixtasis (6); haemoptysis (2), haematemesis (1), petechiae 
(1), severe pulmonary haemorhage (1), and subdural haematoma (1)] and 8 events occurred with the 
high dose [epistaxis (4); anaemia (2), severe haemoptysis (1), and INR increased (1).  
In  summary,  twenty  subjects  (11.5%)  in  the  sildenafil  groups  combined  had  a  total  of  23  events, 
compared  with  6  subjects  (10.0%)  with  6  events  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  bleeding 
events did not increase with sildenafil dose. There  were no severe adverse events and four moderate 
adverse events (2 in the high-dose  sildenafil group and 2 in the placebo group); all other events were 
mild.  The  overa
ll  risk  of  bleeding  events  and  events  associated  with  increased  risk  of  bleeding  was 
lo
wer in the placebo-controlled paediatric PAH study A1481131 (11.5% sildenafil, 10.0% placebo) than 
that in adults.  
Ocular Events 
All-causality  AEs  related  to  the  eye  reported  in  the  placebo-controlled  study  were  reported  for  20 
subjects receiving sildenafil (11.5%) and 9 subjects (15.0%) receiving placebo. 
In
worsening from baseline. These finding
  both  studies  A1481131  and  A1481156  combined,  colour  vision  monitoring  for  5 subjects  had  a 
s were similar to those reported in the adult clinical trials.  
Paediatric Development Assessments 
Studies  A1481131  and  A1481156  included  assessments  of  cognitive  and  motor  development.  Most 
subjects were not limited in either their cognitive or their motor development at baseline. Changes in 
cognitive or motor development from baseline to Week 16 (end of Study A1481131) or at Week 52 in 
S
tudy A1481156 were infrequent. The number of reports of deterioration was similar to the number of 
reports of improvement, and there were no apparent differences between treatment groups. 
egarding the long term safety of these patients, the submitted data do not indicate any specific safety 
R
issue that could be related to this age group, concerning ocular, motor or cognitive development.

Table 27: Summary of Adverse Events (All Causality), by Age and Ability Subgroups 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing  data  from  the  MAH’s  safety  database  has  been  reviewed  during  8  periods  since  the 
approval of Revatio. The first seven periods are covered by the PSURs in Europe and the eighth period 
relates to a post-marketing line listing for the period 01 June 2009 through 30 October 2009 generated 
from  the  MAH’s  safety  database  specifically  for  this  submission.  Regarding  the  last  period,  of  the  79 
cases in patients treated with sildenafil for PAH that included information about the age of the patient, 
11 (21 events) were in patients 17 years of age or younger, including 5 infants (less than 24 months of 
age), 4 children (2 to 11 years of age) and 2 adolescents (11 to 17 years of age). Seven of the cases 
were  serious,  and  one  case  had  a  fatal  outcome.  A  9-month-old  male  born  with  trisomy  21  was 
hospitalized for pulmonary haemorrhage considered related to sildenafil treatment. This event resolved, 
but he died 20 days later of pneumonia, which was not considered related to sildenafil treatment. The 
assessment  of  the  PSURs  did  not  warrant  changes  in  the  current  reference  safety  documentation 
regarding use in children (table 28). 
Table 28: Summary of Post-Marketing Adverse Events Reported to the MAH during the period of 01 June 2009 
through 30 October 2009 
Post-Marketing Safety 
As  in  the  adult  PAH  population,  AEs  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  underlying  PAH  condition  (e.g., 
dyspnoea,  hypoxia,  signs  and  symptoms  of  right  cardiac  failure)  were  found  to  dominate  the  clinical 
picture.  Similarly  events  associated  to  the  vasodilatory  effect  of  sildenafil  (e.g.,  headache,  flushing) 
have been amongst the most frequently reported.  In a number of cases, other PAH treatments such 
as  bosentan,  beraprost,  and  epoprostenol  were  associated  with  sildenafil  in  the  therapeutic 
management of paediatric PAH (due to the severity of this condition).  The role of these agents in the 
occurrence of some events cannot be ruled out (e.g. increased LFTs due to bosentan).  The nature and 
the severity of the AEs remained similar over time.   
A  pharmacovigilance  plan  for  assessing  and  monitoring  safety  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH  is 
described in the RMP. 
It is accepted that post-marketing information for Sildenafil did not identify any additional risks for the 
paediatric population.

1.7.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  paediatric  safety  database  for  oral  sildenafil  is  comprised  by  234  treated  subjects  in  the  placebo 
controlled Study A1481131. The majority (228; 97.4%) completed 16 weeks of per protocol treatment 
in Study A1481131, and 220 of these subjects continued into the extension Study A1481156.  
Study A1481131 
In  study  A1481131,  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  experienced  by  similar  proportions  of  subjects  in 
each  treatment  group  (66.7 to 80.0%)  but  the  number  of  adverse  events  increased  when  sildenafil 
doses increased (All causality: low dose 77 vs medium dose 129 vs high dose 142; Treatment related: 
low 23 vs. medium 31 vs high 48). The most frequently reported AEs in the sildenafil combined group 
were  headache  (13.2%  of  subjects),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (11.5%  of  subjects),  pyrexia 
(11.5% of subjects) and vomiting (10.9%), which were generally higher than the corresponding rates 
for  placebo.  Thee  were  19  SAEs  in  11 subjects:  sildenafil  low-dose  (4  SAEs  in  1  subject);  sildenafil 
medium-dose (3 SAEs in 1 subject), sildenafil high-dose (10 SAEs in 7 subjects) and placebo (2 SAEs 
in 2 subjects). Two of these SAEs (stridor and pyrexia with gastroenteritis), both in the sildenafil high-
dose group, were considered as treatment-related. There were no deaths during study A1481131. 
Although  in  study  A1481131,  the  number  of  adverse  events  showed  a  trend  to  increase  at  increased 
sildenafil  doses,  no  trend  was  observed  when  the  number  of  AEs  (all  causality  or  treatment-related) 
was  adjusted  for  exposure.  Therefore,  no  significant  exposure-safety  relationship  can  be  concluded 
from the safety data for the different dose groups. 
Study A1481156  
In  study  A1481156,  the  most  common  AEs  were  URTI  (58/229 subjects,  25.3%),  headache 
(53/229 subjects,  23.1%),  and  vomiting  (52/229 subjects,  22.7%).    An  apparent  dose  response  was 
observed  for  some  AEs  (eg,  URTI,  nausea,  pneumonia),  with  a  greater  incidence  of  these  AEs  in  the 
medium  and  high  dose  groups  compared  to  the  low  dose  groups.  Many  of  these  adverse  effects 
occurred in the low weight subgroup (8-20 kg). The number of deaths in each of the treatment groups 
at the cut-off for this submission is 13/100 (13%) in the high dose treatment group, 7/74 (9%) in the 
medium  dose  treatment  group  and  3/55  (5%)  in  the  low  dose  treatment  group.  In  the  interim 
A1481156 clinical study report a dose-related increase in the rate of children with SAEs is observed (all 
causality:  low  dose  7.7%  vs.  medium  dose  15.8%  vs.  high  dose  26.1%).  Most  of  these  SAEs 
correspond to cardiac and respiratory SAEs .A total of 7 SAEs occurring during study A1481156 have 
been  considered  as  treatment-related  (sildenafil  low-dose:  0;  sildenafil  medium-dose:  1;  sildenafil 
high-dose:  6).  In  study  A1481131  the  overall  risk  of  bleeding  events  was  11.5%  sildenafil  and  10% 
placebo.  During  Study  A1481156,  an  additional  23  bleeding  events  were  reported  by  20  subjects:  3 
events occurred with the low-dose, 12 events occurred with the medium dose and 8  events occurred 
with  the  high  dose.  In  studies  A1481131  and  A1481156  combined,  colour  vision  monitoring  for 
5 subjects  had  a  worsening  from  baseline.  These  findings  were  similar  to  those  in  the  adult  clinical 
trials. 
1.7.5.  Conclusion on clinical safety 
The review of the paediatric clinical trial cases did not identify any new safety signal that would appear 
to  be  specific  to  the  paediatric  population,  either  considered  as  a  whole  or  independently  as  its  3 
components, i.e. neonates, infants, and children.  
The  adverse  event  profile  for  sildenafil  in  paediatric  PAH  trials  was  consistent  with  the  adverse  event 
profile  of  sildenafil in  adult  PAH  clinical  trials  and  for  marketed  Revatio in  adults with  PAH.  Review  of 
the  published  literature  and  of  post-marketing  information  for  Revatio  did  not  identify  any  additional 
safety risks for the paediatric population. 
Sildenafil  was  generally  well  tolerated  at  all  doses  studied  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH.  In  the 
placebo-controlled clinical trial, there were no treatment emergent deaths, and few discontinuations for 
adverse events.  
In the combined sildenafil treatment groups, adverse drug reactions of vomiting, pyrexia, cough, and 
erection increased were experienced by more subjects than the placebo treatment group (5.2%, 1.7%, 
1.7% and 9.0% compared to 1.7%, 0, 0 and 0, respectively).  
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 40/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most  of  the  serious  adverse  events  reported  were  not  considered  treatment  related.  There  was  no 
evidence from the long-term safety study that frequently observed adverse events, or adverse events 
considered specific to sildenafil treatment, increased with time. 
Ocular and developmental assessments during the  studies of oral sildenafil in PAH did not reveal any 
significant findings. 
In  conclusion,  the  data  presented  support  the  use  of  Revatio  in  paediatric  patients.  Age  appropriate 
formulations will also be made available specifically for the treatment of paediatric patients. 
1.8.  Risk Management Plan 
An updated RMP was submitted in this type II variation.  
Prior  to  this  application,  safety  was  limited  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH.  The  currently  available 
paediatric safety data is discussed below. 
  Non-clinical safety specifications 
With respect to the paediatric non-clinical safety specification, a full toxicology program was conducted 
for the sildenafil citrate registration package, with oral studies of duration up to 12, 18 and 24 months 
in  dogs,  mice  and  rats  respectively.  Embryofoetal,  fertility  and  peri/  post-  natal  studies  were  also 
carried  out.  In  addition,  i.v.  sildenafil  base  was  administered  to  rats  for  13  days  at  doses  up  to  10 
mg/kg/day  and  to  dogs  for  14  days  at  doses  up  to  10  mg/kg/day.  Intravenous  sildenafil  citrate  was 
administered  to  rats  and  dogs  for  1  month  at  doses  up  to  4  mg/kg/day.  An  intra-arterial  irritation 
study  has  been  conducted  in  rabbits.  None  of  these  studies  produced  findings  that  would  preclude 
administration  of  intravenous  sildenafil  citrate  to  a  paediatric  population  for  the  treatment  of 
pulmonary  hypertension  and  no  additional  toxicology  studies  in  juvenile  animals  are  proposed  given 
the pharmacological profile of sildenafil. 
Clinical safety specifications 
 
Exposure data for the trials performed in paediatric patients (<17 years) has been added to the RMP. 
The post-marketing exposure in patients between 0 and 18 years old is 14429 patient-years. 
A literature review for sildenafil citrate in PAH identified 23 paediatric controlled trials, case series and 
case reports dating from 1999 to 2009. Paediatric patients aged from 26 weeks old (gestational age) 
to  18  years  are  recorded  as  receiving  sildenafil.  The  dose  of  sildenafil  ranged  from  0.25  mg/kg  to  2 
mg/kg and duration of therapy ranged from a single dose to over 15 months. In conclusion, review of 
the literature did not reveal specific additional safety issues for paediatric patients. 
Two  paediatric  studies  i.e.  study  A1481131  and  its  long-term  extension  study  A1481156,  constitute 
the clinical support to the submission for the use of Revatio in paediatric PAH. 
The  exclusion  criteria  are  considered  missing  information.  For  most  exclusion  criteria  statements  are 
present in the SmPC of Revatio in the sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.  
Pharmacovigilance Plan 
 
The  only  action  proposed  by  the  MAH  regarding  safety  in  the  paediatric  population  is  data  from 
ongoing  clinical  studies  and  enhanced  pharmacovigilance  using  a  data  capture  aid.  Regarding  clinical 
studies the only study ongoing is a long extension study (A1481156) that will continue until sildenafil is 
approved for marketing for treatment of PAH in children.  
Risk Minimisation Plan 
No  population  specific  risk  was  identified  in  the  clinical  paediatric  program  that  would  justify 
pharmacovigilance/risk management activities beyond those currently in place for the adult population. 
However,  the  need  for  a  clear  and  appropriate  prescribing  information  to  ensure  safe  use  of  the 
product has been addressed in the proposed product label, which focuses on: 1) the paediatric dosage 
recommendations,  including  the  specifics  of  the  extemporaneous  preparation  developed  to  ensure 
dosage  flexibility  in  paediatric  patients  below  the  age  of  6  years,  and  2)  the  AEs  reported  in  the 
paediatric trials that appear to be somewhat specific to that population. 
For paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years old, the recommended dose in patients ≤20 kg is 10 mg (1 
ml of compounded suspension) 3 times a day and for patients >20 kg is 20 mg (2 ml of compounded 
suspension or 1 tablet) 3 times a day.  
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 41/50
 
 
 
 
The extemporaneous preparation of a compounded suspension refers to a validated manipulation, by a 
trained  pharmacist,  of  the  authorized  commercial  sildenafil  citrate  tablet  dosage  form.  The  licensed 
pharmacist  manipulation  at  the  time  of  dispensing  and  the  quality  of  the  product  prepared  in  this 
manner  is  validated,  by  the  MAH  during  development,  so  that  a  robust  product  is  delivered  to  the 
patient. Adopting this extemporaneous preparation approach enables the most rapid provision of a safe 
and effective preparation of assured quality for administration to the paediatric patient. To ensure final 
product  quality  and  patient  safety,  appropriate  quality  data  (e.g.  stability,  dose  uniformity)  and 
specific, detailed and standardized methods of preparation are provided in the proposed product SmPC 
to support the manipulation of the adult dosage form into the paediatric medicine. Compounding of an 
oral  suspension,  by  a  licensed  pharmacist,  following  this  procedure,  will  provide  one  patient  with 
enough  medication  for  a  30-day  course  of  treatment  (1 ml  dosing  volume,  10 mg  dose)  or  a  15-day 
course of treatment (2 ml dosing volume, 20 mg dose).   
Finally,  based  on  the  safety  profile  of  the  product  established  in  the  paediatric  clinical  development 
program several AEs associated with the use of  Revatio appear to be somewhat more specific to the 
paediatric  population,  as  compared  to  the  safety  profile  derived  from  the  adult  clinical  trials  (i.e. 
Vomiting,  Pyrexia,  URTI).  In  the  combined  sildenafil  treatment  groups  Vomiting,  Pyrexia,  URTI,  and 
Erection increased were more frequent than in the placebo group.  
The MAH was also asked to perform an analysis of the main characteristics of patients with URTI in the 
different arms of treatment but this analysis is not included. Additionally, the MAH does not provide a 
discussion of the possible reasons for the differences in the incidences of URTI.  A higher incidence of 
all causality bronchitis and pneumonia was also reported. It is acknowledged that none of these cases 
were considered treatment related by the investigator, and also a causal relationship is not foreseen. 
However, considering that at least bronchitis is included as a common AE in the adult data, the MAH is 
requested  to  include  other  infections  of  the  respiratory  system  in  the  requested  analysis.  In  order  to 
retrieve  all  cases  related  to  respiratory  infections,  the  MedDRA  HLGT  “Respiratory  tract  infections” 
should be used as search criteria and the analysis should be performed according to the PT. A statistic 
analysis of the differences in the incidence of different AEs should be applied: 
1)  To  perform  an  analysis  of  the  main  characteristics  of  patients  with  URTI  as  well  as  patients  with 
bronchitis and pneumonia and other possible AEs suggestive of a respiratory infection in the different 
arms  of  treatment  of  study  A1481131.  In  order  to  retrieve  all  cases  related  to  respiratory  infections, 
the  MedDRA  HLGT  “Respiratory  tract  infections”  should  be  used  as  search  criteria  and  the  analysis 
should  be  performed  according  to  the  Preferred  Term  (PT).  A  statistical  analysis  of  the  differences  in 
the incidence of different AEs should be applied 
2)  To  discuss  the  possible  reasons  behind  the  differences  in  the  incidences  of  URTI,  bronchitis, 
pneumonia and other possible AEs suggestive of a respiratory infection. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to commit to the submission an updated RMP, which should contain the 
requested  analysis  regarding  upper  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infections,  and  also  include  URTI, 
Bronchitis,  and  Pneumonia  as  potential  risks  in  paediatric  patients.  (see  letter  of  undertaking  with 
commitment for submission as part of the next PSUR (July 2011).  
In  conclusion,  this  updated  RMP  version  5.3  discussed  in  this  application  is  considered  acceptable  . 
However  an  updated  RMP  should  further  be  submitted  taking  into  account  the  above  described 
comments.  
1.9.  Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  the  Revatio  is  not  similar  to  iloprost  (Ventavis),  treprostinil  (Remodulin), 
bosentan (Tracleer), ambrisentan (Volibris) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
EC No. 847/2000 for the same therapeutic indication. (see annex)  
1.10.  Update of the Product information 
As the result, the CHMP agreed with the changes in the SmPC as follows ;  
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 42/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.10.1.  Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
The changes in the SmPC described below concern only the oral formulation unless otherwise 
mentioned.  
  Update of section 4.1  
The CHMP agreed to update the indication and add the following information.  
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has 
been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with 
congenital heart disease (See section 5.1). 
  Update of section 4.2 
Posology 
TTPaediatric Population 
The safety and efficacy of Revatio in children below 1 year of age has not been established. No data 
are available. 
For paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old, the recommended dose in patients ≤ 20 kg is 
10 mg (1 ml of compounded suspension) three times a day and for patients > 20 kg is 20 mg (2 ml of 
compounded suspension or 1 tablet) three times a day.  Higher doses are not recommended in 
paediatric patients (see section 5.1). 
For instructions on compounding of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
  Update of section 4.4 
Two paragraphs are amended following the results of the paediatric studies. The final agreed text is 
detailed below :  
The efficacy of Revatio has not been established in patients with severe pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (functional class IV). If the clinical situation deteriorates, therapies that are 
recommended at the severe stage of the disease (eg, epoprostenol) should be considered (see section 
4.2).  The benefit-risk balance of sildenafil has not been established in patients assessed to be at WHO 
functional class I pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Studies with sildenafil have been performed in forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension related to 
primary (idiopathic), connective tissue disease associated or congenital heart disease associated forms 
of PAH (see section 5.1). The use of sildenafil in other forms of PAH is not recommended. 
This amendment is introduced also in the IV formulation.  
  Update of section 4.5 
The following information is added:  
Paediatric Population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
  Update of section 4.8 
Paediatric Population 
In the placebo-controlled study of Revatio in patients 1 to 17 years of age with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, a total of 174 patients were treated three times a day with either low (10 mg in patients 
> 20 kg; no patients ≤ 20 kg received the low dose), medium (10 mg in patients ≥ 8-20 kg; 20 mg in 
patients ≥ 20-45 kg; 40 mg in patients > 45 kg) or high dose (20 mg in patients ≥ 8-20 kg; 40 mg in 
patients ≥ 20-45 kg; 80 mg in patients > 45 kg) regimens of Revatio and 60 were treated with placebo.   
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 43/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The adverse reactions profile seen in this paediatric study was generally consistent with that in adults 
(see table above). The most common treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) that occurred (with a frequency ≥ 
1%) on Revatio (combined doses) with a frequency ≥ 1%  over placebo, in the paediatric study were 
vomiting (5.2%), cough, pyrexia, (each 1.7%) and nausea, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain 
upper, photophobia (each 1.1%).  TRAEs erection increased and spontaneous penile erections occurred 
with a combined frequency of  9.0%  in  male subjects  in the combined sildenafil group. Most of these 
TRAEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
220 subjects who completed the 16 week placebo-controlled study entered a long-term extension 
study. Subjects who had been on active therapy continued in the same treatment regimen, whilst 
those who had been on placebo therapy for 16 weeks were randomised to low, medium or high dose 
groups of sildenafil.   
At two years 184 subjects were still participating in the extension study. Over the first two years of 
sildenafil dosing a total of 4 of the 229 subjects who received sildenafil had a serious adverse reaction; 
1 of 74 subjects in the medium dose group and 3 of 100 subjects in the high dose group. These 4 
events were convulsion, hypersensitivity, hypoxia and ventricular arrhythmia. 
From a data cut with a median subject duration of treatment of 2.2 years (range: 0 to 5.0 years) the 
most frequently reported treatment related AEs were: headache (13.2%), erection increased (9.0%), 
vomiting (6.8%), abdominal pain (3.4%) cough and dyspepsia (each 2.6%). 
  Update of section 5.1 
Paediatric Population 
A total of 234 subjects aged 1 to 17 years were treated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, 
placebo controlled parallel group, dose ranging study.  Subjects (38% male and 62% female) had body 
weight  8 kg, and had primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) [33%], or PAH secondary to congenital 
heart disease [systemic-to-pulmonary shunt 36%, surgical repair 30%].  63 of 234  (27 %) patients 
were < 7 years old (sildenafil low dose = 2; medium dose = 17; high dose = 28; placebo = 16) and 
171 of 234 (73%) patients were 7 years or older (sildenafil low dose = 40; medium dose = 38; and 
high dose = 49; placebo = 44).  Most subjects were WHO Functional Class I (75/234, 32%) or II 
(120/234, 51%) at baseline; fewer patients were Class III (35/234, 15%) or IV (1/234, 0.4%); for a 
few patients (3/234, 1.3%), the WHO Functional Class was unknown. 
Patients were naïve for specific PAH therapy and the use of prostacyclin, prostacyclin analogues and 
endothelin receptor antagonists was not permitted in the study, and neither was arginine 
supplementation, nitrates, alpha-blockers and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors.  
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of 16 weeks of chronic treatment with 
oral sildenafil in paediatric subjects to improve exercise capacity as measured by the Cardiopulmonary 
Exercise (CPX) test in subjects who were developmentally able to perform the test, n = 115). 
Secondary endpoints included haemodynamic monitoring, symptom assessment, WHO functional class, 
change in background treatment, and quality of life measurements. 
Subjects were allocated to one of three sildenafil treatment groups, low (10 mg), medium (10-40 mg) 
or  high  dose  (20-80 mg)  regimens  of  Revatio  given  three  times  a  day,  or  placebo.  Actual  doses 
administered  within  a  group  were  dependent  on  body  weight  (see  Section  4.8).  The  proportion  of 
subjects  receiving  supportive  medications  at  baseline  (anticoagulants,  digoxin,  calcium  channel 
blockers, diuretics and/or oxygen) was similar in the combined sildenafil treatment group (47.7%) and 
the placebo treatment group (41.7%).  
The primary endpoint was the placebo-corrected percentage change in peak VO2 from baseline to week 
16 assessed by CPX testing in the combined dose groups (Table 2). A total of 106 out of 234 (45%) 
subjects were evaluable for CPX test , which comprised those children ≥ 7 years old and 
developmentally able to perform the test.  Children < 7 years (sildenafil combined dose = 47; placebo 
= 16) were evaluable only for the secondary endpoints.  Mean baseline peak volume of oxygen 
consumed (VO2) values were comparable across the sildenafil treatment groups (17.37 to 
18.03 mL/kg/min), and slightly higher for the placebo treatment group (20.02 mL/kg/min).  The 
results of the main analysis (combined dose groups versus placebo) were not statistically significant 
(p = 0.056) (see Table 2). The estimated difference between the medium sildenafil dose and placebo 
was 11.33% (95%CI: 1.72 to 20.94) (see Table 2).

Dose related improvements were observed with pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and mean 
pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). The sildenafil medium and high dose groups both showed PVRI 
reductions compared to placebo, of 18% (95%CI: 2% to 32%) and 27% (95%CI: 14% to 39%), 
respectively; whilst the low dose group showed no significant difference from placebo (difference of 
2%). The sildenafil medium and high dose groups displayed mPAP changes from baseline compared to 
placebo, of -3.5 mmHg (95%CI: -8.9, 1.9) and -7.3 mmHg (95%CI: -12.4, -2.1), respectively; whilst 
the low dose group showed little difference from placebo (difference of 1.6 mmHg). Improvements 
were observed with cardiac index with all three sildenafil groups over placebo, 10%, 4% and 15% for 
the low, medium and high dose groups respectively. 
Significant improvements in functional class were demonstrated only in subjects on sildenafil high dose 
compared to placebo.  Odds ratios for the sildenafil low, medium and high dose groups compared to 
placebo were 0.6 (95% CI: 0.18, 2.01), 2.25 (95% CI: 0.75, 6.69) and 4.52 (95% CI: 1.56, 13.10), 
respectively. 
Long term extension data 
Subjects enrolled into the placebo-controlled study were eligible to enter a long term randomised 
extension study with an initial blinded phase followed by open label administration of sildenafil using 
low, medium and high dose groups. Dose titrations were permitted. 
From a data cut > 7 years after the study start 31 deaths were reported, whether on-treatment or 
reported as part of the survival follow-up. The incidence of deaths in the high, medium and low dose 
groups were 17% (17 of 100), 12% (9 of 74) and 9% (5 of 55) respectively. None of the deaths were 
considered to be treatment-related by the investigator. The majority of deaths were associated with 
functional class III or IV at baseline and primary pulmonary hypertension aetiology. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of survival at 2 years, in those subjects > 20kg in weight at baseline, was estimated as 95%, 
95% and 92% for subjects in the low, medium and high dose groups respectively. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of survival at 2 years, in those subjects (cid:31) 20kg in weight at baseline, was estimated as 
100% and 94% for subjects in the medium and high dose groups respectively. 
These long-term data did not identify an additional survival benefit with higher doses of sildenafil 
compared to lower doses in paediatrics with PAH, therefore higher sildenafil doses are not 
recommended in paediatric patients with PAH (see also section 4.2). 
Peak VO2 was assessed 1 year after the start of the placebo-controlled study. Of those Revatio treated 
subjects developmentally able to perform the CPX 50/85 subjects (59%) had not shown any 
deterioration in Peak VO2 from baseline.  Similarly 123 of 174 subjects (71%) who had received 
sildenafil during the placebo-controlled study had either maintained or improved their WHO Functional 
Class at 1 year.  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Revatio in newborns with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
  Update of section 5.2 
Based on the PK/PD data provided the following paragraph is added :

Paediatric Population 
From the analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of sildenafil in patients involved in the paediatric 
clinical trials, body weight was shown to be a good predictor of drug exposure in children. Sildenafil 
plasma concentration half-life values were estimated to range from 4.2 to 4.4 hours for a range of 10 
to 70 kg of body weight and did not show any differences that would appear as clinically relevant. Cmax 
after a single 20 mg sildenafil dose administered PO was estimated at 49, 104 and 165 ng/ml for 70, 
20 and 10 kg patients, respectively. Cmax after a single 10 mg sildenafil dose administered PO was 
estimated at 24, 53 and 85 ng/ml for 70, 20 and 10 kg patients, respectively.  Tmax was estimated at 
approximately 1 hour and was almost independent from body weight. 
  Update of section 6.6  
Compounding of an extemporaneously prepared oral suspension from Revatio 20 mg tablets 
(final concentration 10 mg/mL) 
Compounding of an oral suspension, by a pharmacist, following this procedure, will provide one patient 
with enough medication for a 28-day course of treatment (1 mL dosing volume, 10 mg dose) or a 14-
day course of treatment (2 mL dosing volume, 20 mg dose).  The compounding of the Revatio 
suspension from Revatio 20 mg tablets uses Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus diluents.  Ora-Sweet and Ora-
Plus are registered trademarks of Paddock Laboratories.   
Compounding Instructions for a Pharmacist  
1.  Ensure Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus have been equilibrated to room temperature. 
2.  Count 62 (sixty two) x 20 mg Revatio tablets.  
3.  Using a mortar and pestle, crush these 62 tablets, 2-10 tablets at a time, into a fine powder. 
4.  Measure out 30 mL Ora-Plus (cloudy white liquid), allowing time for any air bubbles to dissipate.  
5.  Add a portion (15-20 mL typical) of Ora-Plus from step 4 to the mortar and mix into a thick 
homogeneous paste.  More Ora-Plus from step 4 may be added if necessary.  
6.  Transfer the paste to an amber glass or high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle (≥ 150mL volume)  
7.  Rinse the mortar and pestle with the remaining Ora-Plus  from step 4 and transfer rinses to the 
bottle to ensure complete transfer of the paste.  
8.  Measure 90 mL Ora-Sweet (clear pink liquid) allowing time for any air bubbles to dissipate.  
9.  Transfer approximately ½ the volume of the Ora-Sweet from step 8 to the bottle containing the 
formulation prepared above. 
10. Cap bottle and shake vigorously for a minimum of 30 seconds. 
11. Transfer the remaining Ora-Sweet from step 8 to the bottle and shake vigorously again for a 
minimum of 30seconds to achieve an homogenous suspension.  
Put an ancillary label on the bottle warning “Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency, should not take 
this medicine”.  The ancillary label should also indicate “Shake well for a minimum of 10 seconds 
before each dosing”. 
12. Include the patient’s name, dosing instructions, expiry date , and drug name.  
13. Instruct the person who is to administer the compounded product that any remaining material 
following completion of therapy must be discarded by either affixing an ancillary label to the bottle 
or adding a statement to the pharmacy label instructions.  
14. Place an appropriate expiration date label according to storage condition (see Section 6.3). 
Note: The storage condition for the compounded oral suspension, using the Oraplus/Orasweet 
vehicle combination, in amber glass and HDPE bottles demonstrates stability for 28 days in a 
refrigerator at 2 to 8ºC. Stability studies have not been conducted or verified with other vehicles or 
bottle types.

required volumes of suspension.  If possible, mark or highlight the graduation corresponding to the 
appropriate dose (1 mL or 2 mL) on the oral syringe for each patient. 
  Update of the Product information following QRD review  
As  agreed  with  the  CHMP  during  the  renewal  application,  the  product  information  concerning  both 
tablets and IV formulation is also updated taking into account QRD comments. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  agreed  to  commit  to  update  the  paediatric  statements  of  the  product 
information according to the QRD review during the next variation.  
Furthermore,  the  version  number  of  the  RMP  (version  5.3)  is  updated  taking  into  account  the 
assessment performed in this application.  
1.10.2.  Update of the Package leaflet  
Consequential changes related to the paediatric additions are introduced in the Package Leaflet.  
2. Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment 
The main study in the current application study A1481131 is the largest placebo-controlled paediatric 
study conducted so far, recruiting around 230 drug-naive patients and lasting 5 years.  
The  pivotal  study  A1481131  was  a  double-blind,  multi-center,  placebo-controlled  parallel-group, 
dose-ranging  paediatric  study  in  PAH  subjects,  aged  1 to  17 years,  body  weight  8 kg,  with  different 
doses of sildenafil for 16 weeks. The primary objective was to assess peak VO2 in subjects who were 
able  to  perform  the  CPX  test.  However,  all  subjects  who  entered  the  study  were  assessed  for 
haemodynamics,  WHO  functional  class  and  the  QoL  measurements.  A  total  of  234  subjects  were 
treated with one of the 3 sildenafil doses (low, intermediate, high; according to body-weight ranges) or 
placebo and 115 children were able to perform CPX testing.  
Interim  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  Study  A1481156  the  long-term  extension  study  including 
subjects who completed Study A1481131 are also provided to support the above data.  
The  proposed  dose  based  on  the  PK/PD  simulations  is  accepted.  The  medium  dose  shows  the  best 
results in exercise testing accompanied with an acceptable safety profile. 
The  choice  of  endpoints  in  adult  PAH  is  a  recognized  problem,  and  is  even  more  complex  in  the 
paediatric population, due to the scarcity of patients and their inability to perform exercise testing. 
Haemodynamic  parameters  are  considered  by  some  experts  to  be  the  appropriate  primary  endpoints 
for paediatric studies, considering the difficulty in performing exercise tests.  
The main outcome Peak VO2 after cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing has shown to be useful to 
assess patient prognosis and as a mean to quantify functional capacity, although experience is limited 
at present. Therefore, the peak VO2 should be interpreted in association with other harder endpoints 
(i.e.,  mortality,  time  to  clinical  worsening)  and  invasive  haemodynamic  measurements,  leading  to 
additional post hoc analysis requested to the applicant during the procedure.  
It is concluded that efficacy data based on improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary 
haemodynamics support an indication for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years 
old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension 
and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. 
The  currently  proposed  indication  reflects  the  results  of  the  paediatric  study  and  is  generally 
formulated in line with the adult indication, except for omitting the WHO classification. The CHMP opted 
for  this  omission  as  the  representation  of  the  paediatric  study  (more  WHO  I  and  less  WHO  III)  is 
different from that shown in adult studies. Furthermore, the ESC treatment guideline for PAH does not 
recommend  specialized  intervention  in  WHO  I,  however,  this  is  mainly  based  on  adult  data.  In  the 
A1481131 study, improvement in haemodynamic parameters was shown in all three functional classes, 
EMA/482372/2011  
Page 47/50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but  results  on  VO2  max  were  inconsistent.  There  are  experts  who  advocate  early  intervention  in 
paediatrics  (earlier  than  WHO  II)  considering  that  deterioration  in  paediatric  patients  is  more  rapid. 
However  the  number  of  patients  with  WHO  1  in  the  pivotal  A1481131  study  is  too  limited  for  any 
definite conclusions on the Benefit/Risk in this specific subgroup.  
No new safety issues were identified with long term use of sildenafil in paediatric PAH patients.  
It is important to highlight that the approval of this suspension for extemporaneous formulation is an 
interim  measure  temporally  accepted.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  develop  a  suitable  age  appropriate 
formulation in a form of a powder for oral suspension (POS) which is currently under development.  
In conclusion, based on the data provided in this application, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk 
of  Revatio  is  positive  in  paediatric  patients  aged  1  year  to  17  years  old  with  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension.

patients with URTI as well as patients with bronchitis 
and pneumonia and other possible AEs suggestive of a 
respiratory infection in the different arms of treatment 
of study A1481131. In order to retrieve all cases 
related to respiratory infections, the MedDRA HLGT 
“Respiratory tract infections” should be used as search 
criteria and the analysis should be performed according

4. EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
EPAR scope:  
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, annex II, labelling and Package Leaflet to introduce a 
new indication in paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
The above extension of indication applies to the oral tablet formulation only.  
Scientific discussion: 
This  application  is  based  on  quality  and  clinical  data.  The  paediatric  studies  including  clinical 
pharmacology data pertinent to this submission are Studies A1481134 and A1481157 with intravenous 
sildenafil in PAH (supportive for clinical pharmacology and safety data) and pivotal study A1481131 for 
PK/PD data with oral sildenafil, establishing population PK and PK-PD models, and driving the oral dose 
recommendation for  the  paediatric  population.  Interim  data  of  study  A1481156,  the  long  term 
extension of study A1481131 are also supporting this application.  
It is concluded that efficacy data based on improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary 
haemodynamics support an indication for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years 
old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension 
and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. 
The granted indication is as follows:  
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown 
in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart 
disease. 
The  granted  indication  concerns  only  the  oral  tablet  pharmaceutical  formation.  The  approval  of  this 
suspension for extemporaneous formulation is an interim measure temporally accepted. The MAH has 
committed to develop a suitable age appropriate formulation in a form of a powder for oral suspension 
(POS) which is currently under development.  
In addition, minor amendments are introduced in the product information for both tablets and IV 
formulation based on QRD comments received from the renewal application.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

adverse effect data are presented separately for

for section 4.8, the data on adverse reactions are 
presented in a single table. The reporting frequencies of the 
adverse reactions have been updated according to all 
available clinical trial data (a total of 13 double-blind

ischemic heart disease. In addition, the risk of heart attack 
(myocardial infarction) and the risk of heart or artery 
disease events other than a heart attack (e.g. chest pain) 
were added to the Product Information as possible side 
effects, classified as uncommon and common respectively. 
The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other 
ischemic heart disease events (0.43% and 1.54%, 
respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double-
blind studies involving 2082 patients with end-of-dose 
motor fluctuations receiving entacapone.  Information on 
cardiac arrhythmias has been added to the SPC section 4.8, 
subtitle Levodopa/carbidopa, and irregular heart rate or 
rhythm has been added to the PL with frequency common. 
Yellow iron oxide has been deleted from relevant sections 
of the product information for Stalevo 75/18.75/200mg and 
125/31.25/200mg since it is not used in these strengths.

50/12.5/200 mg, 100/25/200 mg, 150/37.5/200 mg and 
200/50/200  film-coated tablets.  
The new 75/18.75/200 mg and 125/31.25/200 mg 
strengths compare with the already marketed Stalevo 
strength with carbidopa and levodopa contained in 1:4 ratio 
and combined with 200 mg entacapone.  
In the fixed combination of three active ingredients, 
levodopa mediates the antiparkinsonian effect whereas 
carbidopa and entacapone inhibit the peripheral 
metabolism of levodopa. The indication is the same as for 
the other strengths, i.e. the treatment of Parkinson (PD) 
patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilized 
with the combination of levodopa and dopa decarboxylase 
inhibitor. 
The new strengths being proposed are intermediates to the 
currently approved Stalevo tablets. The registration of the 
new Stalevo strengths is based on the strategy to develop 
incremental doses across the currently marketed Stalevo 
tablet strengths to enable more flexible dose titration of 
levodopa in clinical use.  
Separate bioequivalence studies have been conducted for 
the four approved strengths of Stalevo using Sinemet 
(levodopa/carbidopa) and Comtess (entacapone) as the

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported 
Package Leaflet 
9 times since market introduction of entacapone. In four 
out of nine of these cases entacapone and other PD drug 
treatment has been abruptly withdrawn 1-2 days before 
event onset. In the remaining cases many confounding 
factors could be recognized, severe underlying illnesses, 
complex drug treatments, and co-administration of 
entacapone with drugs reported to have been related to 
NMS even on their own, and these cases create no clear 
signal at the moment. 
The wording on NMS in section 4.4 of the SPC has been 
revised to state that isolated cases of NMS have been 
reported, especially following abrupt reduction or 
discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant 
dopaminergic medications. It was also added to section 4.8 
of the SPC that isolated cases of NMS have been reported 
following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone 
and other dopaminergic medications. This change was also 
reflected in the Package Leaflet.Since market introduction 
of entacapone 9 cases of rhabdomyolysis have been 
reported. Rhabdomyolysis has been mild or moderate and 
other possible causal factors have been detected. 
Consequently information has been added to section 4.8 of 
the SPC that isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been 
reported.

of the reports including weight decrease or anorexia 
included one or more additional ADRs. No clear pattern of 
adverse events was evident. Both weight loss and anorexia 
are often associated with other gastro-intestinal disorders 
and underlying medical conditions.The CHMP considered it 
appropriate to add the terms "anorexia" and "weight 
decrease" to section 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) and to include a warning regarding 
weight control in case of diarrhoea in section 4.4 for 
Stalevo.The Marketing Authorisation Holder also added a 
warning to section 4.4 of the SPC to state that Stalevo 
contains sucrose.  
In accordance with the guideline on excipients in the label 
and Package Leaflet of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/436/00) these changes were also reflected in the 
labelling and Package Leaflet.

Introduction 
On 11 March 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A3L28 for Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ 
Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk balance for 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A3L28 “Evaluation of Antibody Persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 Years of Age in Healthy 
Children After Primary Series and Booster Vaccination with Investigational (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T) or 
Infanrix™ hexa vaccines in Latin America” is a standalone study. 
This study is the immunogenicity follow-up of two previously assessed studies: A3L24 and 
A3L27. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
No vaccines were given in this extension study A3L28. In the original studies A3L24 and A3L27 
commercial products of Prevenar, Rotarix and Infanrix hexa were given.  
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster 
vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), 
tetanus (T), pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
A3L28:  
“Evaluation of Antibody Persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 Years of Age in Healthy Children After 
Primary Series and Booster Vaccination with Investigational (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T) or 
Infanrix™ hexa vaccines in Latin America” 
This clinical study A3L28 is a Phase III long-term antibody persistence study and was conducted in 
Colombia with a maximum of 699 children who completed a 3-dose primary series (DTaPIPV-Hep B-
PRP-T or Infanrix™ hexa), concomitantly administered with Prevenar™ (PCV7) (3 doses) and Rotarix™ 
(2 doses) in study A3L24, and the booster (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix™ hexa, concomitantly 
administered with Prevenar™ [PCV7]) in study A3L27. All subjects received also hepatitis B vaccination 
at birth.

This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this 
product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02). 
Clinical study 
Description 
Primary immunization (Hexacim or Infanrix hexa both concomitantly given with Prevenar and Rotarix) 
had been done in study A3L24, the booster dose (Hexacim or Infanrix hexa both with Prevenar) was 
given in study A3L27. Subjects now in this study kept the subject number from A3L27 and no further 
vaccinations were given.  Blood draws were now made at the age of 3.5y and the second at the age of 
4.5y (each +/- 60 days), i.e. ~2 and 3 years post booster vaccination. SAEs from A3L27 were followed 
and collected as well as newly developed SAEs during this trial. 
Methods 
Study design 
Only subjects from Colombia participated in this follow-up study.

study report) 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria followed that of the previous studies. Medical history was checked prior 
to inclusion as well as further vaccinations made between studies (HepA vaccination allowed). 
Diary cards were provided. 
Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor’s 
laboratory in Swiftwater, USA or at qualified laboratories.

months of age (MoA) concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster 
dose of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA. 
• Group 2: maximum of 264 children who received 3 doses of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6 MoA 
concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster dose of Infanrix™ 
hexa vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA. 
• Group 3: maximum of 171 children who received 3 doses of Infanrix™ hexa vaccine at 2, 4, 6 MoA 
concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster dose of DTaP-IPV-HB-
Hib vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA. 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
To describe the long-term antibody (Ab) persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age following a 3-dose 
primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib+Prevenar™ (PCV7)+Rotarix™ or Infanrix™ 
hexa+Prevenar™ (PCV7)+Rotarix™ vaccination at 2, 4, 6 months of age and a booster vaccination of 
DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib+Prevenar™ (PCV7) or Infanrix™ hexa+Prevenar™ (PCV7) at 12 to 24 months of

Statistical Methods 
For the main objective: 
The analysis was descriptive according to the group subjects were assigned to in the A3L27 booster 
trial. Immunogenicity endpoints were described at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age on all available blood 
samples. 
The following parameters were used: 
• Geometric mean (GM) of Ab concentrations/titers 
• Percentage of subjects with concentrations/titers above predefined thresholds, including those of pre-
defined seroprotection 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated: 
• using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions 
• using the normal approximation of the Log10 titers, followed by a back transformation for geometric 
mean concentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs)  
Reverse cumulative distribution curves for each Ab criterion are presented. 
EMA/389548/2016  
Page 6/16 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Additionally for each Ab criterion, kinetic curves based on GMC or GMT at each time point were plotted 
including the primary series, booster, and long-term time points. 
For the observational objective: 
Descriptive statistics are produced. 
Immunogenicity endpoints are additionally presented by vaccine group and age stratum based on the 
age at inclusion in the A3L27 booster phase study. The stratification on the age is as follows: 12 
months included till 15 months excluded (simplified as [12 months, 15 months[), [15 months, 19 
months[ and [19 months, 24 months]. 
The same statistical method as the one described for the main objective was used.

Immunogenicity results 
The percentage of subjects achieving the predefined seroprotection or seroconversion threshold for each antigen is similar across the groups so that there is 
also no difference between the two vaccines used for priming. Details can be found in Table 4, GMTs/GMCs are shown further below.

Year 1 (V01) and Year 2 (V02) are the first and second time points of follow-up that correspond to the follow-up when subjects were aged, respectively, 3.5 and 4.5 years, both time points following a 3-
dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine or Infanrix™ hexa at 2, 4, and 6 MoA (both concomitantly administered with PCV7 at 2, 4, and 6 MoA, and Rotarix™ at 2 and 4 MoA), 
and a booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine or Infanrix™ hexa at 12 to 24 MoA (both concomitantly administered with PCV7). 
The GMTs and GMCs of antibodies against all antigens except Polio were similar in all three groups. For Polio the group primed with Infanrix hexa showed 
significantly higher titres than the Hexaxim primed groups. Details can be found in Table 5 and Figure 5.

Considering that the booster dose was given at some time point between 12 and 24 months of age an 
analysis was also done for the different age increments (12-15m, 15-19m, 19-24m) but the results still 
show a high similarity between groups (with the same exceptions described above) and the expected 
higher titres/concentrations in the older subgroups.

Safety results 
No deaths or other SAEs were reported. The safety profile remains unchanged. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The data provided show the titres and concentrations including antibody kinetics 2-3 years following 
the booster dose of Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa with priming Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa and 
concomitantly used vaccines. 
The seroprotection levels of antibodies against Diphtheria, Tetanus, HepB and Polio are adequate and 
similar to what is known from other vaccines.  
The titres and concentrations of antibodies against all antigens vary only for IPV and Pertussis 
depending on which vaccine has been used for priming (IPV) or for priming and/or booster. For IPV the 
Infanrix hexa primed subjects show statistically significantly higher concentrations; the general 
antibody kinetic is identical nevertheless. For the Pertussis antigens slightly higher titres can be found 
in the Hexyon primed groups.  The scale of all those differences is not clinically relevant for the 
timeframe of 3 to 4 years after primary immunization with Hexaxim so this is just an observation and 
not an issue for the moment. Nevertheless, the company should continue to monitor the long-term 
antibody values in the EU studies. 
The safety profile remains unchanged as no SAEs or even deaths occurred during the 2 years of this 
study.  
CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Introduction
Dupilumab (DUPIXENT®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human 
interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) and blocks both human IL-4 (Type I & Type II) and human IL-
13 (Type II) signal transduction. DUPIXENT is approved in the European Union (EU) “for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for 
systemic therapy”.
Dupilumab has been also approved for adults and adolescents with severe asthma with type 2 
inflammation and for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in and EU. Dupilumab is to be 
injected subcutaneously.
This submission proposes to extend the age range for the DUPIXENT indication in atopic dermatitis (AD) 
from ≥12 years (adolescent and adults) to ≥6 years of age (to include children ≥6 to <12 years of age) 
as follows: DUPIXENT is indicated for “the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 to 11 years 
old who are candidates for systemic therapy”.
2.1.2.  Disease or condition
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized clinically by periodic flares 
of dry, red, itchy skin lesions and pathogenically by a defective skin barrier, recurrent infections, and both 
local and systemic type 2 immune responses.
Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants and children.  The disease affects 
over 20% of children in many industrialized countries.  Approximately 45% of all cases of AD begin within 
the first 6 months of life, 60% begin during the first year, and 85% begin before 5 years of age.
2.1.3.  Epidemiology
Recent studies have improved our understanding of the epidemiology of childhood AD.  In general, more 
severe eczema correlated with poorer overall health, impaired sleep and increased healthcare utilization.  
Severe eczema was associated with higher prevalence of comorbid chronic health disorders, including 
asthma, hay fever and food allergies.  The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood 
(ISAAC) phase 3 study surveyed over 8 countries and identified a 7.9% global prevalence of eczema in 
children 6 to 7 years old . The prevalence of AD in developed countries such as the US is expected to 
increase if the trends from the last 20 years continue.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
identified an increase in the prevalence of AD in patients aged 0 to 17 years from 7.4% in 1997 to 1999 
to 12.5% in 2009 to 2011. Rising prevalence seems to be paired with rising incidence in the total number 
of severe intractable cases, which includes more cases of children continuing with disease into the grade 
school years and increased number of cases persisting into adulthood.
2.1.4.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis
There is a paucity of studies comparing adults and children with respect to the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of disease in AD due in part to the fact that mechanistic studies involving the collection of 
skin biopsies and other invasive procedures are generally not feasible or pose ethical challenges in 
children.  The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by genetics and environmental factors and involves a 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 8/117
 
 
complex interplay between antigens, skin barrier defects, and immune dysregulation, in which a polarized 
inflammatory response induced by the marked activation of the T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell axis plays a 
central role. Two cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are critical in the initiation and maintenance of the Type 2 
inflammatory pathway. The elevated IgE responses and eosinophilia observed in the majority of patients 
with AD reflects an increased expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13.  Type 2 helper T-cell-
associated cytokines regulate important barrier-related functions, such as epidermal cornification and 
production of antimicrobial proteins.  These cytokines inhibit the production of major terminal 
differentiation proteins, such as loricrin, filaggrin, involucrin, and the antimicrobial proteins human beta 
defensin 2 and 3. The Th2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes and induce production of chemokines, 
including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (also known as TARC) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 
(also known as eotaxin-3), which are chemo-attractants for the Th2 cells and eosinophils; thus, 
perpetuating the inflammatory response.
Most studies in AD children are limited to studies of peripheral blood, demonstrating that, as in adults, 
disease activity in children correlates with several serum biomarkers (ie, CCL17, eosinophils, IgE), and a 
limited array of Th2/Th1 markers.  
2.1.5.  Clinical presentation
Clinical presentation of AD in children is similar to that in adults.  Lesions typically occur in the flexural 
areas and facial involvement is common, especially the forehead and periorbital regions.  The wrists, 
hands, ankles, feet, fingers, and toes are also often involved. The eruption is characterized by dry, scaling 
erythematous papules and plaques, and the formation of large lichenified plaques from lesional chronicity.  
Pruritus is the hallmark of AD in children, as in adults.  The cycle of itching and scratching exacerbates 
the cellular damage in skin lesions and facilitates secondary infections, which can be serious.
The clinical pattern of AD, however, varies somewhat with age.  In infants, for example, involvement of 
the face, neck, and extensor extremities (elbows, knees) is more characteristic than in older individuals 
with AD.  Persistent, bright red plaques may develop on the cheeks and chin at the time of teething and 
introduction of solid food, likely related to chronic irritation from saliva and foods.  Scalp dermatitis with 
linear excoriations are common, even with minimal skin involvement.  With increasing age, children tend 
to develop the classic flexural patches and plaques on the antecubital and popliteal fossae.  Hand and foot 
plantar dermatitis is also common.  In more severe cases, thickened plaques are seen on the dorsal 
hands, feet, and knees, often with a lichenified or leathery appearance with prominent skin lines.  The 
surrounding skin is often dry and flaky, and there may be plate-like ichthyosis of the distal extremities, 
especially in older children.
Children with AD, similar to adults with AD, are more frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus 
than their healthy counterparts.  The rates of colonization vary among studies and regions and range 
from 40% to 93% of patients with AD, as compared to 24% to 30% of healthy children.  Soft tissue 
infections also occur, affecting 40% to 60% of patients with AD during their lifetime.  Atopic dermatitis 
has been shown to have an impact on the quality of life (QoL) of paediatric patients, greater than that 
seen in other common skin disorders like psoriasis and urticaria.
2.1.6.  Management
Available Therapies for Atopic Dermatitis in Children Aged Children Aged ≥6 to < 12 years
Currently available therapies for children with AD have significant side effects, and various systemic 
immunosuppressive drugs are used off-label with little evidence to support their use. 
Similar to the adult and adolescent population, topical treatment is the mainstay of management of AD in 
children.  Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of varying potency represent the cornerstone of topical treatment 
and some low potency TCS are approved in pediatric patients as young as infants.  However, their long-
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 9/117
 
 
term use or large body-surface application is limited by the risk of local side effects (eg, skin atrophy and 
telangiectasia) as well as systemic adverse reactions, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
suppression and Cushing syndrome.  Children are more prone to the development of systemic reactions 
to topically applied medication because of their higher ratio of total body surface area to body weight.  
Linear growth retardation and delayed weight gain have been reported in children receiving TCS. Cushing 
syndrome, growth retardation, hyperglycemia, hirsutism, glaucoma, and adrenal insufficiency have been 
reported with chronic use.  Moreover, continuous use of TCS can be associated with development of 
tachyphylaxis (decreased treatment response and requirement for higher doses of higher potency 
steroids).
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also available for use in 
children, mostly as second-line therapy as an alternative to or in combination with TCS.  Use of these 
agents is typically limited to areas that are prone to skin atrophy from application of TCS, (e.g, face, 
genitals, and flexural areas).  The more effective TCI product (tacrolimus ointment 0.1%) is not approved 
for use in children aged 6 to 11 years old.  Crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical phosphodiesterase-4 
(PDE4) inhibitor, has been approved for use in paediatric AD patients. Ciclosporin is not approved for AD 
in pediatric patients but often used off label for severe AD when systemic therapy is required.  In 
addition, other systemic immunosuppressive agents are also commonly used in treatment of severe forms 
of the disease, including methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.  A high proportion of 
patients suffer from relapse or rebound once the therapy is discontinued.  The lack of safe and effective 
systemic treatments means that most patients with moderate-to-severe AD are not well controlled and 
further illustrates the need for an effective treatment for AD in children that also has a safety profile that 
is acceptable for chronic administration.
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. Nonclinical safety was assessed as part of the original MAA for atopic dermatitis (AD) indication 
and are sufficient to support the use in patients from 6 to 11 years of age. It is not expected that the 
proposed indication would lead to an increase in environmental exposure therefore the conclusions 
related to the current ERA remain valid.
2.2.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
There are no updated data submitted in this application. In relation to ERA, it is agreed that the indication 
applied for in this application will not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of dupilumab. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects
Introduction
Patients aged ≥6 to <12 years with AD have been included in 3 dupilumab clinical studies where PK and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) data have been collected (refer to Table 1).  A variety of SC dosing regimens was 
evaluated in these studies including: 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg single dose or repeated once weekly (QW) 
dose, weight-tiered 100 mg/200 mg Q2W (below and above 30 kg), and 300 mg Q4W, as well as weight- 
tiered 200 mg/300 mg Q2W as an up-titration from 300 mg Q4W in the OLE study R668-AD-1434. 
Loading doses of two times the respective maintenance doses were administered in the fixed dosing 
regimens of pivotal study R668-AD-1652. 
The proposed indication for children is supported primarily by data from the randomized, placebo-
controlled pivotal study R668-AD-1652, assessing efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant

topical corticosteroids (TCS) in children with severe AD aged ≥6 to <12 years and by supportive data 
from patients aged ≥6 to <12 years : 
 – E-R and PK data are presented to support the posology in this patient population,
 – and additionally by supportive data from patients with severe AD in the phase 2a PK study (R668-AD-
1412) and patients aged ≥6 to <12 years with moderate-to-severe AD in the open-label extension (OLE) 
study (R668-AD-1434) of long-term safety and efficacy.
The proposed posology in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD is tiered by body weight with 
patients ≥15 to <30 kg receiving 300 mg Q4W following a 600 mg loading dose and with patients ≥30 to 
<60 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W following a 400 mg loading dose. 
For children ≥6 to <12 years of age weighing ≥60 kg, the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg Q2W 
following a loading dose of 600 mg, since this dose regimen has been proven to achieve the desired 
effective exposure in adults and adolescents weighing ≥60 kg.
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics
In the phase 2a PK study R668-AD-1412, semi dense PK sampling schedules during the single dose and 
8-week observation/sampling period, and sparse sampling was used during the repeat-dose (at pre-dose 
of each study drug administration) and follow-up period. 
In the pivotal study R668-AD-1652 and the OLE study R668 AD 1434, a sparse sampling scheme was 
utilized with samples taken at pre-initiation of treatment, and at pre-dose of each study drug 
administration (Ctrough) throughout the treatment period.  Samples collected in the post-treatment 
period were limited to those patients who did not roll into the OLE study.
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab have been previously characterized as nonlinear with target-
mediated disposition.

2.3.1.1.  Bioanalytical methods
Overview
Analyses included samples from the clinical study R668-AD-1652 (pivotal study) and the ongoing open-
label extension study R668-AD-1434 which enrolled pediatric patients ≥6 to 18 years of age with AD who 
have previously completed a pediatric AD dupilumab clinical study, including parent studies R668-AD-
1412 (phase 2 PK study) and R668-AD-1652.
Serum samples for quantitation of functional dupilumab (ie, dupilumab with 1 or both binding sites

immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of functional dupilumab of 0.078 
mg/L in undiluted human serum.  In this summary, concentrations of functional dupilumab in serum may 
be referred to as dupilumab for brevity.

Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) for the functional dupilumab assay was performed in R668-AD-1412 
study to support the overall pediatric program, including adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age and 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD. ISR passing rate in study R668-AD-1412 was 90.8%.
2.3.1.2.  Immunogenicity
Assessment of ADAs in the R668-AD-1434 and R668-AD-1652 studies for this submission was conducted 
using the REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V3 assay previously assessed. 22 out of 360 baseline serum samples 
from R668-AD-1652 study were positive in the ADA screening assay, resulting in an observed false 
positive rate of 6.1%. This rate is aligned with the target false positive rate of 5% in the screening assay. 
This indicates that true ADA positives were not missed during the bioanalysis of these study samples in 
children (≥6 to <12 years of age) AD population.
Assessment of neutralizing anti-dupilumab antibodies for this submission was conducted using the 
REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2 assay previously assessed. Updates to this method included modification of 
the assay cut point using a 1% false positive rate.
2.3.1.3.  Study R668-AD-1412 (phase 2a PK study)
Study Design:  Study R668-AD-1412 was a phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, ascending dose, 
sequential cohort study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and efficacy of single 
dose and repeat doses of SC dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD not adequately controlled by topical 
medications. 
Thirty-eight children ≥6 to <12 years of age were included in the PK analysis for the current application 
and the results are summarized below.
The study consisted of a screening period, a baseline visit, Part A (including a single-dose treatment and 
an 8-week sampling period, where patients were randomized to 1 of 3 interspersed semi-dense PK 
sampling schedules), and Part B (including a repeat-dose treatment period [4 weekly doses] and an 8-
week follow-up period). Posology of dupilumab administered in this study was 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg by 
SC injections.
Results (systemic exposure): 38 children ≥6 to <12 years of age were included in the PK analysis for 
the current application.The concentration-time profiles for functional dupilumab in serum are best 
described by an initial absorption phase, followed by a linear β elimination phase and a terminal 
concentration dependent target-mediated elimination phase.  Dupilumab concentrations were typically 
more than 2-fold greater following 4 mg/kg SC than 2 mg/kg SC.  Overall, the PK profile of dupilumab in 
these pediatric AD patients is consistent with that observed in adults.
2.3.1.4.  Study R668-AD-1652 (phase 3 pivotal study)
Study Design:  Study R668-AD-1652 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab combined with TCS in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age 
with severe AD not adequately controlled by topical AD medications.  
The study consisted of 4 periods: screening (up to 9 weeks), TCS standardization (2 weeks), treatment 
(16 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). Sampling for PK assessment was performed at baseline and at 
study weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 during treatment period, at unscheduled visits during this period, and in 
case of early termination, at this visit. For patients not entering the OLE study R-668-AD-1434, further PK 
sampling was performed at study weeks 24 and 28 during the follow-up period.

Randomisation
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by baseline body weight (<30 kg and ≥30 kg) to the 
following treatment groups listed below stratified by baseline body weight (<30 kg and ≥30 kg) and 
region (North America, Europe):
The fixed weight-tiered dupilumab Q2W treatment group (n=122):
-63 Patients with baseline weight ≥15 to <30 kg: Q2W SC injections of 100 mg dupilumab (0.7 mL of a 
150 mg/mL solution) from week 2 to week 14, following a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1
and 
-59 Patients with baseline weight ≥30 kg: Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupilumab (1.14 mL of a 175 
mg/mL solution) from week 2 to week 14, following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1. 
Non-weight-tiered dupilumab Q4W treatment group (n=120):  
regardless of weight, Q4W SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab (2 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution) from 
week 4 to week 12, following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1.
Placebo treatment group (n=120):  matching placebo
A the dosing regimens used in this study were selected using simulation from a population PK model 
based on pediatric PK data from study (R668-AD-1412), with the aim of matching the dupilumab 
exposure distribution in children aged ≥6 to <12 years to that achieved with the approved 300 mg Q2W 
regimen in adults, based on the assumption that the exposure response relationships for efficacy 
endpoints is similar in adults and children aged ≥6 to <12 years. 
Results (systemic exposure):
Overall, 362 patients were included in PK analysis of Study R668-AD-1652 and the results are 
summarized below.
Systemic concentrations of dupilumab achieved steady state in all treatment regimens before the primary 
endpoint at week 16.  Steady state was achieved in accordance with the dosing interval and loading dose; 
the Q2W dosing regimens achieved steady state at or before week 8 and the Q4W regimen achieved 
steady state at or before week 12.  Mean Ctrough for the Q2W regimen observed at week 4 was about 14% 
lower than that at week 16.  Mean Ctrough for the Q4W regimen observed at week 4 was about 21% higher 
than that at week 16.  
When comparing the Q2W regimen with the Q4W regimen for each weight subset, differences in exposure 
by regimen were observed.  At week 16, the patients weighing <30 kg had a mean (±SD) Ctrough of 
dupilumab on the Q4W regimen (300 mg Q4W) of 98.7±33.2 mg/L while those children on the Q2W 
regimen (100 mg Q2W) demonstrated a mean Ctrough of 62.6±32.3 mg/L.  In children weighing ≥30 kg, 
those children on 200 mg Q2W had a mean Ctrough of 86.0±34.6 mg/L as compared with those patients on 
the Q4W regimen (300mg Q4W) who had a mean Ctrough of 53.9±25.7 mg/L. These results demonstrated 
that the 300 mg Q4W regimen in children ≥15 to <30 kg resulted in Ctrough similar to those achieved in 
children ≥30 kg dosed with the 200 mg Q2W regimen.  These Ctrough were higher than those obtained in 
children ≥30 kg dosed with 300 mg Q4W regimen or <30 kg dosed with the 100 mg Q2W regimen

Study R668-AD-1434 (OLE study)
Study Design: Study R668-AD-1434 is an ongoing phase 3, open-label extension (OLE) study 
investigating the long-term safety, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of repeat SC doses of dupilumab in 
pediatric patients ≥6 to 18 years of age with AD who have previously completed a pediatric AD dupilumab 
clinical study, including parent studies R668-AD-1412 (phase 2 PK study) and R668-AD-1652. 
The study consists of a screening period (day 28 to day 1), a treatment period up to the time of local 
regulatory approval in the appropriate pediatric age group, and a 12-week follow-up period.  
Patients from parent study R668-AD-1412 who enrolled in R668-AD-1434 under the original protocol 
were started on weight-based SC dupilumab regimens of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg QW at the same single 
dose level they had received in study R668-AD-1412.  When R668-AD-1434 amendment 1 was approved, 
all patients were re-assigned to a fixed dose regimen of 300 mg SC Q4W.  At the time of this 
amendment, most patients from R668-AD-1412 had been enrolled with a median treatment duration of 
88 weeks.  This amendment also introduced potential for up titration to weight-tiered 200 mg or 300 mg 
Q2W regimen, based on clinical responses.
Vast majority of patients from parent study R668-AD-1652 enrolled in R668-AD-1434 under protocol 
amendment 3 and were started on a dose regimen of dupilumab 300 mg SC Q4W without a loading dose.  
Patients with inadequate clinical response during the treatment with dupilumab 300 mg SC Q4W in study 
R668-AD-1434, defined as failure to achieve IGA 0 or 1 after 16 weeks of treatment, were to be re-
assigned to an up-titrated dosing regimen of either 200 mg SC Q2W (for patients weighing <60 kg) or 
300 mg SC Q2W (for patients weighing ≥60 kg).
PK sampling was performed using two different schemes as follows:
For scheme 1, sampling for PK assessment was performed at baseline and at study weeks 4, 12, 36, 60, 
84, 104 (EOT) during treatment period, at unscheduled visits during this period, and in case of early 
termination, at this visit. A further sample was taken study week 120 (EOS) during follow up.
For scheme 2, sampling for PK assessment was performed at baseline and at study weeks 4, 24, 48, 72, 
96, 104 (EOT) during treatment period, at unscheduled visits during this period, and in case of early 
termination, at this visit. A further sample was taken study week 120 (EOS) during follow up.
At the time of the data cut-off, a total of 368 patients from parent studies R668-AD-1412 and R668-AD-
1652 aged ≥6 to <12 years at screening of OLE were included in the study.

Results (systemic exposure):
Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity results are presented below only for patients ≥6 to <12 years of 
age at the time of enrolment in study R668-AD-1434 who participated in parent study R668 AD-1412 or 
R668-AD-1652. At the time of the data cut-off, a total of 368 patients from these parent studies aged ≥6 
to <12 years were included.
Mean week 16 Ctrough of dupilumab was 68.9 ± 37.8 mg/L in patients receiving dupilumab SC 300 mg 
Q4W and were 57% higher in patients up-titrated to the more intensive 200/300 mg SC Q2W regimen 
(108 ± 53.8 mg/L).  Mean week 16 Ctrough in the subset of patients <30 kg on 300 mg Q4W and ≥30 kg 
on 200/300 mg Q2W fell between this range at 91.5 ± 37.5 mg/L and 82.3 ± 35.9 mg/L, respectively 
(Table 3).  Mean Ctrough observed from week 16 through week 52 were approximately at steady state, 
within a similar range for 2 mg/kg QW and 300 mg Q4W regimens (approximately 50 to 80 mg/L), and 
higher for patients on 200/300 mg Q2W (approximately 80 to 110 mg/L) or 4 mg/kg QW (approximately 
140 to 180 mg/L) regimens.

PK comparison across populations
The PK of functional dupilumab in serum has previously been extensively described in the adult AD 
patient population and healthy subjects (initial marketing application). The PK of dupilumab is 
characterized as nonlinear with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways (target-mediated 
clearance), with the target-mediated pathway expressing a high degree of nonlinearity. Body weight has 
been identified as the single most influential covariate that described the variability in dupilumab 
exposure. As such, an emphasis was primarily placed on presenting and comparing the observed PK of 
dupilumab in all children ≥6 to <12 years of age to adults as well as a weight normalized comparison of 
children to adults.
This latter approach was accomplished using population PK modeling. The goal was to select regimens 
which achieved exposures associated with the highest observed efficacy on primary and secondary 
endpoints at week 16 and whose exposures at least matched or exceeded the Ctrough at week 16 of the 
300 mg Q2W regimen in adults.
Comparison of dupilumab drug concentrations
Functional dupilumab Ctrough data over time and at week 16 from the pivotal study R668-AD-1652 in 
patients ≥6 to <12 years of age treated with dupilumab dosing regimens, including the fixed weight-
tiered regimen of 100 mg Q2W (for patients weighing <30 kg) and 200 mg Q2W (for patients weighing ≥
30 kg) as well as the non-weight-tiered 300 mg Q4W, were compared primarily to the approved dosing 
regimen in adults of 300 mg Q2W. Adult data were pooled from phase 3 studies (R668-AD-1334 SOLO1 
and R668-AD-1416 SOLO2) and the phase 2 study R668-AD-1021. 
Dupilumab Ctrough data were also compared to that of the approved regimen in adolescents (200 mg 
Q2W in patients weighing <60 kg and 300 mg Q2W in patients weighing ≥60 kg) as evaluated in the 
phase 3 study R668-AD-1526.
Steady-state Ctrough for various dupilumab dosing regimens evaluated in adult, adolescent, and children 
≥6 to <12 years old patients with AD are shown in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6. Relative to the mean 
observed steady-state Ctrough for the approved 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults, steady-state Ctrough 
values in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age were lower for those <30 kg receiving 100 mg Q2W, but 
greater in those ≥30 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W. The overall mean steady-state Ctrough in patients ≥6 to

<12 years of age receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen was also similar to that of adults receiving the 
approved 300 mg Q2W dose.

When analyzed by pre-specified weight tiers, steady-state Ctrough were lower in patients weighing ≥30 
kg as compared with patients weighing <30 kg (Figure 2).

Receiving 300 mg Q2W
The observed distribution of dupilumab steady-state Ctrough in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age at week 
16 was visually compared to the adult 300 mg Q2W regimen as well as regimens previously evaluated in 
the pivotal study (R668-AD-1526) in adolescent patients (Figure 2). The 300 mg Q4W regimen in patients 
≥6 to <12 years of age was summarized separately in those ≥30 kg or <30 kg to facilitate comparison to 
the equivalent weight groups receiving 100 mg or 200 mg Q2W.

When comparing dosing regimens within the population of children ≥6 to <12 years of age, generally the 
Ctrough distribution of 200 mg Q2W in patients ≥30 kg and 300 mg Q4W in patients <30 kg was similar 
to each other and higher than the Ctrough distribution of 300 mg Q4W in patients ≥30 kg and 100 mg 
Q2W in patients <30 kg. When comparing across populations, the mean ± SD steady-state Ctrough at 
week 16 in patients ≥30 kg receiving 300 mg Q4W (53.9±25.7 mg/L) and patients <30 kg receiving the 
100 mg Q2W (62.6±32.3 mg/L) were lower than adults receiving 300 mg Q2W (73.6 ±38.4 mg). In 
contrast, mean ±SD steady-state Ctrough in patients <30 kg receiving 300 mg Q4W (98.7±33.2 mg/L) 
and patients ≥30 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W (86.0±34.6 mg/L) were similar to or greater than the steady-
state Ctrough observed in adults (Figure 3).
According to the MAH, these observed PK data support the following posology in children ≥6 to <12 years 
of age: 200 mg Q2W regimen in the children weighing ≥30 kg and 300 mg Q4W regimen in children <30 
kg as the dosing regimens achieving drug concentrations that are at least similar to or greater than that 
achieved by the standard 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults. 
For children ≥6 to <12 years of age weighing ≥60 kg, the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg Q2W 
following an initial dose of 600 mg, since weight is the primary covariate affecting the PK of dupilumab 
and this dose regimen has been proven to achieve the desired effective exposure in adults and 
adolescents weighing >60 kg.

Model-Based Comparison of Dupilumab PK in Children ≥6 to <12 Years of Age and Adult Patients with AD
Concentration time profiles of dupilumab were simulated using a population PK model in children ≥6 to 
<12 years of age <30 kg receiving 300 mg Q4W or ≥30 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W, as well as adults 
receiving 300 mg Q2W regimens. Regimens were simulated with loading doses of 600 mg (300 mg QW, 
Q2W, or Q4W) or 400 mg (200 mg Q2W). The analysis assessed both central tendency and variability as

shown by the 90% prediction interval (interval between 5th and 95th percentile) in dupilumab exposure 
(Table 1and Figure 4). From the model-based analysis, the following observations can be made:
The 5th percentile of Ctrough at steady state in children ≥6 to <12 years of age receiving the 200 mg 
Q2W at body weight ≥30 kg and 300 mg Q4W at body weight <30 kg is similar to, or greater than, that 
of adults receiving the 300 mg Q2W regimen (Table 3).
The 95th percentile of Cmax at steady state is lower in children ≥6 to <12 years of age receiving the 200 
mg Q2W at body weight ≥30 kg and 300 mg Q4W regimen at body weight <30 kg compared to adults 
receiving the 300 mg QW regimen. Tables 31 and 32 compare exposures with and without loading doses.

Population PK Analysis
Methods:
Data from the study R668-AD-1652 were used to form the population PK datasets only.
NONMEM and/or Monolix formatted data files were created from the clinical (dosing, sampling date/time, 
and covariate data) and bioanalytical databases (functional dupilumab concentration data). 
The PK model structure used to describe the adult and adolescent data was fitted to the data from 
children aged ≥6 to <12 years, whereby the parameters of the model were re-estimated using only data 
from the pivotal study R668-AD-1652. 
The statistically significant covariates identified in adults and adolescents were tested to confirm their 
significance in the children aged ≥6 to <12 years. The results of these analyses were compared to those 
from adults with moderate-to-severe AD.
The PK model was used to simulate the median, and 5th and 95th percentiles of dupilumab concentration 
over time in children aged ≥6 to <12 years receiving various dosing regimens in comparison to adults 
receiving the 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen. Exposure metrics including Ctrough, maximum concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) at steady state were determined to allow PK comparison 
between dosing regimens in children aged ≥6 to <12 years to the approved 300 mg Q2W regimen in 
adults. The AUC was calculated over the last 28 days of the 16-week treatment period (Q2W or Q4W) to 
allow for comparison between treatment groups.
Given the relatively small size of population PK dataset in patients >6 to ≤12 years of age (N=241 
patients) compared to the adult dataset (N=2115 patients), a full covariate analysis was not undertaken. 
Covariates identified as significant in the adult population PK model were tested in a forward 
inclusion/backward elimination model building procedure for children >6 to ≤12 years of age. 
241 patients were randomized to the following treatment groups: 1) dupilumab every 2 weeks (Q2W): 
100 mg for patients <30 kg (n = 63) or 200 mg for patients ≥30 kg (n = 59); 2) dupilumab every 4-
weeks (Q4W): 300 mg (n = 119). Two patients were excluded from the analysis. In the 100 mg Q2W 
group, one patient, was originally randomized to placebo and erroneously received one dose of 100 mg 
Q2W at week 2; this patient had only one quantifiable observation. In the 200 mg Q2W group, another 
patient, exhibited concentrations below the LLOQ over the entire time course of treatment. This patient 
had a baseline weight of <30 kg and was mis-stratified to the 200 mg Q2W group ≥30. The patient 
received one loading dose and as a result of mis-stratification, discontinued the drug, but remained in the 
study. Overall, 239 of 241 patients were used in the analysis.

Population parameter estimates for this pediatric population were compared to previous models in adult 
and adolescent patients as a cross-validation using both the base and covariate models.

Modeling Strategy
The initial plan was to apply the adolescent base model to the data from children ≥6 to <12 years of age 
with severe AD. It appeared that PK concentrations were mostly through levels in the beta phase 
providing little or no information about target-mediated elimination rate (Vm); an implementation of 
simulating annealing or between-subject variability in Vm was necessary to make this parameter stable, 
as described below. Having Vm in the model as estimated parameters increased variability in the OFV. 
The variability in OFV was caused by steep target-mediate phase. For these reasons, Vm was estimated 
using a single base model run and then using 10 runs with randomly changed initial values of the 
estimated PK parameters. A Vm estimate of 1.64 mg/L/d, which was close to the median of the 10 
estimates and had a low OFV, was chosen and used as a fixed PK parameter for further model 
developments. During the prior development of the adult covariate model, Vm was also fixed to account 
for sparse data collected mostly during the beta phase and to reduce variability in OFV to acceptable 
level.
Similar to the adolescent model, inter-compartmental rates (k23 and k32), mean residence time (MRT), 
and bioavailability (F) were fixed to the adult values. The absorption rate (ka) was fixed to a value of 
0.641 1/d estimated using semi-sparse data of ≥6 to <12 years of age subpopulation of study R668-AD-
1412. This allowed accounting for potential changes in ka with age and predicting Cmax with higher 
precision. The estimated absorption rate in children ≥6 to <12 years of age was higher than the adult 
value and consistent with the higher reported absorption rates in children. The data from Study R668-AD-
1412 were not utilized for the model building because of higher prevalence of ADA due to the dosing 
regimen and a small representation of patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD.
Pop PK Parameters and results:
A standard two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) 
elimination was used. This model was developed using adult data and replicated in adolescents. Transit-
compartment model of absorption was represented in the model by mean transit time (MTT) and 
absorption rate (ka). The inter-patient variability was implemented in central volume (V2) and elimination 
rate (ke).

Three (albumin, EASI score, and weight) of six covariates which were found statistically significant in 
adults were also statistically significant in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with no meaningful impact of 
albumin and EASI on between-subject variability. The statistically significant impact of ADA and body 
mass index (BMI) on elimination rate and race on central volume in adults was not replicated in children 
≥6 to <12 years of age possibly due to considerably smaller sample size, lower prevalence of ADA, and 
low BMI.
The impact of weight on V2 was similar in children ≥6 to <12 years of age, adolescents, and adults. The 
impact of albumin on V2 was similar in children ≥6 to <12 years of age and adults. The impact of EASI on 
ke was similar in children ≥6 to <12 years of age and adults and was ~2-fold higher in adolescents that 
in children ≥6 to <12 years of age and adults. No dose adjustment for EASI and albumin was done in 
adults and adolescents. As albumin and EASI explained small portion of between-subject variability and 
the therapeutic index of dupilumab is wide3,6, the impact of this covariates did not warrant a dose 
adjustment in children ≥6 to <12 years of age.
When weight is used as a covariate in the population PK model, age does not have a significant impact on 
V2 and ke indicating that when dupilumab treatment is adjusted for weight there is no need to adjust 
dosing regimens for age within ≥6 to <12 age group. 
Sensitivity Analyses
Several sensitivity analyses (SA) were conducted: PK parameter estimated at median weight , profiling of 
Km, testing age as covariate, using the primary covariate model with all outliers and patients, using 
parametrization of covariate model using clearance (ke*Vc), using bioavailability of 80.4% , population 
PK parameters of model with adult absorption rate.

2.3.1.5.  Absorption, distribution and elimination
The estimated rate of absorption in children ≥6 to <12 years of age (0.641 1/d) was higher than adults 
(0.306 1/d) and consistent with the higher reported absorption rates in children.  The extent of 
absorption (bioavailability) in children was not estimated due to lack of intravenous (IV) data. In the adult 
AD patient population, dupilumab is well absorbed with a reported bioavailability of 64%, which was fixed 
for the paediatric populations (see population PK model). 
Estimation of the apparent central compartment volume of distribution (V2) yielded slightly lower values 
for children ≥6 to <12 years of age vs. adults (2.18±0.087 vs. 2.74±0.021 L, respectively, for a 
reference body weight of 75 kg in each population).  At the median body weight of 29.4 kg, V2 was 
estimated as 0.999 L.  
The PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways 
(target-mediated clearance), with the target-mediated pathway expressing a high degree of nonlinearity. 
The target-mediated clearance (Vm) somewhat decreased with age across children ≥6 to <12 years of 
age, adolescents, and adults; no allometric differences (decrease with weight) in elimination rate (ke) 
were observed. 
The statistically significant impact of ADA and body mass index (BMI) on elimination rate and race on 
central volume in adults was not replicated in children ≥6 to <12 years of age possibly due to 
considerably smaller sample size, lower prevalence of ADA, and low BMI.
Based on pop PK results, clearance was estimated to 0.0972 L/d which is slightly lower to Clearance 
calculated for adolescents (0.128 L/d) and the adult population (0.131 L/d)
2.3.1.6.  Dose proportionality and time dependencies
Dose proportionality
Dupilumab is, like other monoclonal antibodies, characterized by linear and nonlinear target-mediated 
kinetics. This nonlinear PK profile is typically observed at drug concentrations below that required to 
saturate the target-mediated pathway, resulting in a greater than dose proportional increase in exposure 
(initial AD marketing application). As drug concentrations increase to levels greater than those required 
to saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK profile reverts to a linear and dose-proportional profile. 
Steady state
In children ≥6 to <12 years of age, systemic concentrations of dupilumab achieved steady state in all 
treatment regimens before the primary endpoint at week 16. Steady state was achieved in accordance 
with the dosing interval and loading dose; for Q2W dosing with 200 mg, starting with a loading dose of 
400 mg, observed data and population PK analysis determined steady-state concentrations to be 
achieved at or before week 8. For the 300 mg Q4W regimen, starting with a loading dose of 600 mg, 
steady state was achieved at or before week 12.
Loading dose and Accumulation
Dupilumab was studied in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD when administered with a loading dose 
as in adult and adolescent patients with AD.  Patients weighing <30 kg to be treated with 300 mg Q4W 
should be administered a total loading dose of 600 mg.  Patients weighing ≥30 kg to be treated with 200 
mg Q2W should be administered a total loading dose of 400 mg. 
Mean Ctrough for the Q2W regimen observed at week 4 were about 14% lower than that at week 16.  In 
contrast, mean Ctrough for the Q4W regimen observed at week 4 were about 21% higher than that at week 
16.  
Despite the higher concentrations after the 600 mg loading dose compared to steady-state concentrations 
in children <30 kg receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen, the observed efficacy at week 16 was similar to 
that observed with the 200 mg Q2W regimen following a 400mg loading dose in children ≥30 kg, 
indicating no impact of higher concentrations on drug effect at week 16.  No safety findings were

associated with the higher drug concentrations after the 600 mg loading dose compared to steady-state 
concentrations in children <30 kg receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen.
2.3.1.7.  Special populations
Covariates (Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors) Affecting Pharmacokinetics
Three of six covariates which were found statistically significant in adults were also statistically significant 
in children ≥6 to <12 years of age, as indicated by population PK modelling.
Body weight is the primary covariate affecting the PK of dupilumab, and fixed weight-tiered dosing 
regimens were previously used to adjust exposure differences caused by body weight across the 
adolescent patient population with AD. 
The impact of weight on volume of distribution V2 was similar in children ≥6 to <12 years of age, 
adolescents, and adults. Dupilumab regimens of 300 mg Q4W in patients <30 kg and 200 mg Q2W in 
patients ≥30 kg exhibited similar exposures in the pivotal study R668-AD-1652 and higher exposures 
than those of 100 mg Q2W in patients <30 kg and 300 mg Q4W in patients ≥30 kg (refer to Figures 1 
and 2 in section PK comparison across populations).
Based on population PK analysis, age had no clinically meaningful impact on dupilumab PK in children ≥6 
to <12 years of age after accounting for differences in body size by weight. 
Based on the population PK analysis, baseline EASI score had a positive, statistically significant 
association with the nonlinear elimination rate of dupilumab in children ≥6 to <12 years of age.  This 
correlation was consistent with that previously observed in adult and adolescent patients with AD but was 
not considered clinically meaningful.  The impact of EASI on elimination rate ke was similar in children ≥6 
to <12 years of age and adults and was ~2-fold higher in adolescents that in children ≥6 to <12 years of 
age and adults. Patients with lower disease burden at baseline exhibit slightly higher exposure of 
dupilumab, but the difference is small and does not warrant a dose adjustment.
The impact of albumin on V2 was similar in children ≥6 to <12 years of age and adults.
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics
The human monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4) antibody Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the 
Type I receptor (IL 4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-
13Rα). Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine- induced responses, including the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE.
Primary and secondary pharmacology
TARC 
The time course of Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC) percent change from baseline 
over time was analyzed as a biomarker/PD of AD disease severity over time and PD marker of efficacy.  
Median TARC concentration profiles in children aged ≥6 to <12 years with AD were compared to that of 
adults and adolescents with AD by dupilumab treatment regimen as a measure of disease activity over 
time.
Pharmacodynamic profiles of TARC in children ≥6 to <12 years of age (Figure 7) show a similar median 
magnitude of effect over time by dose regimen to that of adolescents and adults at approved dose 
regimens.

Immunogenicity
Samples that were positive in the ADA assay were examined for neutralizing (NAb) activity.  For samples 
testing negative in the ADA assay, NAb results were set to negative. The impact of immunogenicity (ADA 
category and NAb status) on functional dupilumab concentration was assessed by plotting individual 
functional dupilumab concentrations by time (weeks), ADA category, and NAb status.
The pivotal study R668-AD-1652 was the primary source for the immunogenicity assessment of 
dupilumab in children aged ≥6 to <12 years with AD, as it was the largest randomized, controlled study 
in this population. The OLE study (R668-AD-1434) allowed additional longitudinal monitoring of ADA 
positive patients and observation of immunogenicity responses over time, especially in those patients who 
had previously participated in the phase 2a study R668-AD-1412.
The ADA status and category of each patient was classified as one of the following:  
 Negative - If all samples are found to be negative in the ADA assay, or if the baseline sample 
is positive (ie, pre-existing ADA) and all post baseline ADA titers are reported as less than 4-
fold the baseline titer value.


Treatment-boosted - A positive result at baseline in the ADA assay with at least 1 post 
baseline titer result ≥4-fold the baseline titer value.
Treatment-emergent - A negative result or missing result at baseline with at least 1 positive 
post baseline result in the ADA assay

Persistent - A positive result in the ADA assay detected in at least 2 consecutive post 
baseline samples separated by at least a 12-week post baseline period [based on nominal 
sampling time], with no ADA-negative results in-between, regardless of any missing 
samples
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 33/117
 
 


Indeterminate  -  A  positive  result  in  the  ADA  assay at  the last  collection  time  point  only, 
regardless of any missing samples
Transient - Not persistent or indeterminate, regardless of any missing samples
In addition, the maximum response titers for each patient are categorized as High/Moderate/Low as 
follows: Low (titer <1,000), Moderate (1,000≤ titer ≤10,000) and High (titer >10,000).
Study R668-AD-1652 (phase 3 pivotal study)
In the pivotal study R668-AD-1652, the overall prevalence of observed immunogenicity in children aged 
≥6 to <12 years with severe AD was low. There were no ADA-positive patients in the 300 mg Q4W + TCS 
group.  The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in the dupilumab 100 mg Q2W + TCS and dupilumab 
200 mg Q2W + TCS groups was 4.9%, and 5.3% respectively and that of placebo + TCS group was 1.7% 
(Table 4).  In these low ADA titer responses, the majority were transient in nature; persistent ADA 
responses were observed in 1 patient (<1%). There were no high titer responses in the study (Table 16).  
Two patients in the dupilumab 100 mg Q2W + TCS group (3.3%) and 1 patient in the dupilumab 200 mg 
Q2W + TCS group (1.8%) showed a positive response in the NAb assay (Table 17).

Association of immunogenicity and dupilumab exposure
There was no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure 
or response in R668-AD-1652.  Anti-drug antibody-positive and NAb-positive patients exhibited individual 
concentration-time profiles in the range of ADA- and NAb-negative patients for the dupilumab Q2W + TCS 
group (Figure 10, Figure 11).

Figure 12
Figure 13
In the 100 mg Q2W Group in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with AD (Figure 10, Figure 11), one 
patient fell outside of the distribution. However, this patient was originally randomized to placebo and 
erroneously received one dose at week 2 of 100 mg Q2W. Therefore, a low titer ADA was not expected to 
have led to the low concentration-time profile observed.
In the 200 mg Q2W group, in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with AD (Figure 12,Figure 12), one 
patient fell outside of the distribution and exhibited concentrations below the LLOQ over the entire time 
course of treatment. This patient had a baseline weight of <30 kg and was mis-stratified to the 200 mg 
Q2W group ≥30. The patient received one loading dose and as a result of mis-stratification, discontinued 
the drug, but remained in the study. Therefore, the low ADA titer was not expected to have led to the low 
concentration-time profile observed for this subject.
Association of immunogenicity and concentration-response
There was no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab efficacy. 
ADA-positive and NAb-positive patients exhibited individual effect-time profiles (both NRS and % EASI 
change from baseline) in the range of ADA and NAb-negative patients for the dupilumab Q2W + TCS 
group (Figure 14 to Figure 17).

Figure 14- 17
Study R668-AD-1412 (phase 2a PK study)
In the phase 2a PK study R668-AD-1412, patients ≥6 to <12 years received a single dose of dupilumab 
(2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) followed by an 8-week observation period to assess PK, followed by 4 additional 
weekly doses.  This dosing regimen invoked a significant ADA response, with the ADA in 5 patients 
observed to have moderate or high titers.  Overall, in this study, a positive response in the ADA assay at 
any time was observed in 21 children ≥6 to <12 years of age (56.8%), 11 of which (29.7% of total 37 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age) were categorized as having a persistent, treatment-emergent ADA 
response.  The rate of occurrence of persistent ADA was similar across cohorts (33.3% [6/18] patients in 
the 2 mg/kg cohort and 26.3% [5/19] patients in the 4 mg/kg cohort).  The majority of the treatment-
emergent positive responses in the ADA assay were categorized as low titer.
As noted above, in 5 patients this treatment regimen resulted in moderate or high ADA titers and those 
were associated with a substantial reduction in detectable drug concentrations and a lack of notable 
improvement in EASI score (Figure 10).  These patients who continued treatment (in part B and OLE) 
resulted in declining ADA titers and a corresponding increase in systemic concentrations of dupilumab as 
well as an improvement in the EASI percent change from baseline.  In 1 patient with elevated titers and 
low concentrations, the efficacy (EASI percent change from baseline) was high and comparable to the 
other 4 patients. In conclusion, as seen with adolescents, a single dose of dupilumab followed, after 8 
weeks (a prolonged pause), by a rechallenge led to a “prime and boost” immune response to dupilumab.  
These data suggest that with continued dupilumab treatment a portion of patients can be treated through 
this ADA response with restoration of efficacy.

Table 21: Summary of ADA Status and NAb Status by Parent Study in Patients ≥6 to <12 Years 
of Age with AD (Study R668-AD-1434)
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADA for patients ≥6 to <12 years of age in R668-AD-1434 
was 8.3% (23/278) (Table 5). Higher rates of treatment-emergent ADA were observed for patients from 
parent study R668 AD 1412 (42.4%, 14/33) than from parent study R668-AD-1652 (3.7%, 9/246).  
Positive ADA in most patients were transient, of a low titer, and negative for NAb.  All patients positive for 
NAb and all but 1 patient with a moderate or ADA high titer were from parent study R668-AD-1412.  The 
elevated immunogenicity in patients from R668-AD-1412 is attributed to intermittent dosing in that study 
which included an 8-week washout following a single dose not unlike a prime and boost regimen used for 
vaccinations.  This is in contrast to the multiple Q2W or Q4W doses administered continuously for 16 
weeks in R668-AD-1652.
The distribution of dupilumab concentrations for ADA positive patients ≥6 to <12 years of age was 
generally within the range of concentrations of ADA negative patients with the exception of a few patients 
with high/moderate ADA titers.  
Longitudinal assessment indicated that most patients from R668-AD-1412 who entered the current study 
with moderate or high titers exhibited a decrease in titer values over time with a corresponding increase 
in dupilumab concentrations. Efficacy, as determined by percent change from baseline in EASI score, also 
generally improved in these patients with continued troughout the study (Figure 10, presented in section 
on phase 2 PK study R668-AD-1412). 
A single patient from R668-AD-1412 with a high ADA titer level in the parent study exhibited dupilumab 
concentrations at or near the lower limit of quantification for the duration of the current study. Despite 
dupilumab concentrations that were not measurable at trough sampling points while on the 2 mg/kg QW 
regimen, this patient responded to treatment with a maximum change from baseline in EASI score of -
100% at week48 in the current study. At Week 94, this patient was transitioned to 300 mg Q4W following 
approval of amendment 1. EASI score increased following the switch and, based on inadequate response, 
the patient was uptitrated to the more intense 200 mg Q2W regimen at Week 102 and EASI score 
subsequently decreased.

Exposure-Response Relationships:
Methods:
For children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD, the E-R analysis sets consist of the PK analysis set 
and one non-missing baseline and at least 1 non-missing post dose Eczema Area and Severity Index 
(EASI), Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), or pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) value, as 
applicable for each E-R assessment.
Exposure-response analyses were based on data from the weight-tiered 100/200 mg Q2W and non-
weight-tiered 300 mg Q4W dosing regimens of study R668-AD-1652.
Logistic regression was performed to investigate the E-R relationship between probability of achieving IGA 
0 or 1, EASI-50, EASI-75, and EASI-90 with Ctrough at week 16. Missing efficacy data were imputed as 
non-responders for the binary variables and missing concentration data were imputed using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) to account for the effect of censored data due to dropout.
Additionally, quartile analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between efficacy endpoints 
and quartiles of exposure. Endpoints included the percentage of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1 and the 
mean (standard deviation [SD]) percent change in EASI from baseline over time by quartile of functional 
dupilumab concentration. For the endpoint of percentage of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1, missing data 
were treated as non-responders, and for percent change in EASI from baseline, data after use of rescue 
treatment were imputed using LOCF. Censored concentration data were imputed using LOCF. 
The E-R analysis related to safety was conducted using a logistic regression method to assess the 
relationship between the incidence of conjunctivitis over 16 weeks and Ctrough at week 16.

Exposure-response analysis of the relationship between quartile of dupilumab Ctrough with the primary 
efficacy endpoint, percentage of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1, showed a trend of increasing drug effect 
with increasing quartile of Ctrough of dupilumab over time (Figure 8 above). 
Similar E-R relationships were observed for other efficacy endpoints including percent of patients 
achieving EASI-75 (primary imputation method), and EASI percent change from baseline (LOCF method, 
Figure 10 above). 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the same rank ordering of concentration quartiles was preserved for the 
E-R relationships for the completer analyses.
Cumulative decile concentration analysis showed that for the most stringent efficacy endpoint of EASI-90 
and IGA 0 or 1), the time course of drug effect was saturated by week 16 at higher concentrations 
compared to the least stringent endpoints of EASI-50. 
Logistic regression on binary response variables such as the primary and co-primary endpoints of IGA 0 
or 1 (Figure 15) and EASI-75 (Figure 16) also demonstrate positive exposure-response relationships, 
showing increasing effect with increasing steady-state Ctrough of dupilumab.
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Bioanalytical methods
Methods applied for the detection of functional dupilumab and for the detection of anti-dupilumab 
antibodies and neutralizing antibodies correspond to the methods already utilized and described in 
previous applications. Incurred sample reanalysis was conducted in study R668-AD-1412 and confirmed 
that the assay produced robust and reproducible results in the paediatric AD population.
Pharmacokinetics
The package on clinical pharmacology regarding children of this age group with severe AD comprises 3 
dupilumab clinical studies where PK and PD data have been collected. A phase 3 pivotal study (R668-AD-
1652) was conducted with patients of this age group and the results of two further studies, R668-AD-
1412 (Phase 2a PK) and R668-AD-1434 (OLE), provide further supporting data. A variety of subcutaneous 
(SC) dosing regimens for dupilumab was evaluated in these studies including 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg single 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 45/117
 
 
dose or repeated QW dose (phase 2 PK study), weight-tiered 100 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W (below and 
above 30 kg) and non-weight-tiered 300 mg Q4W following loading doses of two times the maintenance 
doses for the respective dosing regimen (pivotal study) as well as weight-tiered 100 mg or 200 mg Q2W 
as up-titration from 300 mg Q4W (OLE).  
A weight-tiered regimen of 100 mg Q2W for children ≥15 to <30 kg and 200 mg Q2W for children ≥30 
kg, as well as the non-weight-tiered 300 mg Q4W, were selected for the pivotal study R668-AD-1652 with 
the aim of matching the dupilumab exposure distribution in children aged ≥6 to <12 years to that 
achieved with the approved 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults.
Population PK 
A population PK analysis for dupilumab in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis 
was conducted using data from the Study R668-AD-1652. Appropriate methods were used for model 
development and evaluation. Dupilumab concentration-time data were described by a two-compartment 
population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear Michaelis-Menten (MM) elimination and transit 
compartments for absorption. Weight was included as a covariate on V2 in all models. EASI on ke and 
albumin on V2 were identified as additional significant covariates. 
Parameters were estimated with good precision in both the base and covariate models, with all RSE 
<11% and <28%, respectively. Diagnostic plots for both base and covariate models demonstrated an 
adequate fit to the data.
Re-estimation of PK parameters while using the same model structure for describing adult and adolescent 
data is supported. However, the re-estimation was conducted based on PK samples from the pivotal study 
R668-AD-1652 only (N=925).  PK data were balanced with respect to sex (50.2% female, 49.8 % male). 
ADA incidence was highest in the 200 mg Q2W group (5.1%) with overall low incidence (2.4%) and no 
ADA positivity in the Q4W treatment group. 
The base and covariate models adequately described the PK of dupilumab in children aged ≥6 to <12 
years with severe AD. Population PK parameters were essentially the same in the base and covariate 
models. The parameters of the base/covariate models were generally consistent with those previously 
estimated for adult and adolescent populations with moderate-to-severe AD, although there were some 
numeric differences. The target-mediated clearance (Vm) somewhat decreased with age across children ≥
6 to <12 years of age, adolescents, and adults; no allometric differences (decrease with weight) in 
elimination rate (ke) were observed. Comparisons using the covariate models suggest that central volume 
(V2) calculated at weight of 75 kg slightly increased with age.
Several PK parameters were fixed (Vm, Km, intercompartmental distribution rates k23 and k32, ke, MTT, 
and bioavailability F), similar to the model adolescent patients. Ka (0.641 1/d) deviates from the 
adolescent and adult model (0.306 1/d), whereas F remains to the same fix value of 0.642. It is agreed 
that a more precise estimation of F is not feasible due to the lack of IV PK data in the paediatric 
population. In contrast, the absorption rate (ka) was fixed to a value of 0.641 1/d estimated using semi-
sparse data of ≥6 to <12 years of age subpopulation of study R668-AD-1412. 
It is agreed with the MAH that higher absorption rate is expected in children. However, a higher 
bioavailabilty F is also likely in this age group as seen for other monoclonal antibodies. Due to the 
relatively small size of population PK dataset in patients >6 to ≤12 years of age (N=241 patients) 
compared to the adult dataset (N=2115 patients), a full covariate analysis was not conducted. Three of 
six covariates which were found statistically significant in adults were also statistically significant in 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age. The covariate coefficients for albumin, EASI score, and weight were 
statistically significant similarly to those in the adult model with no meaningful impact of albumin and 
EASI on between-subject variability. The statistically significant impact of ADA and body mass index 
(BMI) on elimination rate and race on central volume in adults was not replicated in children ≥6 to <12 
years of age possibly due to considerably smaller sample size, lower prevalence of ADA, and low BMI.

The impact of BMI and ke could not be replicated in children from 6 to 12 years of age. Thus, there is no 
body size related influence incorporated in the pop PK model for the youngest age group. It is argued by 
CHMP that BMI was notably lower in children ≥6 to <12 years of age than in adolescents and adults 
(16.9, 22.5, and 24.9 kg/m2, respectively), which can potentially explain the absence of the association 
of ke and BMI in the youngest age group. However, as body weight or body size related effects are known 
and expected to have an influence on PK (CL and V), this is not considered plausible to the CHMP. Forest 
plots have been provided and demonstrated the modest influence of body weight on PK.
The extent of absorption (Bioavailability, F) was not estimated in children ≥6 to <12 years population due 
to the lack of intravenous (IV) data. Estimation of the apparent central compartment volume of 
distribution (V2) yielded slightly lower values for children ≥6 to <12 years of age vs. adults (2.18±0.087 
vs. 2.74±0.021 L, respectively, for a reference body weight of 75 kg in each population).  At the median 
body weight of 29.4 kg, V2 was estimated as 0.999 L.  
Based on pop PK results, clearance was estimated to 0.0972 L/d, which is slightly lower to Clearance 
calculated for adolescents (0.128 L/d) and the adult population (0.131 L/d).
Overall, the PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination 
pathways (target-mediated clearance). Clearance slightly decreases with age across children ≥6 to <12 
years of age, adolescents, and adults.  
Steady state was achieved in all treatment regimens in accordance with dosing intervals and loading 
doses before week 16.  
PK and PD comparison across populations
For children receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen at any body weight, the 5th percentile and median of 
CtroughSS were higher than for adolescents receiving the 200/300 mg Q2W regimen but lower than 
adults receiving the 300 mg Q2W regimen. For the 100 mg Q2W regimen in children at body weight <30 
kg, the 5th percentile and median of CtroughSS were lower compared to children receiving the 200 mg 
Q2W regimen at body weight ≥30 kg and the 300 mg Q4W regimen at body weight <30 kg. 
The 95th percentile and median of simulated Cmax at steady state (Cmaxss) in children receiving the 200 
mg Q2W regimen at body weight ≥30 kg were higher compared to adolescents receiving the 200/300 mg 
Q2W regimens and adults receiving the 300 mg Q2W regimen, but lower compared to adults receiving 
the 300 mg QW regimen. Upon request, the MAH justified that the higher steady-state Cmax predicted in 
children receiving the 200 mg Q2W regimen at body weight ≥30 kg is unlikely to have safety 
implications, which can be acceptable as discussed further in the report.
For the 300 mg Q4W regimen in children at body weight <30 kg, the 95th percentile and median of 
simulated CmaxSS were higher compared to adolescents receiving the 200/300 mg Q2W regimens and 
adults receiving the 300 mg Q2W regimen. The median of simulated CmaxSS in children at body weight 
<30 kg receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen was also higher compared to adults receiving the 300 mg QW 
regimen but the 95th percentile of CmaxSS was lower. Further, following the loading dose of 600 mg for 
the 300 mg Q4W regimen in children of any weight, the 95th percentile and median of Cmax were around 
2-fold higher than after the 400 mg loading dose for the 200 mg Q2W regimen in children of body weight 
≥30 kg. This suggests there may be safety implications for the proposed 600 mg loading dose and 300 
mg Q4W regimen for children at body weight <30 kg. 
Despite the higher concentrations after the 600 mg loading dose compared to steady-state concentrations 
in children <30 kg receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen, the observed efficacy at week 16 was similar to 
that observed with the 200 mg Q2W regimen following a 400mg loading dose in children ≥30 kg, 
indicating no impact of higher concentrations on drug effect at week 16. Furthermore, no safety findings 
were associated with the higher drug concentrations after the 600 mg loading dose compared to steady-
state concentrations in children <30 kg receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 47/117
 
 
The higher steady state Cmax in children ≥15 - <30 kg compared to that of the 300 mg Q2W regimen in 
adults and 200 or 300 mg Q2W regimen in adolescents is not considered to be a safety concern given the 
established safety of the dupilumab 300 mg QW regimen in adults and the totality of safety data from 
R668-AD-1652 and the OLE study R668-AD-1434 with the 300 mg Q4W dose in children ≥15 - <30 kg.
Overall the PK/PD has been appropriately demonstrated across populations of children from 6 to 11 years 
of age and from 15 to 60 kgs.
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity was analysed in all clinical studies including children ≥6 to <12 years of age. 
In pivotal study R668-AD-1652, the overall prevalence of observed immunogenicity was low (ADA 
positive 2.3%) and all ADA responses were of low titer. There were no patients positive for ADA in the 
300 mg Q4W + TCS group and the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 4.9% and 5.3% in the 
dupilumab 100 mg Q2W + TCS and dupilumab 200 mg Q2W + TCS group, respectively. Only two patients 
in the dupilumab 100 mg Q2W + TCS group (3.3%) and 1 patient in the dupilumab 200 mg Q2W + TCS 
group (1.8%) showed positive responses in the NAb assay.  It is therefore agreed by CHMP that no clear 
evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure or response was 
observed in study R668-AD-1652.
In Study R668-AD-1412, a marked positive response in the ADA assay at any time was observed in 
56.8% of children ≥6 to <12 years of age, and 29.7% were categorized having a persistent, treatment-
emergent ADA response. The majority of the treatment-emergent positive responses in the ADA assay 
were categorized as low titers, but in 5 of 37 patients moderate or high titers were observed and those 
were associated with a substantial reduction in detectable drug concentrations and a lack of notable 
improvement in EASI score. With continuing treatment through Part B of the study (a repeat-dose 
treatment period [4 weekly doses] and an 8-week follow-up period) and subsequently in the OLE study, 
ADA titers declined and a corresponding increase in systemic concentrations of dupilumab as well as an 
improvement in the EASI percent change from baseline was observed in all but one of the 5 patients 
having moderate to high ADA titers. Similar results were observed in this study for the group of 
adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age but was not observed in the pivotal dupilumab studies R668-AD-
1652 and R668-AD-1562 with children and adolescents, respectively. Study R668-AD-1412 utilized a 
dosing regimen akin to a prime and boost vaccination regimen that could have accounted for the higher 
incidence of ADA than in any other study in the dupilumab development program.   
In the extension study R668-AD-1434, positive ADA in most patients were transient, of a low titer, and 
negative for NAb. Higher rates of treatment-emergent ADA were observed for patients from parent study 
R668-AD-1412. Further, all patients positive for Nab and all but 1 patient with moderate or high ADA titer 
were from parent study R688-AD-1412. Longitudinal assessment of ADA titers over a greater than 2-year 
period in children ≥6 to <12 years of age who had developed high ADA titers showed that with 
continuation of treatment, ADA titers declined, with corresponding incline of functional dupilumab 
concentration and improvement of EASI score.
Exposure-Response
The mean (±SD) EASI and NRS percent (%) change from baseline in conjunction with systemic 
dupilumab concentrations were found to be non-discriminating of dosing regimens. 
The E-R relationships over time, whether assessed by percent change from baseline in EASI, or percent 
achieving IGA 0 or 1 with quartiles of trough concentrations; or by logistic regression of binary endpoints 
(EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90 and IGA 0 or 1), suggested a trend for increasing drug effects with 
increasing trough concentration of dupilumab. These E-R findings support the clinical benefit of the 
regimens resulting in the highest systemic exposure of dupilumab in children ≥6 to <12 years of age: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 48/117
 
 
300 mg Q4W in children <30 kg. This holds partly for the 200 mg Q2W regimen in children ≥30 kg in 
comparison with the 300 mg Q4W regimen.
To ensure adequate efficacy of dupilumab at different body weights, the MAH was asked to provide 
exposure-response relationships stratified by body weight and dosing regimen. The requested plots were 
provided and showed a similar trend of increasing response with increasing concentration in both weight 
groups.
No relationship with respect to safety can be found; probability of patients developing conjunctivitis 
(broad term) with dupilumab Ctrough at week 16 showed a slight trend for an inverse E-R relationship 
with the highest probability of developing conjunctivitis observed at lower drug concentrations. No long-
term data is available at this stage to further inform E-R with respect to safety.
Discussion of recommended dose
The proposed posology in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD is tiered by body weight with 
patients ≥15 to <30 kg receiving 300 mg Q4W following a 600 mg loading dose and with patients ≥30 to 
<60 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W following a 400 mg loading dose. 
For children ≥6 to <12 years of age weighing ≥60 kg, the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg Q2W 
following a loading dose of 600 mg, since this dose regimen has been proven to achieve the desired 
effective exposure in adults and adolescents weighing ≥60 kg.
Observed PK data support the proposed posology in children ≥6 to <12 years of age: 200 mg Q2W 
regimen in the children weighing ≥30 kg and 300 mg Q4W regimen in children <30 kg as the dosing 
regimens achieving drug concentrations that are at least similar to or greater than that achieved by the 
standard 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults. However, the benefit of the 4 weeks program for children 
between 6 and 12 years of age, together with comparable efficacy and exposure to adults and the lack of 
long-term safety data at higher exposure levels needs to be taken into account for dose selection. 
Exposure simulations have been provided based on the base pop PK model for age group 6 – 12 years of 
age. Simulations for body weight cut-off selection (cut-off for switching from 300 mg Q4W to the 200 mg 
Q2W regimen (proposed as 30 kg) and to the 300 mg Q4W regimen (proposed at 60 kg)) were to be 
provided taking E-R analysis and data from the OLE study into account. For weight group > 60 kg, there 
were only few subjects below the age of 12 in this weight category. E-R analysis showed high 
comparability between 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W for paediatric patients in the weight group 30-60 
kg, characterized by a flat exposure response curve for both dosing regimens considering also body 
weight quartiles. Simulations showed that steady state exposure (Ctrough) is expected to be lower in 
each weight category with the 300 mg Q4W regimen compared to the 200 mg Q2W regimen.  Exposure-
response analyses indicate that the 200 mg Q2W regimen may be associated with improved efficacy. 
After switching to the 200 mg Q2W regimen, there appeared to be a small increase in IGA0/1 and EASI-
75 in the lower weight categories. However, a conclusion that the 200 mg Q2W regimen is more effective 
than the 300 mg Q4W regimen is not possible due to the limited number of patients with results at Week 
52.  
Loading dose
Due to the flat dosing regimen that was followed in the Phase 3 study, paediatric patients of low body 
weight received a very high loading dose of 600mg that exceeds exposures of adolescent and adult 
patients. Thus, loading dose 600 mg was deemed not justified from the PK point of view by CHMP. 
Exposure predictions and the data collected support high expected levels. Thus, the MAH was asked to 
discuss the need for such a high loading dose for paediatrics < 30 and to conduct simulations to select a 
body weight cut that justifies the need of a loading dose in the 300 mg Q4W setting for all paediatric 
patients. In response, simulations comprised an alternative modelled scenario: the 600 mg loading dose 
was split (300 mg administered on D1 and 300 mg on D15 followed by the 300 mg Q4W therapy starting 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 49/117
 
 
4 weeks after D15 dose. Simulation results showed that with this amended posology, rapid Ctrough levels 
will be achieved in this paediatric age group (in both weight categories 15-30 kg and 30–60 kg), while 
very high Cmax level are avoided.

and Mean) Treatment Group=300 mg - Day 0, 300 mg Q4W SC - Day 14, Weight Group <30 kg 
Figure 27. Simulated Concentration of Functional Dupilumab over Time (Percentiles, Median, 
and Mean) Treatment Group=300 mg - Day 0, 300 mg Q4W SC - Day 14, Weight Group ≥30 kg 
In conclusion, a loading dose of 600 mg administered 300 mg at Day 1 and 300 mg at Day 15 will avoid 
peak concentrations while rapidly achieving efficacy at Cmin levels. This was also shown by exposure 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 50/117
 
 
simulations for both weight categories 15-30 kg and 30-60 kg. As such, splitting the loading dose 
accordingly is deemed the optimal setting for patients below 30 kg. 
As patients with a body weight <15 kg were not included in the pivotal study, a statement that dupilumab 
should not be used paediatric patients weighing <15 kg is included in the SmPC. 
Dosing regimen
Further, higher predicted Cmax at steady state in children receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen at body 
weight <30 kg compared to adolescents receiving the 200/300 mg Q2W regimens and adults receiving 
the 300 mg Q2W/Q4W are not considered to be a safety concern given the established safety of the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW regimen in adults and the totality of safety data from R668-AD-1652 and the OLE 
study R668-AD-1434 with the 300 mg Q4W dose in children ≥15 - <30 kg. Consequently, a dosing 
regimen of 300mg Q4W is recommended for approval for patients 15 to 60kg. The posology for patients 
weighting more than 60 kgs is recommended as initial dose of 300 mg in two injections followed by 
subsequent doses of 300mg Q2W. 
In summary, the recommended dose of dupilumab for children 6 to 11 years of age as stated in the 
posology section of the SmPC is specified below.

based on physician’s assessment.
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH provided a comprehensive package on clinical pharmacology to support the dosing regimen in 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD. 
CHMP recommended splitting of the high loading dose of 600 mg for paediatric patients below 60 kg is 
recommended to avoid early peak concentrations while resulting in rapid attainment of steady state 
concentrations similarly to the one dose loading of 600 mg as originally proposed and tested in pediatric 
studies.
The proposed posology in this patient group is tiered by body weight. The recommended doses are 300 
mg Q4W with the possibility to increase to 200 mg Q2W (15 kg to < 60 kg), following a loading dose of 
300 mg (one 300 mg injection), followed by a second injection of 300 mg 2 weeks later (600 mg loading 
in total) before staring the Q4W program after  4 weeks.
For patients of this age group (≥6 to <12 years) weighing ≥60 kg, the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg 
Q2W following a loading dose of 600 mg which is equal to the dose regimen in adults and adolescents 
weighing ≥60 kg. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy
The phase 3, placebo-controlled, pivotal study R668-AD-1652 provides the primary efficacy evaluation in 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD and is the focus of discussion in this section. The phase 3 OLE 
study R668-AD-1434 provides additional data to support long-term efficacy in children of this age group 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 51/117
 
 
who had participated in a previous dupilumab AD clinical study. The phase 2a open-label PK study R668-
AD-1412 provides additional supportive efficacy information.
Studies R668-AD-1434 and R668-AD-1412 allowed, but did not require, concomitant use of topical 
treatments; therefore, the efficacy data from these studies support the use of dupilumab with or without 
topical treatment.
In addition, a comparison of the efficacy data in children with that of the adolescent and adult populations 
is provided.
2.4.1.  Main study
R668-AD-1652 - Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-
Group 16-week Treatment Duration Monotherapy Study
Methods
Study R668-AD-1652 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD whose disease could not be adequately 
controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable (eg, 
intolerance, other important side effects, or safety risks). The primary objective of the study was to 
demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab in combination with TCS after 16 weeks of treatment in patients 
≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD.  
Study Flow Diagram
The study consisted of the following 3 periods: screening of up to 9 weeks, a TCS standardization period 
of 2 weeks, a treatment period of 16 weeks, and a follow-up period of 12 weeks (for patients who did not 
enter the OLE).  Patients were offered the opportunity to screen for the pediatric OLE study at the end of 
treatment.  Patients who declined to participate in the OLE study were followed for 12 weeks after 
completion of treatment. 
Starting on day −14, all patients initiated a standardized TCS treatment regimen with a medium potency 
TCS, with adjustments based on clinical response.  The use of other concurrent topical therapies for AD 
was not permitted.  However, if medically necessary (ie, IGA score = 4 or to control intolerable AD 
symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could be provided to study patients as needed at the discretion of 
the investigator.  
Study Participants 
Key Eligibility Criteria
The inclusion/exclusion criteria for R668-AD-1652 were designed to ensure that only children with severe 
AD, whose disease was not adequately controlled with topical treatment, were included.  In addition, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 52/117
 
 
patients with other concomitant diseases or conditions that may have confounded efficacy and safety 
assessments were excluded from the studies.
The inclusion criteria for this population of children specified male and female patients ≥6 to <12 years of 
age with chronic AD (present for at least 1 year and meeting the American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria (Eichenfield, 2014).  Following a 2-week TCS standardization period, required baseline 
AD severity scores for eligibility were IGA score = 4, EASI score ≥21, ≥15% BSA involvement with AD, 
and worst itch weekly average score for maximum itch intensity ≥4.
Patients were also required either to have a documented recent history (within 6 months before the 
screening visit) of an inadequate response to treatment with topical medications.  An inadequate 
response was defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low disease activity state 
(comparable to IGA 0=clear to 2=mild) despite treatment with a daily regimen of TCS of medium to 
higher potency (±TCI as appropriate), applied for at least 28 days. Patients with documented systemic 
treatment for AD (systemic immunosuppressant drugs such as ciclosporin, MTX, corticosteroids, etc) in 
the past 6 months were also considered inadequate responders to topical treatments and were potentially 
eligible for treatment with dupilumab after an appropriate washout period.  In addition to application of 
TCS throughout the study, all patients were required to apply a stable dose of topical emollient 
(moisturizer) twice daily for at least 7 consecutive days before the baseline visit and throughout the 
study.
Exclusion criteria designed to prevent confounding of efficacy results included prior participation in a 
dupilumab clinical study, treatment with any other systemic investigational product, treatment with a 
topical investigational drug, crisaborole, or TCI within 2 weeks prior to baseline visit, treatment with 
systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating agent or phototherapy for AD within 4 weeks prior to 
baseline visit, treatment with any cell-depleting agent within 6 months of baseline visit or other biologics 
within 5 half-lives or 16 weeks, planned use of any prohibited medications or procedures during the 
treatment period, and presence of any skin comorbidities that could interfere with study assessments.
Exclusion criteria included a baseline body weight <15 kg, known or suspected immunodeficiency, active 
infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and endoparasitic infections, and treatment with a live 
vaccine within 4 weeks of the baseline visit.

The study consisted of a 16-week treatment period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period.
Rescue medication
If medically necessary (ie, IGA score = 4 or to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD 
could be provided to study patients as needed at the discretion of the investigator.  These rescue 
therapies included topical therapies (eg, high-potency TCS) as well as oral/systemic medications like 
corticosteroids and non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporin, methotrexate [MTX], 
mycophenolate-mofetil, or azathioprine) for patients who did not respond adequately after at least 7 days 
of topical treatment.  
Objectives
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab administered 
concomitantly with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD). The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of dupilumab 
administered concomitantly with TCS in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe AD.

Sample size
Overall 240 patients were planned to be enrolled. With 80 Patients per group and a 2-sided 5% 
significance level, the study can fulfil the following power considerations:
-
-
-
-
97% power to detect a difference between dupilumab Q2W treatment and placebo treatment 
(both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that 
the percentages are 28% and 5% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo.
 87% power to detect a difference between dupilumab Q4W treatment and placebo treatment 
(both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that 
the percentages are 22% and 5% for dupilumab 300 mg Q4W and placebo.
99% power to detect a difference in the percentage of patients achieving EASI-75 response at 
week 16, assuming that the percentages are 68% and 17% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo 
(both in combination with TCS) 
99% power to detect a difference in the percentage of patients achieving EASI-75 response at 
week 16, assuming that the percentages are 62% and 17% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo 
(both in combination with TCS).
With amendment 3 of the protocol, the sample size was changed from 240 to 330 patients due to 
potential unblinding of 68 patients. 
Randomisation
Randomization was to be stratified by region (North America and Europe) and baseline weight group 
(<30 kg and ≥30 kg) to one of the three treatment groups in 1:1:1 allocation. Randomization was 
performed according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified 
designee).
Placebo patients were to receive a matched placebo, including the different doses depending on body 
weight. Patients in the <30 kg weight stratum were randomly assigned to receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either 
Q2W SC injections of placebo (0.7 mL) matching the 100 mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount 
of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or Q4W SC injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 300 
mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). 
Corresponding to that patients with weight ≥ 30 kg were randomized with the same procedure.
Blinding (masking)
With the exception of the IDMC members, this study remained blinded to all individuals until the 
prespecified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses.
Statistical methods
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes 
all randomized patients excluding potentially unblinded patients. The primary efficacy analysis population 
was to be the FAS. Patients were to be analysed as ITT. The mFAS was to be used in a sensitivity analysis 
for the primary analysis end for selected secondary endpoints.
Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and the proportion of patients 
with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16. Further key secondary endpoints were the percent change in EASI score from 
baseline to week 16 and the percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of daily worst 
itch score.
Primary endpoints were to be analysed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for randomization 
strata was used. For these binary variables withdrawals and patients that were treated by rescue

medication were to be analysed as a non-responder. As a sensitivity analysis, patients that were treated 
by rescue medication were to be analysed regardless of rescue medication. As a further sensitivity 
analysis missing values were imputed by last observation carried forward (LOCF).
Continuous variables as the key secondary variables were to be analysed by ANCOVA stratified by region 
and weight group. Missing values were to be imputed by multiple imputation, where treatment group, 
randomisation strata and relevant baseline characteristics were used as covariates in the regression 
model used for the imputation. Data that were collected after rescue medication was to be treated as 
missing and imputed by multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, patients that were treated by 
rescue medication were to be analysed regardless of rescue medication. A further sensitivity analysis was 
to be performed by imputing missing values by LOCF.
Secondary endpoints that were binary were to be analysed with the same approach as the primary 
analysis.
Multiple testing was to be considered by the following hierarchical testing procedure:

Recruitment
Study Initiation Date: 17 November 2017
Cut-off date for Clinical Study Report: 28 June 2019
Conduct of the study
Changes to the conduct of the study
There were 3 amendments to the main study protocol (original dated 28 Feb 2017) and additional 
country-specific amendments for Germany and the Czech Republic. Amendment 2 only corrected the 
study number in the header of certain sections of the document and thus is not included in the table 
below. Amendment 3 for Germany was only submitted to IRBs/ECs and health authorities and 
implemented at sites that were continuing to enroll patients into the study. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses
The planned other secondary efficacy endpoint of mean weekly dose of TCS in grams for high-potency 
TCS from baseline to week 16 was not evaluated as part of this CSR. During this study, all patients 
initiated a standardized TCS treatment regimen with a medium-potency TCS. Use of high-potency TCS 
was not allowed except as rescue treatment. As a result of the potential unblinding of study site 
personnel to the treatment assignment for 68 patients, the mFAS was included as an efficacy analysis 
set.The mFAS includes all randomized patients but excludes patients potentially unblinded to study site 
personnel. The primary endpoint, co-primary endpoint, and selected secondary endpoints were evaluated 
in the mFAS as sensitivity analyses.
Protocol deviations
Overall, 14 (11.4%) patients in the placebo + TCS group, 12 (9.8%) patients in the dupilumab Q4W + 
TCS group, and 15 (12.3%) patients in the Q2W + TCS group had at least 1 major protocol deviation. 
The most common type of major protocol deviation was inclusion criteria not met but patient randomized 
(11/367; 3.0% overall). The incidence of each of the other major protocol deviation categories was low 
(≤2% overall across the treatment groups) and similar for all treatment groups. The primary efficacy 
endpoints were evaluated as a supportive analysis using the per-protocol set (PPS), which excluded 
patients with those major protocol violations deemed to potentially impact the assessment of efficacy. 
Although not considered a protocol deviation per se, due to an inadvertent operational error, some sites 
received a packing list accompanying the IMP resupply shipment that had product description written in 
an open-label fashion.
Baseline data
A total of 474 patients were screened for study eligibility, 367 of whom were enrolled and randomized in 
a 1:1:1 ratio. The most common causes for patients failing screening were inclusion/exclusion criteria not 
met and “other.” A high proportion of the patients completed the study treatment (95.6%).  The 
proportion of patients who did not complete the study treatment was higher in the placebo + TCS group 
(7.3%) than in the combined dupilumab treatment group (2.9%).  No patients in any treatment group 
withdrew from study treatment due to lack of efficacy. At the time of the data cut-off (28 Jun 2019), 
most randomized patients (96.2%, with approximately an equal number of patients from each of the 
3 treatment arms), transitioned into the R668-AD-1434 OLE study.
Demographics
Patient demographic characteristics were balanced among the treatment groups. More than half of 
patients were white (69.2%) but other races and ethnicities were adequately represented in the patient 
population.  The patient population was balanced with respect to sex.  The mean (SD) age of the patients

EMA/640921/2020
Page 58/117
 
 
was 8.5 (±1.72) years.  The number of patients in the 2 age subgroups (≥6 to <9 and ≥9 to <12 years 
of age) was balanced across the 3 treatment groups.
Randomization was stratified by baseline weight with a required weight distribution of 50% of patients 
<30 kg and 50% ≥30 kg.  The mean weight of patients was 31.5 kg, with 50.4% <30 kg and 49.6% 30 
kg.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics
Overall, baseline disease characteristics were similar between the placebo + TCS and combined 
dupilumab + TCS treatment group with respect to the extent of disease, the intensity of signs, severity of 
symptoms, and the duration of AD.
Rescue Medications
Approximately 3.3% of the patients received rescue mediation during the 16-week treatment. A higher 
proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group received at least 1 rescue medication during the 16-
week treatment period (19.5%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS group 2.5%) and 
dupilumab Q2W + TCS group (4.1%).
By week 2, a higher proportion of patients in the placebo group than the dupilumab + TCS treatment 
groups received systemic or topical rescue medications and among the dupilumab + TCS treatment 
groups the Q2W + TCS group had a higher rate of rescue medication use than the Q4W + TCS group by 
week 3.  Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first rescue treatment (topical or systemic) are shown in Figure 
28. Less than 20% of patients in any treatment group required rescue treatment.

Treatment Compliance
The mean injection compliance was high overall (≥99.82% in each treatment group) and was similar 
across the 3 treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed
Sample Size and Efficacy Analysis Sets
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints was performed using the FAS.  The FAS included all 
randomized patients (367) and was analyzed based on the treatment allocated by the interactive voice 
response system/interactive web response system.  Due to the potential unblinding of study site 
personnel to the treatment assignment of 68 patients, the mFAS was added which excluded data from 
these patients (19 patients in the placebo + TCS group, 30 patients in the Q2W + TCS group, and 19 
patients in the Q4W + TCS group.  The mFAS was used for supportive analysis of the primary and co-
primary endpoints, key secondary, and selected other secondary endpoints.  
Outcomes and estimation
Comparison of Efficacy Results of all Studies
This section discusses the primary/co-primary efficacy endpoints, key secondary efficacy endpoints, and 
other secondary efficacy endpoints of pivotal study R668-AD-1652. As previously noted, a full comparison 
of efficacy results across R668-AD-1412 and R668-AD-1434 is not included given the many differences 
between the studies (eg, study design, number of patients, length of treatment period, dose regimens, 
and the use of concomitant topical therapies).
In the pivotal study, R668-AD-1652, a hierarchical procedure was used to control the overall Type-I error 
rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupilumab dosing 
regimens (Q2W and Q4W) versus placebo.  Each hypothesis was formally tested only if the preceding one 
was significant at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level.  The hierarchical testing order and an overview of 
the efficacy results is shown in Table 17. All p-values were <0.0001, except for the proportion of patients 
with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 for the 100 mg/200 mg Q2W group in the FAS (p=0.0004).
Superiority of dupilumab (300 mg Q4W and 100/200 mg Q2W) + TCS over placebo + TCS was 
demonstrated for primary/coprimary endpoints (IGA 0 or 1, EASI-75 [co-primary for EU]) and key 
secondary endpoints at week 16 (mean percent change in EASI, mean percent change in worst itch 
score) in the FAS.  Statistical significance was also achieved for all remaining other secondary endpoints 
in the prespecified hierarchy for both dose regimens.

Primary efficacy endpoints
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was the primary endpoint for the US and US-
reference market countries and a primary endpoint for the EU and EU Reference Market Countries.  The 
proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was the other co-primary endpoint for the EU and EU 
Reference Market Countries, and a key secondary endpoint for US and US-reference market countries.
Proportion of Patients with IGA 0 or 1 
The proportion of patients in the FAS with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS 
(29.5%) and Q4W + TCS (32.8%) treatment groups than in the placebo + TCS group (11.4%).  Both 
comparisons were considered clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p=0.0004 and p<0.0001, 
respectively). The 2 dupilumab + TCS treatment groups (Q2W and Q4W) were comparable with respect 
to the proportion of patients in the FAS with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16.

Table 23: Proportion of Patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Study R668-AD-1652; Patient 
Considered Non-Responder after Rescue Treatment Use - FAS
In a sensitivity analysis using all observed values, with patients with missing values counted as non-
responders, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was greater in the dupilumab Q2W + 
TCS treatment group (29.5%) and the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group (33.6%) than the placebo + TCS 
group (12.2%). Both comparisons were consistent with the primary analysis. Likewise, the sensitivity 
analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) was consistent with the primary analysis and 
the sensitivity analysis using all observed values.  This showed that the methodology used for handling 
missing data did not impact the results.
Table 24: Sensivity Analysis of Proportion of Patients Achieving IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Study 
R668-AD-1652; All Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use - FAS 
As shown in Figure 5 the proportion of patients achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1 was numerically higher in 
the dupilumab Q4W + TCS and Q2W + TCS treatment groups than in the placebo group beginning at 
week 2 and week 3, respectively. The separation was sustained throughout the 16 weeks of the 
treatment period. The 2 dupilumab +TCS treatment groups were generally comparable with respect to 
this outcome, with the Q4W + TCS group having a slightly higher percentage of responders than the 
Q2W + TCS group starting at approximately week 2 (5.7% vs 0.8%, respectively) through week 16 
(32.8% vs 29.5%, respectively).

Proportion of Patients with EASI-75
The proportion of patients in the FAS achieving EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) at week 16 
was higher in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS (67.2%) and Q4W + TCS (69.7%) groups than in the placebo + 
TCS group (26.8%).  Both comparisons were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p<0.0001). 
The dupilumab Q2W + TCS group was comparable to the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group for the proportion 
of patients with EASI-75 at week 16.

Key secondary endpoints
The proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was a key secondary endpoint for the US and US 
reference market countries and a co-primary endpoint for EU and EU reference market countries.  This 
endpoint is presented above.
Percent Change in EASI Score from Baseline to Week 16
The least square (LS) mean percent change (reduction indicates improvement) from baseline to week 16 
in EASI score was greater in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS (−78.4%) and Q4W + TCS (−82.1%) groups 
than in the placebo + TCS group (−48.6%) (Table 26). The LS mean difference in the percent change 
from baseline to week 16 in EASI score was clinically meaningful and statistically significant between each 
dupilumab + TCS group versus the placebo + TCS group (p<0.0001). The dupilumab Q2W + TCS group 
was comparable to the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group for the mean percent change in EASI score from 
baseline to week 16.

Q4W + TCS (50.8%) groups than in the placebo + TCS group (12.3%). Both comparisons were 
statistically significant (p<0.0001). The dupilumab Q2W + TCS group had a numerically greater response 
than the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group for the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points 
from baseline in weekly average of daily worst itch score at week 16.

Ancillary analyses
Efficacy Data Supporting the Dose Recommendation
The efficacy data from the phase 3 study (R668-AD-1652) show that both dupilumab dose regimens, 
Q2W (100 mg in patients <30 kg, 200 mg in patients ≥30 kg + TCS) and Q4W (300 mg Q4W + TCS; all 
patients irrespective of body weight) result in statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements 
in signs, symptoms, and quality of life in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD.  Comparison of 
the efficacy responses between the Q2W + TCS and Q4W + TCS dose regimens on the primary and key 
secondary endpoints suggested that the regimens used in the 2 arms were similar on the continuous 
endpoints (mean % change in EASI score from baseline, mean % change in worst itch score from 
baseline) and the categorical endpoints (IGA 0 or 1, worst itch score reduction of ≥3 or ≥4 points from 
baseline). The regimens used in the 2 arms were also similar for other secondary endpoints like EASI-50 
and EASI-90. 
In patients <30 kg, the 100 mg Q2W regimen was underperforming compared to the 300 mg Q4W 
regimen.  The proportion of patients who achieved the primary endpoint of IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 in the 
<30 kg dupilumab 100 mg Q2W + TCS group was 13/63 (20.6%) whereas 18/61 (29.5%) patients 
weighing <30 kg who received 300 mg Q4W + TCS achieved IGA 0 or 1 at week 16. A similar trend 
favoring the 300 mg Q4W dose over the 100 mg Q2W in the <30 kg weight strata were observed for the 
endpoints of percent change in EASI, proportion of patients achieving EASI-50, proportion of patients 
achieving EASI-90, and percent change in SCORAD. 
In the ≥30kg weight stratum, numerical differences in efficacy favoring the 200 mg Q2W dose regimen in 
contrast to the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen were observed, particularly with respect to pruritus.  
Although the objective of the weight-tiered regimen in R668-AD-1652 was to normalize exposure across 
weight groups and achieve trough concentration at steady state (Ctrough,ss) comparable to the 300 mg 
Q2W dose in adults, the 100 mg Q2W regimen in children <30 kg resulted in lower observed mean trough 
concentrations at week 16 (62.6 mg/L) compared to the 200 mg Q2W regimen in children ≥30 kg 
(86.0 mg/L).  
According to the MAH, both efficacy data as analyzed by baseline weight strata and clinical pharmacology 
data support the proposed posology in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD: in those ≥15 to <30 kg, 
an initial dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg Q4W; in those ≥30 to <60 kg, an initial dose of 400 mg 
followed by 200 mg Q2W.  For children ≥6 to <12 years of age weighing ≥60 kg, the proposed dose 
regimen is 300 mg Q2W following an initial dose of 600 mg, since weight is the primary covariate 
affecting the PK of dupilumab and this dose regimen has been proven to achieve the desired effective 
exposure and efficacy responses in adults and adolescents weighing >60 kg.

2.4.2.  Supportive studies
R668-AD-1434 An Open-Label Extension Study to Assess the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Dupilumab in Patients ≥6 Months to <18 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis. 
This is a phase 3, open-label extension (OLE) study investigating the long term safety, efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of repeat monthly subcutaneous (SC) doses of dupilumab in 
paediatric patients with AD who had previously completed a clinical study with dupilumab in patients with 
AD. 
The study was ongoing at the time of data cut-off on 22 Jul 2019. Children ≥6 years to <12 years old 
who participated in paediatric studies from dupilumab in AD (R668-AD-1652 and R668-AD-1412) could 
roll-over into this OLE study. The study duration is up to 2 years which provides long-term safety data in 
paediatric patients treated with dupilumab.
Paediatric patients who participated in a prior clinical study of dupilumab in AD were eligible to participate 
in this extension study.
Study Flow Diagram
Children aged ≥6 years to <12 years who were enrolled into this study subsequent to implementation of 
protocol version R668-AD-1434 amendment 1 were started on 300 mg SC administered every 4 weeks 
(Q4W). Patients who were already enrolled in this study at the time of implementation of protocol version 
R668-AD-1434 amendment 1 and who were at the time on either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg were switched to 
300 mg Q4W.
If medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms, treatment of flares of disease, etc), 
rescue treatment for AD may have been provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator.
In case patients were not controlled with topical rescue medications and they needed to be rescued with 
systemic medications or in case the investigator deemed that rescue should be initiated with systemic 
medication, the following procedure was followed:
For patients who were being treated with 300 mg Q4W dose regimen, these patients were up titrated as 
follows:
1. Patients weighing ≥60 kg: 300 mg Q2W
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 71/117
 
 
2. Patients weighing <60 kg: 200 mg Q2W
Endpoints:
The primary endpoint in the study was the incidence and rate (events per patient-year) of treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) through the last study visit.
The secondary endpoints related to safety were:
- Incidence and rate (events per patient-year) of treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs)
- Incidence and rate (events per patient-year) of TEAEs of special interest
Study Population
The intended study population includes paediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD, aged ≥6 to <18 
years at the time of screening, who have participated in a prior dupilumab study, for children ≥6 years 
and <12 years’ old these were Study R668-AD-1652 (Phase 3 study) and Study R668-AD-1412 (A Phase 
2a Study).

Timeline of Patients Feeding into the OLE from Parent Studies
2.4.2.1.  Persistence of Efficacy in Children ≥6 to <12 Years of Age Treated for >16 Weeks
Evidence for the persistence of efficacy beyond 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab in a population of 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age is provided by data from OLE study R668-AD-1434. Data for each 
endpoint that support persistence of efficacy are presented in the subsections below.  For all endpoints, 
data after week 88 should be interpreted with caution as the number of patients included in the analysis 
progressively decreased after this time point (as patients transitioned to fixed dosing of 300 mg Q4W 
[followed by up-titration to 200 mg or 300 mg Q2W in some patients] after re-consenting to protocol 
amendment 1). The clinical benefit provided at week 16 was shown to be incrementally improved at week 
52 and then sustained with continued treatment. 
At the baseline of the OLE study, the mean (SD) EASI score was 15.70 (15.883) and the mean (SD) IGA 
score was 2.5 (1.04); overall, 29.9% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 19.6% had IGA=4 
(severe disease); and the mean (SD) BSA involvement was 28.6% (25.52).  Efficacy results for the 
overall study population (N=368), including patients receiving fixed dosing of 300 mg Q4W, are 
summarized in Table 31. Efficacy data from the 368 patients enrolled in the study demonstrated a 
substantial clinical benefit of dupilumab in children ≥6 to <12 years of age at week 16.  The clinical 
benefit shown at week 16 in the overall study population was sustained at later time points, including in 
the subset of patients with data through week 104.

Children ≥6 to <12 Years of Age, N=368)
2.4.2.2.  Proportion of Patients Achieving an IGA Score of 0 or 1 at Each Visit in R668-AD1434
At baseline of the OLE study, only 1 (3.0%) of 33 patients (≥6 to <12 years of age) who rolled over from 
R668-AD-1412 had an IGA score of 0 or 1. This low proportion of patients with disease control at baseline 
is expected because these patients had a treatment interruption of ≥8 weeks between the last dose in the 
parent study and the baseline of OLE study. At week 16, a considerable proportion of patients (12/32 
[37.5%]) had achieved IGA 0 or 1, which increased to 17/33 (51.5%) patients at week 52.  All 
33 patients who rolled over from study R668-AD-1412 were continuing with weight-based dosing at 
week 52.  Response rates at later time points were generally comparable, suggesting sustained efficacy 
of dupilumab treatment. The slight variability in response rates between week 52 and week 76 resulted 
from patients with remission being discontinued from study drug at week 52, losing remission during the 
period of treatment interruption, and then re-gaining remission once study drug was re-initiated around 
week 76.

The proportion of patients with EASI-75 (defined as a ≥75% reduction in EASI score from baseline EASI 
score of study R668-AD-1412) at baseline of the OLE was 5/33 (15.2%). At week 16, a considerable 
proportion of patients (21/32 [65.6%]) had achieved EASI-75, which increased to 28/33 (84.8%) 
patients at week 52. Response rates at later time points were generally comparable suggesting sustained 
efficacy of dupilumab treatment (Figure 31).

Mean Percent Change in Peak Pruritus NRS Score from the Baseline of R668-AD-1412 in R668-
AD-1434
At baseline of the parent study, R668-AD-1412, the mean (SD) peak pruritus NRS score was 6.67 (±2.354).  
At baseline of the OLE, patients had comparable levels of pruritus intensity with a mean (SD) peak pruritis 
NRS score of 5.94 (±2.573). There was a rapid reduction in pruritus NRS score during the OLE (mean [SD] 
percent change of −27.35% [±57.927] from baseline of R668-AD-1412 by week 4). The mean (SD) percent 
change in pruritus NRS score was −50.52% (±42.556) at week 16 and −63.87% (±32.372) at week 52.  
Although there was some variability, this reduction was largely maintained during the later time points of 
analysis (Figure 32).

baseline of the OLE. There was a reduction in pruritus severity during the OLE (15/33 [45.5%] where 
patients had reduction in pruritus NRS score ≥4 points from the baseline of R668-AD-1412 or a score of 0

2.4.2.5.   Antidrug antibodies
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADA for patients ≥6 to <12 years of age in R668-AD-1434 
was 8.3% (23/278). A higher rate of treatment-emergent ADA responses was observed in patients from 
parent study R668-AD-1412 (42.4%, 14/33) than in patients from parent study R668-AD-1652 (3.7%, 
9/248). The higher rate of treatment-emergent ADA in patients from parent study R668-AD-1412 may be 
explained by the differences in dosing regimen for each study: in R668-AD-1412, a single 2 mg/kg QW or 
4 mg/kg QW dupilumab dose was administered followed by an 8-week delay prior to receiving additional 
treatment with 2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW for 4 additional doses, whereas in R668-AD-1652, dupilumab 
100/200 mg Q2W (<30/≥30 kg), 300 mg Q4W, or placebo were administered in a 1:1:1 ratio for 16 
weeks.
The overall incidence of patients with persistent ADA was 2.5% (7/278).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The pivotal study R668-AD-1652 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD whose disease 
could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was medically 
inadvisable. After an appropriate wash out phase of systemic agents and medium potency TCS with 
standardization period, a treatment period of 16 weeks followed. 
367 patients were enrolled and randomized to three different treatment arms receiving dupilumab Q2W + 
TCS (adapted to weight), dupilumab Q4W + TCS or placebo+ TCS. A participation in the subsequent OLE 
study was offered to patients meeting the eligibility criteria.
The eligibility criteria and the design of pivotal study R668-AD-1652 are deemed appropriate. 
The study treatment consisted of 3 treatment arms differing in treatment frequency and doses. The Q2W 
+ TCS treatment arm provided two different dose regimens according to body weight (patients <30 kg 
received Q2W SC injections of 100 mg dupilumab from week 2 to week 14, following a loading dose of 
200 mg, patients >30 kg received Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupilumab from week 2 to week 14, 
following a loading dose of 400 mg. The second arm provided a treatment scheme of 300 mg Q4W, 
following a loading dose of 600 mg regardless of weight and the third one matching placebo+TCS. Rescue 
therapy was provided if clinically necessary and patients applying systemic drugs were permanently 
discontinued.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 78/117
 
 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, worst itch score, and BSA involvement with AD. 
As to the endpoints both the IGA and EASI scales are established outcome measures and correlation with 
disease severity and activity is acknowledged. The worst itch (WI-NRS) scale as patient-reported outcome 
(PRO) measure and modified peak pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was newly applied in the pivotal 
phase 3 study; as the peak pruritus NRS is a valid and fit-for-purpose tool to measure itch severity this is 
an accepted complementary endpoint. The co-primary and key secondary endpoints, including standard 
efficacy variables like the EASI-75 and IGA 0 or 1 which represent a sufficient degree of improvement, 
are considered adequate to the CHMP and in line with the objectives of this study.
Supportive data as to long-term efficacy comes from the phase 3 OLE study R668-AD-1434; additional 
PK and efficacy data is provided by the phase 2a open-label PK study R668-AD-1412. Both studies 
supplied data for the EoI procedure for Dupixent for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis in patients aged 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy 
(EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0012).  
The patient population, the study design, the endpoints and the treatment regimens are considered 
adequately chosen to demonstrate effects of dupilumab treatment in the proposed indication for patients 
with severe AD and they are in line with PDCO’s decisions. Concerning the protocol amendments 
introduced changes, were based on PIP modifications and approved by PDCO.
Outcome/ Endpoints
As to the efficacy results the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint IGA scores of 0 or 1 
was significantly higher in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS (32.8%) and Q2W + TCS (29.5%) treatment 
groups compared with the placebo + TCS group (11.4%). This effect was consistent in several analyses 
using FAS, mFAS, PPS (primary and sensitivity analysis) and persistent throughout the 16 weeks of 
treatment. Noticeable is the slightly higher percentage of responders in the Q4W +TCS group after 
treatment initiation compared to the Q2W + TCS group (5.7% vs. 0.8%) which probably is attributable to 
the higher loading dose in this treatment group. 
The co-primary endpoints were met in both dupilumab treatment groups. The proportion of patients 
achieving EASI-75 at week 16 was significantly higher in the Q4W + TCS (69.7%) and Q2W + TCS 
(67.2%) treatment groups compared with the placebo + TCS group (26.8%) also with consistent results 
obtained by the above-mentioned analyses. 
Key secondary endpoints as Percent Change in EASI Score from Baseline to Week 16 and Percent Change 
from Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score from Baseline to Week 16 showed 
statistically significant results indicating a quick and sustained treatment effect of both dupilumab + TCS 
groups compared to the placebo + TCS group throughout the performed analyses. As seen for the co-
primary endpoint, better efficacy results were achieved for the Q4W + TCS group regarding the Percent 
Change in EASI Score from Baseline to Week 16. Results pertaining to the reduction of the Daily Worst 
Itch Score were minimally better in the Q2W group than in the Q4W group (LS Mean % Change -56.5 vs. 
-54.5).
Similarly, the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in the weekly 
average of daily worst itch score at week 16 was significantly higher in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS 
(58.3%) and Q4W + TCS (50.8%) groups than in the placebo + TCS group (12.3%). The paediatric 
population showed even better efficacy results than the adult one across the pivotal studies (cf. table 36). 
The onset of action for both dupilumab + TCS treatment groups was rapid, as demonstrated by the 
differences from placebo on assessments of rash and pruritus observed as early as week 2.
For the placebo + TCS group, less than 50% of patients achieved NRS reduction of at ≥3 or ≥4 points 
during the 16- week treatment period. The robustness of these results was confirmed by multiple 
sensitivity analyses, including analyses of all observed values, without censoring the data after rescue, 
although considerably more placebo + TCS patients received rescue treatment (19.5%) during the study

than dupilumab + TCS-treated patients (3.3% combined; 4.1% dupilumab Q2W + TCS; 2.5% dupilumab 
Q4W + TCS).
Topical corticosteroids represent the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of AD. To evaluate the effect 
of dupilumab treatment on the use of topical TCS treatment, the proportion of TCS medication-free days 
and the mean weekly dose of TCS were evaluated as efficacy endpoints. Following the 16-week treatment 
period, there was a significantly higher mean proportion of topical AD medication-free days in both 
dupilumab + TCS groups compared to the placebo + TCS group (nominal p<0.01). The mean weekly 
dose of low / medium potency TCS was also shown to be significantly lower for the dupilumab + TCS 
treatment groups than in the placebo + TCS group (nominal p<0.01). A higher proportion of TCS 
medication-free days, lower mean weekly dose of TCS, and lower proportion of patients requiring rescue 
treatment suggests a potential steroid-sparing effect of dupilumab in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age 
treated with dupilumab + TCS.
Ancillary analyses
Ancillary analyses were conducted for weight strata as to patients weighing less or more than 30 kg. 
Analysis of efficacy response in the different weight strata revealed different clinical benefits resulting 
from different treatment schemes. 
Patients ≥30 kg experienced a slightly better efficacy while receiving the Q2W + TCS regimen measured 
by a higher proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoints IGA 0 or 1, EASI-75 and 3 secondary 
pruritus-related endpoints. However, regarding the primary endpoint and several key secondary 
endpoints this effect was relatively small and relates mainly to the co-primary endpoint EASI-75 and the 
two secondary endpoints ‘proportion of patients with reduction of weekly average of daily worst itch score 
≥ 3 or 4’.  The key secondary endpoint ‘Percent Change from Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Average of 
Daily Worst Itch Score from Baseline to Week 16’, however, was nearly comparable. 
In the <30 kg weight stratum the primary endpoints were met by a higher proportion of patients 
assigned to the Q4W + TCS regimen whereas the outcome regarding the reduction of pruritus was 
slightly more favourable for the Q2W + TCS treatment scheme. However, apart from the secondary 
endpoint 3-point reduction in the pruritus NRS score both of the other endpoints related to pruritus 
assessment were comparable between both dupilumab dose groups. In general, a less frequent dosing 
regimen is supposed to enhance treatment compliance due to a reduced treatment burden in the 
paediatric population in a real world setting. Thus, the Q4W regimen is favoured for all patient of this age 
class.  
Data on persistence of efficacy beyond 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab comes from the OLE study 
R668-AD-1434. The primary objective of the OLE study has been to evaluate long-term safety of 
dupilumab in paediatric patients with AD, as well as long-term, uncontrolled efficacy data. 
A total of 368 children (≥6 to <12 years of age) were enrolled in the OLE study and provided data (as of 
the data cut-off date of 22 Jul 2019). The MAH then introduced an amendment (amendment 1) to switch 
all patients to a 300mg Q4W treatment. The earliest visit a patient from R668-AD-1412 reconsented to 
amendment 1 was at week 88 of the OLE study R668-AD-1434 as previously described in the clinical 
section; hence, these patients had been on QW dosing for a considerable duration.  All patients from 
R668-AD-1652 rolled into the OLE under protocol amendment 1 and were started on fixed dosing 300 mg 
Q4W. This approach is based on the PIP. However, this is not in line with the agreed posology in the 
SmPC as discussed in the clinical pharmacology section.
The MAH also introduced up-titration in case of inadequate clinical response at 300mg Q4W to 200 or 300 
mg Q2W, based on body weight <60 kg or ≥60 kg, respectively. This flexibility allows possible 
demonstration of efficacy with a higher concentration in patients who are not achieving an adequate 
response, although based on uncontrolled data. This is considered adequately addressed in the SmPC as 
the dose may be increased to 200 mg Q2W in 6 to 11 years patients with body weight of 15 kg to less 
than 60 kg based on physician’s assessment.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 80/117
 
 
Of the 368 patients ≥6 to <12 years of age enrolled in the study, 282 had completed 16 weeks, 217 had 
completed 26 weeks, and 39 patients had completed at least 52 weeks of treatment period. Hence, the 
number of patients in the total study population with data after week 28 is limited in this ongoing study. 
Additionally, the majority (33/40) received weight-based dosing (2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW). The 
clinical benefit seemed to be consistent overtime based on continuous improvement of the (co-) primary 
and key secondary endpoints. The proportion of patients in the total study population who achieved IGA 0 
or 1 was 17.7% at baseline of the OLE, 34.2% at week 16, 50.0% at week 52, and 51.5% at week 104, 
and the proportion who achieved EASI-75 was 41.0% at baseline, 69.4% at week 16, 82.5% at week 52, 
and 76.7% at week 104. 
The mean percent change in EASI score from the baseline of the parent study was −59.05% at baseline 
of the OLE, −78.56% at week 16, and −87.36% at week 52. The secondary endpoints such as pruritus, 
SCORAD, POEM, IGA and QoL also demonstrated a positive effect in treatment.
In context with the results of the PK/PD data (i.e. the high comparability of the E-R analysis regarding 
both regimens), the comparable efficacy results on the more stringent parameter IGA 0/1, the slightly 
better safety profile of the Q4W regimen as well as the lower treatment burden that results from a four 
weekly administration, lead to the CHMP recommendation of a uniform posology for all paediatric AD 
patients aged 6-11 years. The MAH agreed with this recommendation. Additionally, flexibility for dose 
increase in patients from 15 to 60 kgs is introduced as discussed above and in the clinical pharmacology 
section.
For patients weighing more than 60 kgs the same loading dose and dose regimen is recommended 
similarly than for adolescents and adults populations. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The superiority of dupilumab over placebo is demonstrated for all three dose regimens regarding the 
primary and key secondary endpoints, and both the Q2W and Q4W regimens achieved convincing results 
with a slightly better global efficacy of the Q4W regimen. 
Based on the provided data, the efficacy of dupilumab in the agreed indication is acknowledged. 
2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Summary of the existing safety profile of dupilumab
In summary, the adult AD data indicate that dupilumab was generally well tolerated and had a favorable 
safety profile in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD, including the subset of patients 
for whom treatment with ciclosporin would be medically inappropriate. Aside from the incidence of ISRs, 
there was no clear difference between the safety profile of the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W dose regimen and 
that of the 300 mg QW dose regimen. Long-term treatment in the 52-week placebo-controlled R668-AD-
1224 study and the R668-AD-1225 OLE study did not reveal additional safety concerns associated with 
dupilumab.
Regarding the adolescent AD data, dupilumab treatment was well tolerated in general. No new safety 
concerns had arisen from data collected in the adolescent population and the previously known safety 
profile of the adult AD population was confirmed
The safety analysis of patients with AD is based primarily on the placebo-controlled phase 3 study 
(R668-AD-1652) and is supported by data from the completed phase 2a pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety 
study (R668-AD-1412), and the paediatric OLE (R668-AD-1434).  A summary of the 3 studies in children

with AD aged ≥6 to <12 years is provided below.
a. Study R668-AD-1412 also included adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age; the number of patients listed is for 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age only.  
b. The number of patients included in the FAS was 38; 1 patient did not receive study treatment and was not included 
in the SAF.  
c. Number in parentheses is the number of patients exposed to dupilumab.   
d. The number of patients randomized and included in the FAS was 367; 5 randomized patients (2 in the 300 mg 
dupilumab Q4W + TCS group and 3 in the placebo + TCS group) did not receive study treatment and were not 
included in the SAF.  Data presented in this dossier include results based on the prespecified primary analysis of 
efficacy (the data cutoff date was the day of last visit of the last patient in the treatment period, which was 28 Jun 
2019. 
e. Study R668-AD-1434 includes patients ≥6 months to <18 years of age.  The number of patients (368) listed 
included all patients ≥6 to <12 years of age from the 2 prior studies as of data cutoff for this submission (22 Jul 
2019), including 33 of the 38 patients ≥6 to <12 years of age from R668-AD-1412, 353 of 367 patients from R668-
AD-1652.  One of the previous studies (R668-AD-1412) was open-label.  The second study (R668-AD-1652) had 
been unblinded, primary analysis completed, and results included as part of this application.

[2] Treatment duration is calculated as sum of treatment exposure to dupilumab for each dose regimen in each 
individual study.

once.  The duration of treatment exposure to a given dupilumab dose for a patient who entered study R668-AD-1434 
was calculated as the sum of duration of treatment exposure to dupilumab in the previous study plus duration of 
treatment exposure to dupilumab in the OLE study.  The 391 patients include all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
dupilumab in either the parent study or the OLE study:  354 patients from R668-AD-1652 (6 patients in the 
placebo + TCS group did not rollover to the OLE study) and 37 patients from R668-AD-1412.

Adverse events
Study R668-AD-1652
A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group reported TEAEs during the 16-week treatment 
period than in the dupilumab + TCS groups; frequencies of TEAEs were similar in the dupilumab + TCS 
groups (Table 39).  Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity and deemed not related to study drug 
by the investigator.  The number of SAEs reported was low: 2/120 patients (1.7%) in the placebo + TCS 
group  (Asthma  and  Dermatitis  Atopic)  and  2/120  patients  (1.7%)  in  the  dupilumab  Q4W  group  (Food 
Allergy  and  Urinary  Tract  Infection).  All  4  SAEs  were  deemed  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator.  No deaths were reported. 2/120 (1.7%) patients reported TEAEs leading to permanent study 
drug discontinuation in the placebo +TCS group and 2/122 patients (1.6%) in the dupilumab Q2W +TCS 
group. There were no discontinuations due to TEAEs in the dupilumab Q4W group.

that rolled over from parent study R668-AD-1412 (n=39, of which 33 patients had ≥52 weeks of treatment 
with dupilumab. 
In the OLE study (n=368), more than half of the patients (219/368 [59.5%]) experienced at least 1 TEAE 
(Table 40).  Most events were mild to moderate in intensity and deemed unrelated to the study drug by 
the investigator. There were 9/368 (2.4%) patients who experienced SAEs during the study, and none of 
them were assessed as related to the study drug by the Investigator. No patient permanently discontinued 
from  the  study  due  to  SAEs.    A  total  of  2/368 (0.5%) patients  reported  AEs  that  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of study drug.  No deaths were reported during the study.

Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events
Study R668-AD-1652
The  proportion  of  patients  who  had  at  least  1  treatment-related  TEAE  (relatedness  assessed  by  the 
investigator) during the 16-week treatment period was comparable across dupilumab treatment groups, 
and was higher than for patients in the placebo + TCS group (Table 41).  This was primarily driven by a 
higher incidence of ISRs in all dupilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo + TCS group.  The 
incidence of Conjunctivitis was also higher in all dupilumab groups compared to the placebo + TCS group.

There were no deaths in the AD program in patients.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Study R668-AD-1652
A total of 5/362 (1.4%) patients experienced treatment emergent AESIs.  One patient in the placebo + 
TCS group reported 1 AESI (Enterobiasis).  Two patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS treatment group 
reported  1  AESI  each  (Ascariasis  and  Food  Allergy).Two  patients  (1.6%)  in  the  dupilumab  Q2W  + TCS 
treatment group reported 1 AESI each (Conjunctivitis Allergic and Keratitis).  One AESI was classified as 
moderate in severity (Food Allergy) and 1 was classified as severe (Conjunctivitis Allergic); all others were 
classified  as  mild.  All  AESIs  were  resolved  apart  from  the  case  of  Keratitis,  which  was  listed  as  not 
recovered/not resolved.  No AESIs resulted in study drug discontinuation. 
Study R668-AD-1434
A  total  of  11/368  (3.0%)  patients  experienced  treatment-emergent  AESIs  in  study  R668-AD-1434,  2  of 
which were serious AESIs (2 events of Anaphylactic Reaction).  None of the events of Anaphylactic Reaction 
were  considered  related  to  study  drug.  Four  patients  had  helminthic  infections  (Enterobiasis  and 
Strongyloidiasis). These AESIs resolved after treatment with antihelminthic medication. Three patients had 
Keratitis (2 events of Keratitis and 1 event of Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis) and 1 patient had Conjunctivitis 
Bacterial.  These events of Keratitis (1 mild case and 1 moderate case) and Conjunctivitis (1 severe case) 
resolved over time with treatment and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug.  One child had an AESI 
of Food Allergy.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System
Infections and Infestations: A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group (61/120 [50.8%]) 
had TEAEs in this SOC than in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group (52/120 [43.3%]) and in the dupilumab 
Q2W + TCS group (49/122 [40.2%]).  No single PT contributed to this difference.  The most common PTs 
in this SOC were Nasopharyngitis and Upper Respiratory Tract Infection. Nasopharyngitis occurred more 
often in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group (15/120 patients [12.5%]) than in the placebo + TCS group 
(8/120 patients [6.7%]). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the 
occurrence of Upper Respiratory Tract infection.
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was similar 
between the placebo + TCS group (23/120 [19.2%]) and the combined dupilumab + TCS groups (39/242 
[16.1%]).  However, the PT Dermatitis Atopic (which was also the most common PT in this SOC) was 
reported more frequently in the placebo + TCS group (17/120 [14.2%]) than in the combined dupilumab 
+ TCS groups (18/242 [7.4%]). The next most common PT was Urticaria, with no significant difference 
between the treatment groups.
Gastrointestinal Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was similar between the 
placebo + TCS group (17/120 [14.2%]) and the combined dupilumab + TCS groups (34/242 [14.0%]).  
The most common PTs in this SOC were Vomiting and Diarrhoea, both with no significant differences 
between the treatment groups.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC 
was similar between the placebo + TCS group (15/120 [12.5%]) and the combined dupilumab + TCS 
groups (34/120 [14.0%]).  The most common PTs in this SOC were Injection Site Erythema and Injection 
Site Swelling, both events occurred more often in the combined dupilumab + TCS treatment groups 
(12/242 patients [5.0%] and 10/242 patients [4.1%], respectively) than in the placebo + TCS group 
(2/120 patients [1.7%] and 1/120 patients [0.8%], respectively).
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was 
higher in the placebo + TCS group (31/120 [25.8%]) than in the combined dupilumab + TCS groups 
(29/242 [12.0%]), mainly due to the PT Asthma, which occurred in 12/120 (10.0%) patients in the 
placebo + TCS group compared to 6/242 (2.5%) patients in the combined dupilumab + TCS groups.  The 
most common PTs in this SOC were Cough and Rhinitis Allergic, both with no significant differences 
between the treatment groups.
Eye Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was higher in the dupilumab Q2W + 
TCS group (15/122 [12.3%]) than in the placebo + TCS group (8/120 [6.7%]) and the dupilumab Q4W + 
TCS group (7/120 [5.8%]).  The only PT in this SOC reported by ≥2% of patients was Conjunctivitis 
Allergic with no significant difference between the treatment groups.
Nervous System Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was higher in the placebo + 
TCS group (15/120 [12.5%]) than in the combined dupilumab + TCS treatment groups (18/242 [7.4%]).  
No single PT contributed to this difference. The only PT in this SOC reported by ≥2% of patients was 
Headache, with no significant difference between the treatment groups.
Conjunctivitis Events
A broad customized MedDRA query (CMQ) containing 14 terms and a narrow standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) containing 5 terms that included “Conjunctivitis” were used for an ad-hoc analysis to obtain a better 
understanding.
In study R668-AD-1652, using the narrow SMQ, the proportion of patients with at least 1 conjunctivitis-
related event during the 16-week treatment period was higher in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group (18/122

Similar results were observed using the broad CMQ. None of these conjunctivitis events from the narrow 
and broad search were serious and most events were of mild or moderate severity and resolved with 
conventional treatment while the patient remained on the study drug.  One event of Conjunctivitis 
Bacterial led to study drug discontinuation.
In study R668-AD-1434, a search performed using the Conjunctivitis narrow CMQ showed 42/368 
patients (11.4%) had a Conjunctivitis event in the OLE (Table 43).  One patient had a severe TEAE of 
Conjunctivitis Bacterial.  None of the events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation.
Events of Injection Site Reaction
In study R668-AD-1652, the proportion of patients with at least 1 Injection Site Reaction events during 
the 16-week treatment period was higher in the dupilumab groups (12/120 patients [10.0%] in the Q4W 
+ TCS group and 13/122 patients [10.7%] in the Q2W + TCS group) than in the placebo +TCS (7/120 
patients [5.8%]).  This difference was mainly driven by the PTs of Injection Site Erythema and Injection 
Site Swelling.  
In Study R668-AD-1434, 17/368 patients (4.6%) experienced TEAEs of Injection Site Reaction.  Most of 
these events were mild to moderate in severity, transient in duration with resolution over time, and none 
were serious or led to treatment.
Adverse Drug Reactions
A review of all TEAEs per the methods did not identify any new ADRs in the population of children with AD 
aged ≥6 to <12 years as compared to the adult and adolescent AD patient population who received 
dupilumab treatment. Only the known ADRs of Injection Site Reactions and Conjunctivitis occurred more 
frequently in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group.  No event of Injection Site Reaction was 
severe, serious, or led to study drug discontinuation, and the incidence was comparable in the dupilumab 
groups.  Likewise, no event of Conjunctivitis was serious; most Conjunctivitis events were of mild to

moderate severity and resolved with conventional treatments while the patient remained on the study 
drug. The following sections provide further details on these cases related to these specific ADRs.
Laboratory findings
Overall, mean and median hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis values were generally consistent with 
baseline values across each of the respectively studies.  While some patients reported fluctuations in LDH 
values and eosinophils during treatment with dupilumab, none of these cases were associated with TEAEs 
and were not clinically significant.  Moreover, these laboratory values were consistent with those 
previously observed in adult trials.
Hematology
Mean/Median Changes from Baseline
Red Blood Cells and Platelets
During the treatment period of study R668-AD-1652, there were no clinically meaningful trends or 
differences between treatment groups in mean or median changes from baseline in any red blood cell 
parameter. There were no meaningful changes from baseline in RBC parameters in studies R668-AD-1434 
and R668-AD-1412.
White Blood Cells
In study R668-AD-1652, there were no clinically meaningful trends or differences between treatment 
groups in mean or median changes from baseline in most white blood cell (WBC) parameters (basophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, leukocytes, and neutrophils) during the treatment period.  
A TEAE related to elevated eosinophil counts was reported in 1/122 patients (0.8%) in the dupilumab 
Q2W + TCS group. This patient had a TEAE of Eosinophilia, moderate in intensity and considered 
unrelated to study drug due to an eosinophil count of 0.78 × 109/L at week 4 (result at baseline: 0.43 × 
109/L). The eosinophil counts subsequently returned towards baseline and was 0.55 × 109/L at EOT. 
There were no associated clinical sequelae and the patient remained on study drug.

Clinically Meaningful Values
Red Blood Cells and Platelets
In study R668-AD-1652, there were no meaningful differences in treatment emergent potentially clinically 
significant value (PCSVs) in red blood cell or platelet parameters between the dupilumab + TCS and 
placebo + TCS groups.  The proportion of patients with at least 1 treatment emergent PCSVs during the 
treatment period was low across treatment groups: 2/120 (1.7%) in the placebo + TCS group, 2/119 
(1.7%) in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group, and 5/122 (4.1%) in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group.  No 
patients had relevant laboratory test abnormalities related to RBCs or platelets that were considered 
TEAEs.
In study R668-AD-1434, 4/281 (1.4%) patients in the SAF had at least 1 treatment emergent 
hematologic PCSV in hematologic (RBCs and platelets) parameters during the OLE. No patients had 
relevant laboratory test abnormalities related to RBCs or platelets that were considered TEAEs.
White Blood Cells
In study R668-AD-1652, the proportion of patients in the dupilumab groups with treatment-emergent 
PCSVs in white blood cell parameters were either similar (dupilumab Q2W + TCS group, 52/122 [42.6%]) 
or lower (dupilumab Q4W + TCS group, 34/119 [28.6%]) than of those in the placebo + TCS group 
(52/120 [43.3%]).  These results were mainly driven by the eosinophil PCSVs: 28/122 (23.0%) patients 
in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group, 14/119 (11.8%) in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group, and 24/119 
(20.2%) in the placebo + TCS group had a treatment-emergent increase in eosinophil count that was 
classified as PCSV.  No patients had relevant laboratory test abnormalities related to white blood cell 
parameters that were considered TEAEs.
In study R668-AD-1434, 90/281 (32.0%) patients in the SAF had at least 1 treatment emergent PCSV in 
hematologic (WBCs) parameters.  The most common PCSV related to WBC parameters were elevated 
eosinophil counts, which was reported in 44/279 (15.8%) patients.  Most of these abnormalities resolved 
over time.  Two patients with a PCSV associated with elevated eosinophil count had TEAEs of Eosinophilia.  
The next most common PCSV related to WBC parameters was elevated total leukocyte count, which was 
reported in 21/281 (7.5%) patients.  Most of these patients were still within the normal lab range for total 
leukocyte count.  None of these events were considered TEAEs.  
Chemistry
Mean/Median Changes from Baseline
In study R668-AD-1652, there were no clinically meaningful trends in mean or median changes from 
baseline in most chemistry parameters in any treatment group for metabolic, electrolyte, renal function, 
liver function, or lipid parameters.  Mean (SD) baseline LDH values were 284.3 (71.15) in the placebo + 
TCS group, 292.8 (85.85) in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group, and 296.3 (84.12) in the dupilumab Q2W 
+ TCS group.  There were mean and median decreases from baseline in LDH for patients in both 
dupilumab + TCS groups during the treatment period.  This is a known phenomenon as elevated LDH 
levels are associated with AD disease activity and severity (Kou, 2012).  
 Urinalysis
In study R668-AD-1652 and R668-AD-1434, there were no clinically meaningful trends in mean or 
median changes from baseline in urinalysis parameters in any treatment group.

Vital Signs
Clinically Significant Values
In study R668-AD-1652, at least 1 treatment emergent PCSV was found in 65/120 patients (54.2%) in 
the placebo + TCS group, 66/120 patients (55.0%) in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group, and 71/122 
patients (58.2%) in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group.  Clinically significant observations in heart rate and 
temperature were rare across the studies. Clinically significant observations in other vital sign parameters 
are discussed below. No AEs or SAEs related to hypertension were reported during study R668-AD-1652 
and study R668-AD-1434. 
Electrocardiogram
Across studies R668-AD-1652 and R668-AD-1434, there were no clinically meaningful trends in mean or 
median changes from baseline in ECG parameters in any treatment group.
Immunological events
In the pivotal study R668-AD-1652, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA response was low. There 
was no evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure or response. 
In the OLE study R668-AD-1434, the distribution of dupilumab concentrations for ADA positive patients 
was generally in the range of concentrations of ADA negative patients.
Relationship Between Anti-Drug Antibody Response and Adverse Event Profile
In study R668-AD-1652, there were no ADA-positive patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group.  In the 
Q2W + TCS group, 3/6 (50.0%) ADA positive patients and 79/112 (70.5%) of ADA negative patients 
reported at least 1 TEAE (Table 17). Two cases of Atopic Dermatitis and 1 case of Conjunctivitis were 
reported in ADA-positive patients. 
In OLE study R668-AD-1434, 23/279 (8.2%) patients had a treatment-emergent positive ADA response 
during the study and a total of 7/279 (2.5%) patients had a persistently positive ADA response during the 
study. The TEAEs (by PT) observed in >1 patient with a persistently positive ADA response during the 
study were Nasopharyngitis (3 patients), Dermatitis Atopic (3 patients), Viral Upper Respiratory Tract 
Infection (2 patients), Herpes Simplex (2 patients), Dermatitis Infected (2 patients), Hordeolum (2 
patients), Oropharyngeal Pain (2 patients), Pyrexia (2 patients), Abdominal Pain (2 patients), and 
Seasonal Allergy (2 patients). Additionally, 2/7 (28.6%) patients with persistent ADA response had a 
TEAE under Injection Site Reactions (HLT).  None of these patients experienced any TEAEs with the PT of 
Anaphylactic Reaction during the study. A total of 5/279 (1.7%) patients had a moderate (1/279) or high 
titer (4/279) ADA response during the study. 
Safety in special populations
 Weight Strata Analyses in R688-AD-1652
An analysis of safety by weight strata was provided by the MAH with the initial submission to support the 
initially proposed posology of dupilumab 300 mg Q4W in patients weighing<30 kg and 200 mg Q2W in 
patients weighing ≥30 kg.  Randomization in this study was stratified by baseline weight (<30 kg, ≥30 
kg) and, within the Q2W + TCS treatment group, patients received different doses of dupilumab in these 
different strata (patients <30 kg: 100 mg Q2W; patients ≥30 kg: 200 mg Q2W).  All patients randomized 
to the dupilumab Q4W + TCS treatment group received dupilumab 300 mg Q4W regardless of baseline 
weight. Table 44 provides an overview of AEs by weight strata.

Overview of Adverse Events by Weight Strata
In the <30 kg weight stratum, a higher proportion (46/63, 73%) of patients in the dupilumab Q2W 
(100 mg) + TCS group reported TEAEs during the 16-week treatment period than in the dupilumab Q4W 
+ TCS (39/60, 65.0%) or the placebo + TCS (43/60, 71.7%) group (Table 44).  Most of the TEAEs were 
mild to moderate in intensity.  No deaths were reported.  There were 2/60 (3.3%) SAEs reported in the 
dupilumab Q4W + TCS group of this weight stratum. No SAE was considered related to study drug and no 
patients permanently discontinued the study drug due to SAEs.

Less than 30 kg Weight Stratum
The SOCs in which TEAEs were reported by ≥10% of patients in any treatment group of the <30 kg 
weight stratum were as follows: 
Infections and Infestations: There was no significant difference between the 2 dupilumab treatment 
groups: (26/60 patients [43.3%] in the Q4W + TCS group and 28/63 patients [44.4%] in the dupilumab 
Q2W [100 mg] + TCS group).  In the placebo + TCS group, 30/60 patients (50.0%) had TEAEs in this 
SOC. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders: There was no significant difference between the 2 dupilumab treatment 
groups (6/60 patients [10.0%] in the Q4W + TCS group and 7/63 patients [11.1%] in the Q2W [100 mg]

stratum were the following:
Infections and Infestations: A higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group 
(26/60 patients [43.3%]) had TEAEs in this SOC than and in the dupilumab Q2W (200 mg) + TCS group 
(21/59 patients [35.6%]).  The PT Nasopharyngitis was reported in 9/60 patients (15.0%) in the

Nervous System Disorders: There was no significant difference between the 2 dupilumab treatment 
groups (6/60 patients [10.0%] in the Q4W + TCS group and 7/59 patients [11.9%] in the Q2W [200 mg] 
+ TCS group).  In the placebo + TCS group, 8/60 patients (13.3%) had TEAEs in this SOC.
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was higher in 
the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group (11/60 patients [18.3%]) than in the dupilumab Q2W (200 mg) + TCS 
group (6/59 patients [10.2%]).  This difference was not driven by any particular PTs.  In the placebo + 
TCS group, 13/60 patients (21.7%) had TEAEs in this SOC.  
Eye Disorders: There was no significant difference between the 2 dupilumab treatment groups 
(3/60 patients [5.0%] in the Q4W + TCS group and 5/59 patients [8.5%] in the Q2W [200 mg] + TCS 
group).  In the placebo + TCS group, 7/60 patients (11.7%) had TEAEs in this SOC.
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was 
higher in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group (11/60 patients [18.3%]) than in the Q2W (200 mg) + TCS 
group (5/59 patients [8.5%]).  The PTs Asthma, Oropharyngeal Pain, and Rhinorrhoea were each 
reported in 2/60 patients (3.3%) in the dupilumab Q4W (300 mg) + TCS group compared to 0/59 
patients in the dupilumab Q2W (200 mg) + TCS group.  In the placebo + TCS group, 
15/60 patients (25.0%) had TEAEs in this SOC. 
The TEAEs that occurred with a higher frequency (≥2%) in the dupilumab Q4W (300 mg) + TCS group 
compared to the Q2W (100 mg) + TCS group were Nasopharyngitis, Conjunctivitis, Diarrhoea, Abdominal 
Pain Upper, Dermatitis Atopic, Urticaria, Asthma, Oropharyngeal Pain, Rhinorrhoea, and Skin Papilloma. 
The TEAEs that occurred with a higher frequency (≥2%) in the dupilumab Q2W (100 mg) + TCS group 
compared to the Q4W (300 mg) + TCS were Bronchitis, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, and Injection Site 
Oedema. 
Safety After Re-treatment with Dupilumab
Effects of re-treatment with dupilumab on safety parameters were evaluated in a subset of patients from 
OLE study R668-AD-1434 who came from study R668-AD-1412. These patients had a treatment 
interruption of at least 8 weeks between the last dose of dupilumab in the parent study and the first dose 
of dupilumab in the OLE study. There were few severe TEAEs and SAEs and no deaths or AEs leading to 
discontinuation in this subset of patients.  The TEAE profile was similar to that observed in both the 16-
week, placebo-controlled pivotal study R668-AD-1652 and the overall population in the OLE study 
R668-AD-1434.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Withdrawal and Rebound
The effect of dupilumab withdrawal was evaluated in the context of disease recurrence following 
treatment discontinuation.  During the 8-week follow-up period of study R668-AD-1412 (weeks 12 to 20) 
at the end of the 4-week repeat-dosing treatment period, there was a return of AD symptomatology, 
trending toward but not reaching baseline.  These observations indicate that continuous treatment is 
necessary to achieve and sustain the clinical benefit of dupilumab. No rebound effect (worsening of 
disease above baseline) after treatment withdrawal was observed in the studies.

Discontinuation due to adverse events
Study R668-AD-1652
A total of 4/362 (1.1%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation; 2 
in the placebo + TCS group (Asthma and Dermatitis Atopic) and 2 in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group 
(Food Allergy and Conjunctivitis Bacterial). For the case of Food Allergy, the patient experienced an 
allergic reaction after eating ice cream that contained nuts.  Because the patient received steroidal 
medication for the event, study drug treatment was permanently discontinued per protocol. The 
investigator considered the Food allergy as not related to study drug, as the patient had a pre-existing 
peanut allergy.
None of these events leading to study drug discontinuation were serious.  Among these TEAEs, only 1 
was classified as treatment-related (Conjunctivitis Bacterial. 
Study R668-AD-1434
A total of 2/368 (0.5%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation in 
patients in study R668-AD-1434 (Optic Disc Drusen and Dermatitis Atopic). Only 1 of these cases 
(Dermatitis Atopic) was considered related to the study drug.
Study R668-AD-1412
There were no TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation in patients in study R668-AD-1412.
Post marketing experience
Dupilumab is not currently approved in patients <12 years of age. There were 736 post-marketing cases 
reported for Dupixent cumulatively up to the data lock point of 22 Jul 2019 in patients <12 years of age 
this population, 733 of which were non-serious. The post-marketing data seem not to suggest any new 
safety concerns for dupilumab.
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
Patient accountability and exposure
The safety analysis of patients with AD is based on the placebo-controlled phase 3 study (R668-AD-1652, 
362 treated patients) and is supported by data from the completed phase 2a pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety 
study (R668-AD-1412, 37 treated patients), and the pediatric ongoing OLE (R668-AD-1434, 368 treated 
patients). All studies allowed concomitant use of topical treatments (eg, TCS, TCI).
362 out of 367 enrolled patients in the pivotal study R668-AD-1652 were treated with study 
treatment, and thereof 242 patients were exposed to dupilumab. Patients were assigned to three different 
dose regimens and stratified by baseline weight (<30 kg, ≥30 kg) and region (North America, Europe).  A 
total of 391 patients were exposed to dupilumab during the parent studies (1412 or 1652) or open-label 
extension study (1434).
From study R668-AD-1412, 33 patients and from study R668-AD-1652, 335 patients joined OLE study 
R668-AD-1434. According to the MAH, 284 patients had completed ≥16 weeks of treatment in the OLE 
study, and 38 patients (all from the parent study R668-AD-1412) had completed ≥52 weeks of 
treatment. 
Safety data was not pooled and the safety analysis is mainly focused on data derived from the pivotal 
study R668-AD-1652, supported by separate analyses of studies 1412 and 1434; this is acceptable to 
CHMP considering the size of the database. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 101/117
 
 
Regarding all 362 treated patients included in the pivotal phase 3 study 1652, the proportion of patients 
receiving different treatment regimens were balanced (120 patients received dupilumab 300 mg Q4W + 
TCS and 122 patients received dupilumab 100/200 mg Q2W + TCS). The same applies to supportive 
phase 2 study 1412 (dupilumab 2 mg/kg QW: 18 patients, 4 mg/kg QW: 19 patients).
Overall, the safety data refer to 137 patients who have received at least 52 weeks of dupilumab 
treatment during both the parent studies R668-AD-1652 and R668-AD-1412 as well as the open label 
extension study R668-AD-1434. Hence, data volume relating to safety is considered acceptable to the 
CHMP.
 The patient accountability in study 1652 and within the Q2W + TCS subgroups was fairly balanced, 
almost all the patients completed the study treatment (placebo: 92.7%, Q4W+TCS: 98.4% and 
Q2W+TCS: 99.2%) and the majority transitioned into OLE study 1434 (placebo: 95.1%, Q4W+TCS: 
97.5% and Q2W+TCS: 95.9%). 
Exposure data were pooled. The majority of the patients were treated with dupilumab beyond week 16 
whereby different proportions are noted: 2 mg/kg: 94.4%, 4 mg/kg: 84.2%, 300 mg Q4W: 74.4%, 100 
mg Q2W: 74.6%, 200 mg Q2W: 74.6%. In contrast to the other dose groups the proportion of patients 
assigned to the 300 mg Q4W arm receiving dupilumab beyond week 12 was merely 78.4%. 
The greatest proportion of patients stemming from supportive study 1412 received dupilumab for 52 
weeks (33/37). Only 7.5% (28/371) of the patients assigned to the 300 mg/kg Q4W + TCS during study 
1652 and 1434 and none of the 100/200mg Q2W + TCS arm study arm reached treatment week 52. For 
patients assigned to the 100/200mg Q2W + TCS arm study arm no safety data beyond week 26 is 
available. Hence, long-term safety data beyond treatment week 26 is only available from 175 (Q4W) and 
33 patients (2 or 4 mg/kg bw) and beyond treatment week 52 from 28 (Q4W) and 33 (2 or 4 mg/kg bw) 
patients (table 5), respectively. 
AEs and SAEs
Overall, more patients assigned to the placebo+TCS group experienced AEs (300 mg Q4W+TCS: 65.0%, 
100/200 mg Q2W: 67.2% and Placebo 73.3%) whereby more of the verum treatment groups had TEAEs 
(300 mg Q4W+TCS: 20.0%, 100/200 mg Q2W: 24.6% and Placebo 10.8%). Most TEAEs were mild to 
moderate in intensity. Two (2) TE-SAEs occurred in the 300 mg Q4W+TCS group but these did not lead 
to treatment discontinuation. During OLE study (n=368) 59.5% experienced TEAE, therefore 14.1% were 
deemed drug-related.  2.4% patients had SAEs but did not permanently discontinue dupilumab.
Summary of Adverse Events
Pivotal, placebo-controlled study R668-AD-1652:
The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar across all treatment groups.  No dupilumab-treated patients in 
the pivotal placebo-controlled study experienced any treatment-emergent SAEs.  The incidence of TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was low.
There is no indication that dupilumab treatment increased the occurrence of systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions. There was no report of an anaphylactic reaction considered related to dupilumab. 
The incidence of local injection site reactions was higher in the combined dupilumab + TCS groups than in 
the placebo + TCS group, consistent with SC injection of a protein biologic.  There was no significant 
difference between the 2 dupilumab dose groups.  No injection site reactions were severe or serious, and 
none of the events resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. There was no increase in infections 
in general with dupilumab compared to placebo + TCS.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 102/117
 
 
The most common PTs ins the SOC of Infections and Infestations were Nasopharyngitis and Upper 
Respiratory Tract Infection, ie, very common infections in that age group. The incidence of Conjunctivitis 
(based on the narrow and broad CMQ search) was higher in both dupilumab groups (with the highest 
incidence in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group) than in the placebo + TCS group.  All of the reported 
events were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity (except for 1 severe event of Conjunctivitis 
Allergic). All the events were transient in nature and resolved over time either spontaneously or with 
conventional treatment. 
There are no new ADRs identified in the AD program for children compared to the adolescent and adult 
AD program.
The safety profile from the long-term OLE study R668-AD-1434 was consistent with that seen in studies in 
children with shorter duration of treatment.  
Summary for Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Mean  and  median  chemistry  and  hematology  laboratory  values  were  generally  consistent  with  baseline 
values at each visit or showed some small random fluctuations from baseline in the pivotal study AD 1652.
A decrease in LDH values was seen over time in the dupilumab dose groups; however, a positive correlation 
between LDH concentrations and AD severity has been reported in the literature (Kou, 2012)(Mukai, 1990).  
Decreases in LDH observed in this study could be a result of reduced AD disease activity and severity after 
dupilumab treatment. This is agreed by CHMP.
Increases in eosinophils were observed in patients treated with dupilumab; however, these increases had 
no clinical consequences.  These eosinophil value changes were consistent with what was previously seen 
in the adult trials.
Results from laboratory observations in the supportive studies R668-AD-1434 and R668-AD-1412 were 
consistent with those of the pivotal study.
Immunogenicity
A few patients were positive for ADA during the pivotal study 1652, especially none included in the 300 
mg Q4W+placebo treatment arm. No specific AE pattern became obvious due to the low case numbers. 
In OLE study R668-AD-1434 8.2% patients had a treatment-emergent positive ADA response during the 
study and 2.5% of the patients had a persistently positive ADA response during the study.
In patients 6 to 12 years of age the immunogenicity profile of dupilumab, given as Q2W or Q4W dosing 
regimens, with respect to treatment-emergent ADA was low; all titers were low and had no significant 
effect on the efficacy or safety of dupilumab in children.
Similar to adolescents, longitudinal assessment of ADA titers over a >2-year period in children who had 
developed high ADA titers (induced by the "prime and boost" regimen used in the R668-AD-1412 study) 
that resulted in attenuated systemic drug concentrations showed that continued treatment with 
dupilumab (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg once weekly [QW]) resulted in reduction of ADA titers and a 
corresponding increase in systemic dupilumab concentrations. Efficacy, as determined by percent change 
from baseline in EASI score, also generally improved in these patients with continued treatment 
throughout the study. None of these patients exhibited any signs or symptoms of a systemic 
hypersensitivity or serum sickness during treatment with dupilumab.
Overall, the frequency of ADA-positive patients seems to be significantly lower compared with the 
adolescent and adult population, the percentage of persistent ADA response is comparable to that of the 
adolescent AD population included in the dupilumab development programme. CHMP concurs that the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

available immunogenicity data do not show a clinically significant effect of ADA on safety. However, long-
term safety data is considered sparse. This will be followed up during the post marketing phase.
Higher incidences of both Atopic Dermatitis and Conjunctivitis were observed in ADA-negative patients. 
The incidence of AEs, such as injection site reactions, were similar between ADA positive and ADA-
negative patients. There were no events of systemic hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, 
related to dupilumab regardless of ADA or neutralizing antibody status.
Analyses by weight strata
Analyses by weight strata were performed for all patients receiving dupilumab. Patients randomized to 
the Q2W arm weighing <30 kg received 100 mg, patients ≥30 kg: 200 mg.  All patients randomized to 
the dupilumab Q4W + TCS treatment group received dupilumab 300 mg Q4W.
The incidence of SAE after re-treatment was far higher than that one observed in the pivotal study R668-
AD-1652 (4/362, 1.1%) or during OLE study R668-AD-1434 (9/368, 2.4%). However, only 33 subjects 
were analysed regarding effects of re-treatment and hitherto, long-term results of OLE study R668-AD-
1434 are limited, so that bias regarding the frequencies are possible. 
From the available data, no specific AE pattern was observed after retreatment with dupilumab after a 
pause of 8 weeks. 
The possibility for treatment interruption and re-treatment is already introduced in the SmPC. 
TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation
During the pivotal study, the overall frequency of permanent study drug discontinuation due to TEAE was 
very low (1.1%). 2 patients each of the placebo + TCS and of the Q2W + TCS group stopped the 
treatment. The 2 TEAE in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group were moderate. Overall, only the bacterial 
conjunctivitis was assessed to be drug-related which is agreed by CHMP.
A total of 2/368 (0.5%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation in 
patients in study R668-AD-1434 and merely 1 of these cases presenting AD was considered related to the 
study drug.
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
Based on the provided data, there is no evidence that dupilumab treatment increases the occurrence of 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions, malignancy and suicidal behaviour in the paediatric population with 
atopic dermatitis aged 6-11 years. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the adolescent 
and adult population. Based on the safety analyses, a uniform posology of 300 mg Q4W in patients 15 to 
<60kg with the possibility of up-titration to a Q2W regimen as performed during the OLE study has been 
recommended, to which the MAH agreed. The split loading dose and amended treatment regimen 
proposed for children weighing 15-60 kg is endorsed by CHMP.
For patients over 60 kgs a loading dose of 600 mg as two 300 mg injections following up by 300 mg 
every other week (Q2W) is recommended similarly as the recommended dose for adolescents and adult 
patients.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease. It is characterized 
by eczematous lesions (including erythema, excoriations, lichenification, infiltration, oozing), xerosis and 
pruritus. These clinical manifestations lead to significant sleep disturbances, severe psychological and 
sociological sequelae and impaired quality of life especially in patients with moderate to severe AD. The 
main goals of the treatment are the reduction of inflammation and symptoms, especially of pruritus. 
Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants and children. The disease affects 
over 20% of children in many industrialized countries.  Approximately 45% of all cases of AD begin within 
the first 6 months of life, 60% begin during the first year, and 85% begin before 5 years of age.
Recent studies have improved our understanding of the epidemiology of childhood AD.  In general, more 
severe eczema correlated with poorer overall health, impaired sleep and increased healthcare utilization.  
Severe eczema was associated with higher prevalence of comorbid chronic health disorders, including 
asthma, hay fever and food allergies.  The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood 
(ISAAC) phase 3 study surveyed over 8 countries and identified a 7.9% global prevalence of eczema in 
children 6 to 7 years old . The prevalence of AD in developed countries such as the US is expected to 
increase if the trends from the last 20 years continue.  Rising prevalence seems to be paired with rising 
incidence in the total number of severe intractable cases, which includes more cases of children 
continuing with disease into the grade school years and increased number of cases persisting into 
adulthood.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Currently available therapies for children with AD have significant side effects, and various systemic 
immunosuppressive drugs are used off-label with little evidence to support their use. 
Similar to the adult and adolescent population, topical treatment is the mainstay of management of AD in 
children.  Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of varying potency represent the cornerstone of topical treatment 
and some low potency TCS are approved in pediatric patients as young as infants.  However, their long-
term use or large body-surface application is limited by the risk of local side effects (e.g. skin atrophy and 
telangiectasia) as well as systemic adverse reactions, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
suppression and Cushing syndrome.  Children are more prone to the development of systemic reactions 
to topically applied medication because of their higher ratio of total body surface area to body weight.  
Linear growth retardation and delayed weight gain have been reported in children receiving TCS. Cushing 
syndrome, growth retardation, hyperglycemia, hirsutism, glaucoma, and adrenal insufficiency have been 
reported with chronic use.  Moreover, continuous use of TCS can be associated with development of 
tachyphylaxis (decreased treatment response and requirement for higher doses of higher potency 
steroids).
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also available for use in 
children, mostly as second-line therapy as an alternative to or in combination with TCS.  Use of these 
agents is typically limited to areas that are prone to skin atrophy from application of TCS, (e.g. face, 
genitals, and flexural areas).  The more effective TCI product (tacrolimus ointment 0.1%) is not approved 
for use in children aged 6 to 11 years old.  Crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical phosphodiesterase-4 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 109/117
 
 
(PDE4) inhibitor, has been approved for use in paediatric AD patients. Ciclosporin is not approved for AD 
in pediatric patients but often used off label for severe AD when systemic therapy is required.  In 
addition, other systemic immunosuppressive agents are also commonly used in treatment of severe forms 
of the disease, including methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.  A high proportion of 
patients suffer from relapse or rebound once the therapy is discontinued. The lack of safe and effective 
systemic treatments means that most patients with moderate-to-severe AD are not well controlled and 
further illustrates the need for an effective treatment for AD in children that also has a safety profile that 
is acceptable for chronic administration.
Thus, there exists a significant unmet medical need for an alternative treatment for -severe AD in 
children.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The application is based on the following studies:
A phase 3, placebo-controlled, pivotal study R668-AD-1652 in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD and 
a phase 3 OLE study R668-AD-1434 provides additional data to support long-term efficacy in children of 
this  age  group  who  had  participated  in  a  previous  dupilumab  AD  clinical  study.  In  addition,  a  phase  2a 
open-label PK study R668-AD-1412 provides additional supportive efficacy information.
The pivotal study R668-AD-1652 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in children ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD whose disease 
could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was medically 
inadvisable. 
In total 367 patients were enrolled and randomized to three different treatment arms differing in 
treatment frequency and doses. The Q2W + TCS treatment arm provided two different dose regimens 
according to body weight (patients <30 kg received Q2W SC injections of 100 mg dupilumab from week 2 
to week 14, following a loading dose of 200 mg, patients >30 kg received Q2W SC injections of 200 mg 
dupilumab from week 2 to week 14, following a loading dose of 400 mg. The second arm provided a 
treatment scheme of 300 mg Q4W, following a loading dose of 600 mg regardless of weight and the third 
one matching placebo+TCS. Rescue therapy was provided if clinically necessary and patients applying 
systemic drugs were permanently discontinued.  
Studies  R668-AD-1434  and  R668-AD-1412  allowed,  but  did  not  require,  concomitant  use  of  topical 
treatments; therefore, the efficacy data from these studies support the use of dupilumab with or without 
topical treatment.
Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, worst itch score, and BSA involvement with AD. 
As to the endpoints both the IGA and EASI scales are established outcome measures and correlation with 
disease severity and activity is acknowledged. The worst itch (WI-NRS) scale as patient-reported outcome 
(PRO) measure and modified peak pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was applied in the pivotal phase 3 
study. The co-primary and key secondary endpoints, including standard efficacy variables like the EASI-
75 and IGA 0 or 1 which represent a sufficient degree of improvement, are considered adequate and in 
line with the objectives of this study.
Supportive data as to long-term efficacy comes from the phase 3 OLE study R668-AD-1434; additional PK 
and efficacy data is provided by the phase 2a open-label PK study R668-AD-1412. Both studies were 
assessed in a previous application (EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0012)  extending the use from patients to 
adolescents aged 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

EMA/640921/2020

3.2.  Favourable effects
The proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint IGA scores of 0 or 1 was significantly higher in 
the dupilumab Q4W + TCS (32.8%) and Q2W + TCS (29.5%) treatment groups compared with the 
placebo + TCS group (11.4%). This effect was consistent in several analyses using FAS, mFAS, PPS 
(primary and sensitivity analysis) and persistent throughout the 16 weeks of treatment. A slightly higher 
percentage of responders in the Q4W +TCS group after treatment initiation compared to the Q2W + TCS 
group (5.7% vs. 0.8%) was observed, which probably is attributable to the higher loading dose in this 
treatment group. 
The co-primary endpoint was met in both dupilumab treatment groups. The proportion of patients 
achieving EASI-75 at week 16 was significantly higher in the Q4W + TCS (69.7%) and Q2W + TCS 
(67.2%) treatment groups compared with the placebo + TCS group (26.8%) also with consistent results 
obtained by the above-mentioned analyses. 
The MAH has demonstrated clinical efficacy and superiority to placebo of all dupilumab dose regimens. 
The effects of therapy as determined by EASI 75 and IGA 0/1 were observed rather quickly starting 
immediately and continuously concerning the Q4W regimen and from week 3 regarding the Q2W 
regimen, respectively.
For the placebo + TCS group, less than 50% of patients achieved NRS reduction of at ≥3 or ≥4 points 
during the 16- week treatment period. The robustness of these results was confirmed by multiple 
sensitivity analyses, including analyses of all observed values, without censoring the data after rescue, 
although considerably more placebo + TCS patients received rescue treatment (19.5%) during the study 
than dupilumab + TCS-treated patients (3.3% combined; 4.1% dupilumab Q2W + TCS; 2.5% dupilumab 
Q4W + TCS).
At Week 16, key secondary endpoints (Percent Change in EASI Score, Percent Change in Weekly Average 
of Daily Worst Itch Score) showed statistically significant results indicating a sustained treatment effect of 
both dupilumab + TCS groups compared to the placebo + TCS group. As seen for the co-primary 
endpoint, better efficacy results were achieved for the Q4W + TCS group regarding the Percent Change in 
EASI Score from Baseline to Week 16. Results pertaining to the reduction of the Daily Worst Itch Score 
were minimally better in the Q2W group than in the Q4W group (LS Mean % Change -56.5 vs. -54.5).
The proportion of TCS medication-free days and the mean weekly dose of TCS were evaluated as efficacy 
secondary endpoints. Following the 16-week treatment period, there was a significantly higher mean 
proportion of topical AD medication-free days in both dupilumab + TCS groups compared to the placebo 
+ TCS group (nominal p<0.01). The mean weekly dose of low / medium potency TCS was also shown to 
be significantly lower for the dupilumab + TCS treatment groups than in the placebo + TCS group 
(nominal p<0.01). A higher proportion of TCS medication-free days, lower mean weekly dose of TCS, and 
lower proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment suggests a potential steroid-sparing effect of 
dupilumab in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age treated with dupilumab + TCS.
Ancillary analyses
Ancillary analyses were conducted for weight strata as to patients weighing less or more than 30 kg. 
Analysis of efficacy response in the different weight strata revealed different clinical benefits resulting 
from different treatment schemes. 
Patients ≥30 kg experienced a slightly better efficacy while receiving the Q2W + TCS regimen measured 
by a higher proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoints IGA 0 or 1, EASI-75 and 3 secondary 
pruritus-related endpoints. However, the reported difference was not found clinically relevant since the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 111/117
 
 
effect was relatively small for the primary endpoint and several key secondary endpoints this effect and 
related mainly to the co-primary endpoint EASI-75 and the two secondary endpoints ‘proportion of 
patients with reduction of weekly average of daily worst itch score ≥ 3 or 4’.  The key secondary endpoint 
‘Percent Change from Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score from Baseline to 
Week 16’, however, was nearly comparable. 
In the <30 kg weight stratum the primary endpoints were met by a higher proportion of patients 
assigned to the Q4W + TCS regimen. Apart from the secondary endpoint 3-point reduction in the pruritus 
NRS score both of the other endpoints related to pruritus assessment were comparable between both 
dupilumab dose groups.
In context with the results of the PK/PD data (i.e. the high comparability of the E-R analysis regarding both 
regimens), the comparable results regarding the more stringent parameter IGA 0/, the slightly better safety 
profile  of  the  Q4W  regimen  as  well  as  the  lower  treatment  burden  that  results  from  a  four  weekly 
administration, lead to the CHMP recommendation of a uniform posology for all paediatric AD patients aged 
6-11 years. Additionally, a less frequent dosing regimen is expected to enhance treatment compliance. 
The MAH also introduced up-titration in case of inadequate clinical response to 200 or 300 mg Q2W, 
based on body weight <60 kg or ≥60 kg, respectively. However, based on PK/PD simulations the 
recommendation for flexible dosing was amended to allow an increase to 200 mg Q2W in patients with 
body weight of 15 kg to less than 60 kg based on physician’s assessment. This flexibility may allow for 
possible demonstration of efficacy with a higher concentration in patients who are not achieving an 
adequate response, although based on uncontrolled data.
Finally, successful re-treatment of relapsed patients following treatment discontinuation was 
demonstrated during OLE study R668-AD-1434.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Efficacy results of OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed improvements of AD symptoms based on the 
proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoint as well as the key secondary endpoints. 
However, long-term efficacy data is limited which brings some limitations regarding longer-term 
maintenance.
The numbers of dupilumab-treated patients included in this submission are too small regarding the long-
term efficacy of the Q2W regimen to recommend this dosing regimen. Additional data submitted during 
the procedure substantiate the overall safety conclusions but are still considered too sparse regarding the 
recommendation of a Q2W posology that was favoured by the MAH for children weighing >30 kg.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Pivotal study 1652: 
More patients assigned to the placebo +TCS group experienced TEAEs, whereby more of the verum 
treatment groups had drug-related TEAEs. 
Common TEAEs by PT that occurred with a higher frequency in the dupilumab treatment groups than in 
the placebo + TCS group were Nasopharyngitis, Conjunctivitis, Molluscum Contagiosum, Injection Site 
Erythema, Injection Site Swelling, Conjunctivitis Allergic, and Skin Papilloma.
Conjunctivitis occurred slightly more often in the dupilumab treatment groups.
The frequency of injection site reactions was higher in both verum groups.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 112/117
 
 
OLE study 1434:
59.5% experienced TEAE, thereof 14.1% were deemed drug-related. 2.4% patients had SAEs but did not 
permanently discontinue dupilumab.
As to the TEAE pattern, similar results were obtained. The most common TEAEs by PT (≥5% in all 
patients) included Nasopharyngitis, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Dermatitis Atopic (typically
worsening or exacerbation), Cough, Conjunctivitis Allergic, and Headache.
For adverse events of special interest, a total of 11/368 (3.0%) patients experienced treatment-emergent 
AESIs in study R668-AD-1434, 2 of which were serious AESIs (2 events of Anaphylactic Reaction were 
considered unrelated to treatment) and 13.9% and 11.4%, respectively (broad/narrow) experienced 
conjunctitivis. 
As for immunogenicity, in OLE study R668-AD-1434 8.2% patients had a treatment-emergent positive 
ADA response during the study and 2.5% of the patients had a persistently positive ADA response during 
the study. 
Based on the submitted data in paediatric patients 6 to 11 years, no new safety concern was identified. 
There was no significantly increased risk for dupilumab regarding malignancy, all types of infections, 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions and suicidal behaviour. The immunogenic potential of dupilumab 
seemed lower than observed in adults or adolescents since persistent ADA were rare. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Conjunctivitis occurred more often during OLE study 1434. However, the observed frequencies are 
comparable to those observed in the adolescent AD population (pivotal study 1526). Close monitoring will 
be performed in the post marketing setting.
There were no events of malignancy reported. However, there is insufficient data on long-term exposure 
to characterise the risk for developing malignancy. This issue had been discussed during the initial MA for 
AD.
Further uncertainties concern the limited long-term safety data in paediatric patients and the impact of 
dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The  superiority  of  dupilumab  over  placebo  is  demonstrated  for  all  three  dose  regimens  regarding  the 
primary and key secondary endpoints, and both the Q2W and Q4W regimens achieved clinically relevant 
results with a slightly better global efficacy of the Q4W regimen. 
The  Q4W  posology  is  recommended  by  CHMP  in  paediatric  AD  patients  aged  6-11  years  weighing  from 
15 kgs  to  less  than  60kg  on  the  basis  of  PK/PD  data  showing  a  high  comparability  of  the  E-R  analysis 
regarding  Q2W  and  Q4W  regimens,  comparable  results  between  both  regimens  on  the  more  stringent 
parameter IGA 0/1, the slightly better safety profile of the Q4W regimen as well as the lower treatment 
burden that results from a four weekly administration. 
In case of inadequate clinical response is observed, up-titration to 200 mg Q2W is also introduced as a 
posology based on body weight in patients from <15 kg to ≥60 kg. This flexibility allows possible 
demonstration of efficacy with a higher concentration in patients who are not achieving an adequate 
response, although based on uncontrolled data.
The split loading dose for children weighing 15-60 kg as proposed by the MAH is considered adequate and 
relevant to avoid peak concentrations.
For children 6 to 11 years weighing more than 60kg, the same posology as in adolescents weighing more 
than 60kg is recommended.
The most relevant safety concerns of dupilumab generally relate to infections, injection site reactions, and 
a formation of anti-drug antibodies resulting in systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Additionally, eye 
disorders such as conjunctivitis and related conditions were identified as AESI throughout the clinical 
development programme. 
The observed treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate and common viral 
infections prevailed as typical for this age class. Conjunctivitis of different etiology was slightly increased 
in the dupilumab treatment groups and this relatively rare clinical symptom is a known ADR. The long-
term effect of chronic conjunctivitis in these patients is currently unknown. Therefore, cases of 
conjunctivitis should be further monitored through PSURs.

EMA/640921/2020

Dupilumab use was not associated with a higher risk of experiencing TEAEs of systemic hypersensitivity in 
the paediatric population, as no events occurred during the studies. This suggests a low immunogenic 
potential of dupilumab in the AD population aged 6-11 years. 
Safety profile was generally similar to the profile observed in adolescents and adults.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The CHMP is the opinion that the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The benefit-risk 
balance in patients from 6 to 11 years old with severe atopic dermatitis is positive. 
In these patients, the agreed posology is: 
 - In patients 15 kg to less than 60 kg an initial dose of 300 mg (one 300 mg injection) on Day 1, 
followed by 300 mg on Day 15 and then subsequent doses of 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), (starting 4 
weeks after Day 15 dose). 
The subsequent dose may be increased to 200 mg Q2W based on physician’s assessment.
- In patients weighting more than 60 kg an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) and then 
subsequent doses of 300 mg every other week (Q2W).
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
Not applicable
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Dupixent is positive in the following indication: treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in 
children 6 to 11 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:
Variation accepted

Annexes 
affected
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II

of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension of indication to expand the indication of severe atopic dermatitis to patients from 6 years to 11 
years. Consequently, the sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The PL is updated 
accordingly. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/640921/2020
Page 116/117
 
 
Minor changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s).
The RMP has been amended accordingly. (version 5.0)
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
Amendments to the marketing authorisation
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.
Paediatric data
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan <PIP P/0374/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
5.  EPAR changes
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:
Scope
Please refer to the Recommendations section above.
Summary
Please refer to Scientific Discussion ‘EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0027’.

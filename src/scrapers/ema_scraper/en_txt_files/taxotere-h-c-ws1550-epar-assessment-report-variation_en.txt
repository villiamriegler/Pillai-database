Docetaxel is available as intravenous formulations for infusion and is currently approved in the United 
States, Europe, and in more than 130 other countries worldwide for the treatment of breast cancer, 
non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer (castration-resistant setting), and head and neck 
cancer. In Japan, Taxotere is registered for the treatment of breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, 
oesophagus, endometrial, ovarian, head and neck cancer, and prostate cancer (castration-resistant 
setting). 
The Applicant has submitted an application for an extension of indication: Taxotere/Docetaxel Zentiva in 
combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or prednisolone, is 
indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. 
This is a literature-based submission from the studies STAMPEDE, CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 conducted 
under the sponsorship of the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG), and Unicancer, respectively, and independently from the Applicant. It was agreed in advance with 
the Applicant that the Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) originating from the academic groups who conducted 
the studies would be acceptable for submission. The relevant CSRs were included within the variation.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The amount predicted for all indications in the next years in the European member states is evaluated at a 
maximum of 165.4 kg/year. Maximum annual consumption was calculated by multiplying the patient 
population with metastatic prostate cancer (193,400) by the maximum daily dose (142.5 mg) by 6 days of 
treatment per patient = 165.4 kg/yr. 
where: 
Metastatic prostate cancer incidence = total 2018 EU population with prostate cancer = 449,761 men 
multiplied by the highest reported percentage of metastatic prostate cancer in the reported in EU 
epidemiology data = 43% = 193,400 men and maximum daily dose = 75 mg/m2 x 1.9 m2 (avg. adult male) 
= 142.5 mg. Following EMA guidance, the PECsurfacewater is the ratio of the maximum annual quantity 
marketed (165.4 Kg/yr) to the total estimated quantity of water consumption in Europe (i.e. 512.6 million 
inhabitants of Europe in 2018 (10) x 200 L x 365 days) and the EMA ERA Guidance dilution factor of 10. The 
PECsurfacewater would therefore be the following: 
165.4 / ((512.6 x106) x 200 x 365 x 10) = 4.42 10-7 mg/L = 4.42 10-4 μg/L  
Under these conditions, the PECsurfacewater is 4.42 x 10-4 μg/L. 
As PEC<0.01 μg/L, Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis is not required. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An ERA has been submitted which is acceptable. The calculated PEC is well overestimated considering the 
short duration of treatment by parenteral route. Docetaxel is used in small quantities under strict medical 
supervision in hospitals which ensures confinement of the product and prevents significant environmental 
exposure.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The purpose of the provided data is to support a proposed docetaxel label expansion to include the treatment 
of  patients  with  metastatic  hormone-sensitive  prostate  cancer  (mHSPC)  in  combination  with  androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or prednisolone. These data are based primarily upon 
the following three randomized clinical trials (RCTs): 
•  STAMPEDE:  Systemic  Therapy  in  Advancing  or  Metastatic  Prostate  cancer:  Evaluation  of  Drug 
Efficacy (1) 
•  CHAARTED-E3805:  ChemoHormonal  therapy  versus  Androgen  Ablation  Randomized  Trial  for 
Extensive Disease in prostate cancer (2) 
•  GETUG-AFU15: Hormone Therapy and Docetaxel or Hormone Therapy Alone in Treating Patients 
with Metastatic Prostate Cancer (3) 
These studies were conducted under the sponsorship of the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), and Unicancer, respectively, independently of Sanofi. 
Each study compared the combination of docetaxel and ADT versus ADT in hormone-sensitive disease, and 
the results of these trials led to the implementation of the recommendation to use docetaxel plus ADT in 
metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients with level of evidence 1, within several academic and 
institutional guidelines (eg, the European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO], and European Association of 
Urology [EAU] Guidelines). 
The  efficacy  analysis  is  primarily  based  on  the  STAMPEDE  study.  CHAARTED  and  GETUG-AFU15  are 
supplemental studies. 
The data are also supplemented with a meta-analysis of the three studies. 
2.4.1.  Main study - STAMPEDE 
STAMPEDE: an international, open-label, adaptive, multicenter, controlled, 
multi-arm-multi-stage (MAMS), randomized study with a seamless phase 2/3 
design comparing the efficacy (OS as primary endpoint) and safety of adding 
new agents (either in monotherapy or in combination) to ADT versus ADT 
alone in patients with hormone-naïve high risk locally advanced or metastatic 
prostate cancer who were commencing first line long term hormone therapy. 
Methods 
The “docetaxel comparison” was one of the five original comparisons which assessed the effects of adding 
different treatments (assessed as single agents and in combinations) to the standard of care (SOC) 
treatment (ADT and radiotherapy [RT] for certain patients). The five original comparisons were made using 
(i) a bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid; (ii) docetaxel; and (iii) a cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor, 
celecoxib. Further investigation approaches have since been included in the study, using the following 
treatments: (iv) a selective CYP-17 inhibitor, abiraterone; (v) RT to the prostate for newly-diagnosed 
metastatic disease; (vi) an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, enzalutamide; and (vii) metformin. For 
purposes of this submission, only data for the “docetaxel comparison” (the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm 
compared to ADT-only treatment arm) are presented.

Treatments 
Docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m² repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 consecutive 
21-day treatment cycles. In addition, prednisolone 5 mg twice daily was administered for the duration of the 
chemotherapy (each day of each treatment cycle) in the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm. Dexamethasone 
was given pre- and post-docetaxel infusion to suppress allergic reactions. 
In all treatment arms, ADT consisted of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or LHRH 
antagonists for an intended duration of at least 2 years, or bilateral orchidectomy, according to the local 
practice at the investigational sites. Use of anti-androgens was recommended in the short term for the 
patients commencing LHRH agonists to prevent tumor “flare”. Patients may have begun hormonal therapy 
prior to randomization, but it was not to have commenced more than 12 weeks (84 days) prior to 
randomization. 
Objectives 
The “docetaxel comparison,” like all of the “original comparisons,” was conducted in five stages: a Pilot 
Phase, Activity Stages 1 to 3, and Efficacy Stage 4. For the intermediate Activity Stages 1-3, patients were 
recruited to the research arm(s) until the approximate target number of failure-free survival (FFS) events 
were observed in the control arm patients for that comparison, with evidence of activity required for a 
research arm to proceed to further recruitment in each stage. Efficacy Stage 4 for the original research 
comparisons, which continued recruitment through all interim activity stages, was triggered by observing 
around 403 deaths in the control arm (SOC). 
The study had the primary objective of demonstrating an overall survival benefit of the experimental arm, 
docetaxel +ADT, over ADT-only treatment. 
The secondary objectives were aimed at assessing treatment failure, clinical progression (local progression, 
lymph node progression, distant metastases) and biochemical progression (PSA failure). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause or 
date last known alive. 
The study’s main secondary outcome measure was failure-free survival (FFS). 
FFS was defined as time from randomization to first evidence of at least one of the following: 
• 
Biochemical failure: rise in PSA of 50% above the within-24-week nadir and above 4 ng/mL and 
confirmed by retest or treatment 
• 
• 
Progression either locally, in lymph nodes, or in distant metastases 
Skeletal-related event (SRE): when reported alone as the first failure, the SRE was queried with the 
site and coded as a FFS-failure when it was a confirmed progression 
• 
Death from prostate cancer 
Sample size 
There was no formal overall sample size target. For the efficacy assessment of OS, it was assumed that there 
would be a slightly higher proportion of non-metastatic than metastatic patients, resulting in 2 years’ 
median failure-free survival and in a median OS between 4 and 5 years, and a targeted relative 
improvement of 25% (HR 0.75) in both failure-free survival and OS for each comparator group with control. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 11/93 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
The efficacy analysis of each pairwise comparison against control (eg, docetaxel + ADT versus ADT-only) for 
OS required around 403 deaths in the control arm for 90% power and a one-sided α level of 2.5% 
(corresponding to a two-sided α level of 5%), accounting for three intermediate analyses on failure-free 
survival. A total of 1776 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel + ADT or ADT-only, of whom 592 
were allocated to receive docetaxel + ADT treatment and 1184 to ADT-only treatment. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was done centrally, using the method of minimization, stratifying for hospital, age at 
randomization, presence of metastases, planned use of radiotherapy, World Health Organization (WHO) 
performance status, planned hormone therapy, and regular use of aspirin or another nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Patients were allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive ADT or docetaxel + ADT. 
Although the STAMPEDE study utilized a MAMS design and included additional treatment arms, for the 
purpose of this submission only the docetaxel + ADT and ADT only treatment arms are relevant. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Standard survival analysis methods were used to analyse time-to-event data. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios, adjusted for stratification factors (except hospital 
and planned hormone therapy), and stratified by time periods defined by addition of a new research group 
or end in recruitment to an ongoing research group. Adjusted p-values were calculated from the likelihood 
ratio test to compare event-time distributions between the two treatment groups.  
Flexible parametric models were constructed with 4 degrees of freedom for each of the baseline hazard 
function and time-dependent effect, and adjusted for stratification factors and time periods. Medians and 
5-year estimates were made using the Kaplan-Meier method, and using the flexible parametric model (FPM) 
fitted to the data. The proportional hazards assumption was tested; restricted mean survival time was used 
in the presence of non-proportionality. Fine and Gray regression models were used for competing risk 
analysis of prostate-cancer specific survival. Prespecified analyses looked at consistency of treatment effect 
within stratification factors, over time period, and also by metastasis status, categorized Gleason score (≤
7, 8+, unknown), recurrent disease, and prostate-specific antigen values before hormone therapy. All tests 
were two-sided, with confidence intervals given at the 95% level. 
The underlying assumptions of the Cox proportional hazard model were checked by a non-proportionality 
test. There is no evidence of a non-proportional hazards (p = 0.874 where a small p-value suggests evidence 
of non-proportionality); therefore, the adjusted Cox estimates take primacy for this comparison. 
Several sensitivity analyses showed the consistency of the treatment effect on OS and the robustness of the 
results. 
An unadjusted Cox model test was performed on survival data as a sensitivity analysis.  
A multivariate flexible parametric model time-fixed estimates was performed as a sensitivity analysis using 
the stratification factors (except center and method of hormones) as covariates, and stratified by trial 
period. A multivariate Cox model adjusted on stratification factors (except center and method of hormones) 
and time-varying WHO-PS and stratified by trial period was also performed as a sensitivity analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
- Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall Survival 
The analysis of OS was based on a total of 175 deaths (29.6%) in the docetaxel + ADT group and 415 deaths 
(34.8%) in the ADT-only group. 
Median survival was 77 months (95% CI: 70-NR) and 68 months (95% CI: 60-91) in the docetaxel + ADT 
and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.93; p = 0.006). The 5-year survival was 65% 
and 54% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively.

Overall, 1186 patients were without event at the cut-off date (65% in the ADT-only group and 70% in the 
docetaxel + ADT group). In both groups, 90% of patients (694 patients in the ADTonly group and 377 
patients in the docetaxel + ADT group) were alive in the past 12 months. 
- Secondary efficacy endpoint: Failure-free Survival 
A total of 315 (53%) and 761 (64%) patients reported a FFS event in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
groups, respectively. Median FFS was 37 months (95% CI: 33-42) and 21 months (95% CI: 18-23) in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53-0.70; p = 0.413 x10-13). The 
5-year FFS was 38% and 28% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively.

Table 2: Censoring information by treatment arm - FFS - STAMPEDE 
Time to skeletal-related events, there were a total 112 patients (19%) and 328 patients (28%) in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively, who reported a SRE. Median time to SRE was 106 
months in the ADT-only group, but was not reached in the docetaxel + ADT group, (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 
0.48-0.74; p = 0.127 x10-5) and the 5-year SRE-free rate was 75% and 66% in the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only groups, respectively. SREs were primarily due to bone pain (77% and 81% in the docetaxel + ADT 
and ADT-only groups, respectively). 
Time to PSA failure, there were a total 277 patients (47%) and 698 patients (59%) in the docetaxel + ADT 
and ADT-only groups, respectively, who reported a PSA failure event. Median time to PSA failure was 43 
months and 24 months in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.59, 95% CI: 
0.52-0.68; p = 0.34 x10-13). The 5-year PSA failure was 43% and 32% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
groups, respectively. 
Time to Progression-free survival (PFS), there were a total 229 patients (39%) and 561 patients (47%) 
in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively, who reported a PFS event. Median PFS was 67 
months and 46 months in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 
0.60-0.81; p = 0.25 x10-5). The 5-year PFS was 53% and 49% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
groups, respectively. 
Time to cause-specific death, at the time of analysis there were a total of 175 and 415 deaths in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively; 82% and 84% of these were due to prostate 
cancer, respectively. The median time to death due to prostate cancer was 102 months and 91 months in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively. An adjusted competing risks regression for prostate 
cancer-specific survival showed an advantage of docetaxel + ADT over ADT-only treatment (subHR 0.79, 
95% CI: 0.65-0.96; p = 0.019). There was no difference between the two groups in the competing risks 
regression for non-prostate cancer-specific survival (subHR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.62-1.43; p = 0.782).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses - metastatic disease 
This analysis is the one supporting the claimed indication.  
Overall Survival 
The median follow-up (FU) time at the cutoff date for the primary analyses was 3.5 years. There were 144 
and 350 deaths among patients with metastatic disease (M1) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, 
respectively. Among these M1 patients, in a pre-planned subset analysis for the docetaxel + ADT group 
compared to the ADT-only group, the median survival was 62 months (95% CI: 51-73) and 43 months (95% 
CI: 40-48) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92; p = 
0.005) (below table). The 5-year survival was 52% and 37% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, 
respectively, among the patients with metastatic disease.

Updated analyses 
Updated analyses were performed with a median FU time of 6.5 years at the data cutoff date and the 
analysis of OS was based on a total of 719 deaths (66%), with 494 events (68%) reported in the ADT arm 
and 225 events (62%) reported in the ADT + docetaxel arm. 
In the M1 population, the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for OS in this updated analysis was 0.81 (95% CI: 
0.69 to 0.95), characterizing a reduction of 19% in risk of death with ADT + docetaxel compared to ADT 
(p=0.009). Median overall survival (95% CI) in the docetaxel + ADT arm was 58.8 months, compared to 
43.2 months in the ADT only arm, corresponding to a 16 months survival benefit for the patients treated with 
docetaxel.

Additional analyses based on metastasis burden  
The STAMPEDE study was retrospectively analyzed by subgroups according to metastasis burden at 
randomization, using the definition that was used for the CHAARTED study. 
Metastasis burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients, including 362/830 (43.6%) patients with 
low and 468/830 (56.4%) patients with high metastasis burden. These subgroups were representative of 
the full M1 cohort in terms of stratification factors. 
In the subgroup of patients with a high metastasis burden, median OS was 39.6 in the docetaxel +ADT 
treatment group and 34.8 months in the ADT alone group; HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.02, p=0.064. In the 
subgroup of patients with a low metastasis burden, median OS was 93.6 in the docetaxel +ADT treatment 
group and 76.8 months in the ADT alone group; HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.07, p<0.107.  
Test for interaction between treatment and disease volume was not significant, indicating absence of 
evidence for heterogeneity in the treatment effect in these 2 subgroups of patients. 
Figures 2 and 3 provide the Kaplan Meier curves for the Updated analysis in the high and low metastasis 
burden M1 population, respectively.

CHAARTED study 
Methods 
The CHAARTED study was an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy 
(OS as primary endpoint) and safety of adding docetaxel to ADT versus ADT alone, in patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer who were commencing first line long term hormone therapy. CHAARTED was 
conducted at 83 sites in the USA. Accrual took place between July 2006 and December 2012.

Treatments 
In the experimental arm, docetaxel was to be administered for a maximum duration of 6 treatment cycles at 
an intended dose of 75 mg/m² on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle. Dexamethasone was given pre-docetaxel infusion 
to suppress allergic/anaphylactic reactions. 
Outcomes/Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was overall survival. 
The secondary objectives were aimed at assessing treatment failure (PFS), clinical progression (time from 
randomization to PSA progression or clinical progression, time to clinical progression and PFS) and 
biochemical progression (PSA Response). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as follow:

Time to CRPC: the time from randomization to PSA progression or clinical progression (increasing 
symptomatic bone metastases, progression per RECIST criteria, or clinical deterioration due to 
cancer per the Investigator’s opinion), whichever occurred first. 
Time to clinical progression: the time from randomization to clinical progression (increasing 
symptomatic bone metastases, progression per RECIST criteria, or clinical deterioration due to 
cancer per the Investigator’s opinion). 
PFS: the time from randomization to PSA progression, clinical progression, or death, whichever 
occurred first (for patients who progressed or died); or the time from randomization until the date 
last known progression-free (for patients who are alive without progression, or patients who died 
without documented progression and the death occurred more than 3 months after the date of last 
disease assessment). 
PSA response: a PSA level <0.2 ng/mL measured for two consecutive measurements at least 4 
weeks apart; assessed at 6- and 12-month time points. 
Evaluation of the QoL: primarily assessed by the self-administered Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scoring tool as a measure of overall QoL. Additional assessments were 
made with the FACT-Taxane (FACT-T; to assess QoL associated with adverse effects of taxane 
treatment), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F; to assess fatigue), 
and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form. QoL was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months. 
Sample size 
790 patients were included in the study. 
The CHAARTED study underwent two major amendments. With each amendment, the sample size was 
adjusted so that the study would have 80% power to detect a 33.3% difference in median OS between the 
docetaxel + ADT and the ADT-alone arms, with the use of a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided α level of 
2.5%. 
At study inception, only patients with high-volume disease were to be enrolled, and the sample size was to 
be 568 patients. After 53 patients had been enrolled, an amendment was issued allowing the inclusion of 
patients with LVD and to initiate a prospective stratification of HVD versus LVD, and the sample size was 
increased to 600 patients. The final amendment was made after 579 patients had been enrolled, to reflect 
new data documenting an increase in median OS owing to the use of PSA in the detection and monitoring of 
disease activity and to address the September 2011 report of the data and safety monitoring committee, 
which noted that 70% of enrolled patients had HVD. 
The final design required the enrolment of 780 patients (399 events), with projections of median overall 
survival with ADT alone of 33 months among patients with HVD and 67 months among patients with LVD. 
Interim analyses were to be performed before all semi-annual meetings of the data and safety monitoring 
committee starting when approximately 25% of the planned full information was obtained and continuing 
until either the criteria for early stopping were met or full information was obtained (after 399 deaths). 
Extent of disease (HVD versus LVD) was included as an additional stratification factor in the CSR. Accrual of 
12 patients per month for about 5.5 years (780 patients) followed by 1.5 years of follow-up was anticipated 
to achieve full information. 
Demographic of study population 
There were 397 randomized patients in the docetaxel + ADT group and 393 randomized patients in the 
ADT-only group. The median age was 64 years in the docetaxel + ADT group and 63 years in the ADT-only 
group. In both treatment arms, approximately 70% and 29% of patients had an ECOG performance-status 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 30/93 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
score of 0 and 1, respectively; approximately 65% of patients had HVD; and approximately 67% and 70% 
of patients had a Gleason score of 8 or higher in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively. In 
both groups, approximately 73% of the patients had received no prior local therapy for prostate cancer with 
curative intent. 
Randomization 
Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for event-time distributions. Cox proportional-hazard models (stratified 
on age, ECOG, use of complete androgen blockade and FDA approved drugs for delaying skeletal related 
events, time of prior adjuvant hormonal therapy, and extent of disease) were used to estimate hazard ratios 
for time-to-event end points. Stratified log-rank tests were used to compare event-time distributions 
between the two treatment groups, with a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Response rates were 
compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test. P-values are two-sided, and confidence intervals were at the 
95% level. 
The changes in QoL from baseline to follow-up were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A mixed 
effect model was used to evaluate the differences in FACT-P (Version 4) total scores and trial outcome index 
scores between the two arms over time. 
Blinding 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients at study entry. Kaplan–Meier estimates were used 
for event-time distributions. Cox proportional- hazard models, stratified according to the factors described 
above, were used to estimate hazard ratios for time-to-event end points. Stratified log-rank tests were used 
to compare event-time distributions between the two groups. Response rates were compared with the use 
of Fisher’s exact test. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted that included all randomly assigned 
patients regardless of eligibility and treatment status. P values are two-sided, and confidence intervals are 
at the 95% level. 
Results 
- Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall Survival 
Analysis of OS was based on a total of 237 deaths, with 101 events (25.4%) reported in the docetaxel + ADT 
arm and 136 events (34.6%) reported in the ADT-only arm. About 84% of the deaths were due to prostate 
cancer. 
After a median follow-up of 28.9 months, the median overall survival with ADT plus docetaxel (combination 
therapy) was 57.6 months, compared to 44.0 months with ADT alone; the estimated HR was 0.61 (95% CI: 
0.47-0.80; p = 0.0003).

Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier overall survival (all patients) - CHAARTED 
The median time to biochemical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression was 20.2 months in the 
combination group, as compared with 11.7 months in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 
0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001). The rate of a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.2 ng per milliliter at 12 
months was 27.7% in the combination group versus 16.8% in the ADT-alone group (P<0.001). 
The OS was analyzed by disease volume: 66.2% and 63.5% of patients had HVD in the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only arms, respectively, and 33.8% and 36.5% of patients had LVD in the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only arms, respectively. 
The median OS for the patients with HVD was 49.2 months versus 32.2 months for the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only arms (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45-0.81; p <0.001), respectively.

analysis of OS was based on a total of 399 deaths (51%), with 211 events (54%) reported in the ADT arm 
and 188 events (47%) reported in the ADT + docetaxel arm.  
In these updated analyses, the estimated HR for OS was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89, p=0.0018). Median 
overall survival (95% CI) in the docetaxel + ADT arm was 57.6 months (52 to 63.9), compared to 47.2 
months (41.8 to 52.8) in the ADT only arm.

Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier OS - all patients - CHAARTED long-term follow-up 
Among patients with HVD (median follow-up of 53.7 months), the median OS benefit with docetaxel + ADT 
treatment was 16.8 months (the median OS was 51.2 versus 34.4 months for the docetaxel + ADT arm and 
the ADT-only arm, respectively; HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.50-0.79; p <0.001]). Among patients with LVD 
(median follow-up of 53.7 months), the median OS was 63.5 months and not reached for the docetaxel + 
ADT arm and the ADT-only arm, respectively; HR 1.04 [95% CI: 0.70-1.55; p = 0.86]). 
- Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints for the CHAARTED study included time to the development of CRPC, time to clinical 
progression, progression-free survival, and PSA complete response at 6 and 12 months.

Regarding time to CRPC, there were 525 patients who experienced either PSA progression or clinical 
progression (238 in the docetaxel + ADT arm and 287 in the ADT arm). Median time to CRPC was 20.2 
months (95% CI: 17.2-23.6) and 11.7 months (95% CI: 10.8-14.7) for patients in the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT arms, respectively (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.72; p <0.0001).

Regarding time to clinical progression, a total of 408 patients had experienced clinical progression at 
cut-off date (180 and 228 in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively). The median 
time to clinical progression was 33.0 months (95% CI: 27.3-41.2) and 19.8 months (95% CI: 17.9-22.8) in 
the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.50-0.75; p <0.0001).

Ancillary analyses: subgroup analyses 
GETUG-AFU15 study 
Methods 
The GETUG-AFU15 study was an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy 
(OS rate at 36 months as primary endpoint) and safety of adding docetaxel to ADT versus ADT alone, in 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were commencing first line long term hormone therapy. 
GETUG-AFU15 was conducted at 29 sites in France and 1 site in Belgium. Accrual took place between 
October 2004 and December 2008.

prostate and radiologically proven metastatic disease, and an ECOG performance-status score of ≤2. 
A lower proportion of men were metastatic at diagnosis of their prostate cancer in the docetaxel + ADT arm 
(67%) compared to the ADT-only arm (76%). The mean duration between diagnosis of the primary tumor 
and randomization was longer in docetaxel + ADT arm (12.55 months) compared to the ADT arm (11.35 
months). The Gleason score was ≥7 in 91% of the study population: 90% and 93% in the docetaxel + ADT 
and ADT arms, respectively. The majority of patients (72%) had metastases at the diagnosis of prostate 
cancer with a majority of patients with metastases in the bone (81%) and lymph nodes (55%).

Treatments 
In the experimental arm, docetaxel was to be administered for a maximum duration of 9 treatment cycles at 
an intended dose of 75 mg/m² on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle. 
Outcomes/Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the 3-year OS. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were survival without clinical progression, survival without biological 
progression and the evaluation of the QoL. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as follow: 
•  Survival without clinical progression (cPFS): the time from randomization to the date of the first 
investigation (bone scintigraphy, pelvic scan, or MRI) that showed clinical progression. For those 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 40/93 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
patients with bone lesions only, progression was defined as the appearance of one or more new bone 
lesions on bone scan. 
•  Survival without biological/laboratory progression (bPFS): the time from randomization until the 
date of biological/laboratory progression, or death of any cause. Biological/laboratory progression 
was defined by two Prostate Working Group (PWG) definitions 1 and 2 (1999 and 2007, 
respectively), based on PSA level cutpoints (detailed further in the CSR). 
• 
Evaluation of the QoL: as assessed by the self-administered European Organisation for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer 30-item quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), completed for the 
docetaxel + ADT arm on Day 1 of Cycle 4, Day 21 of Cycle 9 (or at the end of treatment), and then 
twice a year; and for the ADT-only arm at 3 months, and then every 6 months. A treatment side 
effects analysis was also conducted to supplement this endpoint, as described in Section 11.3.2 of 
the CSR. 
Sample size 
385 patients were included in the study. 
At the time of study design of GETUG-AFU15, the data in the literature concerning the survival of patients 
treated for metastatic prostate cancer with hormone therapy was approximately 30 months. The median 
duration of response to initial hormone therapy was 24 months. To increase OS at 3 years from 50% to 65% 
in the docetaxel + ADT group, with a two-sided test, α=0.05 and a power of 80%, 172 subjects per arm (73 
events) were needed (a total of 344 subjects). An increase of 10% was planned to compensate for patients 
lost to follow up, thus 189 randomized subjects per arm; a total of 378 subjects were therefore required for 
the study. This sample size was calculated assuming an enrolment period of approximately 4.5 years, and 
total study duration of approximately 8.5 years to observe the required 146 events. 
Demographic of study population 
The baseline characteristics were similarly comparable between the 2 arms of the GETUG-AFU15 trial, with 
192 randomized patients in the docetaxel + ADT group and 193 randomized patients in the ADT-only group. 
The mean age was 62.7 years in the docetaxel + ADT group and 63.4 years in the ADT-only group. In both 
treatment arms, the mean Karnofsky index score was approximately 94, with a median score of 100 in both 
groups. The patients were divided by disease volume (48% and 47% of patients had HVD in the docetaxel 
+ ADT arm and ADT-only arms, respectively) in a post-hoc analysis. 
Randomization 
Distributions of time-to-event variables and associated 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the 
use of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The log-rank test was considered as the primary analysis for 
comparison of treatment groups. Adjusted treatment effects were estimated using the Cox 
proportional-hazards model. Qualitative variables were presented as percentages, and were compared using 
a χ2 test or a Fisher test; quantitative variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SD) or 
medians and extremes, and were compared using a Student t or Mann-Whitney test. 
Blinding 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
The estimated distributions of time-to-event variables and associated 95% CIs were with the Kaplan-Meier 
product-limit method. The log-rank test was the primary analysis for comparison of treatment groups. The 
estimated adjusted and unadjusted treatment effects were with the Cox proportional hazards model. Safety

analyses were based on the population exposed to the assigned treatment. Post-hoc subgroup analyses 
were assessed whether specific baseline characteristics affected overall survival and PFS.  
Results 
Primary efficacy endpoint (ITT): 
At the cut-off date, 176 patients had died, with 88 events (45.8%) reported in the docetaxel + ADT arm and 
88 events (45.6%) reported in the ADT-only arm. The 3-year OS (the primary efficacy endpoint) was 64.2% 
(95% CI: 57.5-71.6) and 62.9% (95% CI: 56.3-70.2) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT arms, respectively, 
and the observed median OS was 58.9 months (95% CI: 50.8-69.1) and 54.2 months (95% CI: 42.2-NR) in 
the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively, with an estimated HR of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.75-1.36; p 
= 0.955). Of note, 62% of patients in the GETUG-AFU15 ADT-only treatment arm received docetaxel upon 
disease progression in the primary analysis. 
Figure 15: Overall survival (all patients) - GETUG-AFU15 
Long-term follow-up: 
A post-hoc analysis of the GETUG trial was performed with an extended follow-up period. This analysis also 
stratified OS based on volume of disease (patients with HVD and LVD). The updated analysis was performed 
after a median follow-up of 83.9 months (95% CI: 82.9-84.7), at which point 242 patients had died (115 and 
127 patients were in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT arms, respectively; 147 and 95 patients were in HVD and 
LVD subgroups, respectively). This corresponds to a 63% maturity level. The majority of deaths were due to 
disease progression (82% of patients), while other (9.5%) and unknown (8.2%) causes were reported.

In the overall population, the median OS in the long-term follow-up was 62.1 months (95% CI: 49.5-73.7) 
and 48.6 months (95% CI: 40.9-60.6) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT arms, respectively (HR 0.88, 95% 
CI: 0.68-1.14; p = 0.3). By the time of the follow-up analysis, 85% of patients in the GETUG-AFU15 
ADT-only treatment arm received docetaxel upon disease progression. 
In patients with HVD, the median OS was 39.8 months (95% CI: 28.0-53.4) and 35.1 months (95% CI: 
29.9-43.6) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively; HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.56-1.09; p = 
0.14. 
In patients with LVD, the median OS was not reached (NR; 95% CI: 69.5-NR) and 83.4 months (95% CI: 
61.8-NR) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively, HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.67-1.55; p = 0.9. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint: 
For clinical PFS, at the time of data cut-off, there were 279 cPFS failure events (134 and 145 events 
occurred in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively). The median cPFS was 23.46 months 
(95% CI: 20.47-31.87) and 15.44 months (95% CI: 12.45-19.78) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
treatment arms, respectively, HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94; p = 0.0147.

A sensitivity analysis was also conducted, in which an average HR was determined for cPFS due to 
non-proportional hazard over time (ie, there was decreasing beneficial effect of chemotherapy over time); 
the estimated treatment effect was HR 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54-0.89). 
For Biological PFS, the median biological/laboratory progression-free survival (bPFS) was reported 
according to two different PWG definitions 1 and 2 (1999 and 2007, respectively). 
bPFS, PWG1 (1999) definition 
At the time of data cut-off, there were 287 bPFS failure events (138 and 149 events occurred in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively) assessed under the PWG 1 (1999) definition. The median 
bPFS was 22.93 months (95% CI: 19.6-28.4) and 12.91 months (95% CI: 11.93-17.71) in the docetaxel + 
ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively, HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.91; p = 0.0052.

As for cPFS, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted for bPFS based on the PWG 1 (1999) definition in which 
an average HR was determined for bPFS due to non-proportional hazard over time (there was decreasing 
beneficial effect of chemotherapy over time); the estimated treatment effect was HR 0.66 (95% CI: 
0.52-0.84), similar to that seen for cPFS. 
bPFS, PWG2 (2007) definition 
At the time of data cut-off, there were 298 bPFS failure events (142 and 156 events occurred in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms, respectively) assessed under the PWG 2 (2007) definition. The median 
bPFS was 22.37 months (95% CI: 17.38-25.89) and 12.42 months (95% CI: 9.89-15.11) in the docetaxel 
+ ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively, HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88; p = 0.002.

For QoL, scores were comparable at baseline (participation rate: 90.1%; scores for each arm were not 
reported). Mean QoL scores (± SD) were lower at 3 months in the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm compared 
to the ADT-only treatment arm (63.95 ± 18.5 versus 70.96 ± 20.7, respectively, p = 0.005). Similarly at 6 
months the mean QoL score was lower in the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm versus the ADT-only treatment 
arm (61.84 ± 20.2 versus 70.92 ± 16.8, respectively, p = 0.001). However, no differences in mean global 
and functional scores were recorded between the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only arms at 12 months (67.62 
± 18.4 versus 66.36 ± 20.2, respectively, p = 0.696), although appetite loss (2.31 ± 8.5 versus 9.96 ± 
22.8, p = 0.005), and constipation (10.95 ± 21.0 versus 21.69 ± 31.0, p = 0.012) were more frequent 
(corresponding to lower toxicity single-item QoL scores) in the docetaxel + ADT arm than the ADT-only arm 
at 12 months. 
Long term follow-up analysis: 
A long-term follow-up analysis was performed with median follow-up of 83.9 months. 
The median bPFS was 22.9 months (95% CI: 19.5-28.4) and 12.9 months (95% CI: 11.9-17.7) in the 
docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only treatment arms, respectively (HR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.84; p <0.001).

A similar trend was observed in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). The median rPFS was 22.9 
months (95% CI: 20.5-31.4) and 15.3 months (95% CI:12.4-19.8) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
treatment arms, respectively (HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.87; p = 0.002). 
Analysis performed across trials 
STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, and GETUG-AFU15 were the three studies included in this meta-analysis. 
Demographic of studies populations 
STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies were suggestive of worse prognoses, and as such the patients in those 
studies were perhaps more likely to gain benefit from chemotherapy compared to patients in the 
GETUG-AFU15 study. The most noticeable differences in demographics were as follow: 
• 
Patient Gleason scores: in the GETUG-AFU15 study, there were lower percentages of patients with 
scores of 8-10 compared to the other two studies. 
•  Disease volume: 66% and 64% of patients had HVD in the CHAARTED docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only arms, respectively, versus 48% and 47%, respectively, in the GETUG-AFU15 study. 
•  Median PSA values: the patients in the GETUG-AFU15 study had the lowest values (values were 
approximately 64, 51, and 26 ng/mL in the STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, and GETUG-AFU15 studies, 
respectively). 
• 
Performance status: approximately 30% versus 2% of patients in the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 
studies, respectively, reported ECOG PS of 1-2 (whereas STAMPEDE reported WHO PS for patients, 
approximately 21% of whom reported WHO PS 1-2).

In addition, the STAMPEDE study included patients with non-metastatic (230 patients [39%] and 460 
patients [39%] in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT groups, respectively), while patients with non-metastatic 
disease were not included in the other two studies.

Disposition of patients 
A total of 2951 patients were randomized in the 3 RCTs to receive either docetaxel + ADT or ADT-only 
treatment, of whom 1181 were randomized to docetaxel + ADT treatment and 1770 were randomized to 
ADT treatment. Among the 2951 patients, 60 patients were randomized but did not receive their assigned 
treatment. However, all patients were included in their respective ITT population for the efficacy analyses. 
Table 7: Summary of patients disposition by study 
Completion status data were reported for each study’s intervention arms (docetaxel + ADT). Of the 1181 
patients who were randomized to receive docetaxel + ADT, 878 patients completed treatment per protocol 
(ie, 6 cycles for the STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies, and 9 cycles for the GETUG-AFU15 study), 57 
patients did not receive docetaxel, and 246 patients discontinued early. Among the 1181 randomized to

receive docetaxel + ADT, 77% and 84% of patients who received docetaxel in the STAMPEDE and 
CHAARTED studies completed the full 6 cycles of treatment, respectively, whereas about 46% of patients 
completed the full 9 cycles of treatment in the GETUG-AFU15 study. 
Table 8: Summary of patient treatment completion and discontinuation status by study 
Subsequent therapies upon disease progression 
In the primary analysis, 62% of patients in the ADT-only treatment arm received docetaxel at disease 
progression, and in the long-term follow-up analysis, 127 out of 149 patients (85%) with disease 
progression in the ADT-only treatment arm received docetaxel. In comparison, 48% and 41% of patients 
with disease progression in the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE ADT-only treatment arms received docetaxel in 
the primary analysis, respectively. No major difference in other subsequent therapies was observed with the 
exception of a slightly higher use of cabazitaxel and abiraterone or enzalutamide at progression in the 
docetaxel + ADT arm of CHAARTED.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH provided three randomized open studies and one meta-analysis of these three studies to support 
the hypothesis that docetaxel brings a survival benefit to patients suffering from a metastatic prostate 
cancer when given on top of ADT; i.e., earlier than the currently approved indication, when hormone 
sensitivity is lost. 
These studies were not conducted under the responsibility of the MAH. They all compare docetaxel added to 
a backbone of ADT (with or without steroids) to the backbone alone. 
In the largest study (STAMPEDE), only one comparison in one sub-population is of relevance for the sought 
indication: docetaxel was not the only drug tested and the study enrolled as well patients without 
metastases. The relevant analysis is thus a subgroup analysis on metastatic patients prospectively designed 
(since metastatic disease was a stratification factor). There is no description of alpha-protection measures. 
The early analysis provided is in accordance with the statistical plan and is fully powered (at least in the 
whole population). 
The CHAARTED study included only metastatic patients. 
The smallest study, GETUG-AFU15 used the 3-year OS as a primary endpoint and presents the specificity 
that taxanes were extensively used at progression in the control group. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
An overall survival benefit was associated with docetaxel + ADT treatment compared with ADT only in the 
primary analysis in the STAMPEDE study for all patients (corresponding to a 9-month benefit in median OS 
and HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.93; p = 0.006), and in the CHAARTED study (corresponding to a 13.6-month 
benefit in median OS and HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80; p = 0.0003). However, no benefit was shown in the 
smaller GETUG-AFU15 trial (corresponding to a statistically non-significant 4.7-month improvement in 
median OS and HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.75-1.36; p = 0.955). 
The median time to SRE in STAMPEDE was 106 months in the ADT-only group, but was not reached in the 
docetaxel + ADT group. A significant SRE benefit was associated with docetaxel + ADT compared to 
ADT-only treatment (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.74; p = 0.127 x10-5), and the 5-year SRE-free rate was 75% 
and 66% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively. When the analysis was restricted to the 
first 84 months of the trial, a 6.5-month benefit in mean time to SRE was associated with docetaxel + ADT 
compared to ADT-only treatment. 
The median time to PSA failure, PFS, and prostate-cancer related deaths were also improved with docetaxel 
+ ADT treatment in the STAMPEDE study. Median time to PSA failure was improved by 19 months with 
docetaxel + ADT compared to ADT-only treatment, corresponding to a significant PSA failure benefit (HR 
0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.68; p = 0.34 x10-13). There was a 21-month benefit in median PFS for docetaxel + 
ADT compared to ADT-only treatment, corresponding to a significant PFS benefit (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 
0.60-0.81; p = 0.25 x10-5). The 5-year PFS was 53% and 49% in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
groups, respectively. There was an 11-month benefit in median time to death due to prostate cancer for 
docetaxel + ADT compared to ADT-only treatment, respectively, corresponding to a survival advantage 
(subHR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65-0.96; p = 0.019). 
In CHAARTED, median PFS was improved by 8.2 months with docetaxel + ADT compared to ADT-only 
treatment, representing a reduction in risk of disease progression by 40% (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.51-0.72; p 
<0.0001). Median times to CP and CRPC were both improved by 13.2 months and 8.5 months with docetaxel 
treatment, respectively, corresponding to HR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50-0.75; p <0.0001) and 0.61 (95% CI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 57/93

0.51-0.72; p <0.0001), respectively. Finally, the PSA response rates were improved with docetaxel 
treatment at both 6-month and 12-month timepoints. 
Despite no OS benefit in the docetaxel + ADT treatment group in the GETUG-AFU15 study, the study did 
show benefit in cPFS and bPFS docetaxel + ADT compared to ADT-only treatment; cPFS was improved by 8.1 
months, representing a reduction in risk of clinical progression by 25% (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94; p = 
0.0147), and bPFS as assessed by both PWG 1 and 2 definitions (1999 and 2007, respectively) showed a 
benefit of 10 months by each definition (corresponding to HR 0.72 [95% CI: 0.57-0.91; p = 0.0052] and HR 
0.70 [95% CI: 0.56-0.88; p = 0.002], respectively). 
Although the QoL scores for patients in the docetaxel + ADT treatment group were lower than the ADT-only 
treatment group early in the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 studies, by 12 months there was no substantial 
difference between the two treatment groups. 
Updated analyses of the STAMPEDE study: 
The provided updated analyses were performed with a median FU time of 6.5 years (vs 3.5 years for the 
primary analyses) at the data cutoff date and the analysis of OS was based on a total of 719 deaths (66%) 
(vs 494 deaths (45%) for the primary analyses), with 494 events (68%) (vs 350 events (48%) for the 
primary analyses) reported in the ADT arm and 225 events (62%) (vs 144 events (40%) for the primary 
analyses)reported in the ADT + docetaxel arm. 
Updated estimated hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.95), characterizing a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 19% in risk of death with ADT + docetaxel 
compared to ADT (p=0.009).  
Median overall survival (95% CI) in the docetaxel + ADT arm was 58.8 months, compared to 43.2 months 
in the ADT only arm, corresponding to a 16 months survival benefit for the patients treated with 
docetaxel. 
Updated analyses of the CHAARTED study 
Updated analyses were performed with a median FU time of 53.7 months at the data cutoff date and the 
analysis of OS was based on a total of 399 deaths (51%) (vs 237 deaths (30%) for the primary analyses), 
with 211 events (54%) (vs 136 events (35%) for the primary analyses) reported in the ADT arm and 188 
events (47%) (vs 101 events (25%) for the primary analyses)  reported in the ADT + docetaxel arm.  
In these updated analyses, the estimated HR for OS was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89), characterizing a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 28% in risk of death with ADT + 
docetaxel compared to ADT (p=0.0018).  
Median overall survival (95% CI) in the docetaxel + ADT arm was 57.6 months (52 to 63.9), compared to 
47.2 months (41.8 to 52.8) in the ADT only arm, corresponding to a 10.4 months survival benefit for the 
patients treated with docetaxel. 
Updated analyses of STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies 
Overall, updated analyses of these 2 studies, with more mature data, confirmed the primary analyses 
and, demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit for patients treated with docetaxel and 
ADT by comparison to ADT alone. 
The STAMPEDE study was retrospectively analyzed by subgroups according to metastasis burden at 
randomization, using the definition that was used for the CHAARTED study. 
The estimated HR in these 2 subgroups were, numerically, of similar magnitude and test for interaction 
between treatment and disease volume was not significant, supporting the absence of evidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 58/93 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
for heterogeneity in the treatment effect in these 2 subgroups of patients, in contrast to what was 
reported in the CHAARTED study. 
Of note, the ESMO guidelines and EAU guidelines recommended to offer castration combined with 
chemotherapy (docetaxel) to all patients whose first presentation is M1 disease and who are fit enough for 
chemotherapy.  
The new analysis of the STAMPEDE study, with the largest subgroup of patients with a low metastatic 
burden, showed a consistent treatment effect irrespective of metastasis burden, providing 
additional important information to support the use of upfront docetaxel in all M1 patients who are fit enough 
for chemotherapy.

The updated results provided by the MAH for STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies are enough 
mature to support the claimed indication.  
The benefit of anticipating the treatment of prostate cancer with docetaxel at the hormone sensitive 
stage is demonstrated by a statistically significant survival benefit for patients treated with 
docetaxel and ADT by comparison to ADT alone. 
The new analysis of the STAMPEDE study, with the largest subgroup of patients with a low 
metastatic burden, showed a consistent treatment effect irrespective of metastasis burden. 
In the light of this data, the claimed indication is supported.  
In the GETUG-AFU15 study, there is no apparent benefit related to docetaxel with a HR close to 1, and K-M 
curves are quite superimposable. The extensive use of taxanes at progression in the control arm (85% of 
patients with disease progression in the ADT-only treatment arm received docetaxel as subsequent therapy) 
could explain this neutral effect. 
Secondary endpoints in the long-term analysis periods included time to CRPC and time to CP 
(CHAARTED), and rPFS and bPFS (GETUG-AFU15). Similarly to the primary analyses, the secondary 
endpoint results for the long-term analyses showed benefit of treatment with docetaxel + ADT when 
assessed for all patients. Consistent with the primary analysis, the median times to CP and CRPC in the 
CHAARTED long-term analysis were improved with docetaxel + ADT treatment by 13.2 months and 7.7 
months in all patients, respectively, corresponding to HRs of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75; p <0.001) and 0.61 
(95% CI: 0.52-0.73; p <0.001), respectively. In the GETUG-AFU15 study, the same trend was observed. 
The median rPFS was improved by 7.6 months with docetaxel + ADT treatment in all patients, corresponding 
to a reduction in risk of radiographic disease progression by 31% (HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.55-0.87; p = 0.002]). 
Similarly, the median bPFS for this study was improved by 10 months with docetaxel + ADT treatment in all 
patients (HR 0.67 [95% CI: 0.54-0.84; p <0.001]). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Docetaxel has demonstrated activity in all submitted studies, supported by secondary endpoints. The 
updated results provided for STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies are mature enough to support the claimed 
indication. A consistent treatment effect was shown irrespective of metastasis burden. The benefit of 
anticipating the treatment of prostate cancer with docetaxel at the hormone sensitive stage is demonstrated 
by a statistically significant survival benefit for patients treated with docetaxel and ADT by comparison to 
ADT alone. The claimed indication is supported.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Docetaxel is a member of the taxane anti-cancer group of drugs that promote tubulin assembly in vitro and 
stabilizes microtubules against cold induced depolymerization. Other compounds in this group include 
cabazitaxel (Jevtana®), paclitaxel (Taxol®), and paclitaxel albumin (Abraxane®). 
The safety profile of docetaxel is close in nature to that of other taxanes. Treatment with 
microtubule-stabilizing drugs is associated with adverse events that include anemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, infection, pyrexia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor 
neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, asthenia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis/mucositis, 
dehydration, diarrhea, dyspnea, arrhythmia, fluid retention/edema, skin reaction, injection site reaction, 
bilirubin increase, aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) 
increase, alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) increase, and 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia are the most prominent risks for docetaxel and may need, for 
certain categories of patients, secondary and even primary prevention with growth factors. The incidence of 
severe hypersensitivity can be reduced with adequate premedication with corticosteroids. 
The current filing is to align labeling information of docetaxel with these guidelines, using the same 
background information consisting of these three randomized controlled trials. The safety data from the 
STAMPEDE study will form the main source of the safety information to be included in the Labeling. 
Patient exposure 
Safety parameters collected across the three studies included adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory 
tests. However, safety data collection and safety data reporting differed across the three studies, resulting 
in limitations for the safety analysis. 
For the CHAARTED trial, conducted under the sponsorship of ECOG, only severe AEs were collected. 
Furthermore, in the control arm, AEs were not routinely documented although major AEs were to be 
recorded. Seriousness in the CHAARTED study was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute’s 
(NCI) Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERs) for commercial products. 
Safety evaluation timepoints: 
Safety evaluations were performed at specific timepoints during the course of the studies.  
• 
After randomization in the STAMPEDE study, patients were followed-up every 6 weeks for 6 months, 
then every 3 months to 2 years, then every 6 months to 5 years, and then annually. Safety evaluations were 
discontinued upon disease progression.  
In addition, patients in the docetaxel arm were seen every 3 weeks for docetaxel administration; a complete 
blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets was required at baseline and on day 1 of each treatment 
cycle, as were serum bilirubin and renal function, up to discontinuation of docetaxel.  
• 
After randomization in the CHAARTED study, patients were followed up every 3 months to 2 years, 
then every 6 months to 5 years, and then annually. Safety evaluations were discontinued upon disease 
progression.  
In addition, patients in the docetaxel arm were seen every 3 weeks for docetaxel administration; a CBC with 
differential and platelets was required at baseline and on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, as were liver 
function tests, up to discontinuation of docetaxel.

• 
After randomization in the GETUG-AFU15 study, patients were followed up every 3 months to 3.5 
years, then every 6 months. Safety evaluations were discontinued upon disease progression. 
In both treatment arms, a CBC with differential and platelets, biochemistry, glycemia, albumin, renal 
function, and liver function tests were required at each follow up visit up to the month 42 evaluation.  
In addition, patients in the docetaxel arm were seen every 3 weeks for docetaxel administration; a CBC with 
differential, platelets, biochemistry, glycemia, albumin, renal function, and liver function tests were required 
at baseline and on day 1 of each treatment cycle. 
Regarding the STAMPEDE study, in both treatment arms, AEs (including laboratory AEs), were recorded 
on the Toxicity form of the CRF, at each study visit, including severity assessment. The toxicity form of the 
CRF consisted of a list of pre-printed AEs. Whenever an event was serious, a SAEs form was to be filled in. 
Overall, the relationship to study treatment was not recorded for non-serious adverse events. 
Regarding the CHAARTED study, in the docetaxel arm, AEs (including laboratory AEs) were evaluated at 
the end of each treatment cycle, before re-administration of docetaxel, and recorded on the toxicity form of 
the CRF, at once, at the end of the chemotherapy. Event collection was limited to Grade ≥4 for blood/bone 
marrow and metabolic events, and to Grade ≥3 for other non-hematologic event. After discontinuation of the 
chemotherapy, AEs were collected at each study visit, until disease progression. For the patients randomized 
to the control arm, AEs were not routinely documented in the CRF, and only major events were recorded at 
each study visit, until disease progression. 
Regarding the GETUG-AFU15 study, for the patients assigned to the docetaxel arm, AEs (including 
laboratory AEs) were recorded at each cycle of chemotherapy and at the end of chemotherapy, 30 days 
following the last administration of docetaxel.  For the patients assigned to the control arm, AEs (including 
laboratory AEs) were recorded on the toxicity form of the CRF at the 3, 6, and 9 months visit following 
randomization.  Severity was graded according to NCI CTCAE v 3.0.  Overall, the relationship to study 
treatment was not recorded for non-serious adverse events. 
Safety evaluation definitions 
In the STAMPEDE study, AEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial 
subject to whom a medicinal product has been administered, including occurrences which are not 
necessarily caused by or related to that product. 
In the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 protocols, AEs were not specifically defined. 
In STAMPEDE and GETUG-AFU15, SAEs were defined as any AE that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Resulted in death 
Was life-threatening 
Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (in GETUG-AFU15, this was “serious 
temporary incapacity”) 
• 
Consisted of a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in GETUG-AFU15, this was phrased as an event 
that “results in a congenital abnormality, birth defect or abortion”) 
• 
Other important medically significant condition 
Seriousness and subsequent reporting in the CHAARTED study were assessed and performed according to 
the NCI’s AdEERs for commercial products. In this system, unexpected Grade 4 AE with possible/probable or 
definite relationship and Grade 5 AE, irrespective of relationship or expectedness, were subject to expedited 
reporting. In addition, in line with international rules and as per ECOG rules, any event that resulted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 61/93 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or birth defects was subject to 
expedited reporting. 
Data analysis considerations 
All analyses were performed by the sponsors of the studies, and all study reports were prepared by the 
respective sponsors of the 3 studies. Sanofi has no access to the databases of the 3 studies and hence could 
not perform additional analyses. 
The reasons for treatment discontinuation in the studies were as follow: 
• 
STAMPEDE: disease progression while on therapy, unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent illness which 
prevent further treatment, withdrawal of consent for treatment, any alteration in the patient’s condition 
which justifies the discontinuation of treatment in the clinician’s opinion, or intention to commence a new 
anti-cancer treatment due to evidence of relapse. 
• 
CHAARTED: disease progression, extraordinary medical circumstance, patient withdraws consent, 
or unacceptable toxicity. 
• 
GETUG-AFU15: toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or a major 
breach of the protocol 
The main available demographic, baseline and disease characteristics data in the three studies are 
summarized in the two table below: 
Disposition of patients 
A total of 2951 male patients with HSPC were randomized in the three RCTs to receive either ADT alone or

Three (3) patients did not have a safety assessment (two due to early deaths; one for an unknown reason).  
Four (4) patients did not receive docetaxel because their consent was withdrawn. 
This patient was randomized to receive ADT, but received docetaxel + ADT. 
Overall, 1124 patients were treated with docetaxel + ADT and were included in the safety analyses. Among 
these 1124 patients, 935 (83.2%) were to be treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel (from the STAMPEDE and 
form the CHAARTED studies), while 189 (16.8%, from GETUGAFU15) were to be treated with 9 cycles of 
docetaxel. 
A total of 878 of the 1124 patients (78.1%) in the safety population assigned to the docetaxel + ADT 
treatment arms completed the intended treatment across the studies; in STAMPEDE and CHAARTED, 454 
patients (83.3%) and 335 patients (85.9%) completed 6 cycles of treatment per protocol, respectively, 
whereas 89 patients (47.1%) completed 9 cycles of treatment in the GETUG-AFU15 study. 
A total of 246 patients assigned to the docetaxel + ADT treatment arms discontinued treatment early across 
the studies; in STAMPEDE and CHAARTED, 92 patients (16.9%) and 55 patients (14.1%) completed less 
than 6 cycles of treatment, respectively, while 99 patients (52.4%) completed less than 9 cycles of 
treatment in GETUG-AFU15. Of those patients who discontinued treatment, 72 patients (13.2%), 30 
patients (7.7%), and 39 patients (20.6%) discontinued due to toxicities in the STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, and 
GETUG-AFU15 studies, respectively.

Of the 335 patients who completed treatment, 315 clearly completed 6 cycles per protocol. As 
detailed in the CHAARTED CSR Table 8, an old version of the chemotherapy summary form was used for an 
additional 20 patients; of these, 17 appear to have received 6 cycles of treatment (16 with full dose and 1 
with dose reduction) based on the cumulative dose of docetaxel, 1 patient did not provide cumulative dose 
information (so the number of cycles could not be estimated), and the remaining 2 patients had reported 
dose modifications and may have received 6 cycles.  
b 
The GETUG-AFU15 CSR does not specifically state how many patients completed 9 cycles; it is noted 
however that 99 patients received <9 cycles, and 4 patients did not receive docetaxel. The remaining 89 
patients are listed in this table as having completed 9 cycles of treatment. 
Demography: 
While patient ages were similar across the studies, the percentage of patients in GETUG-AFU15 with ECOG 
PS 1-2 was significantly lower than in the CHAARTED study (the STAMPEDE study used WHO PS).

Disease characteristics were well balanced within each of the three studies. In each study, the majority of 
the patients had a Gleason score of at least 8. While all patients were metastatic at baseline in the 
CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 studies, the STAMPEDE study accepted patients with less advanced disease 
and 39% of the patients had non-metastatic disease.  
Across the studies, differences in disease characteristics included a lower percentage of patients in the 
GETUG-AFU15 study with Gleason scores of 8-10 compared to the other two studies, and a lower median 
baseline PSA value in GETUG-AFU15 compared to the other studies (approximately 26 ng/mL, versus 
approximately 64 ng/mL and 51 ng/mL in STAMPEDE and CHAARTED, respectively).

Adverse events 
The CSRs for the STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, and GETUG-AFU15 studies were completed on 24 January 2019, 
25 November 2015, and 06 February 2017, respectively; no new analyses were performed. 
The STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies assessed docetaxel + ADT therapy over 6 cycles, whereas the 
GETUG-AFU15 study assessed the therapy over 9 cycles. Due to the variations in analyses across studies, 
AEs are presented for the following periods:  
• 
STAMPEDE: over the entire duration of the study and up to 6 months on study (the time 
corresponding to the period of chemotherapy)  
• 
• 
CHAARTED: over the entire time on study treatment 
GETUG-AFU15: up to 6 months on treatment in the control arm and up to the discontinuation of 
chemotherapy in the experimental arm. 
Regarding STAMPEDE: 
Over the entire duration of the study, almost all treated patients experienced at least one AE. More patients 
with Grade ≥3 AEs were observed in the docetaxel arm (283 patients, 52%) than in the ADT arm (384 
patients, 32%). SAEs were also more frequently reported in the docetaxel arm compared to the ADT-only 
arm (31% versus 10%, respectively).  
The same pattern was observed when considering the period of time corresponding to the duration of the 
chemotherapy (up to 6 months).

Overall, over the first 6 months on treatment, there was no difference between treatment arms with regard 
to the proportion of patients reporting at least one severe (Grade ≥3) AEs (16% in each treatment arms).  
For Grade ≥3 AEs, toxicities in the following body systems were more common in the docetaxel + ADT arm 
compared to the ADT-only arm, respectively: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Blood and lymphatic toxicities (15% versus 1%)

Grade ≥3 AEs, reported in excess of at least 2% in the docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the ADT arm were 
febrile neutropenia (difference: +15%), neutropenia (+12%), and diarrhea (+3%). 
Grade ≥3 impotence was more frequent in the ADT-only arm (6% versus 3%). 
Regarding the CHAARTED study: 
In accordance with ECOG/protocol rules, systematic safety data collection in the CHAARTED study was 
performed in the docetaxel + ADT arm, only, and was focused on Grade ≥3 AEs. Safety data were not 
systematically documented in the control arm; only “major” events were to be reported, precluding safety 
comparison between treatment arms. 
In the docetaxel + ADT arm, the most frequently occurring treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs were 
neutropenia (12.1%, including 9% Grade 4 events), febrile neutropenia (6.1%), and fatigue (4.1%). Grade 
≥3 allergic reactions were reported in 2.1% of the patients. Related Grade ≥3 diarrhea, vomiting, stomatitis, 
peripheral neuropathy, sensory neuropathy, and thromboembolic events occurred at rate of ≤1%. 
Regarding the GETUG-AFU15 study: 
No safety overview analysis was performed for the GETUG-AFU15 study. 
AEs were more frequent in the docetaxel + ADT arm, with an overall safety profile consistent with the known 
safety profile of docetaxel.  
As expected, the most frequent all-grade toxicities occurring in the docetaxel + ADT arm were hematological 
toxicities (primarily anemia and neutropenia, in 72% and 50% of the patients, respectively) and 
gastrointestinal toxicities (primarily diarrhea [31%], nausea [29%], constipation [22%], and mucositis 
[21%]). All-grade sensory neuropathy and edema were each reported in 29% of the patients treated with 
docetaxel. All-grade fatigue was reported in 74% of the patients treated with docetaxel. 
Low grade increased ALT and AST were more reported in 23% and 20% of the patients treated with 
docetaxel.  
AEs (all grades) reported in excess of at least 10% in the docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the ADT-only 
arm were fatigue (+54%), alopecia (+53%), anemia (+50%), neutropenia (+47%), nail change (+39%), 
diarrhea (+29%), nausea (+27%), sensory neuropathy (+25%), edema (+24%), mucositis (+21%), 
constipation (+17%), dyspnea (+16%), cough (+13%), rash/desquamation (+13%), skin reaction 
(+13%), infection without neutropenia (11%), ALT and AST increases (+11%), and fever (+10%). 
AEs related to hormone therapy were reported at similar incidences in the two treatment arms, with the 
notable exception of all grade hot flashes which were more frequent in the ADT-only arm (63%) compared 
to the docetaxel + ADT arm (37%). 
Few Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in the ADT-only arm. Grade ≥3 AEs reported with a higher incidence in ≥
5% in the docetaxel + ADT arm by comparison to the ADT-only arm were neutropenia (32% versus 0%), 
febrile neutropenia (7% versus 0%), and fatigue (7% versus 1%). 
Other frequently (≥5% of the patients) reported Grade ≥3 AEs were decreased libido and erectile 
dysfunction, which were reported at similar rates in both treatment arms. 
Analysis of adverse events by main organ system across study 
In this section are presented, side by side, the safety results of the STAMPEDE and GETUGAFU15 studies. 
Results of the CHARTEED study were not included because the systematic collection of AEs was limited to the 
related Grade ≥3 events for the experimental arm. 
For the STAMPEDE study, the results are from the analysis up to 6 months on study.

- Hematology 
Anemia was the most frequently reported hematologic toxicity. All grade events were more frequent in the 
docetaxel + ADT treatment arms than in the ADT arms. Barely any severe events (Grade ≥3) were reported. 
In the two studies, neutropenia (Grade ≥3) was reported very commonly (≥10%). Febrile neutropenia was 
reported at rates ranging from 8% to 15%, higher than what was reported in the hormone resistant patient 
setting (3% of the patients in the TAX 327 study [10]). 
Neither of the studies required prevention of severe neutropenic complications with growth factor. 
In the GETUG-AFU15 study, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended G-CSF (5 
μg/kg/day subcutaneously once daily) from day 5 to day 10 after each docetaxel administration, after two 
deaths were reported related to febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection among the first 108 patients 
randomized to the docetaxel arm.

- Respiratory disorders 
Dyspnea and coughing events were more frequent in the patients treated in the docetaxelcontaining arms of 
the two studies compared to those treated with ADT-only. In the STAMPEDE study, upper respiratory tract 
infections were also more frequent in the patients treated with docetaxel + ADT. 
Severe events (Grade ≥3) were reported in 2% or less of the patients. The most frequent severe event was 
dyspnea, reported in 2% of the patients in the docetaxel +ADT arm of the GETUG-AFU15 study.

- Liver function disorders 
In the GETUG-AFU15 study, AEs of low grade increased LFTs were more commonly reported in the 
docetaxel-containing arm; this is consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel, which is frequently 
associated with mild serum elevations of aminotransferases. No such difference was observed in the 
STAMPEDE study; however no conclusion should be drawn from this observation, as no analysis of 
systematic laboratory test results has been performed.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Most deaths in these studies involving advanced cancer patients were due to progressive disease. 
In STAMPEDE, there were a total of 590 patient deaths; 175 and 415 in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only 
arms, respectively. Overall, 143 (82%) and 347 (84%) were due to prostate cancer, whereas 7 (4%) and 11 
(3%) were due to AEs which occurred at any time from the beginning of the trial in the docetaxel + ADT and 
ADT-only treatment arms, respectively. In the docetaxel + ADT arm, two patients died within 30 days 
following the last administration of docetaxel. 
Of the 7 patients who died in relation to AEs in the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm: 
• 
Two patients experienced a SAE and death within 30 days of their last docetaxel treatment (one 
patient [patient 3067] was found dead at home, with a postmortem examination showing a cerebral 
infarction; the other experienced neutropenic sepsis, which resulted in death and was considered a SAR. 
• 
One patient [patient 16004] experienced a SAE within 30 days of docetaxel treatment, but died over

At the time of the primary analysis database freeze, outcomes for all fatal AEs were not coded. A total of 4 and 
3 patients in the ADT-only and docetaxel + ADT arms, respectively, experienced Grade 5 AEs, while the others 
experienced Grade 2-4 AEs that eventually resulted in death.  
b 
One AE death was also reviewed as a death due to prostate cancer. 
In CHAARTED, there were 237 patient deaths at the cut-off date (101 deaths in the docetaxel + ADT arm, 
and 136 in the ADT-only arm). There was 1 death of unknown cause during the course of docetaxel therapy 
(the patient was found dead at home), which was considered to be possibly related to docetaxel. 
In GETUG-AFU15, death data were not analyzed and no listings were produced. At the cut-off date, 176 
patients had died (88 in each treatment arm). It was noted that there were 4 deaths due to the following 
toxicities in the docetaxel + ADT treatment arm: 
• 
• 
• 
Septic shock with pneumopathy and febrile neutropenia (related to docetaxel)  
General health deterioration (related to docetaxel)  
Neutropenic sepsis (possibly related to docetaxel and ADT [bicalutamide and goserelin acetate])

No summary of SAEs was performed for the STAMPEDE study. 
No summary of AdEERs was performed for the CHAARTED study. 
No summary of serious adverse events was performed for the GETUG-AFU15 study. 
Narratives for the following two patients from the STAMPEDE study (experiencing fatal events related to 
docetaxel as per investigator judgement) were written based on information from the Sanofi 
pharmacovigilance database: 
• 
Sanofi PV Case ID: xxxxxxxxxxx 
Pt: xxxxx, docetaxel + ADT treatment arm 
A 
68 year-old patient initiated treatment with docetaxel (142 mg) and goserelin on 12 December 2006 
for metastatic prostate cancer. No relevant medical history or concomitant medication was reported. 
On 19 December 2006 he was diagnosed with neutropenic sepsis (grade 4), and on the next day he was 
admitted to the critical care unit. He was treated with antibiotics (NOS) iv, G-CSF, and oxygen therapy with 
“respiratory support”. The patient died on xx xxxxxx xx. The primary cause of death has been reported as 
bronchopneumonia fatal with secondary cause of neutropenic sepsis. No autopsy was performed.  
The investigator considered the fatal event was definitely related to docetaxel. Underlying prostate cancer 
was considered to be a contributing factor. 
• 
Sanofi PV Case ID: xxxxxxxxxx 
Pt: xxxxx, docetaxel + ADT treatment arm 
A 75 year-old patient initiated docetaxel (140 mg) + ADT (goserelin was started 08 August 2012) on 17 
September 2012. He last received cycle 3 of docetaxel on 05 November 2012 (no information for goserelin). 
No relevant medical history was reported. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, irbesartan, 
moxonidine, nifedipine, omeprazole, prednisolone, propranolol, and simvastatin.  
On 14 November 2012, the patient was hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia. The white blood cell count 
was 1.7 x 109/L (normal range: 4-11 x 109/L), the neutrophil count was 0.20 x 109/L (normal range: 
2.0-7.5 x109/L), and the hemoglobin level was 9.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17 g/dL). Antibiotics (NOS) 
and intravenous fluid therapy were started. On an unknown date he was admitted to ICU with hypoxia, and 
on 23 November 2012, he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii (Pneumocystis jirovecii). Despite 
treatment with antibiotics (NOS) and mechanical ventilation, his condition continued to deteriorate, and on 
09 December 2012 dialysis was started. The patient died on xx xxxxxxx xxxx. The cause of death was 
reported as myocardial infarction. An autopsy was performed (the result was not reported). 
The investigator considered the fatal event of myocardial infarction and febrile neutropenia were related to 
docetaxel and not to goserelin. 
No narratives were written as part of the CHAARTED CSR. The narrative for the following patient who 
reported fatal event related to docetaxel + ADT was prepared based on information from the Sanofi 
pharmacovigilance database (case reported via AdEERs):

A 69 year-old male patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2005, and received surgical treatment on 
March 2005 followed by hormonal therapy from March 2005 to January 2007. His preexisting conditions 
included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoker, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and 
Barrett's esophagus.  
Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril, loperamide, 
omeprazole, bicalutamide, prochlorperazine edisylate, gabapentin, metformin hydrochloride, and 
metoprolol.  
The patient was randomized to receive docetaxel + ADT (arm A). He received 4 cycles of docetaxel and 
goserelin from 21 July 2010 to 22 September 2010. 
On xx xxxxx xxxx, he was found dead at home. No laboratory data are available. No autopsy was performed.  
The investigator considered that the event of “death” was possibly related to docetaxel. 
Narratives for patients in the GETUG-AFU15 study who experienced fatal SAEs possibly related to docetaxel 
were provided by Unicancer in the CSR, as follow: 
• 
Patient xx: Septic shock with pneumopathy and febrile neutropenia (Grade 4)  
(FR-UNICANCER-xxxxxxxx) 
A 58-year old man was included in the study on the 12 September 2005 and randomized to docetaxel + ADT. 
The patient received 1 cycle of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and goserelin acetate (10.8 mg) on the 12 September 
2005. He developed symptoms, including fever (40°C) and abdominal pain, related to a pneumopathy 
during the evening of 17 September 2005. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated on the 17-Sep-2005. The 
patient was hospitalized on the 18 September 2005 with acute respiratory distress. A pneumopathy was 
diagnosed and the patient was treated with mechanical ventilation, vascular filling, and antibiotherapy. The 
patient died on the xx xxxxxx xxxx. The investigator and the sponsor both considered the event related to 
the docetaxel but not reasonable related to the goserelin acetate.  
• 
Patient xxx: General health deterioration (FR-UNICANCER-xxxxxxx) 
A 76-year old man was included in the study on the 14 April 2006 and randomized to docetaxel + ADT. 
Relevant medical history included hypertension and arrhythmia. The patient received 4 cycle of docetaxel 
(cumulative dose of 480 mg) with the last administration (120 mg) on the 10 July 2006. The patient was 
hospitalized for a vagal reaction with associated lumbar pain without neurological symptoms on the 26 May 
2006, the patient recovered on the 27 May 2006. On the 12 June 2006 the patient was hospitalized with 
bowel obstruction with neutropenia (Grade 4), the patient was treated with growth factor and 
antibiotherapy. On the 13 July 2006, the patient was urgently hospitalized due to general health 
deterioration (Grade 4). The patient died on the xx xxxxx xxxx. The investigator and the sponsor both 
considered the event related to the docetaxel. 
• 
Patient xxx: Neutropenic sepsis (FR-UNICANCER-xxxxxxx) 
A 73-year old man was included in the study on the 10 November 2006 and randomized to docetaxel + ADT. 
The patient received 2 cycle of docetaxel on the 20 November 2006 and on the 11 December 2006 (75 
mg/m2). The patient was also administered oral daily bicalutamide (50 mg) from the 10 November 2006 till 
the 19 December 2006, and goserelin acetate on the 10 November 2006 (10.8 mg). On the 19 December 
2006 the patient was hospitalized with febrile aplasia, tachycardia, and hypotension, and was treated with 
antibiotherapy. During the evening of the xx December 2006 the patient had a cardiorespiratory failure and 
could not be resuscitated. The patient died on the xx xxxxxxx xxxx. The investigator and the sponsor both 
considered the event possibly related to docetaxel, bicalutamide, and goserelin acetate.

Laboratory findings 
No analyses of laboratory data were performed for the three studies included in this submission. 
No analyses of vital signs or physical findings were performed for the three studies included in this 
submission. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety analyses by special groups of patients were not performed for the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 
studies. The analyses for the STAMPEDE study were performed over the entire duration of the study 
treatment. 
- Age 
No major differences were reported between age categories. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel 
arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, neutropenia, anemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes 
when compared to the patients aged less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached the 
threshold of 10% difference. 
Events of renal impairment and urinary frequency were slightly more frequent in patients aged ≥65 years, 
irrespective of treatment arms. 
No such differences were observed for Grade ≥3 AEs, with the exception of neutropenia; neutropenia was 
reported in 14% of the patients treated with docetaxel and aged ≥65 years, and in 10% of the patients 
treated with docetaxel and aged less 65 years. 
A tendency for more frequent febrile neutropenia in the elderly population was noted (17% versus 13% 
among patients aged ≥65 years and <65 years, respectively).

A similar analysis was performed for the patients aged ≥75 years. 
Only 48 and 128 patients treated with docetaxel + ADT and ADT, respectively, were aged ≥75 years. 
There was a general tendency for more frequent AEs in the patients treated with docetaxel aged ≥ 75 years 
compared to those aged <75 years. By a threshold of at least 10%, more patients aged ≥75 years in the 
docetaxel-containing arm reported neutropenia, anemia, diarrhea, dyspnea, and upper respiratory tract 
infection. An increased incidence of anemia in patients aged ≥75 years in the ADT-only arm was also 
observed. 
Severe (Grade ≥3) neutropenia was reported more frequently in patients aged ≥75 years in 
docetaxel-containing arm compared to the ADT-only arm.

- Metastatic disease versus non-metastatic disease 
Evaluation of the safety according to the baseline metastatic status was limited to the STAMPEDE study only. 
There was a general tendency for the M0 patients to experience more frequent AEs compared to the M1 
patients, irrespective of the treatment received. However, these differences were often more pronounced for 
the patients treated with docetaxel, with the exception of diarrhea and lethargy. 
With a threshold of ≥10% difference, dyspepsia and arthralgia were reported more frequently in the M0 
patients treated with docetaxel compared to the M1 patients treated with docetaxel, while incidences of 
these events were comparable between M0 and M1 patients treated with ADT alone. 
Neutropenia, although not reaching the 10% threshold, was more frequently reported in the M0 patients 
treated with docetaxel than in the M1 patients (26% versus 17%). 
As expected, bone pain was reported more frequently in the M1 patients than in the M0 patients, irrespective 
of the treatment received. There was no difference in incidence of bone pain between treatment arms for the 
M1 patients.

Regarding the Grade ≥3 events, no clinically meaningful differences were noted between M0 and M1 patients 
treated with docetaxel. Severe neutropenia were slightly more frequent in the M0 patients when compared 
to the M1 patients (15% versus 11%). Severe bone pain was only reported in the M1 patients. 
There was no difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia between M0 and M1 patients treated with 
docetaxel; febrile neutropenia was reported in 15% of the M0 patients treated with docetaxel, and in 16% of 
the M1 patients treated with docetaxel.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 141 patients discontinued treatment due to AEs; in STAMPEDE, 72 patients (13.2%) discontinued 
treatment, while 30 patients (7.7%) and 39 patients (20.6%) in the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 studies, 
respectively, discontinued treatment due to AEs (“toxicity” in GETUGAFU15). No further information is 
available for these patients. 
Post marketing experience 
Because docetaxel has been indicated for hormone refractory prostate cancer, and the majority of 
pharmacovigilance data is from unsolicited reports (and therefore information is limited), pharmacovigilance 
data cannot be produced specifically for the HSPC indication. 
In order to provide a more complete safety profile of docetaxel, a cumulative search from Taxotere® launch 
to 30 November 2018 was performed in the Sanofi global pharmacovigilance database to identify all adverse 
events/reactions reported with docetaxel from spontaneous reports, non-interventional post marketing

studies, and other solicited sources (for all indications, including unapproved indications). The report 
includes only those events where either the 'reporter causality' or the 'Company causality' is related to the 
selected product in the "Non-Interventional Post-Marketing Study and Reports from Other Solicited 
Sources". 
Docetaxel has been on market more than 20 years (international birth date [IBD] of 30 November 1994). 
Safety evaluation reports are periodically submitted; the most recent PBRER was submitted with DLP of 30 
November 2017, and accompanies this submission in 5.3.6 Reports of Postmarketing Experience. 
Sales figures for the interval period were received for the period from 01 October 2016 through 30 
September 2017. Exposure from the cumulative experience is available from 01 October 2001 through 30 
September 2018 (17 years). Based on an estimate that the average body surface area is equal to 1.7 m2, 
the recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 represents 170 mg per patient per cycle. The total number of 
milligrams sold divided by 170 mg per patient per cycle is equal to the total number of cycles. On average, 
it is estimated that patients receive 5 cycles of docetaxel; therefore, the total number of cycles divided by 5 
is equal to the approximate number of patients exposed to docetaxel. Since on the market, the estimated 
number of patients who received docetaxel commercially worldwide was therefore more than 2.8 million 
patients, cumulative, from 01 October 2001 through 30 September 2018. 
Additionally, a cumulative search of the Sanofi global pharmacovigilance database was performed as a 
supplemental postmarketing experiences safety review. Cases were reported up to 30 November 2018. A 
total of 69,457 cases were retrieved with 217,427 events, of which the majority were reported under the 
SOCs skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (N = 35,077), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (N = 29,720), and investigations (N = 24,882).  
The thorough safety analysis of docetaxel, as performed and evaluated in these documents and in regular 
pharmacovigilance activities, showed that the safety profile of docetaxel has been consistent with reference 
safety information. 
Safety data from published literature 
Docetaxel has been reported in literature to increase the risk of severe neutropenia and complicated 
neutropenia in mHSPC patients. 
After accrual of 215 patients in the GETUG-AFU15 study, 4 treatment-related deaths were reported, 
including one due to febrile neutropenia and one other due to neutropenia with infection. Following these 
events, the protocol was amended for systematic primary prevention with G-CSF after each administration 
of docetaxel. After this amendment was implemented, the proportion of patients with Grade 3-4 neutropenia 
fell from 41% to 15%, the proportion of patients with febrile neutropenia fell from 8% to 6%, and no 
subsequent toxic deaths were reported. For the overall study, the incidence of Grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia 
was 7%, and the incidence of Grade 3-4 infections with neutropenia was 2%.  
High incidences of febrile neutropenia were reported in the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE studies (6.2% and 
15% rates of febrile neutropenia, respectively), as well. 
Similar results were reported earlier, from 2005 to 2008, in small-size studies in mHSPC patients. In these 
studies, using a dose of docetaxel ranging from 70 to 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, severe neutropenia was 
reported in 58%, 62%, and 61% of study patients, respectively.  
Collectively, these observations contrasted with the results from the TAX 327 study in first line metastatic 
disease in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who had disease progression 
during hormonal therapy. In TAX 327, with docetaxel administered 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, Grade 3-4 
neutropenia was reported in 32% of the patients, and febrile neutropenia in 3% of the patients.

This contrast in occurrence of severe neutropenia and neutropenic complications between mCRPC and 
mHSPC patients triggered evaluation of potential differences in the systemic clearance of docetaxel in these 
two different populations of patients. This study included 20 castrated and 10 non-castrated patients. 
Compared with mHSPC patients, the clearance of docetaxel in the mCRPC patients was increased by 
approximatively 100% and was associated with an approximatively two-fold reduction in area under the 
curve (AUC). The erythromycin breath test indicated that the hepatic activity of CYP3A4 was not altered in 
the castrated patients, and therefore that the increased clearance in castrated men was not the result of an 
increased CYP34A-mediated metabolism of docetaxel in the liver. The authors showed that the AUC of 
docetaxel in the liver was significantly higher in castrated rats when compared with intact animals, 
supporting the hypothesis of a greater uptake of docetaxel in the liver in castrated animals. The authors 
ultimately showed that in castrated animals, this increased uptake by the liver was associated with an 
increased expression of rOat2, a transporter that in part regulates the transfer of docetaxel from systemic 
circulation to hepatocytes.  
Considering those results, a pharmacokinetic evaluation was conducted of 74 patients treated with 
docetaxel in the context of a registry trial in the Netherlands. Out of these 74 patients, all men with 
non-prostate cancer tumors served as controls (n = 36) for the 38 patients with metastatic hormone 
resistant prostate cancer patients. Dosage of docetaxel ranged from 30 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2, given in 
different schedules. In the mCRPC patients, there was an increased docetaxel clearance compared to 
uncastrated men (48.4 L/h versus 42.1 L/h, respectively). In addition, both absolute neutrophil count nadir 
and white blood cell count nadir were higher in castrated patients (4.1 versus 1.7 ×109/L, 5.3 versus 
3.1×109/L, respectively). This study provided further evidence of a more pronounced hematological toxicity 
in mHSPC patients compared to mCRPC men treated with docetaxel. 
In 2016, the results of a meta-analysis of 7 phase 2-3 trials comparing docetaxel to non-docetaxel control 
arms (ie, the best supportive care including non-cytotoxic therapy or mitoxantrone) for prostate cancer were 
published, including a total of 5088 patients. In most studies, the use of G-CSF was at the discretion of the 
investigators. The global incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with docetaxel was 10.7%. The 
relative risk (RR) of febrile neutropenia was higher in patients who received docetaxel compared to patients 
who did not (RR 16.8, 95% CI: 10.7-26.4; p <0.0001). Among the patients treated with docetaxel, there 
was a numerically higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the mHSPC population when compared to the 
mCRPC population (12.4% versus 6.6%, respectively). Of note, this difference in incidences was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.7).  
Following the publication of the STAMPEDE results in 2016, several authors published retrospective safety 
analyses of real life cohort of hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, with either nodal or high risk 
locally advanced or metastatic disease. These cohorts of patients were in general of modest size, ranging 
from 39 to 63 patients, corresponding to the cumulative clinical experience at single institutions; 
consistently, high rates of febrile neutropenia or neutropenic sepsis were reported by these reports (ie, 13% 
febrile neutropenia; 30% febrile neutropenia; 20% neutropenic sepsis). In a single-institution retrospective 
analysis, 39 patients with mCRPC were compared to 22 patients with mHSPC; the incidences of neutropenic 
fever were 5% and 9% in the mCRPC and in the mHSPC patients, respectively. 
In conclusion, there is a body of accumulating evidence for numerically higher incidences of severe 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic sepsis in patients with mHSPC when compared to mCRPC 
patients. Although in the largest analyzed data set the difference in incidences of febrile neutropenia 
between mCRPC and mHSPC patients did not reach statistical significance, consideration should be given to 
primary prophylaxis with growth factors, in particular for patients presenting other risk factors for febrile 
neutropenia; eg, age ≥65 years, previous radiotherapy, preexisting neutropenia, altered organ functions, 
and multiple comorbid conditions.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of docetaxel is close in nature to that of other taxanes. Treatment with 
microtubule-stabilizing drugs was described to be generally associated with adverse events that include 
anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, infection, pyrexia, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, motor neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, asthenia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
stomatitis/mucositis, dehydration, diarrhea, dyspnea, arrhythmia, fluid retention/edema, skin reaction, 
injection site reaction, bilirubin increase, aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamicoxaloacetic 
transaminase (AST/SGOT) increase, alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase 
(ALT/SGPT) increase, and hypersensitivity reaction. 
Based on the established safety profile of docetaxel in other indications, severe neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia are the most prominent risks for docetaxel and may need, for certain categories of patients, 
secondary and even primary prevention with colony stimulating factors. The incidence of severe 
hypersensitivity can be reduced with adequate premedication with corticosteroids. The necessity of 
pre-medication with G-CSF or corticoids in certain cases is already adequately covered in the current PI. 
Safety data to support the indication “for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone sensitive 
prostate cancer in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or 
prednisolone” are based primarily upon 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs): 
• 
STAMPEDE: Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate cancer: Evaluation of Drug 
Efficacy  
• 
CHAARTED-E3805: Chemo-Hormonal therapy versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for 
Extensive Disease in prostate cancer  
• 
GETUG-AFU15: Hormone Therapy and Docetaxel or Hormone Therapy Alone in Treating Patients 
with Metastatic Prostate Cancer 
The Applicant has chosen the STAMPEDE study to be the main study for safety reporting as for this study, 
safety data were reported most comprehensively. Also, the posology was in line with what is now proposed 
to be stated in the amended PI. This was acceptable. 
Safety results for the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 study were reported separately, limited safety data 
gained from these studies is only briefly discussed. 
In the STAMPEDE study, no causality assessment was performed for the AEs and frequency of non-serious 
ADRs cannot be assessed based on the submitted data. In consequence, the table proposed for section 4.8 
states that adverse events are listed “regardless of causal relationship”. However, it seems that higher grade 
AEs (3-5) have been assessed for causality. 
Substantially more adverse events in the class “Neutrophil toxicity” (=Neutropenia) have been reported 
for treatment arm C (SOC+Doc). This is true for AEs < grade 3 (approximately twice as much) and even 
more for ≥ grade 3. No Grade 5 toxicities have been reported in the category “blood/bone marrow 
toxicity”.Neutropenia is listed in the frequency category “very common”, with the frequency 12% for G3-5 
events, in the newly added table in section 4.8 of the amended SmPC. The risk of developing Neutropenia is 
already covered in the SmPC, e.g. in section 4.4 “Haematology”. Adverse events of“Febrile neutropenia” 
have also been more frequently reported for treatment arm C (SOC+Doc). Results of the STAMPEDE trial 
regarding blood/bone marrow toxicity/ blood and lymphatic toxicity have been adequately covered in the 
proposed PI including its amendments. 
GI haemorrhage is not stated as AE/ADR in the PI, this AE was, however, also not more frequently reported 
in treatment arm C (SOC+Doc) and this is therefore acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647024/2019 
Page 86/93

Adverse events in the class “general disorder toxicity” have been significantly more frequently reported in 
treatment arm C (SOC+Doc). Grade 4 or 5 toxicities did not occur, except one case of grade 4 asthenia in 
treatment arm A (SOC) and one case of grade 4 lethargy (maximal grade) in each of the treatment arms). 
Lethargy, flu-like syndromes and asthenia are listed as very common adverse events in the newly added 
table in section 4.8 of the amended SmPC, fever and oral candidiasis are listed in the frequency category 
“common”.  Results of the STAMPEDE trial regarding general disorder toxicity have been adequately covered 
in the proposed PI including its amendments. 
Limited safety data available from the CHAARTED study indicate a safety profile generally in line with what 
was seen in the STAMPEDE trial. Peripheral neuropathy, sensory neuropathy and thromboembolic occurred 
at rate of ≤1%. events are not listed as AEs/ADRs in the SmPC, as this reports only the safety results for the 
STAMPEDE trial. 
Assessment of the safety data provided for the GETUG-AFU 15 study indicate a safety profile generally in line 
with what was seen in the STAMPEDE trial. However, alopecia (54% grade 1- 5), sensory neuropathy (29% 
grade 1-5) and haemoglobin (72% grade 1- 5) are not listed as AEs/ADRs in the SmPC, as this reports only 
the safety results for the STAMPEDE trial. These AEs are, however, also reported for mCRPC (current PI) and 
regarded to be of relevance for the treating physician and patient. 
The adverse events reported in the three Clinical Studies are consistent with the known safety profile of 
docetaxel. However, literature data indicate possible differences (increase) in frequency of severe adverse 
reactions as febrile neutropenia in mHSPC patients compared to mCRPC patients.  
It should be noted that fatal events related to docetaxel treatment are also part of the known safety profile 
for docetaxel. Deaths possibly related to docetaxel have been also reported for STAMPED (n=2), CHAARTED 
(n=1) and GETUG-AFU 15 (n=4). As stated in the SmPC, docetaxel is contraindicated in patients with 
baseline neutrophil count of ‹ 1,500 cells/mm3 (SmPC section 4.3) and prophylactic G-CSF may be used to 
mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities (SmPC section 4.2). In addition, also the warning section of the 
SmPC (4.4) contains detailed information on neutropenia as most frequent and sometimes severe adverse 
reaction. 
With regard to age dependency, the STAMPEDE study showed that more patients ≥65 years in the docetaxel 
arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, neutropenia, anemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes 
compared to patients below 65. In addition, more patients ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported grade 
≥3 neutropenia compared to patients below 65.  This is also true for febrile neutropenia in (17% versus 
13%). For patients above the age of 75, more patients ≥75 years in the docetaxel arm reported AEs 
compared to patients below 75 in every AE category. 
Regarding time dependency, the breakdown of worst toxicity grade (any grade) for different time points 
provided shows that docetaxel related toxicity is most obvious during the administration (docetaxel is 
administered in 6 cycle every 3 weeks). In later time points (after 1 year or 2 years), differences between 
the treatment arms (SOC vs. SOC + DoC) diminish. This result would have been expected and is in line with 
what was seen with the detrimental impact on QoL. 
As regard to metastatic disease versus non-metastatic disease, there was a general tendency for the M0 
patients to experience more frequent AEs compared to the M1 patients, irrespective of the treatment 
received. However, these differences were often more pronounced for the patients treated with docetaxel, 
with the exception of diarrhoea and lethargy. Regarding to Grade ≥3 events, no clinically meaningful 
differences were noted between M0 and M1 patients treated with docetaxel. Severe neutropenia was slightly 
more frequent in the M0 patients when compared to the M1 patients (15% versus 11%). Severe bone pain 
was only reported in the M1 patients. There was no difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia between 
M0 and M1 patients treated with docetaxel; febrile neutropenia was reported in 15% of the M0 patients 
treated with docetaxel, and in 16% of the M1 patients treated with docetaxel.

In summary, the summited safety data picture a safety profile of docetaxel in line with what is already 
known from studies in other malignancies. Safety results, mainly derived from results in the STAMPEDE trial, 
have been overall adequately covered in the proposed PI including its amendments. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data related to the combination of docetaxel and ADT was derived from a large cohort of 1124 
patients and were comprehensively reported.   
Addition of docetaxel to ADT treatments provided additional AEs to those classically related to ADT, notably 
hot-flushes, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction.  
Additional AEs of all grades, reported in excess in the docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the ADT arm, were 
those pertaining to the known safety profile of docetaxel, including alopecia, nail changes, sensory 
neuropathy, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anaemia, stomatitis, nausea, fatigue.  
Grade ≥3 AEs reported in excess in the docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the ADT arm were febrile 
neutropenia, neutropenia, diarrhea and fatigue. 
A thorough safety analysis of docetaxel was performed within this submission that showed that the safety 
profile of docetaxel has been relatively consistent with no major safety concerns. Relevant information is 
reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The WSA submitted RMP version 1.0 with this variation.  
The CHMP was of the opinion that no safety concerns require inclusion in the safety specification of the risk 
management plan for products containing docetaxel. Furthermore, in line with the PRAC recommendation, it 
was agreed that no pharmacovigilance activities and additional risk minimisation measures are currently 
required. However, remaining unresolved issues pertaining to the risk management require further 
assessment and should be resolved in a separate type II variation. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of Malta. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication is for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer, in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or 
prednisolone. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the first cause of death from cancer in men. When 
the disease becomes metastatic, systemic therapy is the only option and despite castration and ADT, the 
disease can progress and become resistant to hormonal manipulations. Taxanes are for the time being 
indicated at these late disease stages, but many oncologists have proposed an earlier use of chemotherapy, 
when the tumour is metastatic but still sensitive to hormones, and investigated this option in clinical trials 
that support the present application. These academic studies led to recommendations in academic and 
institutional guidelines (e.g., ESMO, ASCO). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH submitted three main randomized, controlled, open-label studies, of which STAMPEDE was 
characterised as a main study (n = …), whereas CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 were supportive studies, and 
one meta-analysis of these studies to demonstrate a survival benefit in the claimed indication. In all three 
studies, docetaxel was randomised to be used in combination with a backbone of ADT+/- 
glucocorticosteroids and the primary endpoint was OS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the STAMPEDE study an overall survival difference was shown for all patients (M0 and M1) treated with 
docetaxel and ADT compared with to ADT (corresponding to a 9-month benefit in median OS and HR 0.78, 
95% CI: 0.66-0.93; p = 0.006).  
Among M1 patients of the STAMPEDE trial, a difference in OS was shown in a pre-planned subset analysis for 
the docetaxel + ADT group compared to the ADT-only group. Median survival was 62 months (95% CI: 
51-73) and 43 months (95% CI: 40-48) in the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.76, 
95% CI: 0.62-0.92; p = 0.005), reflecting a 19-month longer median survival associated with docetaxel + 
ADT compared to ADT-only. 
A statistically significant FFS benefit was shown for the docetaxel + ADT group compared to the ADT-only 
group; median FFS was 37 months (95% CI: 33-42) and 21 months (95% CI: 18-23) in the docetaxel + ADT 
and ADT-only groups, respectively (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53-0.70; p = 0.413 x10-13). 
A statistically significant SRE benefit was shown for the docetaxel + ADT group compared to the ADT-only 
group (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.74; p = 0.127 x10-5), and the 5-year SRE-free rate was 75% and 66% in 
the docetaxel + ADT and ADT-only groups, respectively. 
The provided updated analyses were performed with a median FU time of 6.5 years (vs 3.5 years for the 
primary analyses) at the data cutoff date and the analysis of OS was based on a total of 719 deaths (66%) 
(vs 494 deaths (45%) for the primary analyses), with 494 events (68%) (vs 350 events (48%) for the 
primary analyses) reported in the ADT arm and 225 events (62%) (vs 144 events (40%) for the primary 
Assessment report

analyses) reported in the ADT + docetaxel arm. Updated estimated hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.81 (95% 
CI: 0.69 to 0.95), characterizing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 19% in risk 
of death with ADT + docetaxel compared to ADT (p=0.009). Median overall survival (95% CI) in the 
docetaxel + ADT arm was 58.8 months, compared to 43.2 months in the ADT only arm, corresponding to a 
16 months survival benefit for the patients treated with docetaxel. 
An overall survival benefit was shown also in the CHAARTED study in the primary analysis (corresponding to 
a 13.6-month benefit in median OS and HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80; p = 0.0003) and in the long-term 
analysis (corresponding to a 10.4-month benefit in median OS and HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.89; p = 
0.0018). Updated analyses were performed with a median FU time of 53.7 months at the data cutoff date 
and the analysis of OS was based on a total of 399 deaths (51%) (vs 237 deaths (30%) for the primary 
analyses), with 211 events (54%) (vs 136 events (35%) for the primary analyses) reported in the ADT arm 
and 188 events (47%) (vs 101 events (25%) for the primary analyses)  reported in the ADT + docetaxel 
arm. In these updated analyses, the estimated HR for OS was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89), characterizing 
a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 28% in risk of death with ADT + docetaxel 
compared to ADT (p=0.0018). Median overall survival (95% CI) in the docetaxel + ADT arm was 57.6 
months (52 to 63.9), compared to 47.2 months (41.8 to 52.8) in the ADT only arm, corresponding to a 10.4 
months survival benefit for the patients treated with docetaxel. 
In the GETUG-AFU15 study, the main analysis was on a fixed-time assessment of survival at three years.  
There is no apparent benefit related to docetaxel with a HR close to 1, and K-M curves are quite 
superimposable.  
A survival benefit assessed in the meta-analysis was shown in men with mHSPC with HR 0.77 (95% CI: 
0.68-0.87; p <0.0001). 
On secondary endpoints, docetaxel shows an undisputable activity in all submitted studies. This was 
expected. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The neutral effect on survival observed in the GETUG-AFU15 study could be the result of the extensive use 
of taxanes at progression in the control arm (85% of patients with disease progression in the ADT-only 
treatment arm received docetaxel as subsequent therapy). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events reported in the three Clinical Studies are consistent with the known safety profile of 
docetaxel. The safety data from the STAMPEDE study formed the main source of safety information for 
updating the PI. 
Addition of docetaxel to ADT treatments provided additional AEs, including serious AEs, to those classically 
related to ADT. The most frequent AEs (all grades, reported in at least 10% of the patients in the docetaxel 
+ ADT arm of the STAMPEDE study) were lethargy, urinary frequency, impotence, nail changes, diarrhea, 
anemia, constipation, arthralgia, bone pain, generalized pain, insomnia, nausea, stomatitis, fluid retention, 
dyspepsia, myalgia, dyspnea, neutropenia, abdominal pain, coughing, asthenia, headache, flatulence, 
flu-like symptoms, febrile neutropenia, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, rash, increased 
ALT, vomiting, hypersensitivity, and fever. AEs related to hormone therapy were reported at similar 
incidences in the two treatment arms, with the notable exception of all grade hot flashes which were more 
frequent in the ADT-only arm (63%) compared to the docetaxel + ADT arm (37%). Other frequently (≥5% 
of the patients) reported Grade ≥3 AEs were decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, which were reported 
at similar rates in both treatment arms.

Expectedly, those additional AEs were those pertaining to the known safety profile of docetaxel, including 
alopecia, nail changes, sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, stomatitis, nausea, 
fatigue. Several AE were grade ≥3 AEs such as febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, diarrhea and fatigue. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although not statistically significant and based on a limited data set, and cross-study comparisons, there is 
a trend to a higher incidence of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic sepsis in patients 
with mHSPC when compared to mCRPC patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Docetaxel is active on prostate cancer and this was expected given its efficacy demonstrated years ago at 
the castration-resistant and metastatic stage. This activity is confirmed by a survival benefit in two of the 
three studies submitted here (STAMPEDE and CHAARTED), even if in the third study (GETUG-AFU15), 
docetaxel failed to produce even a positive trend. Overall, updated analyses of these 2 studies, with more 
mature data, confirmed the primary analyses and, demonstrated a clinically relevant difference in survival 
for patients treated with docetaxel and ADT by comparison to ADT alone. The STAMPEDE study was 
retrospectively analysed by subgroups according to metastasis burden at randomization, using the definition 
that was used for the CHAARTED study. The estimated HR in these 2 subgroups (low and high burden) were, 
numerically, of similar magnitude and test for interaction between treatment and disease volume was not 
significant, supporting the absence of evidence for heterogeneity in the treatment effect in these 2 
subgroups of patients, in contrast to what was reported in the CHAARTED study. Of note, the ESMO 
guidelines and EAU guidelines recommended to offer castration combined with chemotherapy (docetaxel) to 
all patients whose first presentation is M1 disease and who are fit enough for chemotherapy.

The new analysis of the STAMPEDE study, with the largest subgroup of patients with a low metastatic 
burden, showed a consistent treatment effect irrespective of metastasis burden, providing additional 
information to support the use of upfront docetaxel for all M1 patients.  
Severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic sepsis in patients with mHSPC treated with 
SOC+DOC are an important safety risk. In the STAMPEDE study, a considerable percentage of 13% stopped 
SOC+Doc treatment due to toxicity. Compared to what is known for mCRPC docetaxel toxicity seems to be 
more pronounced in mHSPC. Older people (above 65 or 75 years, respectively) reported AEs more 
frequently, neutropenia, anemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with 
a greater incidence of at least 10% in patients above 75 years. It should be noted that fatal events related 
to docetaxel treatment are also part of the known safety profile for docetaxel. Fatal events possibly related 
to docetaxel have been reported for STAMPED (n=2), CHAARTED (n=1) and GETUG-AFU 15 (n=4).  
Treatment related risks are adequately covered in the PI. As stated in the SmPC, docetaxel is e.g. 
contraindicated in patients with baseline neutrophil count of ‹ 1,500 cells/mm3 (SmPC section 4.3) and 
prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities (SmPC section 4.2). In 
addition, also the warning section of the SmPC (4.4) contains detailed information on neutropenia as most 
frequent and sometimes severe adverse reaction. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The updated results provided by MAH for STAMPEDE and CHAARTED studies are mature to support the 
claimed indication. The benefit of anticipating the treatment of prostate cancer with docetaxel at the 
hormone sensitive stage is now certain and demonstrated a survival benefit for patients treated with 
docetaxel and ADT by comparison to ADT alone. 
The adverse events reported in the three Clinical Studies are consistent with the known safety profile of 
docetaxel. Adverse events below grade 3 are regarded to be of minor relevance.  
It can be concluded that the overall B/R of TAXOTERE / Docetaxel Zentiva in combination with 
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or prednisolone, for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of TAXOTERE / Docetaxel Zentiva is positive.

prednisolone, for Taxotere and Docetaxel Zentiva; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 1.0 has also been 
submitted. In addition, the Worksharing applicant took the opportunity to update information on the local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This recommendation is subject to the following new condition: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
•  Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
- At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
An updated RMP shall be submitted by 31 October 2019.

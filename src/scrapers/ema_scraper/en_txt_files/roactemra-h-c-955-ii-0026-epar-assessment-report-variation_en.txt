2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tocilizumab  (RoActemra)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  anti-human  monoclonal  antibody  of  the 
immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  sub-class  directed  against  the  soluble  and  membrane-bound  interleukin  6 
receptor (sIL-6R and mIL-6R).  
RoActemra  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in 
adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy 
with  one  or  more  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  or  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF) 
antagonists  and  for  the  treatment  of  active  systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (sJIA)  in  patients  2 
years of age and older who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous 
therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF) antagonists.  
In  both  indications  for  adult  RA  patients,  RoActemra  can  be  given  as  in  combination  with  MTX  or  as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.  
Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  is  arthritis  of  at  least  6  weeks  duration  of  unknown  aetiology  that 
begins  in  children  less  than  16  years  old.  Although  less  common  than  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in 
adults,  JIA  is  one  of  the  most  common  systemic  autoimmune  systemic  autoimmune  diseases  in 
children and adolescents. According the ILAR scheme JIA is classified in 7 categories  
Figure 1.  Frequency, age at onset and gender distribution of ILAR categories of JIA 
In the present submission, the polyarticular JIA (pJIA) population studied in the phase III clinical study 
WA19977  consists  of  three  subsets:  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)-positive  polyarthritis,  RF-negative 
polyarthritis, and extended oligoarthritis.

The  current  submission  aims  to  extend  the  indication  of  RoActemra  to  the  treatment  in  combination 
with  methotrexate  (MTX)  of  active  polyarticular  juvenile idiopathic  arthritis  in  patients  2  years  of  age 
and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introductions 
This application is supported by Part I data (16-week active tocilizumab treatment lead-in period) and 
Part II (24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal period) from the pivotal Phase 
III study WA19977 and two supportive studies: studies MRA318JP and MRA319JP. 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  Applicant.  The  Applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Data on the PK and PD characteristics of TCZ have been previously submitted as part of the initial MAA 
and as part of variation II/15 to extend the indication of TCZ to the treatment of sJIA. This submission 
includes new data in pJIA patients. The TCZ clinical pharmacology program for pJIA was conducted to 
characterize the PK and PD of TCZ as well as the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships. 
These  data  are  presented  below  and  are  based  on  studies  WA19977,  MRA318JP  and  MRA319JP. 
Population PK analyses were performed for studies WA19977 and MRA318JP. 
2.2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
In Part I of the pivotal study, blood samples for PK (TCZ serum concentrations) and PD (IL-6 and sIL-
6R)  analysis  were  collected  pre-dose  and  post-dose  (within  15  minutes  following  the  saline  flush 
marking the end of infusion) on Day 1; at the Week 4, 8, and 12; at any time during Weeks 1, 2, 6, 
and  10;  and  pre-dose  at  Week  16.  In  part  II  of  the  study,  pre-dose  blood  samples  for  PK  and  PD 
analysis  were  collected  at  the  Week  20,  24,  28,  32,  36,  and  40  visits,  and  additional  samples  were 
taken at any time during Weeks 18 and 22.  
The presence of anti-TCZ antibodies was assessed at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at Week 40. In 
part II of the study, the visit when JIA ACR30 flare relative to Week 16 had occurred was designated 
“the flare visit”. At the first visit when the flare definition was met, an additional sample was obtained 
for assessment of potential anti-TCZ antibodies. 
PK Results 
Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modeling  was  used  to  analyse  the  serum  concentration-time  TCZ  data 
collected  in  study  WA19977.  The  population  PK  dataset  consisted  of  2631  TCZ  serum  concentrations 
from  188  pJIA  patients.  The  serum  concentration-time  course  for  TCZ  in  patients  with  pJIA  was  best 
described  by  a  two-compartment  disposition  pharmacokinetic  model  with  parallel  first-order  and 
Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics.

Table 3.  Summary of TCZ PK Exposure Parameters by ACR Response Status to Week 16 for 
All Patients (Part I) 
A  trend  towards  lower  exposures  in  non-responders  compared  with  responders,  across  JIA 
ACR30/50/70/90  was  observed.  This  is  even  more  pronounced  for  JIA  ACR30  and  JIA  ACR50. 
Comparing  the  mean  PK  exposures  across  non-responders  for  JIA  ACR30/50/70/90,  there  is  a  trend 
towards lower exposures in the least responsive patients (i.e. JIA ACR30 non-responders).  
In  contrast,  when  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  exposures  were  compared  across  responders  for  JIA 
ACR30/50/70/90, there was no trend observed.

Immunogenicity (Part I and II) 
One  patient  (patient  2342)  developed  positive  neutralizing  anti-TCZ  antibodies  at  Week  20.  Available 
post  dose  PK  concentrations  from  baseline  through  week  12  were  comparable  to  those  from  other 
patients. Because this patient did not receive TCZ dosing at Week 8, she did not have model-computed 
PK exposure results from the study.  
2.2.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Following  TCZ  dosing,  pronounced  changes  were  observed  in  the  inflammatory  markers  C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The decline in median CRP concentrations and 
median ESR occurred rapidly, within the first two weeks of TCZ dosing. The observed changes in CRP 
and ESR were similar between the 10 mg/kg (<30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (≥30  kg) treatment groups, but 
were smaller in magnitude in the 8 mg/kg (<30 kg) group. The median CRP levels stabilized by week 8 
for the 10 mg/kg (<30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) groups but not until week 16 for the 8 mg/kg (<30 
kg)  group.  The  median  ESR  was  lower  in  the  10  mg/kg  (<30  kg)  and  8  mg/kg  (≥30  kg)  treatment 
groups compared to the 8 mg/kg (<30 kg) group from week 2 through week 16. 
2.2.2.3.  Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
Data on the PK and PD characteristics of TCZ have been previously submitted as part of the initial MAA 
and as part of variation II/15 to extend the indication of TCZ to the treatment of sJIA. This submission 
includes new data in pJIA patients. 
Assessment report

Comparable exposure between the 10 mg/kg dose in the lower bodyweight patients (<30 kg) and the 
patients in the 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) was observed, although a trend to somewhat lower exposure even in 
the higher dose for the lower bodyweight patients (<30 kg) was observed. Exposure in patients (<30 
kg)  dosed  with  8  mg/kg  was  consistently  lower  compared  to  the  other  two  dose  groups.  Of  note,  a 
different dosage was selected for the sJIA study. In this study it was demonstrated that doses of 8 and 
12  mg/kg  in  the  respective  body  weight  groups  lead  to  almost  100%  bioequivalent  exposure  (shown 
for the two-weekly application). However, it is reassuring that the 8 and 10 mg/kg have demonstrated 
comparable efficacy in the respective patient groups. 
Comparing the PK exposure to the JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response, a trend towards lower exposures in 
non-responders  compared  with  responders,  across  JIA  ACR30/50/70/90  was  observed.  This  is  even 
more  pronounced  for  JIA  ACR30  and  JIA  ACR50.  Comparing  the  mean  PK  exposures  across  non-
responders for JIA ACR30/50/70/90, there is a trend towards lower exposures in the least responsive 
patients (i.e. JIA ACR30 non-responders).  
In  contrast,  when  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  exposures  were  compared  across  responders  for  JIA 
ACR30/50/70/90,  there  was  no  trend  observed.  The  Applicant  suggested  that  lower  exposures  are 
associated  with  complete  non-response  (failure  to  achieve  JIA  ACR30),  whereas,  in  responders, 
variability  in  degree  of  response  (between  JIA  ACR30  and  90)  is  explained  by  factors  other  than 
variability  in  PK  exposure.  However  there  is  an  overlap  of  patients  in  the  responder  groups.  The 
relationship  was  based  on  cumulative  AUC  rather  than  single  dose  interval  AUC.  The  MAH  was 
requested  during  the  evaluation  to  provide  the  percentage  of  ACR  30/50/70/90  response,  the 
percentage  of  “ACR30  flare:  no”  reached  and  the  percentage  of  dosage  regimen  applied  (8  or  10 
mg/kg) for each of the exposure quartile groups.  
From  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  it  seems  there  is  no  straight  relationship  between  single-dose 
exposure  data  and  responder  rates.    Paradoxically  the  responder  rates  of  the  lowest  and  highest 
Ctrough quartiles are similar and between them the responder rates are somewhat lower. Due to the 
small  sample  size it cannot be decided that the observed U type relationship is a chance finding or a 
real phenomenon. This statement is particularly true for the <30 kg weight group where are very few 
observations or sometimes even zero observations per cells.  
Comparing  the  PK  exposure  to  the  safety  profile  no  consistent  trend  of  an  increased  risk  of  AEs  with 
increased  exposure  was  observed.  A  relationship  between  TCZ  exposure  and  neutrophil  loss  was 
demonstrated in adult RA patients and in sJIA patients. Thus the higher incidence of infections in the 
highest exposure quartile (Q4) compared to the other quartiles is not unexpected.  
Observed and model-computed PK parameters for the 10 mg/kg dose in patients weighing <30 kg to 
PK exposures, in both part I and part II, were more comparable to the 8 mg/kg dose in pJIA patients 
weighing ≥30 kg than for the 8 mg/kg (<30 kg) group. Especially comparable efficacy outcomes (JIA 
ACR response and JADAS27 change from baseline) for the 10 mg/kg dose in patients weighing < 30 kg 
and the 8 mg/kg dose in patients weighing ≥  30 kg was demonstrated.  
In contrast, no clear PK / safety relationship was observed. Thus the recommended dose of 10 mg/kg 
for pJIA patients weighing less than 30 kg and 8 mg for patients weighing >30 kg is acceptable. 
2.2.2.4.  Conclusions on Clinical Pharmacology 
The MAH submitted with this extension of indication population PK analyses for studies WA19977 and 
MRA318JP.  
The results for PK, PD, and exposure-response relationship from study WA19977 demonstrate that the 
lower  exposure  observed  in  patients  who  received  the  dose  of  8  mg/kg  in  the  low  weight  band  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 12/104 
  
  
associated  with  less  marked  change  in  PD  markers  and  sub-optimal  efficacy.  Conversely,  in  the 
exposure range corresponding to the dose of 10 mg/kg in the lower weight band and to 8 mg/kg in the 
upper  weigh  band,  the  PD  and  efficacy  were  constant  indicating  a  plateau  of  the  TCZ  exposure 
response curve was reached. In contrast to the evident PK-PD and PK-efficacy relationship, there was 
no clear exposure-safety relationship. These results demonstrate that optimal benefit can be achieved 
without  an  increased  safety  risk.  Therefore,  the  dose  of  TCZ  for  the  treatment  of  pJIA  should  be  10 
mg/kg  for  patients  weighing  <30  kg  and  8  mg/kg  for  patients  weighing  ≥30  kg  is  supported  by  the 
CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Clinical Efficacy 
Study WA19977 
Methods 
Study WA19977was a 24-week randomized double-blind, placebo controlled withdrawal trial with a 16-
week open-label lead-in phase, and 64-week open-label follow-up, to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of tocilizumab in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  
Figure 2.  Overview of Study Design 
Part I consisted of a 16-week active treatment lead in period, followed by Part II a randomized blinded 
withdrawal  for  a  maximum  of  24  weeks  or  occurrence  of  JIA  ACR30  flare  (compared  to  week  16). 
Beginning  at  week  16,  patients  with  at  least  a  JIA  ACR30  response  compared  to  baseline  were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) to either receive placebo or 
continue on active tocilizumab treatment at the same dose received in Part I. 
No  reductions  or  changes  of  concomitant  NSAIDs,  corticosteroids  or  methotrexate  dosing  were 
permitted during Part I and II, except for documented safety reasons. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 13/104 
  
  
 
Part III which is currently ongoing is a 64 week open-label period beginning at week 40 to examine the 
long  term  use  of  tocilizumab  on  safety  and  efficacy.  In  patients  not  receiving  corticosteroids  with 
inactive  disease  for  at  least  6  months,  methotrexate  tapering/discontinuation  was  considered  if 
applicable.  
Study participants 
The target patient population of study WA19977 was patients of 2 to 17 years of age with documented 
evidence for at least 6 months prior to study entry of RF-positive or RF negative pJIA or of extended 
oligoarticular  arthritis  according  to  ILAR  criteria.  Disease  had  to  be  active  at  screening  and  baseline 
with  at  least  five  joints  with  active  arthritis  (joints  that  were  swollen  or  if  no  swelling  was  present 
limitation of movement accompanied by pain, tenderness or both), with at least 3 of the active joints 
having  limitation  of  motion.  The  patients  also  had  to  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to 
methotrexate  (MTX)  or  inability  to  tolerate  MTX.  Patients  previously  treated  with  any  cell  depleting 
therapy, including any investigational agents (e.g. anti-CD19 and anti-CD20) were not permitted in the 
study.  
The  following  JIA  subtypes  were  not  included  in  the  study  population:  systemic  arthritis,  persistent 
oligoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. 
Treatments 
Part  I:  Active  treatment  lead-in  period,  every  4  weeks  for  4  doses.  The  total  duration  was  16  weeks 
with dosing at baseline, Weeks 4, 8 and 12. 
•  <30 kg randomized 1:1 to either TCZ 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion 
•  ≥30 kg TCZ 8 mg/kg IV infusion 
Part II: Double-blind withdrawal period. All subjects were randomized to either: 
•  TCZ (at the same dose as Part I) 
•  Placebo 
This withdrawal period lasted from Week 16 through Week 40 with the last dose at Week 36. 
Part III: Open-Label (Part I dose resumed) 
Concurrent  use  of  DMARDs  and  immunosuppressants  other  than  methotrexate  was  not  permitted  in 
the study. Oral corticosteroids were allowed concomitantly during the study.  
In Part III of the study concomitant medications were allowed to be reduced for efficacy only according 
in the following order: oral corticosteroids first, methotrexate second and NSAIDs last.  
Objectives  
Primary Objective (from Part II) 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  proportion  of  patients  on  tocilizumab  (TCZ) 
versus  placebo  who  developed  a  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  American  College  of  Rheumatology 
30 (ACR30) flare (compared to Week 16) by Week 40.

Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of open-label TCZ therapy (Part I) 
To evaluate the long-term effect of TCZ on the maintenance of clinical response and safety in 
patients with polyarticular JIA (pJIA) (Parts II and III) 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 8 mg/kg vs. 10 mg/kg in patients <30 kg (Parts I, II and 
III) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Part I (not exhaustive) 
• 
JIA ACR Core set 
Clinical  measures  of  efficacy  were  evaluated  by  comparing  the  following  JIA  ACR  core  outcome 
variables to baseline values. JIA ACR responses were defined as follows: 
o 
o 
JIA ACR30 response was defined as 3 of any 6 core outcome variables improved by at 
least  30%  from  the  baseline  assessments,  with  no  more  than  1  of  the  remaining 
variables worsened by more than 30% 
JIA ACR50/70/90 responses were defined in a similar manner for 50%, 70% and 90% 
improvements. 
• 
JADAS-27 
Juvenile  Arthritis  Disease  Activity  Score  (JADAS-27),  a  composite  disease:  derived  from  6  variables 
including: 
• 
• 
Parent/patient global assessment of overall wellbeing 
Physician global assessment of disease activity 
•  Normalised ESR 
•  Arthritis activity at 27 selected joints Number of joints with limitation of movement 
• 
• 
ESR 
Functional Ability determined by CHAQ Disability Index. 
The  patient  were  deemed  to  have  responded  if  3  of  the  6  core  variables  have  improved  by  at  least 
30% at week 16 and not more than one of the other core variables has worsened by 30% or more. 
Part II 
JIA ACR30 flare was defined for Part II of the study as a change from Week 16 of: 
•  At least 3 of the 6 JIA ACR components worsening by at least 30% and 
•  No more than 1 of the remaining JIA ACR components improving by no more than 30%. 
Additional  criteria  addressing  worsening  in  patients  with  a  very  low  Week  16  score  (ie,  30% 
improvement had to be substantive) were also specified.

Sample size 
Assuming a 35% flare rate in the TCZ arm and a 65% flare rate in the placebo arm, 60 patients with 
polyarticular-course  JIA  were  to  be  randomized  per  arm  in  Part  II  to  achieve  at  least  80%  power  to 
detect this difference applying a Type I error of 0.05 (2-sided). In order to achieve these numbers 185 
patients were to be recruited into Part I of the study. 
Randomisation 
Randomization in part II to TCZ or placebo in a 1:1 ratio was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use 
and concurrent corticosteroid use.  
Blinding 
Part  II  of  the  study  was  a  24-week  double-blind  withdrawal  period.  Patients  entering  the  withdrawal 
period  of  the  study  (Part  II)  were  randomized  equally  to  receive  either  TCZ  or  placebo,  stratified  by 
methotrexate and oral corticosteroid use.

To  preserve  the  blind,  various  vial  combinations  based  on  the  patient’s  weight  with  identical 
appearance for both treatments were used. To prevent potential blind breaks due to observed efficacy 
or laboratory changes a ‘dual assessor’ approach was used to evaluate efficacy and safety during Part I 
and Part II of the study. The joint assessor performing all joint examinations in Part I and Part II was 
blinded.  CRP  results  after  the  first  dose  of  study  drug  remained  blinded  to  all  study  participants  in 
order to preserve the blind during Part II. 
Statistical methods 
For  study  parts  I  and  II  all  efficacy  parameters  were  summarized  by  statistical  characteristics, 
depending of the type of data, stratified by treatment and visit (if appropriate).  
The main efficacy analysis population was the ITT population in Part II (ITT-2) consisting of all patients 
who were randomized into Part II and received at least one dose of study drug. 
For  Part  II  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factors  used  for 
randomisation was used to compare the rate of JIA ACR30 flares between TCZ and placebo. Secondary 
parameters  were  analysed  by  means  of  CMH-tests  (in  case  of  dichotomous  outcomes)  or  ANOVA-
models  (continuous  data).  To  control  the  Type  I  error  a  pre-defined  hierarchical  fixed  sequence 
approach  was  applied.  Each  endpoint  in  the  sequence  had  to  be  significant  (p<0.05)  in  order  for  the 
subsequent endpoint in the chain to be tested. To account for missing data the following approach was 
used:  for  categorical  endpoints,  patients  with  missing  data  were  classified  as  ‘non-responders’.  For 
continuous  data  the  ‘observed  data’  approach  was  used  for  Part  I  and  LOCF  imputation  was  used  for 
Part II.

Figure 3.  Patient Disposition (Part I) 
Twenty two patients withdrew in Part I the majority of which were due to lack of therapeutic effect (15 
patients)  and  were  not  permitted  to  continue  to  Part  II.  Other  withdrawals  during  Part  I  were  due  to 
AEs (3 patients), refusal of treatment (3 patients) and lost to follow-up (1 patient).

Recruitment 
The study was conducted from 14 October 2009 until 4 November 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
85  sites  for  this  study  enrolled  subjects  in  Argentina,  Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Canada,  France, 
Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Russia, Spain, the UK and the USA.  
The  study  protocol  was  amended  twice.  There  were  no  changes  to  the  planned  analyses  as  originally 
specified in the SAP that significantly affected or altered the analysis of efficacy and safety data.

Baseline data 
Table 7.  Demographic and disease characteristics 
The  majority  of  patients  were  RF-negative  (126  [67%])  at  baseline  compared  to  54  (29%)  patients 
who were RF-positive; 8 (4%) patients had missing RF status at baseline.  
Numbers analysed 
All  188  patients  enrolled  received  at  least  1  infusion  of  TCZ  and  were  therefore  included  in  the  ITT 
population, which was used in the analyses of efficacy data. 
Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study  was  difference  in  JIA  ACR30  flare  rate  between  Week  16 
and Week 40 in patients receiving placebo and those receiving TCZ.

Table 8.  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Analysis of the Proportion of Patients with JIA ACR30 
Flare (Withdrawal Phase Study Part II, ITT Population – Study Part II) 
There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  treatment  difference  (p-value  0.0003)  in  the  robustness 
analysis  of  JIA  ACR30  flare  (withdrawn  patients  assigned  as  not  flared).  The  12  patients  who  were 
randomized at Week 16 but withdrew or took escape medication prior to Week 40 without experiencing 
a JIA ACR30 flare were not influential in determining the treatment effect. 
Secondary endpoints 
To  control  for  the  Type  I  error  rate  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed 
sequence  approach.  Each  endpoint  in  the  sequence  had  to  be  significant  (p<0.05)  in  order  for  the 
subsequent endpoint in the chain to be considered significant.

Table 9.  Overview of Hierarchical Analysis of Significance Testing at Week 40 
The  hierarchical  chain  of  assessment  for  secondary  endpoints  for  the  study  was  broken  at  the 
assessment of number of joints with limitation of movement and hence treatment significance was not 
assessed below that point in the chain of assessments.

Phase Study Part I , ITT Population – Study Part I) 
Seventy-eight patients had an elevated CRP concentration (>10 mg/L) at baseline. The concentration 
had normalized 2 weeks after their first dose of TCZ in the majority of these patients (76/78 [97.4%]). 
The  proportion  with  a  normalized  CRP  increased  to  Week  16.  The  proportion  of  patients  with 
normalized CRP at 16 weeks was lower for the lighter children (<30 kg) who were receiving the lower 
dose (8 mg/kg) of TCZ than the heavier children (>30 kg) or than those receiving the higher dose (10 
mg/kg) of TCZ.

From Week 16 to Week 40, patients randomized to TCZ maintained their Week 16 response. Patients 
randomized  to  placebo  experienced  a  dramatic  increase  in  mean  ESR  as  soon  as  they  stopped 
receiving TCZ.  
Ancillary analyses 
Gender: There were no differences in the JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 response rate profile of subgroups. 
Age:  A  smaller  proportion  of  patients  aged  ≤7  years  achieved  JIA  ACR  30/50/70  responses  than 
patients aged ≥8 years.

Duration  of  disease:  A  smaller  proportion  of  patients  with  longer  duration  of  disease  achieved  JIA 
ACR 30/50/70/90 improvement than patients with disease duration of ≤2 years.

MTX  use:  At  baseline  79%  of  patients  were  taking  concurrent  MTX.  From  Week  16  to  40,  a  lower 
proportion of patients experienced JIA ACR30 flares in the subgroup who were taking concurrent MTX 
(Table  20).  However,  regardless  of  MTX  use,  the  incidence  of  JIA  ACR30  flare  was  lower  for  patients 
receiving TCZ to those receiving placebo.

Phase Study Part II, ITT Population Study Part II) 
Oral  corticosteroid  use:  Oral  corticosteroid  use  at  baseline  was  also  a  stratification  factor  in  the 
randomization  of  patients  at  Week  16.  There  was  no  consistent  trend  in  the  JIA  ACR30  flare  rate  at 
Week 40 based on concurrent corticosteroid use.  
Previous  Biologic  Use:  The  number  of  patients  who  received  previous  biologics  was  32%  with  the 
remaining 68% being biologic-naïve. 
JIA  ACR30  flare  rate  was  higher  and  JIA  ACR  responses  were  lower  at  Week  40  in  patients  that  had 
previously  been  exposed  to  a  biologic  (TCZ  and  placebo  groups)  compared  to  biologic-naïve  patients 
(Table  21).  However,  patients  randomized  to  TCZ  responded  better  than  patients  receiving  placebo 
whether they had prior biologic use or not.

The  serum  TCZ  concentration  and  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (e.g.,  Cmax,  time  course  of  trough 
value,  AUC,  kel,  CL,  Vd,  Vdss,  t1/2)  were  evaluated.  Patients  who  received  one  or  more  doses  of  the 
investigational  product  formed  the  analysis  set  for  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  The  patients  were 
handled as shown in the figure below. The patients were classified according to the following criteria. 
In  this  clinical  study,  the  PPS  (population  complying  with  protocol)  formed  the  main  analysis  set  for 
efficacy. 
Results 
Nineteen  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  In  all  19  patients,  the  investigational  product  was 
administered three times as specified and the last observations were completed. None of the patients 
was withdrawn. 
The  patients  were  made  up  of  4  males  and  15  females.  Their  age  (mean  ±  SD  [range];  same 
hereinafter) was 11.6 ± 5.3 (3 to 19) years, age at onset of the underlying disease was 6.2 ± 4.0 (0 to 
14) years and the disease duration was 5.3 ± 4.5 (1 to 17) years. At baseline, CRP was 2.657 ± 1.985 
(0.06 to 8.2) mg/dL, ESR was 46.5 ± 19.9 (18 to 83) mm/hr, the number of joints with active arthritis 
was 14.3 ± 9.5 (5 to 43) and the number of joints with limited range of motion was 9.4 ± 6.8 (1 to 
21).  Fifteen  patients  were  being  treated  with  corticosteroids  at  the  start  of  treatment.  The 
prednisolone-equivalent  dose  (the  daily  dose  on  the  day  treatment  was  started)  was  0.141  ±  0.071 
(0.02 to 0.30) mg/kg and 4.73 ± 2.98 (1.0 to 10.0) mg/body.

Study MRA319JP 
This study was a phase IV study to investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of long-term 
treatment  with  TCZ  in  the  19  patients  examined  in  the  Open-label  Clinical  Study  of  TCZ  in  Patients 
with  Polyarticular  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (hereinafter,  “the  previous  study”),  who  were 
administered  8  mg/kg  TCZ,  as  a  rule,  by  intravenous  infusion  at  4-  week  intervals.  5  sites  enrolled 
subjects in Japan. Patients who met all the criteria below were included as subjects in this study: 
•  Of the patients who received three infusions of TCZ in the previous study and for whom a last 
observation  was  conducted,  those  who  did  not  have  problems  with  safety  and  whose  CRP  or 
ESR level had improved with administration of TCZ 
• 
Patients  who  wished  to  be  treated  with  TCZ  and  whose  parent/legal  guardian  gave  written 
consent for participation in the study (written consent was also obtained from the patient if the 
patient had the capacity to understand.) 
Dosage  and  administration: TCZ  at  a  dose  of  8  mg/kg,  as  a  rule,  at  4-week  intervals  by  intravenous 
infusion.  The  dose  and  interval  between  infusions  could  be  adjusted  depending  on  changes  in  clinical 
signs and laboratory test values. However, the upper limit for one infusion was to be 8 mg/kg, and the 
shortest interval between infusions was to be two weeks (14 days). Duration of treatment: A target of 
at least one year from the first infusion in the previous study. 
Primary endpoint:

The patients were handled as in the figure below. Patient classification was determined in accordance 
with  the  following  criteria.  Patient  classifications  were  decided  before  data  locking.  In  this  study,  the 
full analysis set (FAS) was the primary analysis set for efficacy. 
Results 
Nineteen patients were enrolled in the present study: 15 of them completed the study, and the other 
four were withdrawn. The 19 patients in the previous study were all enrolled in the present study. Four 
patients (21.1%) were withdrawn from the study. The reason for withdrawal was “absence of change 
in  or  aggravation  of  symptoms”  for  two  patients  (10.5%,  Patient  Nos.  05  and  18),  “adverse  event 
occurrence”  for  one  patient  (Patient  No.  15)  and  “confirmation  of  appearance  of  anti-TCZ antibodies” 
for one patient (Patient No. 13). The continuation rate was high—94.7% (18 of 19 patients) after one 
year, 84.2% (16 of 19 patients) after two years and 78.9% (15 of 19 patients) after three years. 
There were four male patients and 15 female patients. The age of the patients was 11.6 years ± 5.3 
years  (3–19  years)  [mean  ±  SD  (range),  same  below];  the  age  of  the  patients  at  onset  of  the 
underlying disease was 6.2 years ± 4.0 years (0–14 years); and the duration of the disease was 5.28 
years  ±  4.46  years  (0.8–17.1  years).  Baseline  test  values  were  as  follows:  CRP,  2.66  mg/dL  ±  1.99 
mg/dL (0.1–8.2 mg/dL); ESR, 46.5 mm/h ± 19.9 mm/h (18–83 mm/h); number of active joints, 14.3 
joints  ±  9.5  joints  (5–43  joints);  and  number of  joints  with  limited  range of motion,  9.4  joints  ±  6.8 
joints  (1–21  joints).  In  addition,  15  patients  were  being  treated  with  corticosteroids  at  the  start  of 
treatment  with  TCZ,  and  the  prednisolone-equivalent  dose  (daily  dose  on  the  first  day  of  TCZ 
treatment) was 0.11 mg/kg ± 0.09 mg/kg (0.0–0.3 mg/kg) and 3.74 mg/body ± 3.29 mg/body (0.0– 
10.0 mg/body). 
Outcomes and estimations 
The  percentages  of  patients  showing  30%,  50%  and  70%  improvement  in  the  JIA  core  set  every  24 
weeks  compared  with  the  respective  values  before  the  start  of  treatment  in  the  present  study  are 
shown  in  the  table  below.  The  percentage  of  patients  showing  30%  improvement  (the  primary 
endpoint) was 94.1% (16 of 17 patients) after 24 weeks and 100.0% after each 24-week period from 
48 weeks to 168 weeks (17 of 17 patients, 16 of 16 patients, 14 of 14 patients and 15 of 15 patients). 
The  percentage  of  patients  showing  50%  improvement  was  94.1%  (16  of  17  patients)  after  both  24 
weeks  and  48  weeks,  100.0%  after  each  24-week  period  from  72  weeks  to  144  weeks  (16  of  16 
patients  and  14  of  14  patients),  and  93.3%  (14  of  15  patients)  after  168  weeks.  The  percentage  of 
patients showing 70% improvement was 94.1% (16 of 17 patients) after 24 weeks, 88.2% (15 of 17 
patients) after 48 weeks, 93.8% (15 of 16 patients) after both 72 weeks and 96 weeks, 100.0% (14 of 
14 patients) after both 120 weeks and 144 weeks, and 93.3% (14 of 15 patients) after 168 weeks.

According to the clinical study report of the previous study, the percentages of patients showing 30%, 
50% and 70% improvement at 12 weeks after the start of treatment were 94.7% (18 of 19 patients), 
94.7% (18 of 19 patients) and 57.9% (11 of 19 patients), respectively. At 24 weeks after the start of 
treatment, the percentages of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement were all 94.1% (16 
of 17 patients); thus, not only were the percentages of 30% and 50% improvement greater than 90%, 
the percentage of 70% improvement was also greater than 90%. In subsequent long-term treatment 
as well, percentages of about 90% or higher were maintained for 30%, 50% and 70% improvement.

2.2.3.1.  Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The pivotal phase III study WA19977 consisted of 3 parts. An initial 16-week open label lead in period 
(Part I) is followed by a randomized double blind withdrawal phase for a maximum of 24 weeks. Part 
III, a 64 week open-label period to examine the long term use of tocilizumab on safety and efficacy is

currently ongoing. The design of this study is considered acceptable: the withdrawal phase enables to 
evaluate the efficacy in a controlled manner, while using an escape endpoint, reducing the exposure to 
poor  response  for  a  relative  short  period.  The  approach  is  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products 
for 
the 
treatment  of 
juvenile 
idiopathic  arthritis 
(CHMP/EWP/422/04). 
Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  is  a  heterogeneous  group  of  disease,  ILAR  has  introduced  a  new 
nomenclature and classified the disease and distinguishes 7 subgroups. The MAH included patients with 
active  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (RF-positive  or  RF  negative  pJIA,  and  extended 
oligoarticular arthritis) in the study. The 3 subgroups can be considers as homogenous population since 
the disease characteristics are similar. 
Given the small numbers in the subsets, the data are pooled for analysis. This approach is consistent 
with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis  (CHMP/EWP/422/04).  The  patients  were  divided  into  two  body  weight  categories.  TCZ  was 
dosed according the body, patients weighing at least 30 kg received 8 mg/kg TCZ q4w; patients with a 
body weight below 30 kg were randomized to either 10 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg q4w. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between 
Week  16  and  Week  40  in  patients  receiving  placebo  and  those  receiving  TCZ.  The  JIA  ACR30  flares 
relative  to  week  16  in  patients  receiving  TCZ  was  statistically  significantly  lower  than  the  rate  in 
patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met. 
This  result  was  supported  by  a  predefined  set  of  secondary  analyses,  controlling  for  multiple  testing. 
To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed 
sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary 
endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  patients  improved  rapidly  following 
dosing with TCZ 
Thus it can be considered that the results demonstrated a clinically relevant effect in patients treated 
with TCZ.  
In Part I of the study the onset of efficacy was observed after the first dose of TCZ.  
There was no gender effect on the efficacy observed.

A  smaller  proportion  of  patients  aged  ≤7  years  achieved  JIA  ACR  30/50/70  responses  than  patients 
aged ≥  8 years, while proportions of patients achieving JIA ACR90 are comparable in all age groups. 
This observation is not unexpected and is partly due to the lower exposure to TCZ in younger patients. 
Patients  with  younger  age  had  lower  body  weight  and  thus  had  lower  drug  exposure  and  associated 
lower efficacy scores. There was a trend of a better response in children with body weight of less than 
30  kg  receiving  the  higher  dose  of  10  mg/kg,  supporting  the  proposed  dose  of  10  mg/kg  in  lower 
weight  children.  Generally  the  <30  kg  treatment  groups  included  a  lower  proportion  of  RF  positive 
patients  than  the  ≥  30  kg  group.  The  MAH  argued  that  the  observed  difference  in  the  different  age 
groups might also be linked to the fact that the proportions of rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and RF 
negative  patients  differed  between  treatment  groups.  This  claim  is  not  supported  by  the  data  so  far. 
The  MAH  will initiative  a  collecting  of  long  term  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  pJIA  treatment  through  a 
registry also covering the efficacy of 10 mg/kg for patients <30 kg. This paediatric registry is described 
in the risk management plan. 
The MAH provided a subgroup analysis of JIA ACR response rates between RF positive and RF negative 
patients.  The  efficacy  of  TCZ  in  terms  of  JIA  response  rates  was  generally  similar  regardless  of  the 
patients’ RF status; however the groups are too small to detect meaningful differences.  
During the evaluation the MAH was requested to provide subgroup analysis for patients with extended 
oligoarthritis.  According  to  the  ILAR  diagnostic  criteria  oligoarticular  JIA  is  characterized  by  1  to  4 
active joints in the first six months of disease. Oligoarticular JIA that does not progress after 6 months 
is  termed  persistent  oligoarticular  JIA  and  is  not  included  in  WA19977.  If  there  is  progression  of 
oligoarticular  JIA  to  affect  ≥5  joints  after  six  months  it  is  classified  as  extended  oligoarticular  JIA 
(eoJIA)  while  pJIA  is  characterized  by  ≥5  joints  in  the  first  six  months  of  disease.  After  6  months  of 
disease  (the  minimum  disease  duration  required  for  entry  into  WA19977)  the  polyarticular  course  of 
eoJIA  is  no  different  to  that  observed  in  patients  originally  diagnosed  with  pJIA.  Patients  with 
oligoarticular disease onset, including eoJIA, are almost exclusively RF- at diagnosis and maintain their 
RF- status throughout their disease course.  
Therefore the analysis of efficacy by RF status captures eoJIA patients along with RF- pJIA patients in 
the RF population. 
Of the 188 patients enrolled in WA19977 54 were RF+, 126 were RF- and no RF status was recorded in 
8 patients.

The MAH interpretation of these data is that patients with an initial diagnosis of eoJIA or RF- pJIA are 
at  neither  a  therapeutic  advantage  or  disadvantage  relative  to  those  patients  with  an  initial  eoJIA  or 
RF- pJIA. The MAH’s arguments were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Study WA19977 was designed to evaluate a population of patients with an inadequate response to MTX 
due to lack of efficacy or  toxicity, patients were required either not be taking MTX, or be on a stable 
dose of MTX for 12 weeks prior to baseline. Patients on MTX had lower JIA ACR flare rates and higher 
JIA ACR response rates regardless of assignment to TCZ or placebo treatment. It has been shown in a 
logistic  regression  analysis  of  JIA  ACR30  flares  that  MTX  use  had  a  significant  influence  on  the 
response independent of TCZ treatment. Patients taking concomitant MTX have better outcomes than 
those  who  do  not,  regardless  of  assignation  to  TCZ  or  placebo.  Of  note,  in  patients  not  taking  MTX 
53.3% of patients treated with TCZ achieved a JIA ACR70 response at week 40 compared with 23.5% 
of patients treated with placebo.  
Oral  corticosteroid  use  at  baseline  was  also  a  stratification  factor  in  the  randomization  of  patients  at 
Week 16, and patients were required to maintain oral corticosteroid use at a constant level until Week 
40 unless a change was required for safety reasons. There was no consistent trend in the JIA  ACR30 
flare rate at Week 40 based on concurrent corticosteroid use, and the oral corticosteroid use term was 
not statistically significant in the confirmatory logistic regression analysis. The interaction of TCZ with 
oral corticosteroid use was assessed and was found non-significant (p-value 0.3267), suggesting that 
the  benefit  from  TCZ  was  independent  of  corticosteroid.  However  this  conclusion  might  be  hampered 
by the small sample size.  
The inclusion criteria specified that disease had to have been present for 6 month or more with still 5 
active joints. Consequently patients with disease duration from 6 month to several years are included 
in  the  study.  As  mentioned  by  the  MAH  treatment  outcome  was  poorer  in  children  with  disease 
duration  of  more  than  2  years.  During  the  evaluation  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  a  separate 
analysis  of  the  efficacy  data  in  those  receiving  treatment  late  versus  earlier  in  the  disease  course. 
Effective  control  of  JIA  disease  activity  early  in  the  disease  course  is  being  advocated  as  a  way  of 
improving  longer  term  outcomes  (1).  While  the  cut-off  for  distinguishing  early  vs.  late  disease  is 
somewhat  arbitrary,  the  MAH  considers  a  2  year  cut-off  to  be  reasonable  since  it  distinguishes  the 
diagnosis, assessment and first line therapy phases from the second and further line phases of patient 
management. 
JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses at Week 16 were summarised by the subgroups of patients with 
disease duration <2 years and ≥2 years. The data are provided in the table below.

At  the  end  of  Part  I  of  the  study  JIA  ACR  response  rates  were  numerically  lower  in  patients  with 
disease duration of ≥2 years. 
JIA  ACR  30/50/70/90  responses  at  Week  40  and  JIA  ACR30  Flare  rates  were  also  presented  by  the 
subgroups of patients with disease duration <2 years and ≥2 years. The data are provided in the table 
below.

(Lead in Phase Study Part I + Withdrawal Phase Study Part II, ITT Population –

At  the  end  of  Part  II  of  the  study  JIA  ACR  30/50/70/90  response  rates  were  lower  in  patients  with 
disease  duration  of  ≥2  years.  Similarly,  JIA  ACR30  Flare  rates  were  higher  in  patients  with  disease 
duration of ≥2 years. Efficacy was better in TCZ patients compared to Placebo patients, regardless of 
disease duration. Due to smaller sample sizes, data should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, 
these data are consistent with the notion that effective treatment earlier in the course of disease can 
contribute to better efficacy outcomes.

No comparative analyses were provided on therapeutic efficacy of TCZ and other biologic for treatment 
of patients with pJIA used in MTX combination or as monotherapy in the submitted documentation. The 
MAH was requested during the evaluation to provide such comparative analyses in which at least data 
of published clinical studies would be used as the source of information. 
At  the  time  of  submission,  three  biologics  are  approved  for  use  in  pcJIA  in  the  EU:  etanercept, 
adalimumab  and  abatacept.  Of  these  three  both  etanercept  and  adalimumab are  TNF  inhibitors  while 
abatacept  is  T-cell  activation  inhibitor  (through  action  on  CD28).  Abatacept  and  adalimumab  are 
approved for use in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in MTX-IR patients and as monotherapy in 
patients unable to tolerate MTX. Etanercept is approved for monotherapy use only. 
The  pcJIA  studies  for  all  three  molecules  were  of  a  randomized  withdrawal  design  similar  to  that 
utilized in WA19977 although the duration of study phases and study populations differed between the 
studies (see table below). 
Table 20.  Summary of Studies in pcJIA 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 37/104 
  
  
 
Due  to  the  fact  that  the  etanercept  and  abatacept  studies  enrolled  patients  with  all  subtypes  of  JIA, 
including sJIA, and due to differences in the statistical methodologies utilized in both studies, the MAH 
considers  it  inappropriate  to  directly  compare  the  results  of  these  two  studies  with  TCZ  study 
WA19977.  The  etanercept  and  abatacept  studies  allowed  patients  who  flared  during  the  double  blind 
phase to be counted as JIA ACR responders while WA19977 (and the Lovell at al. adalimumab study) 
counted  flare  patients  as  JIA  ACR  non-responders,  regardless  of  JIA  ACR  response  achieved  prior  to 
flare.  Despite  the  greater  similarities  in  study  design  and  statistical  analyses  between  WA19977  and 
the  adalimumab  study  the  MAH  considers  it  methodologically  flawed  to  make  direct  comparisons 
between  these  studies.  Firstly,  the  adalimumab  study  included  MTX  naïve  patients  with  less  severe 
disease whereas all of the patients enrolled in WA19977 had prior MTX exposure and had more severe 
disease.  Secondly,  32%  of  patients  enrolled  in  WA19977  had  a  prior inadequate  response  to  another 
biologic drug. No such prior biologic exposure in the adalimumab population was reported by Lovell et 
al.  (2008)  which  could  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  WA19977  patient  population  may  also  have 
more  refractory  disease  compared  to  those  in  the  adalimumab  study.  These  patients  tend  to  have 
higher flare rates and lower JIA ACR response rates in comparison with biologic-naïve patients. Efficacy 
of TCZ stratified by prior biologic use at both Week 16 and Week 40 has been provided in the original 
TCZ submission but is not available in the Lovell et al publication. Thirdly, the all-TCZ summary data 
includes the 8 mg/kg (<30 kg) dose group which showed suboptimal efficacy relative to the other two 
doses investigated whereas the adalimumab study was a non-doseranging study in which all patients 
received the recommended dose. 
Nevertheless, on the basis of an indirect and qualitative comparison of the data presented above it is 
the  opinion  of  the  MAH  that  tocilizumab  is  at  least  as  effective  as  adalimumab,  etanercept  and 
abatacept in pcJIA patients.  
The  MAH’s  argumentation  is  considered  acceptable.  Unfortunately  there  are  no  comparative  data 
available of face to face trials biological products in patients with pJIA available for the time being. Still 
it can be established, based on the data presented by the MAH, that the therapeutic effects which can 
be achieved by TCZ in patients with pJIA are similar to those produced by adalimumab, etanercept or 
abatacept, as stated by the MAH. 
The MAH was requested during the evaluation to propose how efficacy and safety of re-treatment with 
TCZ will be evaluated in patients who are experiencing flares during treatment holidays. 
The  randomized  withdrawal  design  of  study WA19977  allows  for  assessment of  efficacy  and  safety  in 
patients randomized to placebo in part II. Those that did not flare were retreated with TCZ in part III 
(from  week  40)  whilst  those  that  experienced  a  JIA  ACR30  flare  during  part  II  were  re-treated  with 
TCZ as escape therapy. Part III of the study is currently ongoing. 
Of  the  188  patients  that  were  enrolled  in  study  WA19977  166  entered  the  double-blind  withdrawal 
period  with  82  TCZ;  84  randomized  with  placebo.  Of  81  out  of  these  84  placebo  patients  in  the  ITT 
Population,  39  (48.1%)  experienced  a  JIA  ACR30  flare  while off  TCZ  between  Week  16  and  Week 40 
and re-initiated TCZ treatment. In terms of the efficacy of re-treatment with TCZ, the MAH will provide 
the final study report after completion of part III of study WA19977. The submission of the final study 
report for study WA19977 is part of the RMP 
2.2.3.2.  Conclusions on Clinical Efficacy 
In the pivotal phase III study WA19977, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients 
developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between  Week  16  and  Week  40.  Patients  receiving  placebo  and  those 
receiving  TCZ  were  compared.  Three  subsets  of  the  JIA  population  were  included  in  the  study:  RF-
positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 38/104 
  
  
The JIA ACR30 flares relative to week 16 in patients receiving TCZ was statistically significantly lower 
than the rate in patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met. 
This  result  was  supported  by  a  predefined  set  of  secondary  analyses,  controlling  for  multiple  testing. 
To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed 
sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary 
endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  JIA 
ARC/30/50/70  improvement  was  statistical  significant  higher  in  the  TCZ  group  than  in  the  placebo 
group. Change from baseline in number of active joints, in Physician’s global assessments VAS and in 
pain VAS also demonstrated statistical significant superiority of TCZ over placebo.  
The treatment effect is independent of initial diagnosis of eoJIA or RF- pJIA. Furthermore, the data are 
consistent  with  the  notion  that  effective  treatment  earlier  in  the  course  of  disease  can  contribute  to 
better  efficacy  outcomes.  Although  patients  taking  concomitant  MTX  have  generally  better  outcomes 
adequate  response  was  also  demonstrated  for  patients  treated  with  TCZ  without  MTX  compared  to 
placebo-treated patients. Available data suggests that the treatment effect from TCZ is independent of 
corticosteroid  use  although  the  small  sample  size  was  too  small  to  draw  firm  conclusions.  Overall, 
tocilizumab  appears  to  be  at  least  as  effective  as  adalimumab,  etanercept  and  abatacept  in  pcJIA 
patients  even  though  unfortunately  no  direct  comparative  data  of  different  biological  products  in 
patients  with  pJIA  are  available  for  the  time  being.  Information  on  re-treatment  after  flare  will  be 
coming  from part  III  of  the  ongoing  study.Thus  it  can  be  considered that the  results  demonstrated a 
significant clinical benefit in patients with RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular 
arthritis.  
Impairment  of  growth  is  a  common  problem  in  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis,  particularly  in  children 
with active disease. So far no data on the potential impact on TCZ therapy on growth retardation of in 
the  paediatric  population  are  available.  Furthermore  there  is  evidence  that  JIA  is  associated  with 
increased  risk  for  atherosclerosis,  yet  the  data  are  scare.  The  MAH  will  initiative  a  collecting  of  long 
term  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  pJIA  treatment  through  a  registry  also  covering  the  impact  of  TCZ 
therapy on the increased risk of atherosclerosis and growth development, respectively. This paediatric 
registry is described in the risk management plan.  
2.2.4.  Clinical safety aspects  
Patient exposure 
The  database  supporting  the  safety  of  TCZ  for  treatment  of  pJIA  includes  the  pivotal  phase  III  study 
(WA19977), and is supported by the data from studies MRA318JP and MRA319JP.  
In addition post-marketing safety data with TCZ for pJIA patients are provided in a tabulated overview 
in comparison with the paediatric data. 
Study  WA1997  consists  of  thee  part,  a  16-week  active-treatment  lead-in  period  (Part  I),  a  24-week 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  period  (Part  II)  followed  by  a  64-week,  open-label, 
extension  period  (Part  III).  During  Part  I  177/188  patients  (94%)  received  all  four  planned  TCZ 
infusions  and  during  Part  II,  57/82  patients  (70%)  and  43/81  (53%)  received  all  six  scheduled 
infusions  of  TCZ  and  placebo,  respectively.  At  the  time  of  the  data  cut,  the  median  exposure  to  TCZ 
across Parts I, II, and III was 48 weeks (0.92 years). The total duration of exposure to TCZ was 184.4 
patient-years; this is the total exposure used to determine the rate of adverse events per 100 patient 
years 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 39/104 
  
  
All 188 patients had at least 1 safety assessment following the first infusion of TCZ and were therefore 
included  in  the  safety  population,  which  was  used  in  the  analyses  of  safety  data.  The  ITT  and  safety 
populations were therefore equivalent. 
The safety results in this report have been presented using the all exposure population; this includes 
all the patients until their last visit before 04 November 2011.

Serious adverse events 
Seventeen patients (9.0%) reported 22 SAEs with a rate of 12.5 SAEs per 100 patient-years (in the all 
exposure population).

The  SOC  that  had  the  most  patients  reporting  at  least  1  SAE  in  the  all  exposure  population  was 
infections  and  infestations  (9  patients  [4.8%]),  followed  by  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications (3 patients [1.6%]).  
The  majority  of  SAEs  were  individual  cases  occurring  in  individual  patients  with  the  exceptions  of 
pneumonia, bronchitis and cellulitis. Pneumonia was reported in 4 patients (3 patients receiving TCZ 8 
mg/kg  [≥30  kg]  and  1  patient  receiving  TCZ  10  mg/kg  [<30  kg]).  Bronchitis  was  reported  in  2 
patients  receiving  TCZ  10  mg/kg  (<30  kg)  and  cellulitis  was  reported  in  2  patients  receiving  TCZ  8 
mg/kg (≥30kg). 
Individual  serious  cases  of  varicella,  neck  injury,  synovial  rupture,  upper  limb  fracture,  sclerosing 
cholangitis,  hypertransaminasemia,  back  pain,  osteoporosis,  familial  mediterranean  fever,  uveitis, 
constipation,  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  psychosomatic  disease  and  urinary  calculus  were 
reported.  
Of  the  22  SAEs  reported,  5  SAEs  that  occurred  in  5  patients  (2.7%)  were  considered  remotely, 
possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  The  5  events  reported  were  benign 
intracranial hypertension, uveitis, urinary calculus, pneumonia, and cellulitis.

Adverse events of special interest 
Infections 
Over half of the patients in the all-exposure population in study WA19977 had at least one infection AE 
(115/188 [61.2%]). With a total of 302 infection AEs, the rate of infections was 163.7 per 100 patient 
years.  
The  most  common  types  of  infections  include  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract  or  the  ears. 
There was one case of a primary pulmonary tuberculosis infection in an endemic region.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 42/104 
  
  
 
Nine patients (4.8%) had a serious infection, including four with pneumonia, two each with bronchitis 
and  cellulitis,  and  one  with  varicella  (hospitalised  with  varicella  pneumonitis).  All  infection  SAEs 
resolved without squeal. 
There  was  no  indication  that  patients  who  received  concomitant  oral  corticosteroids  or  MTX  had  an 
increased risk for infections.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In  order  to  identify  events  that  may  indicate  hypersensitivity,  analyses  of  infusion  related  AEs  were 
performed. Infusion-related AEs were defined as any AEs occurring during or within 24 hours after the 
infusion of TCZ and that were not judged ‘unrelated’ to treatment by the investigator. 
A  total  of  40  events  were  reported  in  33/188  patients  (17.6%).  The  rate  of  infusion  related  AEs  was 
23.3  events  per  100  patient  years.  The  most  frequent  individual  AE  terms  were  dizziness,  headache, 
and hypotension (each at a rate of 2.2 AEs per 100 patient-years). None of the events were serious, 
and no patient was withdrawn as a result of an infusion-related event. 
There were no cases of anaphylaxis.

Gastrointestinal Perforations 
There were no gastrointestinal perforations reported in the study. 
Malignancies 
There  were  no  malignancies  reported  in  study  WA19977.  A  total  of  four  events  of  papilloma  were 
reported. All were described as warts. 
Immunogenicity 
Almost  all  patients  (185/188  or  98.4%)  were  tested  for  screening  assay  at  any  time  point.  Of  these, 
20  patients  (10.6%)  had  positive  baseline  anti-TCZ  assay  results,  3  patients  (1.6%)  had  positive 
screening assay results post-baseline, and 1 patient (0.5%) had positive confirmation and neutralizing 
assay  results  post-baseline.  This  patient  did  not  experience  infusion  reactions.  The  patient  was 
withdrawn  as  she  did  not  achieve  a  JIA  ACR30  response  at  the  end  of  Part  I  and  was  therefore  not 
eligible to continue in Part II. 
Laboratory findings 
Neutropenia and abnormal neutrophil count 
There  were  no  neutropenia  AEs  reported  during  the  study,  however  decreases  in  neutrophil  counts 
were observed during the study.

In  two  patients  infections  (both  non-serious)  were  reported  in  a  temporary  relation  with  the 
neutropenia was reported (gastroenteritis [Patient 2496, TCZ 8 mg/kg, ≥30 kg] and tracheitis 3 days 
prior  to  the  neutropenia  [Patient  2611,  TCZ  10  mg/kg,  <30  kg).  Both  events  were  reported  as 
unrelated to study drug and the patients continued in the study. 
Platelet count 
During study treatment, mean platelet counts decreased in most subgroups of patient. There were few 
bleeding events with the most common being epistaxis in 7 patients. 
One non-serious event of vaginal haemorrhage described as pre-menstrual red spot occurred in patient 
with a platelet count of 114 × 109/L. No serious bleeding events were reported. 
Hepatic events and liver function test parameters 
One  event  with  preferred  term  ‘hepatotoxicity’  was  reported  in  one  patient  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg 
(≥30kg)  group  on  day  357.  The  event  was  recorded  as  mild  in  intensity  and  was  attributed  to  MTX 
therapy. 
ALT  values  remained  within  the  normal  range  throughout  study  treatment  in  126/187  patients 
(67.4%). The highest CTC grade ALT elevation in the study was one grade 3 event in one patient. AST 
concentrations  remained  within  the  normal  range  throughout  study  treatment  in  152/187  patients 
(81.3%). There was one shift to a grade 3 AST value in a patient who had a grade 2 baseline value. 
There was no shift in total bilirubin to grade 3 or 4 values. 
Lipid parameters 
In  general,  mean  lipid  parameters  including  total  cholesterol,  LDL-cholesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  and 
triglyceride  concentrations  were  within  normal  ranges  for  the  duration  of  the  study.  For  total 
cholesterol  and  LDL-cholesterol,  the  highest  post  baseline  values  were  >1.5-2  ×  ULN  and  were 
reported in 0.5% of patients each. There were no clinically relevant findings in other laboratory safety 
parameters. 
Comparison of TCZ safety in PJIA, SJIA and adult RA patients 
The overall safety profile of TCZ was similar between the paediatric pJIA and adult RA patients. There 
were some differences in rates of AEs per 100 PY by SOC. The most notable difference was the rate of 
infections,  which  was  higher  in  the  pediatric  population  (see  table  below).  This  was  to  be  expected 
since  the  age  of  onset  is  much  younger  in  pJIA,  affecting  a  population  more  prone  to  infection.  The 
rate  of  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  was  also  higher  in  pJIA  when  compared  to 
adult RA. This is considered largely a result of the different study designs and reporting practices in the 
paediatric  and  adult  clinical  studies.  As  discussed  above,  the  high  number  of  events  in  this  system 
organ class in study WA19977 was the result of AEs reported as “juvenile arthritis” (59 of 98 events; 
rate  per  100  patient  years:  32.0),  which  were  attributed  to  flares  of  the  underlying  disease.  In  the 
adult  RA  studies,  AEs  of  “rheumatoid  arthritis”  were  reported  at  a  lower  rate (723/4824  events;  rate 
per 100 patient years: 4.8) . The rate of SAEs was not higher in pJIA than in adult RA. The number of 
individual SAEs in study WA19977 was too small to make a meaningful comparison to the adult data.

The  rate  of  AEs  and  SAEs  in  sJIA  patients  treated  with  TCZ  in  study  WA18221  was  higher  than  that 
observed in pJIA or in adult RA patients. This was also true for most SOCs. The systemic form of JIA 
involves  additional  complications  that  are  less  common  in  pJIA  or  adult  RA,  such  as  multi-organ 
involvement.  Other  factors  contributing to the  higher  rates  of  AEs  and  SAEs  observed in  sJIA  include 
the  more  systemic  nature  of  this  illness.  The  pattern  of  changes  in  laboratory  data  (neutrophils, 
platelets, AST, ALT and total bilirubin) was consistent with changes observed amongst the pJIA, adult 
RA  and  sJIA  populations  (see  table  below).  The  majority  of  shifts  were  to  CTC  Grade  1  or  2 
classifications.

Discontinuation due to AES and dose interruptions 
Seven  patients  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  an  AE.  This  included  1  patient  who  was 
withdrawn  following  an  event  reported  as  juvenile  arthritis,  which  indicated  that  the  reason  to 
discontinue  treatment  in  this  patient  was  insufficient  efficacy.  One  of  the  7  patients  was  withdrawn 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013

from  treatment  due  to  an  event  of  gastroenteritis  that  started  while  the  patient  received  placebo  in 
Part II of the study. 
Of  the  7  events  leading  to  withdrawal  from  study,  2  events  (hypertransaminasemia  and  benign 
intracranial hypertension) were serious.  
Dose interruption 
In  the  all  exposure  population,  12.8%  of  patients  experienced  TCZ  dose  interruptions  because  of 
safety concerns. There was a higher incidence of AEs leading to dose interruptions in patients receiving 
TCZ  10  mg/kg  (<30  kg)  (28.6%)  than  patients  receiving  TCZ  8  mg/kg  (<30  kg)  (5.9%).  The  AEs 
under the SOC of infections and infestations were the leading cause of TCZ dose interruption (9.0%), 
followed  by  AEs  under  the  SOC  of  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (1.6%)  and 
gastrointestinal disorders (1.1%). 
Supportive Studies 
Study MRA318JP 
Thirty-eight adverse events occurred in 17 of the 19 patients (89.5%) who were included in the safety 
evaluation  set.  Thirty-six  of  the  events  were  mild  and  2  were  moderate.  None  of  the  events  was 
assessed as severe. The incidences by SOC were as follows: 12 events of infections and infestations in 
11 patients (57.9%), 9 events of gastrointestinal disorders in 7 patients (36.8%), 5 events of injury, 
poisoning  and  procedural  complications  in  4  patients  (21.1%),  4  events  of  skin  and  subcutaneous 
tissue disorders in 4 patients (21.1%), 2 events of investigations in 2 patients (10.5%) and 2 events of 
nervous  system  disorders  in  1  patient  (5.3%).  For  all  of  the  other  SOCs  with  adverse  events,  there 
was 1 event of each. 
Twenty-one  adverse  drug  reactions  occurred  in  13  of  the  19  patients  (68.4%).  Twenty-one  of  the 
adverse drug reactions were mild. None was assessed as moderate or severe. The incidences by SOC 
were  as  follows:  10  events  of  infections  and  infestations  in  10  patients  (52.6%),  5  events  of 
gastrointestinal disorders in 5 patients (26.3%), 3 events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in 
3  patients  (15.8%)  and  2  events  of  investigations  in  2  patients  (10.5%).  For  the  other  SOC  with  an 
adverse drug reaction, there was 1 event. 
Adverse  events  (PT)  with  an  incidence  of  ≥10%  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (26.3%,  5 
patients),  nasopharyngitis  (21.1%,  4  patients),  diarrhoea  (15.8%,  3  patients)  and  arthropod  sting 
(10.5%, 2 patients). 
Three  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  3  patients.  Those  events  (PT)  were  gastroenteritis, 
gastroenteritis bacterial and sensory disturbance. The causal relationship to the investigational product 
was  “unrelated”  for  gastroenteritis  bacterial  and  “unlikely”  for  the  other  2  events.  The  outcome  was 
“improved” for sensory disturbance and “resolved/recovered” for the other 2 events. 
None of the patients died and none was withdrawn from the study because of adverse events. 
Twelve  adverse  events  classified  under  the  SOC  infections  and  infestations  occurred  in  11  of  the  19 
patients  (57.9%).  Those  (PT)  with  an  incidence  of  ≥10%  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(26.3%, 5 events) and nasopharyngitis (21.1%, 4 events). 
Infusion reactions consisted of 1 event each of nausea (at 1st infusion) and dizziness (at 3rd infusion) 
in 2 patients (10.5%). 
Changes in laboratory test values were within the reference range or were changes in the direction of 
normalisation, except for increased ALP. The only patients in whom laboratory test values changed by 
Assessment report

two or more NCI-CTC grades were 1 patient for the neutrophil count and 2 patients for the lymphocyte 
count, and the change in the neutrophil count was transient. Adverse events involving laboratory test 
values were 1 event each of lymphocyte count decreased and blood urine present. 
One  of  the  patients  became  positive  for  anti-TCZ  antibodies  (neutralising  antibodies)  on  the  last  test 
day. 
There were no changes in vital signs. 
Study MRA319JP 
There were a total of 142 adverse events in all 19 patients (100.0%) in the safety evaluation. As for 
severity,  136  events  were  “mild”,  five  events  were  “moderate”  and  one  event  was  “severe”. 
Occurrence  of  adverse  events  by  system  organ  class  (SOC)  in  order  of  incidence  was  as  follows: 
“infections and infestations”, 60 events in 18 patients (94.7%); “gastrointestinal disorders”, 18 events 
in 12 patients (63.2%); “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”, 14 events in 12 patients (63.2%); 
“injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications”,  16  events  in  10  patients  (52.6%);  “respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders”,  six  events  in  six  patients  (31.6%);  “immune  system  disorders” 
and “musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders”, each five events in five patients (26.3%); “eye 
disorders”,  five  events  in  four  patients  (21.1%);  “nervous  system  disorders”,  five  events  in  three 
patients (15.8%); “investigations”, three events in three patients (15.8%); and “blood and lymphatic 
system disorders” and “ear and labyrinth disorders”, each two events in two patients (10.5%). In the 
other SOCs, the incidence was less than 10%. 
There  were  100  adverse  drug  reactions  in  18  of  the  19  patients  (94.7%).  As  for  severity,  98  of  the 
adverse drug reactions were “mild”, one was “moderate” and one was “severe”. Occurrence of adverse 
drug  reactions  by  SOC  was  as  follows:  “infections  and  infestations”,  52  reactions  in  17  patients 
(89.5%);  “skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders”,  11  reactions  in  10  patients  (52.6%); 
“gastrointestinal  disorders”,  13  reactions  in  nine  patients  (47.4%);  “respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal  disorders”,  six  reactions  in  six  patients  (31.6%);  “immune  system  disorders”,  five 
reactions in five patients (26.3%); “eye disorders”, four reactions in three patients (15.8%); “nervous 
system  disorders”  and  “investigations”,  each  three  reactions  in  three  patients  (15.8%);  and 
“musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders”,  two  reactions  in  two  patients  (10.5%).  The 
incidence was less than 10% for the other SOCs. 
In  order  of  decreasing  incidence,  the  events  (PTs)  with  an  incidence  of  at  least  10%  were 
nasopharyngitis,  78.9%  (15  patients);  pharyngitis,  42.1%  (eight  patients);  gastroenteritis,  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  and  arthropod  sting,  31.6%  (six  patients)  each;  seasonal  allergy  and 
eczema,  21.1%  (four  patients)  each;  bronchitis,  impetigo,  influenza,  conjunctivitis  allergic,  upper 
respiratory  tract  inflammation,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis  and  urticaria,  15.8%  (three 
patients) each; and pneumonia, headache, rhinitis allergic, constipation, enterocolitis, musculoskeletal 
stiffness and joint sprain, 10.5% (two patients) each. 
Six  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  four  patients.  Those  events  (PTs)  were  gastroenteritis, 
influenza, pneumonia, gastroenteritis bacterial, myasthenia gravis and sensory disturbance. The causal 
relationship  to  TCZ  was  assessed  as  “unrelated”  for  influenza  and  gastroenteritis  bacterial,  “unlikely” 
for gastroenteritis and sensory disturbance, and “possibly” for pneumonia and myasthenia gravis. The 
outcome was “improved” for myasthenia gravis and “resolved/recovered” for the other five events. 
There were no adverse events that resulted in death. 
One  adverse  event,  myasthenia  gravis  in  one  patient,  resulted  in  withdrawal  of  the  patient  from  the 
study; the causal relationship to TCZ was assessed as “possibly”. 
Assessment report

There were 60 occurrences of adverse events classified as the SOC “infections and infestations” in 18 
of  the  19  patients  (94.7%).  Of  those,  the  events  with  an  incidence  of  at  least  10%  were  as  follows: 
nasopharyngitis,  78.9%  (15  patients);  pharyngitis,  42.1%  (eight  patients);  gastroenteritis  and  upper 
respiratory tract infection, 31.6% (six patients) each; bronchitis, impetigo and influenza, 15.8% (three 
patients) each; and pneumonia, 10.5% (two patients) each. 
There  were  two  infusion  reactions  in  two  patients  (10.5%);  those  events  were  nausea  (at  the  first 
infusion) and dizziness (at the third infusion) in one patient each. 
Except for elevation of ALP, the changes in laboratory test values were either within the normal range 
or  tended  toward  normal.  The  laboratory  test  values  whose  NCICTC  grade  changed  by  two  or  more 
grades  and  the  numbers  of  patients  affected  were  as  follows:  neutrophil  count,  seven  patients; 
lymphocyte count and total bilirubin level, two patients; and haemoglobin level, WBC count, ALP value 
and CK value, one patient. Of those, changes of three grades (Grade 0 to Grade 3) were seen for the 
neutrophil  count  and  CK  value  in  one  patient  each.  The  three-grade  exacerbations  of  the  neutrophil 
count and CK value were both transient. 
Regarding  anti-TCZ antibodies, one  patient  (5.3%) became  positive  for  neutralizing  antibodies  before 
the  fourth  infusion;  and  positive  for  IgE  antibodies  after  the  fifth  infusion  657  days  after  the  fourth 
infusion; and was withdrawn from the study. 
Regarding  vital  signs,  large  changes  were  not  observed  in  blood  pressure,  pulse  rate  or  body 
temperature. 
Post-marketing data 
Post-marketing data is available from several sources: 
• 
• 
Japanese post-marketing study ML21939 for pJIA 
Japanese post-marketing study ML21940 for sJIA 
•  Spontaneous  reports  received  globally,  including  those  from  non-interventional  studies  for 
patient  treated  for  pJIA,  sJIA,  JIA  that  are  unspecified  by  classification,  and  in  paediatric 
patients under the age of 18 years treated with tocilizumab for unknown indications. 
Tocilizumab  has  a  marketing  license  in  Japan.  Tocilizumab  has  been  available  for  treatment  of 
multicentric  Castleman’s  disease  in  Japan  since  2005  through  a  closed  distribution  program,  and  for 
treatment of RA, pJIA and sJIA since April 2008. 
The MAH provided updated post-marketing data through 31 July 2012. 
Consistent with study WA19977, the most common types of SAEs reported were infections. The safety 
profile  of  TCZ  in  patients  with  pJIA  remains  unchanged  from  the  profile  presented  in  the  original 
submission and is consistent with that expected for a biologic agent in the pJIA population.

Additional safety data from study WA19977 will be reviewed and summarized in the final clinical study 
report  with  the  conclusions  of  part  III  of  this  study.  The  MAH  will  review  safety  data  in  the  pJIA 
population  as  part  of  ongoing  Pharmacovigillance  as  well  as  within  the  context  of  a  post-marketing 
registry (paediatric patients is included as important missing information in the RMP). 
The  table  below  shows  the  distribution  of  spontaneous  reports  across  the  pJIA  population,  patients 
enrolled in the Chugai Japanese Post-Marketing Surveillance (JPMS) study ML21940, and spontaneous 
reports  received  across  sJIA  patients,  patients  treated  for  unspecified  JIA  conditions,  and  other 
paediatric patients <18 years of age treated for unknown indications.

The  events  identified  from  the  updated  search,  and  the  numbers  and  proportion  of  these  events  by 
system  organ  class  (SOC)  are  summarized  in  the  table  below.  Across  all  populations,  the  most 
common  types  of  events  reported  in  >5%  of  patients  were  infections  (26.6%),  followed  by 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (8.7%),  investigations  (7.7%),  musculoskeletal  disorders  (7.5%),  general 
disorders (7.3%), neoplasms (7%), and blood disorders (5.3%). Among individual patient groups, the 
frequencies of these types of events varied from those seen across all populations. 
Within the post-marketing SAEs previously presented, the most frequently reported events reported in 
>  5%  of  patients  across  all  patient  groups  were  similar  to  those  in  the  updated  data  cut.  The  most 
common events were infections (30%), followed by investigations (11.2%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(8.9%),  neoplasms  (8.9%),  musculoskeletal  disorders  (6.7%),  blood  disorders  (5.8%),  and  general 
disorders (5.1%). 
2.2.4.1.  Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Due to the design of study WA19977, the placebo controlled withdrawal part was preceded by a lead in 
phase were all subjects were treated with TCZ. Thus all patients were exposed to TCZ which precludes 
a comparative assessment of the safety data. 
The safety of TCZ was previously assessed in the paediatric population in sJIA patients. 
Study WA1997 did not reveal any new safety signal. The safety between the pJIA and sJIA patients is 
similar  with  a  trend  to  lower  AE  rates  in  the  pJIA  population  compared  to  the  sJIA  population.  This 
could be explained through more severe diseased sJIA population. 
The most frequent AEs occurring were juvenile arthritis (which were underlying disease flares reported 
as  AEs),  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  cough,  pharyngitis,  nausea, 
diarrhoea, rhinitis, vomiting, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, and rash. The most common types 
of infections were those typically seen in children i.e. infections of the upper respiratory tract or viral 
infections.  
The  rate  of  SAEs  was  similar  in  the  pJIA  and  adult  population  but  lower  than  in  the  sJIA  population. 
Again, this could explain by the generally more severe diseased sJIA population.  
One patient experienced uveitis under treatment with TCZ, which is a known complication for JRA. The 
impact  on  the  prevention/outcome  of  uveitis  under  treatment  with  TCZ  should  be  addressed  in  the 
post-marketing setting. The overall prevalence of uveitis is estimated to be around 10-15% in the JIA 
population, with a higher prevalence in the extended oligoarthritis subgroup (around 20%). Additional 
risk  factors  for  the  development  of  uveitis  include  female  gender,  a  young  age  of  diagnosis  and  ANA 
positive status (about 30%). Thus, in spite of the exclusion of patients with prior uveitis on the basis of 
slit-lamp  examination  at  screening,  the  report  of  uveitis  in  the  WA19977  study  is  not  unexpected. 
However, the paucity of literature on the incidence of uveitis means that an analysis of the relationship 
between TCZ usage and uveitis using WA19977 data is not possible. The MAH is planning to record the 
occurrence of uveitis in pJIA patients treated with TCZ in the post-marketing setting in the context of a 
registry. Independently, an investigator sponsored trial (supported via a financial grant by the MAH) is 
planning  to  treat  five  patients  with  JIA  and  uveitis  with  open-label  TCZ;  the  design  of  the  trial  will 
preclude  the  results  from  making  definitive  conclusions,  and  given  the  independence  of  the  sponsor 
from  the  MAH,  whether  and  when  these  data  are  collected  is  uncertain.  The  plan  to  record  the 
occurrence of uveitis in pJIA patients treated with TCZ in the post-marketing setting in the context of a 
new paediatric registry is endorsed. As per the RMP, the MAH should submit the outline of the registry 
for review by the CHMP.

There  was  one  case  of  a  primary  pulmonary  tuberculosis  infection  in  an  endemic  region.  This  is  not 
unexpected for the product class.  
One event with preferred term ‘hepatotoxicity’ was reported in one patient treated concomitant with 
MTX. The event was attributed to MTX therapy.  
Hepatic transaminases remained within the normal range throughout study treatment in the majority 
of  the  patient.  There  was  no  shift  in  total  bilirubin  to  grade  3  or  4  values.  The  rate  of  patients  with 
normal liver enzymes was higher than in the adult study and in the sJIA population.  
Three  patients  (1.6%)  had  positive  screening  assay  results  post-baseline,  and  1  patient  (0.5%)  had 
positive  confirmation  and  neutralizing  assay  results  post-baseline  without  evidence  of  clinical 
consequence.  
2.2.4.2.  Conclusions on Clinical Safety 
The safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population with pJIA is comparable with the safety profile in 
the adult RA population. No new safety signals were identified. The rates of adverse events, including 
SAEs, 
infections,  serious 
infections  and  haematological  abnormalities  e.g.  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia  are  lower  than  in  the  sJIA  population.  This  might  be  partly  explained  by  the  less 
diseased population. 
The long term safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population is currently limited. Additional data will 
be  provided  through  the  final  report  of  the  last  part  of  study  WA19977  (part  III).  Furthermore,  the 
MAH was requested to initiate a new paediatric registry to collect long term efficacy and safety data in 
pJIA treatment. Both data colleactions are documented in the risk management plan.  
2.3.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk  minimisation  plan.  The  key  principles  of  the  existing  education  material  have  been  updated  to 
include the new pJIA indication.

Infections  
Serious and sometimes fatal infections 
have been reported in patients 
receiving immunosuppressive agents 
including RoActemra (see 
section 4.8). 
RoActemra treatment should not be 
initiated in patients with active 
infections (see section 4.3). 
Administration of RoActemra should 
be interrupted if a patient develops a 
serious infection until the infection is 
controlled (see section 4.8). 
Healthcare professionals should 
exercise caution when considering the 
use of RoActemra in patients with a 
history of recurring or chronic 
infections or with underlying 
conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, 
diabetes, and interstitial lung disease) 
which may predispose patients to 
infections. 
Vigilance for the timely detection of 
serious infection is recommended for 
patients receiving biological 
treatments for moderate to severe RA 
or sJIA as signs and symptoms of 
acute inflammation may be lessened, 
associated with suppression of the 
acute phase reaction. The effects of 
tocilizumab on C-reactive protein 
(CRP), neutrophils and signs and 
symptoms of infection should be 
considered when evaluating a patient 
for a potential infection. Patients 
(which includes younger children with 
sJIA who may be less able to 
communicate their symptoms) and 
parents/guardians of sJIA patients, 
should be instructed to contact their 
healthcare professional immediately 
when any symptoms suggesting 
infection appear, in order to assure 
rapid evaluation and appropriate 
treatment.

pt-yrs in the placebo plus DMARD 
group. In the all exposure population, 
the overall rate of infections with 
RoActemra was 108 events per 
100 pt-yrs exposure. 
In 6-month, controlled clinical studies, 
the rate of serious infections with 
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs 
was 5.3 events per 100 pt-yrs 
exposure compared to 3.9 events per

group and 1.5 events per 100 pt-yrs of 
exposure in the MTX group.  
In the long-term exposure population, 
the overall rate of serious infections 
(bacterial, viral, fungal) was 
4.7 events per 100 pt-yrs. Reported 
serious infections, some with fatal 
outcome, included active tuberculosis, 
which may present with 
intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary 
disease, invasive pulmonary 
infections, including candidiasis, 
aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and 
pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 
cellulitis, herpes zoster, 
gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis 
and bacterial arthritis. Cases of 
opportunistic infections have been 
reported. 
Interstitial Lung Disease: 
Impaired lung function may increase 
the risk for developing infections. 
There have been post-marketing 
reports of interstitial lung disease 
(including pneumonitis and 
pulmonary fibrosis), some of which 
had fatal outcomes. 
sJIA: 
In the 12 week controlled phase, the 
rate of all infections in the tocilizumab

Section 2 What you need to know 
before you use RoActemra  
Do not use RoActemra  
If you have an active, severe infection. 
Take special care with RoActemra 
If you have any kind of infection, 
short- or long-term, or if you often get 
infections. Tell your doctor 
immediately if you feel unwell. 
RoActemra can reduce your body’s 
ability to respond to infections and 
may make an existing infection worse 
or increase the chance of getting a 
new infection. 
If you have had tuberculosis, tell your 
doctor. Your doctor will check for 
signs and symptoms of tuberculosis 
before starting RoActemra. 
If symptoms of tuberculosis 
(persistent cough, weight loss, 
listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after 
therapy tell your doctor immediately. 
Section 4 POSSIBLE SIDE 
EFFECTS 
Possible serious side effects include 
serious infections and allergic 
(hypersensitivity) reactions, that may, 
in a small number of cases, be life-
threatening  
If you notice any of the following 
signs of: 
…infections, tell your doctor as soon 
as possible: 
-fever and chills  
-mouth or skin blisters  
-stomach ache 
-persistent headaches 
Additional risk minimization: 
Alert card to advise patients and 
health care providers that RoActemra 
increases the risk of getting infections 
which can become serious if not 
treated and of the need for timely 
diagnostic and treatment measures on 
the first signs of infection.

Complications of diverticulitis 
Events of diverticular perforations as 
complications of diverticulitis have 
been reported uncommonly with 
RoActemra in RA (see section 4.8). 
RoActemra should be used with 
caution in patients with previous 
history of intestinal ulceration or 
diverticulitis. Patients presenting with 
symptoms potentially indicative of 
complicated diverticulitis, such as 
abdominal pain, haemorrhage and/or 
unexplained change in bowel habits 
with fever should be evaluated 
promptly for early identification of 
diverticulitis which can be associated 
with gastrointestinal perforation.

Gastrointestinal Perforation 
During the six month controlled trials, 
the incidence of gastrointestinal 
perforation was 0.26 events per 100 
pt-yrs with tocilizumab therapy. In the 
all exposure population, the overall 
rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 
0.28 events per 100 pt-yrs. Reports of 
gastrointestinal perforation were 
primarily reported as complications of 
diverticulitis including generalised 
purulent peritonitis, lower 
gastrointestinal perforation, fistula, 
and abscess.

Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
have been reported in association with 
infusion of RoActemra in 
approximately 0.3% of RA patients 
(see section 4.8). A patient with a 
previous infusion reaction and 
premedicated with steroids and 
antihistamines experienced a fatal 
anaphylactic reaction during a 
subsequent treatment with RoActemra 
in the post marketing setting. 
Appropriate treatment should be 
available for immediate use in the 
event of an anaphylactic reaction 
during treatment with RoActemra. If 
an anaphylactic reaction or other 
serious hypersensitivity reaction 
occurs, administration of RoActemra 
should be stopped immediately and 
RoActemra should be permanently 
discontinued. 
SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Infusion reactions  
In the 6-month controlled trials, 
adverse events associated with 
infusion (selected events occurring 
during or within 24 hours of infusion) 
were reported by 6.9% of patients in 
the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus 
DMARD group and 5.1% of patients 
in the placebo plus DMARD group. 
Events reported during the infusion 
were primarily episodes of 
hypertension; events reported within 
24 hours of finishing an infusion were 
headache and skin reactions (rash, 
urticaria). These events were not 
treatment limiting. 
The rate of anaphylactic reactions 
(occurring in a total of 6/3778 
patients) was several fold higher with 
the 4 mg/kg dose compared to the 
8 mg/kg dose.

and requiring treatment 
discontinuation were reported in a 
total of 13 out of 3778 patients (0.3%) 
treated with tocilizumab during the 
controlled and open label clinical 
studies. These reactions were 
generally observed during the second 
to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see 
section 4.4). The safety profile in post 
marketing experience is consistent 
with clinical trial data with the 
exception of a case of a fatal 
anaphylactic reaction that has been 
reported during tocilizumab treatment 
(see section 4.4). 
sJIA: 
Infusion related reactions are defined 
as all events occurring during or 
within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 
12 week controlled phase, 4% of 
patients from the tocilizumab group 
experienced events occurring during 
infusion. On event (angioedema) was 
considered serious and life-
threatening, and the patient was 
discontinued from study treatment. 
In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% 
of patients in the tocilizumab group 
and 5.4% of patients in the placebo 
group experienced an event within 24 
hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab 
group, the events included, but were 
not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, 
epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and 
headache. One of these events, 
urticaria, was considered serious. 
Clinically significant hypersensitivity

Hepatic transaminase elevations 
In clinical trials, transient or intermittent mild 
and moderate elevations of hepatic 
transaminases have been reported commonly 
with RoActemra treatment, without 
progression to hepatic injury (see section 4.8).

MTX and in 6.5% of patients who received 
8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus DMARDs 
compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus 
DMARDs. 
The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs 
(e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy 
resulted in increased frequency of these 
elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x 
ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab 
monotherapy patients and 1.4% of 
tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the 
majority of whom were discontinued 
permanently from tocilizumab treatment. 
These elevations were not associated with 
clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, 
nor were they associated with clinical 
evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment. 
During the double-blind controlled period and 
with long-term exposure, the pattern and 
incidence of elevations in ALT/AST 
remained consistent with what was seen in 
the 6-month controlled clinical trials. 
During the double-blind controlled period, the 
incidence of indirect total bilirubin greater 
than the upper limit of normal, collected as a 
routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in 
patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab +

Immunogenicity  
A total of 2876 patients have been tested for 
anti-tocilizumab antibodies in the controlled 
clinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who 
developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 had 
an associated medically significant 
hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Thirty patients developed neutralising 
antibodies. 
sJIA: 
All 112 patients were tested for anti-
tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two 
patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab 
antibodies with one of these patients having a 
hypersensitivity reaction leading to 
withdrawal. The incidence of anti-
tocilizumab antibody formation might be 
underestimated because of interference of 
tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug 
concentration observed in children compared 
to adults.

Lipid parameters 
Elevations in lipid parameters including total

high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and 
triglycerides were observed in patients treated 
with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). In the 
majority of patients, there was no increase in 
atherogenic indices, and elevations in total 
cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid 
lowering agents. 
Assessment of lipid parameters should be 
performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation 
of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be 
managed according to local clinical 
guidelines for management of 
hyperlipidaemia. 
Cardiovascular Risk  
RA patients have an increased risk for

SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes 
is suppressed by the cytokines, such as IL-6, 
that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, 
CYP450 expression may be reversed when 
potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as 
tocilizumab, is introduced. 
In vitro studies with cultured human 
hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a 
reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. 
Tocilizumab normalises expression of these 
enzymes. 
When starting or stopping therapy with 
tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal 
products which are individually adjusted and 
are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 
or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium channel 
blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, 
ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be 
monitored as doses may need to be increased 
to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long 
elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of 
tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may 
persist for several weeks after stopping 
therapy.

ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab 
monotherapy patients and 1.4% of 
tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the 
majority of whom were discontinued 
permanently from tocilizumab treatment. 
These elevations were not associated with 
clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, 
nor were they associated with clinical 
evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment. 
During the double-blind controlled period and 
with long-term exposure, the pattern and 
incidence of elevations in ALT/AST 
remained consistent with what was seen in 
the 6-month controlled clinical trials. 
During the double-blind controlled period, the 
incidence of indirect total bilirubin greater 
than the upper limit of normal, collected as a 
routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in 
patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + 
DMARD. A total of 5.8% of patients 
experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin

Immunogenicity  
A total of 2876 patients have been tested for 
anti-tocilizumab antibodies in the controlled 
clinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who 
developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 had 
an associated medically significant 
hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Thirty patients developed neutralising 
antibodies. 
sJIA: 
All 112 patients were tested for anti-
tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two 
patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab 
antibodies with one of these patients having a 
hypersensitivity reaction leading to 
withdrawal. The incidence of anti-
tocilizumab antibody formation might be 
underestimated because of interference of 
tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug 
concentration observed in children compared 
to adults.

Lipid parameters 
Elevations in lipid parameters including total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and 
triglycerides were observed in patients treated 
with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). In the 
majority of patients, there was no increase in 
atherogenic indices, and elevations in total 
cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid 
lowering agents. 
Assessment of lipid parameters should be 
performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation 
of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be 
managed according to local clinical 
guidelines for management of 
hyperlipidaemia. 
Cardiovascular Risk  
RA patients have an increased risk for 
cardiovascular disorders and should have risk 
factors (eg. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) 
managed as part of usual standard of care.

SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes 
is suppressed by the cytokines, such as IL-6, 
that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, 
CYP450 expression may be reversed when 
potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as 
tocilizumab, is introduced. 
In vitro studies with cultured human 
hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a 
reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. 
Tocilizumab normalises expression of these 
enzymes. 
When starting or stopping therapy with 
tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal 
products which are individually adjusted and 
are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 
or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium channel 
blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, 
ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be 
monitored as doses may need to be increased 
to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long 
elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of 
tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may 
persist for several weeks after stopping 
therapy.

The  MAH  proposed  the  following  changes  to the  Product  Information  (PI),  to  which  the  CHMP  agreed 
(new text shown as underlined, deleted text as strikethrough): 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC 
RoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of 
age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. RoActemra can be 
given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate. 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC 
Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of RA or sJIA or pJIA. All patients treated with RoActemra should be given the Patient Alert Card. 
[…] 
pJIA patients 
The safety and efficacy of RoActemra in children below 2 years of age has not been  
established.  
No data are available.  
The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal 
to 30 kg or 10 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should 
be calculated based on the patient’s body weight at each administration. A change in dose 
should only be based on a consistent change in the patient’s body weight over time. 
Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in pJIA 
patients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other 
medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the 
clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may effect 
laboratory values in pJIA, the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality 
should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient.

The decision to discontinue RoActemra in pJIA for a laboratory 
abnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the 
individual patient. 
Reduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in pJIA patients. 
Available data suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment 
with RoActemra. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient exhibiting no 
improvement within this timeframe. 
[…] 
Method of administration 
After dilution, RoActemra for RA and sJIA and pJIA patients should be administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 1 hour. 
RA Patients, and sJIA and pJIA Patients ≥ 30 kg 
RoActemra should be diluted to a final volume of 100 ml with sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection using aseptic technique.  
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  
sJIA and pJIA Patients <30 kg

pJIA Patients 
The safety of tocilizumab in pJIA has been studied in 188 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. The total 
patient exposure was 184.4 patient years. The frequency of ADRs in pJIA patients can be found in 
Table 2. The types of ADRs in pJIA patients were similar to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see 
section 4.8. When compared to the adult RA population, events of nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, 
and decreased neutrophil count were more frequently reported in the pJIA population. Events of 
cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the pJIA population than in the adult RA 
population.  
Infections 
The rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The 
most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate 
of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg 
tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg 
tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was 
also numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) 
compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%). 
Infusion Reactions 
In pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours 
of an infusion. In the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) experienced infusion 
reactions during the infusion and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an 
infusion. The most common events occuring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension 
and within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions 
observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and sJIA 
patients, see section 4.8.  
No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment 
discontinuation were reported. 
Immunogenicity 
One patient in the 10 mg/kg < 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without 
developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study. 
Neutrophils 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in 
neutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 3.7% of patients. 
Platelets 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, 1% of patients had a 
decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 103/µL without associated bleeding events.  
Hepatic transaminase elevations 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in ALT or 
AST ≥3xULN occurred in 3.7% and <1% of patients, respectively. 
Lipid parameters 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in total 
cholesterol >1.5-2 x ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%) and elevation in LDL >1.5-2 x ULN in one 
patient (0.5%). 
sJIA Patients 
The safety of tocilizumab in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. In the 12 
week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab (8 mg/kg or 
12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of switching to tocilizumab, due to 
disease worsening, patients were treated in the ongoing open label extension phase.

In general, the ADRs in sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients, see section 4.8. 
The frequency of ADRs in sJIA patients can be found in Table 2. When compared to the adult RA 
population, patients with sJIA experienced a higher frequency of nasopharyngitis, decrease in 
neutrophil counts, hepatic transaminases increased, and diarrhea. Events of cholesterol increased were 
less frequently reported in the sJIA population than in the adult RA population. 
Infections 
In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab group was 344.7 per 
100 patient years and 287.0 per 100 patient years in the placebo group. In the ongoing open label 
extension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 306.6 per 100 patient 
years. 
In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 
100 patient years. At one year in the ongoing open label extension phase the overall rate of serious 
infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were similar to 
those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media. 
Infusion Reactions 
Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. 
In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events 
occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and 
the patient was discontinued from study treatment. 
In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the 
placebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab group, the events 
included, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and 
headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. 
Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment 
discontinuation, were reported in 1 out of 112 patients (<1%) treated with tocilizumab during the 
controlled and up to and including the open label clinical trial. 
Immunogenicity 
All 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed 
positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction 
leading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated 
because of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in 
children compared to adults. 
Neutrophils 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil counts 
below 1 x 109/l occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and no decreases in the placebo 
group. 
In the ongoing open label extension phase, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/l, occurred in 
15% of the tocilizumab group.  
Platelets 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 3% of patients in the placebo 
group and 1% in the tocilizumab group had a decrease in platelet count to ≤100 x 103/µl. 
In the ongoing open label extension phase, decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/µl, occurred 
in 3% of patients in the tocilizumab group, without associated bleeding events. 
Hepatic transaminase elevations 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x 
ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group, and 0% in the placebo 
group. 
In the ongoing open label extension phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 12% and 4% 
of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group.

some point in the study. 
Lipid parameters 
During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in total cholesterol 
> 1.5 x ULN to 2 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of the tocilizumab group and none in the placebo group. 
Elevation in LDL > 1.5 x ULN to 2 x ULN occurred in 1.9% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and in 
0% of the placebo group. 
In the ongoing open label extension phase, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters 
remained consistent with the 12 week controlled phase data. 
SJIA Patients 
The safety of tocilizumab in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. In the 12 
week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab (8  mg/kg or 
12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of switching to tocilizumab, due to 
disease worsening, patients were treated in the ongoing open label extension phase.

Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC 
PJIA Patients 
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study WA19977 including an open-label 
extension in children with active pJIA. Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment 
lead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 
withdrawal period (n=163), followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. In Part 1, eligible 
patients ≥ 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeksfor 4 doses. Patients < 30 kg were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. 
Patients who completed Part I of the study and achieved at least a JIA ACR30 response at week 16 
compared to baseline were eligible to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. In 
Part II, patients were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 
ratio, stratified by concurrent MTX use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in 
Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR30 flare criteria (relative to 
Week 16) and qualified for escape to tocilizumab therapy (same dose received in Part I).   
Clinical response 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR30 flare at week 40 relative to 
week 16. Forty eight percent (48.1%, 39/81) of the patients treated with placebo flared compared with 
25.6% (21/82) of tocilizumab treated patients. These proportions were statistically significantly 
different (p=0.0024).  
At the conclusion of Part I, JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were 89.4%, 83.0%, 62.2%, and 26.1%, 
respectively. 
During  the  withdrawal  phase  (Part  II),  the  percentage  of  patients  achieving  JIA  ACR  30,  50,  and  70 
responses  at  Week  40  relative  to  baseline  are  shown  in  Table  7.  In  this  statistical  analysis,  patients 
who flared (and escaped to TCZ) during Part II or who withdrew, were classified as non-responders. An 
additional  analyses  of  JIA  ACR  responses,  considering  observed  data  at  Week  40,  regardless  of  flare 
status,  showed  that  by  Week  40,  95.1%  of  patients  who  had  received  continuous  TCZ  therapy,  had 
achieved JIA ACR30 or higher.

Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC 
PJIA Patients: 
The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a 
database composed of 188 patients with pJIA.  
The following parameters are valid for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight ≥ 
30 kg) given every 4 weeks. The predicted mean (± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and C min of tocilizumab were 
29500 ± 8660 µg⋅hr/mL, 182 ± 37 µg/mL and 7.49 ± 8.20 µg/mL, respectively. 
The following parameters are valid for a dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight 
< 30 kg) given every 4 weeks. The predicted mean (± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab 
were 23200 ± 6100 µg⋅hr/mL, 175 ± 32 µg/mL and 2.35 ± 3.59 µg/mL, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393130/2013 
Page 97/104 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The accumulation ratios were 1.05 and 1.16 for AUC 4weeks, and 1.43 and 2.22 for Cmin for 10 mg/kg 
(body weight < 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (body weight ≥ 30 kg) doses, respectively. No accumulation for 
Cmax was observed. 
In pJIA patients, the central volume of distribution was 50 ml/kg, the peripheral volume of distribution 
was 53 ml/kg, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 103 ml/kg. The linear clearance 
estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was 0.146 ml/hr/kg.  
The half life of tocilizumab in pJIA patients is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories 
(8 mg/kg for body weight ≥ 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight < 30 kg) during a dosing interval at 
steady state. 
Section 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling of the SmPC 
Use in the paediatric population 
SJIA and pJIA Patients ≥30 kg 
Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 100 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.4 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 100 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 
100 ml. To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming. 
SJIA Patients < 30 kg 
Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 50 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.6 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 50 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 50 ml. 
To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming. 
PJIA Patients <30 kg 
Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 50 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.5 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 50 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 50 ml. 
To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming.

Section 1. What RoActemra is used for of the PL 
•  RoActemra is also used to treat patients 2 years of age and older with active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), an inflammatory disease that causes 
pain and swelling in one or more joints. RoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA 
and can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone. 
Section 2. What you need to know before you take RoActemra of the PL 
Due to lack of clinical experience, RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological 
medicines for the treatment of RA or sJIA or pJIA. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
RoActemra is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are 
pregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.  
Stop breast-feeding if you are to be given RoActemra, and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at 
least 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether 
RoActemra is passed into breast milk.  
Available non-clinical data does not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment 
Section 3. How RoActemra is given of the PL 
Children with pJIA 
The usual dose of RoActemra depends on your weight. 
• 
• 
If you weigh less than 30kg: the dose is 10mg per kg  
If you weigh 30kg or more: the dose is is 8 mg for every kilogram of body weight  
The dose is calculated based on your body weight at each administration.  
Children with pJIA will be given RoActemra once every 4 weeks through a drip in your vein 
(intravenous infusion) over one hour. 
Section 4. Possible side effects of the PL

Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 100 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.4 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 100 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 
100 ml. To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming. 
SJIA Patients < 30 kg 
Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 50 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.6 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 50 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 50 ml. 
To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming. 
PJIA Patients < 30 kg 
Withdraw a volume of sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
from a 50 ml infusion bag, equal to the volume of RoActemra concentrate required for the patients 
dose, under aseptic conditions. The required amount of RoActemra concentrate (0.5 ml/kg) should be 
withdrawn from the vial and placed in the 50 ml infusion bag. This should be a final volume of 50 ml. 
To mix the solution, gently invert the infusion bag to avoid foaming. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk 
balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the pivotal phase III study WA19977, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients 
developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between  Week  16  and  Week  40.  Patients  receiving  placebo  and  those 
receiving  TCZ  were  compared.  Three  subsets  of  the  JIA  population  were  included  in  the  study:  RF-
positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.  
The JIA ACR30 flares relative to week 16 in patients receiving TCZ was statistically significantly lower 
than the rate in patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met. 
This  result  was  supported  by  a  predefined  set  of  secondary  analyses,  controlling  for  multiple  testing. 
To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed 
sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary 
endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  JIA 
ARC/30/50/70  improvement  was  statistical  significant  higher  in  the  TCZ  group  than  in  the  placebo 
group. Change from baseline in number of active joints, in Physician’s global assessments VAS and in 
pain VAS also demonstrated statistical significant superiority of TCZ over placebo.  
Thus  it  can  be  considered  that  the  results  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  in  patients  with 
RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Impairment  of  growth  is  a  common  problem  in  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis  (JRA),  particularly  in 
children  with  active  disease.  So  far  no  data  on  the  potential  impact  on  TCZ  therapy  on  growth 
retardation of in the paediatric population are available. Data on growth development are collected in 
part  III  of  study  WA19977  and  will  be  provided  with  the  final  study  report.  The  MAH  should  also

include  monitoring  the  growth  development  in  the  paediatric  registry  as  described  in  the  risk 
management plan. 
An increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease is documented in adult RA patients, it is suggested 
that  chronic  inflammation  and  impaired  immune  system  are  increasing  the  risk  for  atherosclerosis  in 
this population. In paediatric patients there is also evidence that JIA is associated with increased risk 
for  atherosclerosis,  yet  the  data  are  scare.  The  MAH  will  collect  post  marketing  data  on  the  efficacy 
and  safety  of  TCZ  in  children  with  pJIA  in  a  paediatric  registry  as  described  in  the  risk  management 
plan.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  unfavourable  effects  of  TCZ  are  established  and  include  infection,  allergic  reactions  including 
anaphylaxis, 
neutropenia, 
and 
thrombocytopenia, 
AST/ALT/bilirubin 
elevation 
and 
hypercholesterolaemia.  
No  new  safety  signals  were  identified.  The  safety  profile  of  TCZ  in  paediatric  population  with  pJIA  is 
comparable  with  the  safety  profile  in  the  adult  RA  population.  The  rates  of  adverse  events,  including 
SAEs, 
infections,  serious 
infections  and  haematological  abnormalities  e.g.  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia are lower than in the sJIA population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavorable effects 
The long term safety data of TCZ in the paediatric population is limited. The final report of the part III 
of study WA19977 is will provide further information. In addition, the MAH was requested to initiate a 
paediatric  registry  to  generate long-term  efficacy  and  safety  data. This  registry  specifically  addresses 
the  occurrence/treatment  of  uveitis  in  pJIA  patients  as  one  patient  experienced  this  event  under 
treatment  with  TCZ.  These  measures  are  defined  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  considered 
appropriate. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
JIA is a major cause of disability in children. The prognosis depends on the adequacy of therapy. The 
aim  the  treatment  is  rapid  suppression  of  inflammation  in  order  to  prevent  organ  damage,  maximise 
physical function and promote normal growth and development.  
The important clinical benefit of TCZ observed in the pivotal study WA19977 was a rapid alleviating of 
signs and symptoms in children with JRA in children which are unresponsive to MTX or who intolerant 
to MTX. The primary endpoint was met at the end of the placebo controlled withdrawal period at week 
40.  Furthermore,  at  the  end  of  the  active  lead  in  period  (week  16)  clinically  meaningful  JIA  ACR 
response rates (week 16) were achieved. 
The safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population with pJIA is comparable with the safety profile in 
the adult RA population. No new safety signals were identified. Appropriate risk minimisation measures 
(routine or additional) are included in the RMP.

Benefit-risk balance 
The demonstrated clinical benefit of TCZ therapy in children with RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and 
extended  oligoarticular  arthritis  who  are  unresponsive  or  intolerant  to  MTX  outweighs  the  risks. 
Appropriate  risk  minimisation  measures  (routine  or  additional)  are  included  in  the  RMP.  Additional 
long-term efficacy and safety data in pJIA will be provided with the final results of study WA19977 and 
information from a new paediatric registry, as described in the risk management plan. The benefit risk 
balance in the proposed indication and patient population is positive.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fortacin is indicated for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 3 actuations applied to cover the glans penis. Each dose consists of a total 
of 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine per application (1 dose is equal to 3 actuations). 
A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 4 hours between doses.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
Dose adjustments are not required in the elderly (see section 5.1). 
Renal impairment 
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function, however due to its 
method of administration and very low systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is required. 
Hepatic impairment 
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired hepatic function, however due to its 
method of administration and very low systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is required. Caution 
is advised in case of severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Fortacin in the paediatric population for the indication of treatment of 
primary premature ejaculation. 
Method of administration 
Cutaneous use.

Fortacin is only indicated for application to the glans penis. 
Before initial use, the spray container should be briefly shaken and then primed by spraying it into the 
air three times. 
Before each subsequent use, it should be briefly shaken and then the spray container should be 
re-primed by spraying into the air once. 
Any foreskin should be retracted from the glans penis. The spray container should be held in an 
upright position before use. Fortacin should be applied to the entire glans penis, by actuating the valve 
3 times. One third of the glans penis should be covered with each actuation. After 5 minutes any 
excess spray should be wiped off prior to intercourse. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity of the patient or their partner to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed 
in section 6.1. 
Patients or their partner with a known history of sensitivity to local anaesthetics of the amide type. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Precautions for use 
Premature ejaculation may be due to a condition requiring medical supervision. If this product used as 
directed does not provide relief, the patient should discontinue use and seek medical advice. 
Avoid contact with the eyes and ears  
When applied in the vicinity of the eyes, Fortacin may cause eye irritation. Also the loss of protective 
reflexes may allow corneal irritation and potential abrasion. If eye contact occurs, the eye should 
immediately be rinsed with water or sodium chloride solution and protected until sensation returns. 
When applied to an impaired tympanic membrane, Fortacin may cause ototoxicity of the middle ear. 
Risk of injury 
Fortacin sprayed onto mucous membranes of the patient or their partner, such as the mouth, nose and 
throat, or transferred onto female genitalia or anal lining, could be absorbed and temporary local 
numbness/anaesthesia is likely to result. This hypoaesthesia may mask normal pain sensations and, 
therefore, increase the dangers of localised injury. 
Use with condoms 
Fortacin must not be used with polyurethane-based female and male condoms as deterioration was 
observed and protection from sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy may be reduced. Fortacin can 
be used with contraceptive devices made of latex rubber, polyisoprene, nitrile and silicone as no 
deterioration has been shown with these materials.  
A higher rate of erectile dysfunction and male genital hypoaesthesia may be experienced when using 
Fortacin with male condoms. 
Anaemia related conditions 
Patients or their partner with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or 
idiopathic methaemoglobinaemia are more susceptible to medicinal product-induced 
methaemoglobinaemia (see section 4.5). 
Although the systemic availability of prilocaine by cutaneous absorption of Fortacin is low, caution 
should be exercised in patients with anaemia, congenital or acquired methaemoglobinaemia or patients 
on concomitant therapy known to produce such conditions.

Hypersensitivities 
Patients allergic to paraaminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not 
shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine and/or prilocaine; however, Fortacin should be used with caution 
in patients with a history (or partner with a history) of sensitivities to medicinal products, especially if 
the aetiologic medicinal product is uncertain. 
Skin effects 
In case the patient or their partner develop a rash or skin irritation, treatment with Fortacin should be 
discontinued. If symptoms persist, the patient should consult a doctor. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolise local anaesthetics 
normally, are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine (see 
section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Methaemoglobinaemia may be accentuated in patients already taking medicinal products known to 
induce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, 
metoclopramide, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, 
pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine and quinine (see 
section 4.4). 
The risk of additional systemic toxicity should be considered when large doses of Fortacin are applied 
to patients already using other local anaesthetics or structurally related medicinal products, e.g. class I 
anti-arrhythmics such as mexiletine.  
Specific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and anti-arrhythmic medicinal products class III 
(e.g. amiodarone) have not been performed, but caution is advised due to the potential increase of 
antiarrhythmic effect. 
Medicinal products that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 reduce the clearance of lidocaine (e.g. 
fluvoxamine, cimetidine or betablockers) and may cause potentially toxic plasma concentrations when 
lidocaine is given intravenously in repeated high doses over a long time period (30 hours). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Fortacin is not indicated for use by women. However, there may be some exposure in female partners 
of men treated with Fortacin. 
Women of childbearing potential / contraception in male and females 
Patients hoping to achieve conception should either avoid using Fortacin, or, if it is essential to 
achieve penetration, should wash the glans penis as thoroughly as possible 5 minutes after applying 
the spray but prior to intercourse. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Fortacin during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive 
measures are taken in order to avoid potential foetal exposure.

Breast-feeding 
Lidocaine and prilocaine are excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of Fortacin no effects on 
the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated due to active substance transfer from the male patient to 
his female partner. Fortacin can be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed. 
Fertility 
There are no adequate data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine on fertility in humans. A study in 
rats showed that Fortacin caused a reduction in sperm motility (see section 5.3). This medicinal 
product may reduce the possibility of pregnancy, but should not be used as a contraceptive. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fortacin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in male patients 
were local effects of genital hypoaesthesia (4.5%) and erectile dysfunction (4.4%). These adverse 
reactions caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in female partners 
were vulvovaginal burning sensation (3.9%), and genital hypoaesthesia (1.0%). Vulvovaginal 
discomfort or burning sensation caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.3% of subjects. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Frequency of the adverse reactions is defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
It is unlikely that Fortacin at the recommended dosages to result in an overdose.  
However, should symptoms of systemic toxicity occur, the signs are anticipated to be similar in nature 
to those following the administration of local anaesthetics by other routes. Local anaesthetic toxicity is 
manifested by symptoms of nervous system excitation (e.g. restlessness, vertigo, hearing and visual 
disorders, nausea, vomiting, tremor and muscle twitching) and, in severe cases, central nervous and 
cardiovascular depression (e.g hypotension, bradycardia and circulatory collapse which may lead to 
cardiac arrest).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe neurological symptoms (convulsions, CNS depression) must be treated symptomatically by 
respiratory support and the administration of anticonvulsive medicinal products. 
Prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in the methaemoglobin level particularly in 
conjunction with methaemoglobin-inducing medicinal products (e.g. sulphonamides). Clinically 
significant methaemoglobinaemia should be treated with a slow intravenous injection of 
methylthioninium chloride.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anaesthetics, amides, ATC code: N01BB20 
Mechanism of action 
Fortacin provides topical anaesthesia to the glans penis. The active substances lidocaine and prilocaine 
block the transmission of nerve impulses in the glans penis, reducing the sensitivity of the glans penis. 
This is translated into a delaying of the ejaculatory latency time without adversely affecting the 
sensation of ejaculation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Clinical studies have shown Fortacin to increase the intra-vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), 
increase control over ejaculation and reduce the feelings of distress in patients with premature 
ejaculation as measured by the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE). The medicinal product has a 
rapid onset of action and is effective within 5 minutes of application. The effectiveness of the 
medicinal product has been demonstrated to persist on repeat use over time. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Fortacin was demonstrated in two multi-centre, multinational, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo controlled studies (PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004) both followed by an 
open-label phase. Men satisfying the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) criteria for 
premature ejaculation (PE) who had a baseline IELT ≤ 1 minutes in at least 2 of the first 3 sexual 
encounters during screening were eligible to enrol. 
The ITT population for the two combined pivotal studies comprised 539 patients, with 358 and 181 
patients  in  the  Fortacin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively  (2:1  ratio)  for  the  initial,  three  month  DB 
phase. The Per Protocol population comprised 430 patients (284 and 146 patients in the Fortacin and 
placebo groups, respectively). 
Demographic characteristics for the ITT population of PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 
individually are summarised in table below.

Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index; ITT = intention-to-treat; SD = standard deviation 
The effectiveness of Fortacin in treating PE was assessed by measuring IELT and the co primary 
endpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress using the IPE. During the 3 months 
of the double-blind treatment phase, the geometric mean IELT increased from 0.58 to 3.17 minutes in 
the Fortacin group and from 0.56 to 0.94 minutes in the placebo group. 
85.2% of subjects in the Fortacin group achieved a mean IELT of > 1 minute over the course of 
3 months of treatment with it, whereas 46.4% of the placebo subjects had a mean IELT of > 1 minute. 
66.2% of Fortacin-treated subjects and 18.8% of placebo-treated subjects achieved a mean IELT 
> 2 minutes. 
The clinically significant increases in IELT were paralleled by significant differences in the IPE scores 
(p < 0.0001). Adjusted mean change scores (Fortacin vs. placebo) at Month 3 were 8.2 vs. 2.2 for the 
ejaculatory control score, 7.2 vs. 1.9 for the sexual satisfaction score, and 3.7 vs. 1.1 for the distress 
score. 
In Fortacin-treated subjects, IELT and IPE scores increased at the first measured timepoint. Both IELT 
and IPE scores continued to increase slightly more throughout the remainder of the double-blind 
phase. The positive changes in IELT and IPE domain scores were maintained during the open-label 
treatment phase. 
At each of the three monthly assessments all subjects completed a Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) 
questionnaire relating to perceived control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation, 
satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and interpersonal difficulty relating to ejaculation. The PEP scores 
followed a similar pattern of improvement to the IELT and IPE scores. For all of the three monthly 
assessments completed by the subjects, there was a significant difference between Fortacin and 
placebo (p < 0.0001). Partners completed the PEP questionnaire at month three. There was also a 
significant difference over placebo in all domains for the responses from the partners (p < 0.0001).

Elderly patients 
Patients recruited into the clinical trials ranged from 18- 68 years of age. In the pivotal clinical studies, 
subgroup analysis of the efficacy response in different age groups showed that the efficacy and safety 
profiles were quite consistent between the different age groups.  
There is a large safety database for lidocaine and prilocaine, due to their established use. This does not 
indicate a safety concern for elderly 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fortacin in all subsets of the paediatric population in primary premature ejaculation (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The plasma levels of lidocaine and prilocaine in male and female subjects were below the level 
associated with toxicity (5 000 ng/ml). Male volunteers had maximum plasma concentrations of 
lidocaine which were less than 4% of toxic levels, and prilocaine which were less than 0.4% of toxic 
levels, after repeat dosing. Female volunteers receiving repeated doses directly to the cervix and 
vagina of up to five times the recommended dose for the male partner, had maximum plasma levels of 
lidocaine which were less than 8% of toxic levels, and prilocaine which were less than 1% of toxic 
levels. 
Systemic exposure to lidocaine and prilocaine and their metabolites (respectively 2,6-xylidine and 
o-toluidine), is low following application to the glans penis in male patients and application to the 
cervix/vagina fornices in female subjects, at doses higher than recommended. 
Distribution 
Lidocaine 
The steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 to 2.1 L/kg after intravenous administration. Lidocaine 
is reported to be 66% bound by plasma proteins, including alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine can 
cross the blood brain barrier and the placenta and is distributed in breast milk. 
Prilocaine 
Following intravenous administration, the steady state volume of distribution of prilocaine is 0.7 to 
4.4 L/kg. Prilocaine is reported to be 55% bound to plasma proteins, including alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein. Prilocaine crosses the blood-brain barrier and also crosses the placenta. Prilocaine is also 
distributed in breast milk. 
Biotransformation 
Lidocaine is largely metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP 3A4) and probably to a minor 
extent in the skin. First pass metabolism is rapid and extensive and bioavailability is about 35% after 
oral doses. 
Prilocaine is rapidly metabolised in both the liver, by cytochrome P450, and in the kidneys by 
amidases. 
The metabolism of lidocaine and prilocaine results in the formation of 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine, 
respectively, amongst other metabolites. Plasma levels of these metabolites detected after 
administration of Fortacin in clinical trials were low in both male and female subjects, even after doses 
of it many times in excess of the clinical dose were applied. No 2,6-xylidine or o-toluidine was 
detectable at any time-point in vaginal fluids following local application of the medicinal product in 
female volunteers. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Lidocaine 
The terminal elimination half-life of lidocaine from the plasma following intravenous administration is 
approximately 65 - 150 minutes and the systemic clearance is 10 - 20 mL/min/kg. Lidocaine is 
excreted in the urine mainly as metabolites, with only a small proportion excreted unchanged. 
Prilocaine 
The elimination half-life of prilocaine following intravenous administration is approximately 
10 - 150 minutes. The systemic clearance is 18 - 64 mL/min/kg. Prilocaine is excreted in the urine 
mainly as its metabolites, with only a small proportion excreted unchanged. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Reproductive toxicity 
Lidocaine 
No teratogenic effects were observed in studies of embryonic/foetal development in rats and rabbits 
receiving doses during organogenesis. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at doses toxic to the 
mother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and lactation with 
a dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced. 
Prilocaine 
In a study of pregnant rats receiving a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during organogenesis, 
no effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure 
data available for comparison with clinical exposure. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Lidocaine 
Lidocaine was not genotoxic and the carcinogenic potential of lidocaine has not been studied. The 
lidocaine metabolite 2,6-xylidine has genotoxic potential in vitro. In a carcinogenicity study of rats 
exposed to 2,6-xylidine in utero, postnatally and throughout their lifetime, tumours in the nasal cavity, 
subcutaneous tumours and liver tumours were observed. The clinical relevance of tumour findings in 
relation to short-term/intermittent use of lidocaine in humans is unknown. Human exposure from 
Fortacin is 20-30 fold less than the minimum dose that did not result in tumours and 200 fold less than 
the minimum dose that did result in tumours. 
Prilocaine 
Prilocaine was not genotoxic and the carcinogenic potential of prilocaine has not been studied. The 
prilocaine metabolite o-toluidine has genotoxic potential in vitro. In carcinogenicity studies of 
o-toluidine in rats, mice and hamsters, tumours were observed in several organs. The clinical 
relevance of tumour findings in respect of short-term/intermittent use of prilocaine in humans is 
unknown. Human exposure is 1 000 fold less than than the minimum dose studied. Note, this dose did 
result in tumours. 
Effect on fertility 
In an in vitro study of rats Fortacin has shown a reduction in sperm motility when 22.5 mg lidocaine 
and 7.5 mg prilocaine (i.e. the amount in 1 human dose) was in direct contact with rat sperm. However 
this study did not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as the concentration of Fortacin in direct 
contact with the sperm would be many fold lower. The potential for reduction of sperm motility 
following the clinical use of the medicinal product can not be excluded; therefore it is not possible to 
state whether Fortacin would prevent pregnancy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fortacin is and what it is used for 
Fortacin is a combination of two medicines: lidocaine and prilocaine. These belong to a group of 
medicines called local anaesthetics. 
Fortacin is indicated for the treatment of premature ejaculation occurring in adult men (aged 18 years 
and over) from first sexual intercourse. This is when you always, or nearly always, have ejaculated 
within one minute of sexual intercourse and this causes you negative emotional effects. Fortacin works 
by decreasing the sensitivity of the head of the penis to increase time before ejaculation. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Fortacin 
Do not use Fortacin 
• 
if you or your partner are allergic to lidocaine or prilocaine or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6); 
if you or your partner have a history of allergy or sensitivity to other local anaesthetics with a 
similar structure (known as amide-type local anaesthetics). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fortacin 
• 
if you, or your partner, have been diagnosed with a genetic disease or other condition affecting 
your red blood cells (glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, anaemia or methaemoglobinaemia); 
if you have a history of medicine sensitivities, especially if you are not certain which medicine 
causes sensitivity; 
if you suffer from severe liver problems. 
• 
• 
• 
Premature ejaculation may be due to a condition requiring medical supervision. If this product used as 
directed does not provide relief, consult a doctor. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use with condoms 
• 
Fortacin must not be used with latex-free female and male condoms made of polyurethane as 
these condoms may deteriorate when used together with Fortacin and therefore may fail to 
protect from sexually transmitted disease or pregnancy. Fortacin can be used with contraceptive 
devices made of latex rubber, polyisoprene, nitrile and silicone as no deterioration has been 
shown. Carefully check the material that your contraceptive or your partner’s contraceptive is 
made of before using this product. Ask your pharmacist if you are unsure. 
If you use Fortacin with condoms, you may be more likely to be unable to develop or maintain 
an erection. You may also be more likely to have reduced feeling in and around the penis. 
• 
Avoid accidental contact 
•  When you use this medicine, particularly during priming of the container, aim the container 
away from the face to avoid accidental contact with ears, eyes, nose and mouth. 
If some medicine accidentally gets into your eyes or your partner’s eyes, rinse them 
immediately with cold water or sodium chloride solution and keep them closed as much as 
possible until any effects, such as numbness, wear off. Be aware that normal protective 
mechanisms, such as blinking, or sensation of a foreign body in the eye, may not occur until the 
numbness has worn off. 
Fortacin should not come into contact with a damaged ear drum. 
• 
• 
Contact with other mucous membranes 
• 
Fortacin may also come into contact with other mucous membranes such as your, or your 
partner’s, mouth, nose and throat, causing them to feel slightly numb for a short while. As this 
will reduce the ability to feel pain in these areas, extra care should be taken not to injure them 
until the numbness has worn off. 
Possible transfer to partner, e.g. to vagina or the anus 
• 
During sexual intercourse, a small amount of this medicine may be transferred, e.g. to the 
vagina or the anus. Therefore, both you and your partner may feel slight numbness for a short 
while and should take care not to injure yourselves, particularly during sexual activity. For more 
information regarding possible side effects in sexual partners, see section 4. 
If you or your partner develop a rash or irritation, discontinue use of Fortacin. If symptoms persist, 
consult a doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Fortacin 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. It is particularly important that you talk to a doctor before using Fortacin if you are taking 
any of the following medicines which may interact with Fortacin: 
• 
other local anaesthetics as benzocaine and procaine  
• 
heart medicines (anti-arrhythmic medicines as mexiletine and amiodarone) 
• 
fluvoxamine, cimetidine or beta-blockers, which may cause an increase in the blood levels of 
lidocaine. 
medicines known to increase the risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood 
(methaemoglobinaemia), such as those listed below: 
•  Benzocaine – a local anaesthetic used to treat pain and itching 
•  Chloroquine, pamaquine, primaquine, quinine - used to treat malaria  
•  Metoclopramide – used to treat feelings of sickness (nausea) and vomiting, including in 
• 
patients with migraine 
•  Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, nitroglycerin), isosorbide mononitrate, erythrityl tetranitrate, 
pentaerythritol tetranitrate and other nitrate and nitrite medicines - used to treat angina 
(chest pain caused by the heart) 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Sodium nitroprusside, isosorbide dinitrate – used to treat high blood pressure and heart 
failure 
•  Nitrofurantoin – an antibiotic used to treat urinary and kidney infections 
• 
Sulphonamides (also called sulpha medicines), e.g. sulfamethoxazole – an antibiotic used 
to treat urinary infections, and sulfasalazine – used to treat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative 
colitis and rheumatoid arthritis 
•  Dapsone – used to treat skin conditions such as leprosy and dermatitis and also to prevent 
malaria and pneumonia in high-risk patients 
Phenobarbital, phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy 
Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) – used to treat tuberculosis 
• 
• 
The risk of methaemoglobinaemia can also be increased by the use of certain dyes (aniline dyes), or 
the pesticide naphthalene, so let your doctor know if you work with any dyes or chemical pesticides. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Fortacin is not approved for use by women.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Pregnancy 
Fortacin should not be used whilst your partner is pregnant unless you use an effective male condom, 
as listed above in section 2 “Use with condoms”, to prevent exposure of the unborn child. 
Breast-feeding 
This medicine may be used while your partner is breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Fortacin may reduce the possibility of pregnancy. Therefore, patients hoping to achieve conception 
should either avoid using Fortacin, or, if this medicine is essential to achieve penetration, should wash 
the penis as thoroughly as possible five minutes after Fortacin has been applied, but prior to 
intercourse. 
Driving and using machines 
Fortacin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines when used at the 
recommended doses. 
3.  How to use Fortacin 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
The recommended dose of Fortacin is 3 sprays (3 sprays = 1 dose) on the head of the penis at least 
5 minutes before sexual intercourse. A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 
4 hours between doses. 
The maximum recommended dose (3 doses within 24 hours) should not be exceeded. 
Instructions for use 
• 
Before initial use, briefly shake the spray container and then prime the pump mechanism by 
spraying the valve three times into the air. Aim the container away from faces to avoid contact 
with eyes, nose, mouth and ears. 
Before each subsequent dose, briefly shake the spray container and then re-prime the pump by 
spraying 1 time into the air. 
Retract any foreskin from the head of the penis. Holding the can upright (valve up), apply 
1 dose (3 sprays) of Fortacin to the entire head of the penis, by covering one third with each 
spray.  
• 
• 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Wait 5 minutes then wipe off any excess spray prior to having sexual intercourse. It is important 
that you wipe off any excess spray also if you use a condom (see also section 2 for other 
important information regarding use with condoms). 
If you use more Fortacin than you should 
If you do apply too much, wipe it off. 
Symptoms of using too much Fortacin are listed below. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you 
experience any of these. They are very unlikely to happen if it is used as instructed: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Feeling light-headed or dizzy 
Tingling of the skin around the mouth and numbness of the tongue 
Abnormal taste 
Blurred vision 
Ringing in the ears 
There is also a risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood 
(methaemoglobinaemia). This is more likely when certain medicines have been taken at the 
same time. If this happens, the skin becomes bluish-grey due to a lack of oxygen. 
In serious cases of overdose, symptoms may include fits, low blood pressure, slowed breathing, 
stopped breathing and altered heart beat. These effects may be life-threatening. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted a completed paediatric study; 3082B2-313-WW (B1831001); an open label 
study to evaluate prophylaxis treatment, and to characterise the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics 
of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin free in children with hemophilia A. 
This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (European 
Commission [EC]) No 1901/2006. The MAH plans to submit a type II variation Q1 2019 to update the 
ReFacto AF SmPC to include the safety data from this study once this Article 46 assessment has 
completed. The MAH will submit an RMP update as part of this type II variation, which will reflect the 
completion of studies 3082B2-313-WW (B1831001) and B1831007. This submission also fulfils MEA 
116. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Refacto (Moroctocog alfa) received its first regulatory approval on 13 April 1999 in the EU for the 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII [FVIII] 
deficiency).  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including 
newborns.  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence, is not 
indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand’s disease.  Refacto AF (Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)) was 
developed as a successor to Refacto (moroctocog alfa) in an effort to eliminate animal/human proteins 
from the manufacturing process of moroctocog alfa by making the product albumin free.  Refacto 
(Moroctocog alfa) is approved globally, but is no longer manufactured.   
Study B1831001 was undertaken to fulfil a FDA commitment with the primary objective to compare 
annualised bleeding rate during on demand versus routine prophylaxis and the secondary objective to 
compare 2 regimens of prophylaxis with Xyntha, the US approved product. The difference between 
ReFacto AF and Xyntha is the analytical method used to calibrate the working potency standard that is 
used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using a one-stage assay, and 
the standard for ReFacto AF has been calibrated using a chromogenic substrate assay.  The 2 products 
are not interchangeable.

• 
Study  B1831001  an  open  label  study  to  evaluate  prophylaxis  treatment,  and  to  characterise 
the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin 
free in children with hemophilia A. 
For this study, 2 previous interim analysis clinical study reports, dated 07 November 2013 and 11 April 
2016,  presented  snapshot  analyses  of  selected  data  collected  for  approximately  4  and  7  years, 
respectively,  after  initiation  of  study  enrollment.  The  first  interim  analysis  CSR  included  OD  therapy 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety data, collected for approximately 4 years after initiation of 
study enrollment. The analyses for these summaries were based on descriptive statistics, using a data 
cut-off  date  of  31  December  2012.  Moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC),  the  study  drug,  was  reported  as 
efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  hemophilia  A  when  used  for  the  OD  treatment  of  bleeding  episodes  in 
children under 6 years of age. The majority of the bleeding episodes (93.7%) were resolved with 1 or 
2  infusions.  A  total  468  of  493  bleeding  episodes  (94.9%)  treated  with  study  drug  were  rated 
“Excellent”or “Good”in their response to initial treatment and 22 (4.5%) were rated as “Moderate”. 
No new safety signal was observed. PK data were reported for 5 children aged 3.7 to 5.8 years. 
The  second  interim  analysis  CSR  included  data  on  safety,  efficacy,  and  OD  therapy  compared  to  RP, 
collected for approximately 7 years after initiation of study enrollment up to a data cut-off date of 26 
June 2015. An analysis was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, comparing the mean number 
of bleeds per year (annualized bleeding rates [ABRs]) while on OD therapy versus RP on the intent to 
treat  (ITT)  population.  Routine  prophylaxis  with  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  was  reported  to  be 
efficacious  for  pediatric-aged  subjects  <6  years  with  moderately  severe  to  severe  hemophilia  A, 
reducing  significantly  the  ABR  compared  to  OD  therapy  in  addition  to  demonstrating  efficacy  when 
used  as  an  OD  treatment.  No  new  safety  findings  were  reported  in  this  pediatric  hemophilia  A 
population. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study B1831001 
Study B1831001 was an open label, multicentre study of Xyntha conducted at 42 sites in 17 countries 
worldwide between 11 December 2007 and 18 April 2018 in paediatric patients with moderately severe 
to severe haemophilia A. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  clinical  outcomes  during  periods  of  study  drug  prophylaxis 
treatment  versus  periods  of  On-demand  (OD)  therapy  in  paediatric  subjects  to  demonstrate  that 
moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduces annualized bleeding rate (ABR) relative to OD therapy in 
infants to children aged <16 years with haemophilia A.   
The  secondary  objectives  included  the  comparison  of  the  clinical  outcomes  of  a  high-  (ie,  25 
international unit(s) [IU]/kg every other day [EOD]) versus low-frequency dosing (ie, 45 IU/kg twice a 
week [BIW]) schedule on the efficacy of study drug prophylaxis.  In addition, the study also evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of the drug in paediatric patients, including the characterisation of the incidence 
of  less  than  expected  therapeutic  effect  (LETE)  and  characterisation  of  the  PK  of  FVIII  following 
moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration to patients aged 6 months to <16 years with haemophilia A. 
Overall study design 
This  was  an  open  label,  multicentre  study  of  Xyntha  that  originally  planned  to  recruit  a  total  of 
approximately  72  paediatric  subjects  <6  years  of  age  (<16  years  after  Amendment  10)  with 
moderately severe to severe haemophilia A (confirmed Factor VIII activity in plasma [FVIII:C] ≤2% by 
both the local laboratory and the central laboratory at screening) at approximately 40 sites. 
The study was conducted in two 6-to-12 month segments (Segment 1 and Segment 2); 2 cohorts were 
enrolled: the OD cohort included subjects who practised OD therapy for Segment 1 followed by RP for

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Segment 2, and the RP cohort included subjects who practised RP for both segments.  Segment 1 for 
the OD cohort was 12 months for subjects enrolled prior to Amendment 7 (dated 31 August 2011), and 
6 months in duration for subjects enrolled after this.  When a bleed occurred for a subject in the OD 
cohort  during  Segment  1,  study  drug  was  to  be  administered  at  a  dose  and  frequency  prescribed  by 
the investigator as per local standard of care, based on the recommendation for OD treatment with the 
licensed product Xyntha. 
For the OD cohort, study drug in Segment 2 was administered at the doses and frequencies defined by 
Regimen B only (25 ± 5 IU/kg EOD).  For the RP subjects, each segment was 12 months in duration.  
Subjects  in  the  RP  cohort  were  randomised  to  receive  low  frequency  Regimen  A  (45  ±  5  IU/kg  BIW) 
followed  by  high  frequency  Regimen  B  (25  ±  5  IU/kg  EOD)  (prophylaxis  sequence  received  during 
Segments  1  and  2:  the  low-  followed  by  the  high  frequency  dosing  sequence  [AB]),  or  vice  versa 
(Regimen  B  followed  by  Regimen  A;  prophylaxis  sequence  received  during  Segments  1  and  2:  the 
high- followed by the low frequency dosing sequence [BA]).  Randomisation to prophylaxis treatment 
was  stratified  by  haemophilia  A  severity:  FVIII:C  <1%  or  1%  to  2%  (according  to  central  laboratory 
screening result).  There was no active control group in this study. 
A  subset  of  severe  (FVIII:C  ≤1%  confirmed  by  the  central  laboratory  screening  test)  haemophilia  A 
subjects  could  participate  in  assessments  to  characterise  the  PK  of  FVIII:C  after  administration  of 
study  drug.    Subjects  who  were  eligible  and  opted  to  participate  underwent  a  PK  assessment,  after 
receiving a single open-label dose (50 ± 5 IU/kg rounded to the nearest complete vial) over 2 minutes, 
with  blood  sampled  for  FVIII:C  measurements  before  and  at  0.5  hour,  8,  24,  28  (optional),  and  32 
hours after the start of the infusion. 
Selection of Study Population 
The subjects were considered eligible for enrolment into the study only when they met all the inclusion 
criteria outlined in the protocol. 
The eligible subjects for screening included previously treated male subjects (≥20 exposure days [EDs] 
to  any  FVIII  replacement  product)  aged  6  months  to  <16  years  at  the  time  of  Screening  Visit  with 
moderately severe to severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤2%) by both the local laboratory and the central

laboratory.  The subjects were to have a medical history negative for past FVIII inhibitor.  In addition, 
subjects had to have a FVIII:C of ≤1% confirmed by the central laboratory screening test to be eligible 
for PK assessments.   
Statistical Considerations for the Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately  72  subjects  were  originally  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  at  approximately  40 
sites.  Subjects withdrawn from the study were not replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal.  
Twenty four (24) subjects in the OD cohort were planned to contribute to the comparison of ABR in the 
OD versus RP treatment settings; 48 subjects in the RP cohort were planned for the comparison of ABR 
in the 2 prophylaxis regimens (A and B).  After the sample size re-estimation described in Amendment 
10,  planned  enrolment  for  the  RP  cohort  was  revised  to  56  subjects  (6  months  to  <16  years), 
considering the subjects from Site 010 who were excluded from the analyses (allowing for an attrition 
rate of 30% [38 subjects)].  From the planned total of 72 subjects, a subset of approximately 23 PK 
subjects  (meeting  specific  criteria)  was  planned  for  PK  assessments  for  the  objective  of  PK 
characterisation of FVIII:C. 
Due  to  serious  breaches  of  Good  Clinical  Practice  compliance  pertaining  to  data  integrity  at  Site  010, 
data for 15 subjects at this site were presented separately to those of subjects from other study sites.  
Data  from  this  site  were  excluded  from  safety,  efficacy  and  baseline  summary  data  (but  included  for 
protocol deviations and recovery/PK data and inhibitor incidence. 
Subject Disposition and Demography 
A total of 71 subjects were screened, and 51 subjects (excluding Site 010 in Poland) were enrolled into 
this study and included in the intent to treat (ITT) population.  A total of 50 subjects were included in 
the modified intent to treat (mITT) population; 1 subject enrolled in the OD cohort did not receive any 
study  drug.    A  total  of  41  (80.4%)  subjects  completed  the  study,  and  10  (19.6%)  subjects 
discontinued  the  study  early;  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  adverse  event  (AE) 
(9.8%).    The  complete  details  about  the  disposition  of  the  enrolled  subjects  are  present  in  CSR 
B1831001. 
Demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  for  all  subjects  dosed  in  the  study  are  presented  in 
Table 1.  All subjects were male.  The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age (range) was 4.65 ± 1.99 
years  (1.1  12.7  years).    The  majority  of  subjects  (84.3%)  were  aged  between  2  and  6  years,  were 
white  (78.4%)  and  of  non  Hispanic  and  non  Latino  ethnicity  (86.3%).    The  mean  ±  SD  height  was 
107.45  ±  13.31  cm,  and  mean  ±  SD  weight  was  18.74  ±  5.44  kg  for  all  subjects.    Similar 
characteristics were observed for the subjects in the RP and OD cohorts. 
All  7  subjects  with  PK  data  available,  and  included  in  the  PK  analysis,  were  younger  than  6  years  of 
age (including 1 subject from Site 010).

Medical History (ITT Population) 
While enrollment eligibility allowed for subjects with based FVIII activity of <2%, all subjects enrolled 
were  classified  as  having  severe  hemophilia,  ie,  with  <1%  FVIII  activity  level  at  screening.  Most 
subjects  had  a  life  time  exposure  to  FVIII  of  >50  days;  5  subjects  had  between  20  and  50  prior 
exposure dates. The mean (±SD) total number of bleeds in the last 12 months was 9.1±14.3. A total 
of  20  (39.2%)  subjects  had  a  target  joint  involvement  bleed.  The  most  commonly  (>20%)  reported 
medical history by System Organ Class (SOC) was Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (11 
[21.6%]  subjects)  (Table  14.1.4).  Other  SOCs  reported  for  >10%  of  subjects  were  Gastrointestinal 
disorders, Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and Vascular disorders (each reported for 6 
[11.8%] subjects).

Efficacy, Safety Including Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
The measures of PK and safety in this study were standard measurements, widely used and generally 
recognised as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  The safety measurements recorded in this clinical study 
were those employed in most clinical studies, including the recording of AEs coded in accordance with 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Inhibitor development was monitored as part of ongoing safety surveillance by the sponsor to ensure 
that subjects treated with study drug had an acceptable rate of inhibitor development.  The study had 
testing  for  inhibitor development  at  a  frequency  consistent  with  commonly  accepted  standard of  care 
practice in the usual clinical setting. 
RESULTS 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
The optional PK assessment occurred at the beginning of the study (Visit 2), before subjects initiated 
moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  treatment.  Blood  samples  were  collected  at  time  0  (prior  to  the  dose)  and 
then  0.5  hour,  8,  24,  28  (optional  time  point)  and  32 hours  after  the  start  of  the  infusion.  Plasma 
samples  were  analysed  for  FVIII  activity  and  FVIII  inhibitor  at  Covance  Laboratories  Inc  (Chantilly, 
Virginia, USA) using validated, sensitive and specific analytical one-stage coagulation assays. 
Immunogenicity – FVIII Inhibitors 
Incidence  of  FVIII  inhibitors  was  monitored  throughout  the  duration  of  this  study.    Due  to  technical 
issues with the inhibitor assay at the Covance Central Laboratory Services in Chantilly, VA, testing of 
FVIII  inhibitors  needed  to  be  transferred  to  a  new  laboratory,  Esoterix/Labcorp  Inc  (Denver,  CO).  In 
addition,  serum  samples  were  collected  and  tested  for  anti-FVIII  antibodies,  antibodies  to  Chinese 
hamster ovary, and antibodies to the affinity ligand used in the study drug purification process (TN8.2) 
using validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods.  The samples were analysed by 
Covance (Chantilly, VA). 
Overview of Clinical Pharmacology 
The PK parameters for FVIII activity were calculated for each subject using noncompartmental analysis 
of plasma concentration-time for FVIII activity data.  
Pharmacokinetics Results 
Median  and  mean  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  for  FVIII  activity  following  a  single  dose  of 
50 IU/kg  of  Xyntha  are  presented  in  figure  2  and  3.    PK parameters  are  summarised  descriptively  in

Pharmacokinetic Conclusions 
The PK analysis of FVIII activity data for 5 of the 7 subjects  included in this study was reported to the 
FDA  in  a  previously  completed  interim  analysis  and  is  included  in  the  US  Package  Insert.    The  data 
from the full study were re-analysed using current Pfizer processes and standards and results obtained 
were similar. PK analyses  demonstrated that geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss) were 5.822 mL/h/kg and 78.38 mL/kg, respectively.  Mean t½ was about 8.9 hours.  
Geometric mean incremental recovery was 1.248 IU/dL/IU/kg. 
Efficacy Evaluation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Annualised Bleed Rate (On-Demand Cohort) 
The  estimate  of  the  ABR  (±  standard  error  [SE])  for  the  OD  cohort  (ITT  population)  during  the  RP 
regimen (Regimen B [25 IU/kg EOD]) was 1.76 ± 0.798 and was significantly lower (p = 0.0040) than 
the estimate for the ABR (± SE) for OD therapy of 47.02 ± 10.749 using a linear mixed-effects model ( 
Table 3).    A  supportive  analysis  was  performed,  using  the  paired  t-test  (p  =  0.0020),  based  on  the 
within-subject  change  in  ABR  for  the  8 subjects  who  were  evaluated  with  both  OD  and  RP  dosing 
during the study.  The difference between the 2 treatment regimens, though not tested, was similar to 
that observed for the PP population, with or without washout data. 
In addition, a 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the arithmetic means for ABR during 
the  RP  regimen  over  the  ABR  during  OD  therapy  in  the  ITT  population  was  calculated.    The  1-sided 
95% upper confidence bound was 0.08, which is <0.5 indicating that the ABR during the RP regimen 
was at least 50% lower than that observed during  OD therapy.   The ratio and corresponding 1-sided 
95% CI are presented in Table 3.

Of  the  3 categories  of  bleeding  location  (joint,  soft  tissue/muscle,  other),  bleeding  episodes  occurred 
slightly more frequently in soft tissue/muscle during the RP regimen and occurred most frequently in 
joints  during  OD  therapy.    The  RP-B  regimen  resulted  in  a  mean (±  SD)  ABR  for  joint  bleeding 
episodes  of  0.5  ±  1.3  (median:  0.0),  OD  therapy  resulted  in  a  mean  (± SD)  ABR  for  joint  bleeding 
episodes  of  26.2±21.1  (median: 17.5).    The  mean  (±SD)  ABR  for  soft  tissue/muscle  bleeds  was 
0.7±1.1 (median: 0.0) during the RP-B regimen and 21.2±15.3 (median: 16.5) during OD therapy.  A

Annualised Bleed Rate of High- Versus Low-Frequency Prophylaxis (RP Cohort) 
Table 4  presents  the  summary  statistics  for  the  analysis  of  ABR  for  the  RP  cohort  (ITT  population).  
The  90%  2-sided  CI  for  the  mean  difference  in  ABRs  for  the  2  prophylactic  regimens  demonstrated 
equivalence for subjects in the ITT population, that is, the limits of the 90% CI were wholly within the 
prospectively defined equivalence limit of (−3, 3) bleeds per year. Sensitivity analyses that estimated 
the  treatment  effect  and  its  95%  2-sided  CI  obtained  from  a  mixed-effect  model  were  supportive  of 
the results of the equivalence CI results.

Other Efficacy Endpoints 
Number of Infusions Used to Treat Each Bleeding Episode (ITT Population) 
A total of 838 OD infusions were administered to treat the 562 bleeding episodes with a unique start 
date and time.  The majority of bleeding episodes (76.5%) resolved with 1 infusion. 
Response to On-Demand Treatment for All Bleeding Episodes (ITT Population) 
Of the 559 first infusions in 38 subjects for bleeding episodes that were treated initially with a FVIII OD 
infusion, 555 had responses recorded according to the 4-point OD Haemostasis Efficacy Rating Scale.  
Most  bleeds  treated  (>90%)  had  “excellent”  or  “good”  responses  to  the  first  infusion.    The  majority 
(>60%)  of  the  279  follow-up  infusions  (in  31 subjects)  had  “excellent”  or  “good”  responses.  Of  279 
follow-up  infusions,  20  had  no  response  data  recorded.    All  20  of  these  were  in  2 subjects  and  were 
infusions of non-study FVIII and therefore were not required to record a response. 
Incidence of Less Than Expected Therapeutic Effect (ITT Population) 
There  were  no  occurrences  of  LETE  in  the  OD  or  recovery  setting.    In  the  prophylaxis  setting,  7 
subjects  were  identified  as  having  spontaneous  bleeding  episodes  within  48 hours  after  a  regularly 
scheduled prophylaxis dose of study drug with no confounding factors (the criteria for LETE); 5 (9.8%) 
subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode  during  Regimen  B,  and  3 (7.1%)  subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode 
during Regimen A (1 subject had a bleeding episode in both Regimen A and Regimen B).

Out of 561 bleeding episodes with a unique start date and time that were treated with study drug, no 
bleeds met LETE criteria in the OD setting since there were no bleeds that failed to have a response to 
2 successive OD infusions; the observed incidence rate of LETE was 0.0%.  Out of a total of 10,927 RP 
infusions, 18 bleeding episodes met the criteria for LETE in the prophylaxis setting, and the observed 
incidence  rate  of  LETE  was  0.16%.    No  occurrences  of  LETE  low  recovery  were  reported  following 
infusion of study drug, and a similar outcome was observed for the EE population. 
Consumption of Moroctocog Alfa (AF-CC) (ITT Population) 
The  cumulative  total  number  of  RP  infusions  was  10,899  including  3533  during  Regimen A  and  7366 
during Regimen B. 
Number  of  Spontaneous  Bleeds  and  Time  to  Spontaneous  Bleeds  During  the  Prophylaxis  Period  (ITT 
Population) 
During Regimen A (45 IU/kg BIW), 4 subjects experienced a mean (± SD) of 1.3 ± 0.50 spontaneous 
bleeding  episodes  within  48 hours  of  a  previous  RP  infusion.    During  Regimen B  (25 IU/kg  EOD), 
6 subjects experienced a mean (± SD) of 1.3 ± 0.52 spontaneous bleeding episodes within 48 hours of 
a previous RP infusion.  A similar outcome was also observed for the EE population.   
Compliance to Prophylaxis Regimen 
Most  subjects  received  a  total  actual  number  of  infusions  within  ±  20%  of  the  expected  number  of 
infusions  (98.0%)  and  had  an  actual  mean  exposure  within  ±  20%  of  the  expected  mean  exposure 
(84.0%).  Eight (8) subjects had an actual mean exposure that was not within ± 20% of the expected 
mean  exposure  (2  in  the  OD  cohort  and  6  in  the  RP  cohort).    In  the  OD  cohort  during  RP  regimen B 
(25 IU/kg  EOD),  2 subjects  received  total  doses  which  were  outside  their  expected  doses:  1  subject 
received  a  total  dose  of  3141.9 IU/kg  which  was  below  the  expected  dose  of  4062.5 IU/kg  and  1 
subject  (001504)  received  a  total  dose  of  5243.6 IU/kg  which  was  above  the  expected  dose  of 
4287.5 IU/kg. 
The  number  (%)  of  subjects  requiring  prophylaxis  regimen  escalation  during  protocol-defined 
prophylaxis is provided for the ITT and EE populations.  In the ITT population, a total of 3 subjects (2 
during  Regimen  A  and  1 during  Regimen  B)  required  intensification  of  their  protocol-defined 
prophylaxis regimen.  Results were similar in the EE population.

The estimate of the ABR for the OD cohort (ITT population) during the RP regimen (25 IU/kg EOD) was 
significantly  lower  than  the  estimate  for  the  ABR  for  OD  therapy  using  a  linear  mixed-effects  model 
(mean  ABRs  [±  SE]  were  1.76  ±  0.798  and  47.02  ±  10.749,  respectively;  p  =  0.0040).    This  result 
was  supported  by  a  paired  t-test  based  on  the  within-subject  change  in  ABR  for  the  8 subjects  who 
were evaluated with both OD and RP dosing during the study (p = 0.0020) and a 1-sided 95% upper 
confidence bound of 0.08 for the ratio of the arithmetic means for ABR during the RP regimen over the 
ABR  during  OD  therapy  (a  ratio  of  <0.5  indicates  the  ABR  during  the  RP  regimen  was  at  least  50% 
lower  than  that  observed  during  OD  therapy).  These  results  are  similar  and  support  the  same 
conclusions for prophylaxis as in the second interim CSR. 
For  the  OD  cohort  (ITT  population),  the  majority  of  bleeding  episodes  during  OD  therapy  were 
traumatic  events.  The  mean  (±SD)  ABR  for  traumatic  bleeds  was  lower  during  the  RP-B  (25  IU/kg 
EOD) regimen (0.8±1.3 [median: 0.0]) than for OD therapy (37.9±31.6 [median: 31.8]). 
In the RP cohort, the 90% 2-sided CI for the mean difference in ABRs for the 2 prophylaxis regimens 
demonstrated equivalence for subjects in the ITT population (the limits of the 90% CI fell wholly within 
the prospectively defined equivalence limit of [–3, 3] bleeds per year). 
Sensitivity  analyses  that  estimated  the  treatment  effect  and  its  95%  2-sided  CI  obtained  from  a 
mixed-effect model were supportive of the results of the equivalence CI results. 
A total of 838 OD infusions were administered to treat the 562 bleeding episodes with a unique start 
date  and  time.  The  majority  of  bleeding  episodes  (76.5%)  resolved  with  1  infusion.  Of  the  559  first 
infusions in 38 subjects for bleeding episodes that were treated initially with a FVIII OD infusion, 555 
had  responses  recorded  according  to  the  4-point  On-Demand  Hemostasis  Efficacy  Rating  Scale.  Most 
bleeds  treated  with  the  first  infusion  (>90%)  had  “excellent”  or  “good”  responses.  The  majority 
(>60%) of the 279 follow-up infusions (in 31 subjects) had “excellent” or “good” responses. 
There were no occurrences of LETE in the OD or recovery setting. In the prophylaxis setting, 7 subjects 
were  identified  as  having  spontaneous  bleeding  episodes  within  48  hours  after  a  regularly  scheduled 
prophylaxis dose of study drug with no confounding factors (the criteria for LETE); 5 (9.8%) subjects 
had  a  bleeding  episode  during  Regimen  B  and  3  (7.1%)  subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode  during 
Regimen  A  (1  subject  had  a  bleeding  episode  in  both  Regimen  A  and  Regimen  B).  Eighteen  (18) 
bleeding episodes met the criteria for LETE in the prophylaxis setting and the observed incidence rate 
of LETE was 0.16%. 
The  cumulative  total  number  of  RP  infusions  was  10899  including  3533  during  Regimen  A  and  7366 
during  Regimen  B  (including  both  cohorts).  Most  subjects  received  a  total  actual  number  of  infusions 
within  ±20%  of  the  expected  number  of  infusions  (98.0%)  and  had  an  actual  mean  exposure  within 
±20% of the expected mean exposure (84.0%). 
SAFETY EVALUATION 
All  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  ITT  analysis  population;  additionally  AEs,  laboratory  data, 
and the incidence of inhibitor development were performed on the mITT population.  Safety data were 
presented for all subjects (OD and RP) combined.  Safety outcome measures included the incidence of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-SAEs.  Any subject who received at least 1 dose of moroctocog 
alfa  (AF-CC)  after  the  informed  consent  document/assent  form  had  been  signed  was  included  in  the 
evaluation  for  safety  in  the  final  CSR.    Information  was  also  collected  on  the  development  of  FVIII 
inhibitors.  Subject withdrawal for safety reasons was at the discretion of the investigator and treating 
physicians.

Treatment emergent events 
A  total  of  49  (98.0%)  subjects  in  the  mITT  population  reported  549  non-haemophilia  related  TEAEs.  
The  most  commonly  reported  (≥50%  of  subjects)  non-haemophilia  related  TEAEs  by  System  Organ 
Class  (SOC)  were  in  the  infections  and  infestations,  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions,  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications,  and  gastrointestinal  disorders.    The  most 
commonly reported (>20%) preferred terms were pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough and 
nasopharyngitis. 
A total of 15 (30.0%) subjects in the mITT population reported at least 1 TEAE related to haemophilia.  
The  most  commonly  reported  (>25%  of  subjects)  haemophilia  related  TEAEs  were  in  the 
Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissues  disorders  SOC  and  included  the  PTs  of  Pain  in  extremity  and 
Haemarthrosis.    Other  treatment  emergent  haemophilia  related  events  were  each  reported  by  ≤5% 
subjects.    A  total  of  6  subjects  experienced  a  drug  related  TEAE:  3  subjects  had  FVIII  inhibition,  1 
subject  had  aminotransferase  increased,  1  subject  had  joint  injury,  and  1  subject  had  drug 
hypersensitivity and pyrexia. 
The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity and no life threatening TEAEs were reported.  
Mild and moderate TEAEs were most commonly reported in the Infections and infestations SOC.  The 
most  commonly  reported  (>20%  of  subjects)  mild  TEAEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, 
pyrexia,  and  cough.    The  most  commonly  reported  (>20%  of  subjects)  moderate  TEAE  was  pyrexia.  
Severe  TEAEs  were  reported  for  8  subjects  and  were  distributed  around  SOCs;  only  1  of  the  severe 
TEAEs was reported for >1 subject (FVIII inhibition, 2 subjects [4.0%]).  The other severe TEAEs (PTs) 
were  Varicella,  Device  related  infection,  Pyrexia,  Catheter  site  rash,  Post  procedural  haemorrhage, 
Haemarthrosis,  Muscle  spasms,  Torticollis,  Monoplegia,  Seizure,  Drug  hypersensitivity  and 
Haematoma. 
Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 15 (30.0%) subjects reported a total of 30 SAEs.  With the exception of FVIII inhibition (4 
[8.0%] subjects), each PT was experienced by ≤2 subjects.  All 4 subjects (including the 1 subject 
with inhibitor detected pre-study treatment) with FVIII inhibition were discontinued from the study as 
PP.  A further subject was discontinued due to drug hypersensitivity.

Factor VIII Inhibitor Development 
Investigators reported all FVIII inhibitors in the same expedited manner as outlined for SAEs. 
Subjects who developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor on the study were to be withdrawn from the study 
after  completion  of  the  procedures  described  in  the  protocol.    Of  the  50  subjects  exposed  to 
moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), 4 subjects tested positive for FVIII inhibitors.  All 4 subjects were withdrawn 
from  the  study  and  considered  as  SAEs.    For  1  of  the  4  subjects,  the  FVIII  inhibitor  event  occurred 
prior to receiving his first dose of study drug and was assessed as unrelated to treatment.  This subject 
had taken study drug for 19 EDs before the baseline results became available.  He was excluded from 
the  numerator  and  denominator  for  inhibitor  development  as  the  inhibitor  was  present  prior  to 
receiving study drug. 
Of the 3 treatment-emergent, treatment-related FVIII inhibitor events (reported in subjects <6 years 
of age), based on the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms along with negative inhibitor testing at 
an  additional  laboratory,  2  were  classified  by  the  sponsor  as  false  positive  inhibitors.    The  third  case 
reported  a  low  titer,  clinically  silent  FVIII  inhibitor  that  resolved.    Further  details  of  the  3  reports  of 
positive FVIII inhibitor results are described below: 
•  Subject wmale subject with severe haemophilia A (FVIII activity ≤1%) had previously received 
both OD FVIII therapy and a FVIII RP regimen for a total of 35 EDs prior to entering the study.  
This subject was assigned to the prophylaxis cohort and received moroctocog alfa (AF CC) 25 
IU/kg EOD during the first 12 months, and then switched to 45 IU/kg BIW for the remainder of 
the study.  Samples obtained during visit 3 (month 1) and visit 5 (month 3) reported positive 
values  via  central  laboratory  evaluation  of  1.73  BU/mL  and  0.89  BU/mL,  respectively.    Based 
on  these  results  the  patient  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.    A  subsequent  sample  collected 
during the follow up visit and assayed at the central laboratory showed persistence of low titer 
FVIII  inhibitors  1.58  BU/mL  with  subsequent  sample  collection  reporting  negative  (<0.6 
BU/mL)  and  resolution  of  event.    There  were  no  concomitant  medications  taken  as  a

consequence  of  the  event  and  the  subject  did  not  experience  any  clinical  manifestations 
associated with the FVIII inhibition.  The investigator and the sponsor considered the event of 
FVIII inhibition to be related to moroctocog alfa (AF CC). 
•  Subject  male  subject  with  severe  hemophilia  A  (FVIII  activity  ≤1%)  had  previously  been 
treated  with  both  OD  FVIII  therapy  and  a  FVIII  RP  regimen  for  a  total  of  362  EDs  prior  to 
entering the study.  This subject was assigned to 45 IU/kg BIW during the first 12 months, and 
then switched to 25 IU/kg EOD for the remainder of the study.  A blood sample obtained during 
the  visit  7  (month  6)  reported  positive  (1.84  BU/mL).    A  subsequent  blood  sample  collected 
during month 9 was reported as positive (3.20 BU/mL) through central laboratory evaluation, 
however,  re-test  of  the  sample  reported  negative  (<0.6  BU/mL)  for  FVIII  inhibitor.    The 
negative  result  was  similarly  reported  through  sample  analysis  at  a  second  laboratory.    A 
further  4  samples  collected  over  an  approximately  4  month  period  were  reported  as  negative 
(<0.6  BU/mL)  through  central  laboratory  evaluation.    The  subject  did  not  experience  any 
clinical manifestations of FVIII inhibitor.  The prophylaxis dose was not increased, no LETE was 
identified and the recovery assessment was reported normal.  In view of the totality of the data 
and  clinical  profile  of  the  subject,  the  sponsor  classified  this  as  a  “false  positive”  for  FVIII 
inhibitor development. 
•  Subject  male  subject  with  severe  haemophilia  A  (FVIII  activity  ≤ 1%)  had  previously  been 
treated  with  a  total  of  >50  EDs  prior  to  receiving  the  first  dose  of  moroctocog  alfa  (AF  CC).  
This subject was assigned to the prophylaxis cohort and received moroctocog alfa (AF CC) 25 
IU/kg EOD during the first 12 months, and then switched to 45 IU/kg BIW for the remainder of 
the study.   A blood sample to test for FVIII inhibitors was obtained on Visit 5 (month 3) and 
reported as positive (1.61 BU/mL) and confirmed through sample re-test (2.11 BU/mL) via the 
central  laboratory.    The  sample  was  re-analysed  at  a  second  laboratory  and  was  reported 
negative  (<0.6  BU/mL)  as  was  the  local  laboratory  result.    Three  (3)  subsequent  samples 
collected  across  a  period  of  approximately  5  months  reported  negative  through  central  and 
local  laboratory  testing.    The  investigator  and  the  sponsor  considered  FVIII  inhibition  was 
related to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC).  The subject did not experience any clinical manifestations 
of FVIII inhibitor.  Indeed the prophylaxis dose was not increased, no LETE was identified, and 
the  recovery  assessment  report  was  normal.    In  view  of  the  totality  of  the  data  and  clinical 
profile  of  the  subject,  the  sponsor  classified  this  event  as  a  “false  positive”  for  FVIII  inhibitor 
development. 
Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram, Physical Findings and Other Observations Related to Safety 
No  clinically  significant  findings  were  reported  for  any  subject  related  to  vital  signs  and  based  on 
physical examination at ED 1. 
Safety Analyses Conclusions 
Overall,  the  median  number  of  infusions  per  subject  was  262,  and  the  median  number  of  EDs  per 
subject was 261. 
No new safety signals were observed for moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during the course of this study.  The 
majority  of  TEAEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity,  and  no  life  threatening  TEAEs  were  reported.  
Severe TEAEs were reported for 8 subjects.  Serious TEAEs were reported for 15 (30.0%) subjects, of 
which  3  led  to  withdrawal  due  to  FVIII  inhibition  and  1  subject  withdrew  due  to  a  SAE  of  drug 
hypersensitivity.    A  further  subject  was  withdrawn  due  to  FVIII  inhibitor  that  was  detected pre-study 
treatment.  No deaths were reported during the study.

Three  (3)  subjects  had  central  laboratory  confirmed  inhibitor  testing  after  beginning  treatment  with 
study drug.  Based on an absence of any clinical signs and symptoms and negative results with repeat 
inhibitor  assessment  of  the  same  samples  in  a  different  central  laboratory,  2  of  the  3  cases  were 
classified  by  the  sponsor  as  false  positive  inhibitors.    The  third  case  was  a  low  titer,  clinically  silent 
FVIII inhibitor that resolved.  A fourth subject had a positive result for low titer FVIII inhibitor prior to 
receiving study drug. 
Overall, the safety profile exhibited in the study would support treatment with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 
in a haemophilia A paediatric population as being well tolerated with no new safety findings detected. 
Discussion and overall conclusions by the MAH 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  prophylaxis 
reduces  the  ABR  relative  to  OD  therapy  in  pediatric  aged  hemophilia  A  patients  with  baseline  FVIII 
<2%.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  effect  of  a  high  (25  IU/kg  EOD)  versus  low  (45 
IU/kg  BIW)-frequency  dosing  schedule  on  the  efficacy  of  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  prophylaxis,  to 
continue to characterize the PK of FVIII:C after administration of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children 
6 months to <16 years of age with hemophilia A, and to describe moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) efficacy 
and  safety  in  children,  including  characterization  of the  incidence of  LETE.  From  Protocol  Amendment 
10,  enrollment  into  the  PK  assessment  was  optional  and  could  also  include  children  aged  6  to  <16 
years;  before  this  date  only  children  aged  6  months  to  <6  years  were  included  in  the  study  (for  all 
assessments). 
The primary objective of this study was met: the prophylaxis regimen at a dose of 25 IU/kg EOD was 
more  efficacious  as  measured  by  ABR  than  OD  treatment.  This  result  is  consistent  with  prior  studies 
with  moroctocog  alfa  and  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  and  shows  for  the  first  time  this  effect  with 
moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  in  a  pediatric  population.  Additionally,  ABR  for  prophylaxis  at  a  dose  of  45 
IU/kg  BIW  was  shown  to  be  equivalent  compared  to  a  more  frequently  administered  prophylaxis 
regimen (25 IU/kg EOD), satisfying a secondary objective. This is the first study to demonstrate that a 
longer  interval  between  prophylactic  infusions  of  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  is  as  effective  as  more 
frequent  dosing  in  a  pediatric  population.  This  offers  patients  with  hemophilia  A  a  treatment  option 
requiring  fewer  infusions,  thus  reducing  the  disease  burden,  which  could  correlate  to  greater 
compliance  and  a  better  quality  of  life.  This  is  especially  beneficial  for  pediatric  patients  in  whom  IV 
access can be challenging. Response to OD infusions for the treatment of bleeding episodes was similar 
to  that  seen  in  prior  studies  with  moroctocog  alfa  and  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  with  the  majority  of 
bleeding episodes responding to 2 or fewer infusions. FVIII recovery was similar to that seen in prior 
studies with young pediatric patients treated with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC). Rates of LETE were similar 
to those seen in prior studies. 
A  PK  analysis  of  FVIII  activity  data  for  5  of  the  7  subjects  included  in  this  study  was  reported  in  a 
previously  completed  interim  analysis.  However,  the  data  were  reanalyzed  using  current  Pfizer 
processes and standards and the results were similar. Although Amendment 10 allowed children aged 
6 to <16 years to be enrolled in the study, none participated in the PK assessment. 
No new safety signals emerged from this study. TEAEs were representative for the pediatric population 
that  was  studied.  One  subject  experienced  drug  hypersensitivity.  The  inhibitor  rate  was  6.12%; 
however, 2 of the 3 cases were deemed to be false positive. Overall, taking into consideration that 2 of 
the  cases  were  assessed  as  false  positive,  the  incidence  and  clinical  significance  of  FVIII  inhibition 
observed in this study is consistent with that seen in prior studies with PTPs with moroctocog alfa and 
moroctocog alfa (AF-CC). 
Taken together, this study met its objectives and has shown that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is safe and 
efficacious in pediatric-aged subjects for both OD treatment and RP. Additionally, it has shown that RP

with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is statistically more efficacious than an OD treatment regimen. The study 
also has shown for the first time that BIW prophylaxis infusions with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) are as 
efficacious as EOD prophylaxis infusions. 
In conclusion the study demonstrated that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduced ABRs relative 
to OD therapy, showed for the first time that BIW prophylaxis infusions with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 
were  as  efficacious  as  EOD  prophylaxis  infusions,  and  demonstrated  the  PK  parameters  observed  in 
this study are similar to those observed in other studies of young patients (<6 years) with hemophilia 
A. The study showed that Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is safe and efficacious in pediatric patients for both 
OD therapy and RP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation by the Rapporteur 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  final  CSR  for  the  completed  paediatric  study;  3082B2-313-WW 
(B1831001); an open label study to evaluate prophylaxis treatment, and to characterise the efficacy, 
safety and pharmacokinetics of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin free in children with 
hemophilia  A.  The  study  was  undertaken  to  fulfil  a  FDA  commitment  with  the  primary  objective  to 
compare  annualised  bleeding  rate  during  on  demand  versus  routine  prophylaxis  and  the  secondary 
objective to compare 2 regimens of prophylaxis with Xyntha, the US approved product. The difference 
between  ReFacto  AF  and  Xyntha  is  the  analytical  method  used  to  calibrate  the  working  potency 
standard that is used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using a one-
stage  assay,  and  the  standard  for  ReFacto  AF  has  been  calibrated  using  a  chromogenic  substrate 
assay.  The two products are not interchangeable. 
It  may  be  agreed  that  the  results  data  support its  objectives  and  has  shown  that  Xyntha  is  safe  and 
efficacious in paediatric-aged subjects for both OD treatment and RP.  
No  new  safety  signals  emerged  from  this  study.    TEAEs  were  representative  for  the  paediatric 
population  that  was  studied.    The  MAH  plans  to  submit  a  type  II  variation  Q1  2019  to  update  the 
ReFacto  AF  SmPC  to  include  the  safety  data  from  this  study  once  this  Article  46  assessment  has 
completed. The MAH will submit an RMP update as part of this type II variation, which will reflect the 
completion  of  studies  3082B2-313-WW  (B1831001)  and  B1831007.  This  submission  also  fulfils  MEA 
116.

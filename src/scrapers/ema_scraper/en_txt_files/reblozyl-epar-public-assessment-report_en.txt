2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)  
MDS are a group of clonal bone marrow (BM) neoplasms, which represent the most common class of 
acquired BM failure syndromes in adults (Ades, 2014; Bejar, 2014). Myelodysplastic syndromes are 
characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis, in which haematopoietic progenitor cells have reduced 
ability to differentiate and increased likelihood of apoptosis (Ades, 2014; Foran, 2012). This manifests 
in abnormal ‘dysplastic’ cell morphology in one or more haematopoietic cell lines and development of 
peripheral cytopenias (Ades, 2014; Bejar, 2014; Foran, 2012). 
In approximately 30% of patients with MDS, abnormal cell morphology/biology results in the potential 
for clonal evolution and development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Bejar, 2014; da Silva-Coelho, 
2017). 
In the MDS Multicentre Registry study, the median time of survival from diagnosis was 75 months 
(range, 1.7 to 350 months). The 2- and 5-year survival probabilities were 86% and 61%, respectively. 
Transfusion-dependent (TD) patients had a median survival of 44 months compared to 97 months for 
transfusion-independent patients (Germing, 2012).  
β-Thalassaemia 
The β-thalassaemias are a group of inherited disorders characterised by absent or reduced production 
of the β-globin chains of haemoglobin (Hgb), the oxygen-carrying molecule in human RBCs. There are 
two beta globin genes (one on each chromosome). The mutations can result in reduced expression 
(beta+) or complete absence of expression (beta0) of the β-globin chains. The severity of disease 
correlates with the imbalance between alpha and beta globin chains. Because beta globin expression 
begins during infancy (gamma globin is the beta-like chain used in foetal and early infant 
haemoglobins), the thalassaemia phenotype generally begins to manifest during the first year of life 
(typical age of presentation, four to six months). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MDS 
An analysis of 64 cancer registries from European countries indicates that the incidence of MDS was 
1.5 per 100,000 individuals per year in 1995–2002 (Visser, 2012). Data from the Dusseldorf registry in 
Germany suggest that the crude incidence of MDS in 2002–2005 was approximately 4 per 100,000 
person-years (3.40 for MDS as defined by World Health Organization [WHO] subtypes versus 4.15 
using French-American-British [FAB] classification) (Neukirchen, 2011). The annual incidence of MDS 
reported by the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) in the UK between 2010 and 
2016 is 3.5 per 100,000 (HMRN, 2019). Incidence of MDS extracted from population-based registries 
such as SEER in the US and similar databases worldwide may not accurately capture the true number 
of MDS cases due to underdiagnoses and underreporting (Cogle, 2011). 
12 
 
Data consistently demonstrate that MDS is most commonly diagnosed in patients with a median age at 
diagnosis in the seventh decade (Ma, 2012; Neukirchen, 2011) and is reported more frequently in men 
versus women (Ma, 2007; Neukirchen, 2011; Visser, 2012). 
β-Thalassaemia 
Large-scale epidemiologic studies of patients with β-thalassemia are lacking. Most available 
epidemiologic data have been estimated using carrier frequency rates determined in screening 
programs, or stem from expert opinion of researchers conducting large-scale observational studies. 
About 80 to 90 million people (~1.5% of the global population) are carriers of β-thalassaemia with 
approximately 60,000 symptomatic individuals born annually (Modell, 2007). The annual incidence of 
symptomatic individuals is estimated at 1 in 100,000 worldwide and 1 in 10,000 in the European Union 
(EU) (Galanello, 2010). Incidence is highest in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, North 
America and South East Asia (particularly India, China, Thailand and Indonesia; this region accounts 
for approximately 50% of affected births). 
The highest prevalence of the structural variant HgbE is observed in the Indian subcontinent and East 
and Southeast Asia, where carrier frequencies may reach as high as 80% (Olivieri, 2010; Weatherall, 
2005; Weatherall, 2010). Haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia currently affects around 1,000,000 people 
worldwide (Olivieri, 2011) and more than 19,000 affected children are born each year, half of them 
having TD β-thalassaemia (Modell, 2008; Weatherall, 2010). It should also be noted that, in view of 
continued migration, β-thalassaemia is now also becoming increasingly common in large multi-ethnic 
cities in Europe and North America, as evident from newborn screening programs (Harteveld, 2010; 
Lorey, 2000; Lorey, 2001; National Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme, 2018; Piel, 
2016). Thalassaemia today continues to pose a public health concern owing to its chronic disease 
burden and need for long-term management (Weatherall, 2010). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
MDS 
The cause of MDS is known only in 15% of cases (Ades, 2014; Fenaux, 2014). In approximately 30% 
of pediatric patients with MDS, the disease is due to an inherited predisposition, such as Down’s 
syndrome, Fanconi anaemia, and neurofibromatosis (Ades, 2014; Fenaux, 2014). In adult patients 
without inherited predisposition, MDS may be attributed to a number of factors, including older age, 
prior treatment with chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy, and exposure to environmental irritants 
(Ades, 2014; Fenaux, 2014; Foran, 2012). Advanced age is the single greatest risk factor (Sekeres, 
2010). 
An abnormal karyotype is observed in approximately 40% to 60% of de novo MDS cases and 50% to 
80% of cases in which prior therapy resulted in MDS (Ades, 2014; Bejar, 2014; Haase, 2007; Visconte, 
2014a). Unlike AML, MDS is characterised by partial or complete loss or gain of chromosomes, the 
most frequent being: deleted 5q; −7 or deleted 7q; +8; deleted 20q; and deleted 17p (Ades, 2014). 
The chromosomal abnormality del(5q) leads to haplo-insufficiency of a variable number of genes 
according to the extent of the deleted region (Ades, 2014) and is one of the best understood 
pathogenic mechanisms in MDS. 
Almost 80% of patients with MDS carry at least one mutation in one gene (Papaemmanuil, 2013). 
While founder mutations drive asymptomatic local expression, further mutations acquired within a 
clone will subsequently impair normal haematopoiesis, alter blood counts, and ultimately result in overt 
MDS (Kennedy, 2017; Papaemmanuil, 2013). Indeed, genomic instability (genetic defects, mutations) 
increases the propensity to develop AML (Papaemmanuil, 2013; Visconte, 2014a). 
13 
 
β-Thalassaemia 
The β-thalassaemias are a group of inherited disorders characterised by absent or reduced production 
of the β-globin chains of haemoglobin (Hgb). Mutations in the β-globin gene can be passed on from 
each of the 2 carrier parents to affected offspring in a recessive Mendelian manner. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
MDS 
Many patients with MDS are asymptomatic; the lack of specific symptoms among patients with lower-
risk MDS is a major diagnostic challenge (Foran, 2012). Diagnosis is often made during assessment of 
comorbidities, when peripheral blood or bone marrow (BM) features associated with MDS are revealed. 
Differential diagnosis is informed by the patient’s medication history; exclusion of diseases, such as 
autoimmune disorders, renal failure, malignancies, chronic infections or inflammations, aplastic 
anaemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, is also important (Fenaux, 2014). 
The clinical presentation of MDS is heterogeneous and varies depending on the subtype and severity of 
the cytopenia (Foran, 2012). Anaemia is the most common peripheral erythroid maturation defect, 
occurring in 80% to 85% of cases (Steensma, 2006). Many patients with MDS who develop anaemia, 
particularly those with Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) lower-risk MDS 
(approximately 40%), become transfusion dependent (Zeidan, 2013; Ades, 2014). Thrombocytopenia 
is observed in 30% to 45% of patients with MDS and neutropenia in 40% of patients (Steensma, 
2006). Symptoms are usually nonspecific but may be suggestive of the cytopenia involved. Fatigue and 
a decline in activities of daily living or quality of life (QoL) are indicative of anaemia. Recurrent 
infections may be related to neutropenia, and frequent and unexplained bruising or bleeding is 
suggestive of thrombocytopenia (Ades, 2014; Foran, 2012; Toma, 2012). 
Patients with higher-risk MDS present with more severe symptoms (Foran, 2012). Analysis of the BM 
and blood samples is central to the diagnosis (Ades, 2014; Fenaux, 2014) and facilitates the exclusion 
of non-MDS causes of cytopenias (Ades, 2014; Bejar, 2014; Zini, 2017). Analysis of somatic mutations 
and flow cytometry analysis of BM cells can be useful when a diagnosis of MDS is uncertain (Fenaux, 
2014).

As the adult human Hgb molecule is made up of two α- and 2 β-globin chains, the reduced synthesis of 
β-globin in patients with β-thalassaemia leads to an imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio. 
Accumulation of excess unpaired α-globin chains leads to formation of hemichromes and inclusion 
bodies, and premature death of RBCs and their precursors in the bone marrow and peripheral 
circulation. This process, termed ineffective erythropoiesis, results in a state of chronic anaemia and 
subsequent pathophysiologic mechanisms involving iron accumulation in vital organs, resulting in 
significant clinical co-morbidities in affected patients (Taher, 2018). 
Patients with TD β-thalassaemia (which includes conventional β-thalassaemia major and severe forms 
of HgbE/β-thalassaemia) commonly come to clinical attention in early childhood (before 2 years of 
age) with severe anaemia (< 7 g/dL). These patients require life-long, regular blood transfusion 
therapy. Patients with NTD β-thalassemia (which includes conventional β-thalassemia intermedia and 
mild to moderate forms of HgbE/β-thalassemia) present later in childhood or adolescence with mild to 
moderate anaemia and require no or only occasional transfusions in instances of blood loss or 
worsening anaemia due to periods of physiological stress (e.g., during infections, surgery, or 
pregnancy).  
14 
 
Patients with thalassaemia intermedia invariably develop increasing clinical complications from β-
thalassaemia, such as thrombotic events or pulmonary hypertension and can become transfusion 
dependent during their lifetime, regardless of whether they required transfusions earlier in life 
(Guidelines Management of Non Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia, 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
MDS 
The main clinical guidance for the management of MDS in Europe is the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) (Fenaux, 2014). Management of patients with MDS differs depending on the ultimate 
goal of treatment for each individual (Zeidan, 2013; Zeidan, 2017). Treatment of MDS is complicated 
by the advanced age of the affected population and, thus, high incidence of comorbid conditions and 
relative inability of patients to tolerate intensive treatment approaches (Greenberg, 2017). In addition, 
there is a growing role for consideration of genetic and epigenetic lesions in therapeutic decision-
making. 
• 
Patients with lower-risk MDS have a lower likelihood of AML progression and a longer survival 
expectancy (Fenaux, 2014); management of this population is focused on treating cytopenias 
(predominantly anaemia) and optimising QoL (Fenaux, 2014). 
• 
Patients with higher-risk MDS are at greater risk of progression to AML and have shorter 
survival expectancy (Fenaux, 2014). Consequently, the aim of treatment in this population is to modify 
the natural disease course (Fenaux, 2014). 
All patients with MDS receive supportive care (NCCN, 2018), which may include blood transfusions, 
clinical monitoring, management of iron overload, QoL assessment, and psychosocial support (Fenaux, 
2014; NCCN, 2018). 
Treatment of IPSS-R Lower-risk Patients with MDS 
The main focus of management in patients with IPSS-R lower-risk MDS is the treatment of 
cytopenia(s) and the improvement of QoL (Fenaux, 2014). The specific treatment approach will differ 
according to the type of cytopenia(s) observed, and there are benefits and challenges associated with 
currently available first-line treatment options. The majority (80% to 85%) of patients with MDS 
develop anaemia (Steensma, 2006). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the first-line 
treatment option for anaemia in lower-risk MDS patients without del(5q) (Fenaux, 2014; NCCN, 2018). 
Despite an initial response to ESA treatment, approximately 70% of patients will become unresponsive 
to ESAs (Park, 2017). Careful monitoring for disease progression and consideration of the patient’s 
preferences remain important factors in the tailoring of treatment in this population (NCCN, 2018). 
Erythropoiesis-stimulating Agents 
As anaemia is the most common cytopenia among patients with lower-risk MDS (Steensma, 2006), it 
tends to be the focus of treatment in this population (Fenaux, 2013; Fenaux, 2014). Erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents, with or without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), are used in patients 
with lower-risk MDS without del(5q) (Fenaux, 2014; NCCN, 2018). The major favourable prognostic 
factors for response to ESAs are low (< 2 units/month) or no RBC transfusion requirement and 
baseline serum EPO level < 500 U/L (Fenaux, 2013). The European ESA Scoring System uses a serum 
EPO level of ≤ 200 U/L as a prognostic factor for ESA responsiveness (Santini, 2013). Despite an initial 
response to ESA treatment, approximately 70% of patients become unresponsive to ESAs (Park, 
2017). 
15 
 
Erythroblast differentiation and maturation during late-stage erythropoiesis is independent of the effect 
of erythropoietin (Eshghi, 2007; Hattangadi, 2011). Mutations in SF3B1 can cause impaired late-stage 
RBC differentiation (Obeng, 2016).  
There are limited treatment options for lower-risk MDS patients who fail treatment with ESAs or have 
poor prognostic factors of response to ESAs (Santini, 2016). The second-line treatment options are 
restricted to anti-lymphocyte globulin and anti-thymocyte globulin (immunosuppressive therapies) in 
the < 60 to 65-year age category, and azacitidine and lenalidomide, both of which are 
myelosuppressants. Outcomes remain suboptimal despite the use of these second-line treatment 
options, and many patients will ultimately require long-term RBC transfusions (Fenaux, 2014; NCCN, 
2018).  
Lenalidomide 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is recommended treatment of lower-risk patients with MDS with del(5q) 
(Fenaux, 2014; NCCN, 2018). In Europe, lenalidomide is indicated for use in adult patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with an isolated 
deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate 
(Revlimid SmPC, 2019). Lenalidomide in MDS patients with del(5q) yields RBC-transfusion 
independence (RBC-TI) in two-thirds of this population for a median duration of 2 to 3 years, and 
cytogenetic responses in 50% to 70% of patients (Ades, 2014). The most common Grade 3 or 4 
adverse events included myelosuppression (neutropenia, 55%; thrombocytopenia, 44%) that often 
requires treatment interruption or dose reduction (NCCN, 2018). 
Red Blood Cell Transfusions 
RBC transfusion forms the mainstay of treatment in patients with lower-risk MDS and anaemia. Many 
patients become transfusion dependent, which is associated with increased morbidity, a reduced QoL, 
and high social burden (Fenaux, 2013; Hellström-Lindberg, 2013; Platzbecker, 2012). 
There is no internationally recognised haemoglobin level threshold below which transfusion should be 
given, and the use of transfusion should be tailored to the individual patient based on comorbidities 
(e.g., lung and cardiac function, the individual’s level of physical activity) (Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2013). 
Guidelines based on expert opinion, such as those provided by ESMO, recommend administering 
transfusions at haemoglobin levels starting in the 8 to 10 g/dL range, since patients with comorbidities, 
poor functional tolerance, or poor QoL may experience significant clinical benefit from transfusions 
(Fenaux, 2014).  
Red blood cell transfusions are time consuming, can have a deleterious effect on a patient’s social 
functioning, increase the patient’s dependence on the medical system, affecting the use of hospital 
resources and the supply of RBC concentrates (Fenaux, 2013; Hellström-Lindberg, 2013; Platzbecker, 
2012). Chronic transfusions lead to secondary iron overload. The relatively long survival of low- and 
intermediate-risk MDS groups (Greenberg, 2006; Valent, 2007) places them at an increased risk of 
damage by iron overload from prolonged red blood cell transfusions compared to high-risk patients 
with a markedly reduced survival (Steensma, 2006). The MDS population consists mainly of elderly 
patients with comorbid conditions and a propensity to develop cardiac failure, infection, haemorrhage, 
and hepatic cirrhosis; iron overload may exacerbate these pre-existing conditions (Malcovati, 2005). 
Iron Chelation Therapy 
Iron chelation may be required in patients receiving frequent transfusions in order to avoid iron-related 
cardiac, hepatic, and endocrine toxicities (Fenaux, 2014; Platzbecker, 2012; Steensma, 2013). As 
such, monitoring of the number of RBC transfusions, cardiac function with magnetic resonance 
imaging, and serum ferritin levels is recommended (NCCN, 2018). 
16 
 
There is a lack of consensus on the use of iron chelation in patients with lower-risk MDS. Initiation of 
iron chelation is generally recommended in management guidelines although specific treatment 
thresholds and prescribing practice vary (Fenaux, 2014; NCCN, 2018). Guidelines generally advocate 
starting iron chelation in patients with a relatively favourable prognosis (e.g., IPSS low- or 
intermediate-1-risk MDS), who have received 20 to 60 RBC concentrates, or if serum ferritin rises 
above 1000 U/L (Bennett, 2008; Fenaux, 2014; Malcovati, 2013). 
Unmet Medical Need 
The majority (80% to 85%) of patients with MDS develop anaemia (Steensma, 2006). Erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents are the first-line treatment option for anaemia in lower-risk patients with MDS 
without del(5q); lenalidomide is the recommended treatment for patients with del(5q) (Fenaux, 2014; 
NCCN, 2018). Despite an initial response to ESA treatment, approximately 70% of patients will become 
unresponsive to ESAs (Park, 2017). In addition, ESAs are less effective in patients with either 
endogenous EPO level ≥ 200 U/L or those requiring RBC transfusion of ≥ 2 units/month.  
Treatment options remain suboptimal in the lower-risk MDS patients who are not eligible or no longer 
respond to ESAs, and many patients will ultimately require long-term RBC transfusions (Fenaux, 2014; 
NCCN, 2018). Red blood cell-transfusion dependence and lower haemoglobin levels have been 
associated with a deleterious impact on outcomes and increased mortality in patients with MDS 
(Platzbecker, 2012; Fenaux, 2013; Hellström-Lindberg, 2013). 
β-Thalassaemia 
In patients with TD β-thalassemia, transfusion and iron chelation therapy (ICT) have been the 
mainstay of therapy from childhood to adulthood. The objective of disease management in TD and NTD 
β-thalassemia is to prevent the development or progression of serious and irreversible morbidities as 
patients transition to adulthood, through interventions targeting the key pathophysiologic mechanisms 
of ineffective erythropoiesis, anaemia, and iron overload. The current wider scope of management also 
includes monitoring for and treatment of specific clinical complications as well as lifestyle modifications, 
and psychosocial therapy. As such, management of patients requires close monitoring and regular 
follow up from early childhood throughout adulthood through multidisciplinary teams from various 
medical specialties (Cappellini, 2014a; Taher, 2013a; Taher, 2018). 
Transfusion Therapy 
Transfusion works by supplying normal erythrocytes and thus decreasing the demand for 
erythropoiesis, ultimately suppressing ineffective erythropoiesis and its associated pathophysiology.  
Management guidelines recommend initiation of regular transfusion therapy in patients with TD β-
thalassemia with a total Hgb level of < 7 g/dL (in the absence of infection) or > 7 g/dL, but with poor 
growth and development, aiming at a pre-transfusion Hgb target of 9 to 10.5 g/dL (11 to 12 g/dL in 
those with heart disease) (Cappellini, 2014a; Musallam, 2013a).  
The main challenge with regular transfusion therapy is secondary iron overload. Transfusional iron 
overload causes significant morbidity and mortality. In patients with TD β-thalassemia, iron 
accumulation in vital organs such as the liver and heart is evident in children aged as young as 2 and 6 
years, respectively (Berdoukas, 2013; Borgna-Pignatti, 2014a; Wood, 2008; Yang, 2014), with 
cumulative iron overload subsequently leading to organ dysfunction in the heart, liver, and endocrine 
glands (Cappellini, 2014a). Iron-related cardiomyopathy has been the leading cause of death in 
patients with TD β-thalassemia (Borgna-Pignatti, 2004; Cappellini, 2014a), and mortality from liver 
disease is also increasing (Voskaridou, 2012). 
17 
 
 
 
Iron Chelation Therapy 
In view of the detrimental effects of iron overload in patients with TD β-thalassemia (secondary, via 
transfusions) and NTD β-thalassemia (primary, via intestinal absorption), prompt diagnosis and 
management are essential in these patient populations.  
Three iron chelators are currently approved for the treatment of iron overload in patients with TD β-
thalassemia: Deferoxamine in SC or intravenous injection, oral deferiprone in tablet or solution form, 
and oral deferasirox in dispersible tablet and, more recently, film-coated tablet forms (Cappellini, 
2014a; Musallam, 2013a; Taher, 2018). Although progress in ICT was associated with clear 
improvement in survival in long-term follow-up studies evaluating different birth cohorts of patients 
with TD β-thalassemia (Borgna-Pignatti, 2004; Modell, 2000), the situation is not yet ideal. Recent 
data from a large global sample of patients with TD β-thalassemia (N = ~1000) showed that over half 
of patients continue to show high-risk iron overload levels in the heart and liver, reflecting that optimal 
control of iron overload in the global population of TD β-thalassemia has not yet been achieved 
(Aydinok, 2015).  
All available chelators are also associated with several adverse events (AEs) (e.g. ocular, auditory, 
bone growth retardation, local reactions, allergy and gastrointestinal, arthralgia, agranulocytosis/ 
neutropenia, increased creatinine, increased hepatic enzymes). Although these AEs are usually non-
serious and manageable, they require close clinical and laboratory monitoring (e.g., neutrophil count, 
creatinine, and hepatic enzymes), which remains cumbersome in a chronic disease with lifelong 
therapy (Cappellini, 2014a; Musallam, 2013a; Taher, 2018). Additionally, ensuring adherence to ICT is 
essential as it correlates with both effective management and patient survival (Delea, 2007a; Gabutti, 
1996). 
The limitations in efficacy, safety, and adherence are also coupled with poor access to, or affordability 
of, oral ICT, especially in resource-constrained countries where the disease is most prevalent.  
Splenectomy 
Although not supported by data from clinical trials, splenectomy has been performed traditionally as an 
alternate or adjunct to transfusion therapy in certain patients for improvement of Hgb concentration, 
growth, and quality of life (Premawardhena, 2005). Splenectomy has become almost obsolete in 
patients with TD β-thalassemia (Piga, 2011), but the procedure is still used sporadically in patients 
with NTD β-thalassemia to “boost” Hgb levels (Musallam, 2012b; Olivieri, 2012; Olivieri, 2008; Taher, 
2011; Vichinsky, 2012). Recent guideline recommendations, however, have restricted the use of 
splenectomy to patients who are unable to receive transfusion and ICT, as well as those with clinically 
symptomatic splenomegaly or hypersplenism (Cappellini, 2014a; Taher, 2013a).  
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only available curative therapy for patients with 
β-thalassaemia. Almost 90% of patients with TD β-thalassaemia who undergo HSCT at experienced 
centres in Europe now survive, with 2-year disease-free survival rates of > 80% (Baronciani, 2016). 
Availability of matched donors remains a key limitation (available in only ~20% to 25% of cases) 
(Angelucci, 2014; Cappellini, 2014a). Moreover, several factors continue to limit the acceptability of 
HSCT: an overall mortality risk of 12% within 2 years of transplantation, acute and chronic graft 
versus host disease and graft failure, and the need for complete myeloablation that can result in 
infertility and other toxicities (Baronciani, 2016; Cappellini, 2014a; Taher, 2013a). The best clinical 
outcomes of HSCT are reported in patients with TD β-thalassemia aged < 14 years at transplantation 
(Baronciani, 2016); this is likely due to older patients having existing morbidity related to iron overload 
and other complications (Higgs, 2012). The use of unrelated donors and umbilical cord blood are not 
uncommon, but still mostly experimental. 
18 
 
Zynteglo 
In May 2019, Zynteglo has been approved in the EU, for the treatment of patients 12 years and older 
with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia who do not have a β0/β0 genotype and for whom HSCT is 
appropriate, but an HLA matched related HSC donor is not available. 
Unmet Medical Need 
There is no available therapy approved or widely used to address the underlying ineffective 
erythropoiesis and anaemia of β-thalassemia, the source of clinical morbidity and diminished quality of 
life. In patients with TD β-thalassemia, transfusion and ICT have shown a clear survival benefit. 
However, administration of regular and chronic transfusion therapy continues to pose challenges for 
patients’ quality of life, also presenting a public health burden. Challenges with access and affordability 
of transfusion exist especially in resource-constrained countries. Moreover, transfusional iron overload 
necessitates iron overload monitoring and ICT. The efficacy and safety of current iron chelators are not 
ideal, with persisting challenges in adherence, access, and affordability. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an established option in patients with TD β-thalassemia, but 
its use is limited to small groups of younger patients with available matched donors who can tolerate 
the procedure. Splenectomy is primarily restricted to patients with splenomegaly or hypersplenism 
because of the high risk of infections and vascular disease following the procedure.  
Clearly, there is an unmet need for the development of novel therapies that can ameliorate the 
ineffective erythropoiesis and anaemia of β-thalassemia, and subsequently prevent the development of 
morbidity and poor quality of life. 
About the product 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a recombinant fusion protein that binds selectively to transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands (e.g., GDF-11, 
activin B), luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid maturation through 
differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 
signalling is abnormally high in disease models characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, i.e., 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and β-thalassemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. 
MDS-associated anaemia  
The initially claimed indication was “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
anaemia requiring transfusions due to very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
(MDS), who have ring sideroblasts and loss or lack of response to, are ineligible for, or intolerant to 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy”.  
The indication was later slightly amended to “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for 
erythropoietin-based therapy (see section 5.1). 
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
The initially claimed indication was ‘Reblozyl is indicated for treatment of adult patients with anaemia 
requiring transfusions due to beta thalassaemia (β thalassaemia).’ 
This was changed during assessment to “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1)” to more 
adequately reflect the target population. 
19 
 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The global clinical development program for luspatercept consists of a total of 9 clinical studies across 
3 different disease states: myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), β-thalassaemia, and myelofibrosis.  
Of these studies, 3 are included in the global clinical development program for MDS, all of which are 
ongoing and provide efficacy and safety data for this submission. These studies include a pivotal Phase 
3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ACE-536-MDS-001; MEDALIST) and 2 
supportive Phase 2, open-label, single-arm studies (multiple ascending-dose base Study A536-03 and 
extension Study A536-05). Efficacy and safety data through the clinical data cut-off date for each 
study are included in this submission, including at least 48 weeks of double-blind treatment data in 
Study ACE-536-MDS-001. 
4 studies are included in the global clinical development program for β-thalassaemia, 3 of which have 
completed enrolment and provide efficacy and safety data for this submission. These studies include a 
pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (ACE-536-B-THAL-001; BELIEVE) and 2 supportive, 
sequential Phase 2, open-label, single-arm studies (multiple ascending-dose base Study A536-04 and 
extension Study A536-06). Study A536-04 is complete; the long-term extension Phase 2 Study A536-
06 is ongoing for a total treatment duration of up to 5 years; and the long-term extension Phase 3 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 is ongoing until all subjects initially assigned to luspatercept in the double-
blind treatment phase complete a total treatment duration of 5 years from first dose. Efficacy and 
safety data through the clinical data cut-off data for each study are included in this submission, 
including at least 48 weeks of double-blind treatment data in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001. 
MDS 
In the development of the study design, Appendix 4 to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer 
Medicinal Products in Man (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012, dated 13 Dec 2012) was taken into account. 
Celgene also received scientific advice on the Phase 3 MDS study design from the Medicines Evaluation 
Board (MEB; Netherlands) on 28 Jul 2015 and from the Medical Products Agency (MPA; Sweden) on 26 
Aug 2015. The final study design of Study ACE-536-MDS-001 was amended to incorporate the advice 
received from both agencies on the proposed patient population, stratification factors, randomization, 
the placebo comparator arm, primary and key secondary endpoints, the statistical analysis plan, and 
the proposed long-term follow up period. 
β-Thalassaemia 
Scientific advice from the CHMP was given in June 2015 (EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III). Key 
feedback was received on the antidrug antibody (ADA) testing plan and the β-thalassemia clinical 
development plan, specifically the design of the TD Phase 3 study (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001) that 
provides pivotal clinical data to support the use of luspatercept as a treatment for β-thalassemia in this 
Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). The key points raised by the CHMP on the immunogenicity 
testing plan for luspatercept were incorporated into the testing plan for the studies and the 
immunogenicity risk management strategy. 
In addition, the applicant received EMA Scientific advice concerning the CMC development 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716191/2017) in September 2017. The questions addressed the introduction of a 
new working cell bank (WCB2), the data package for the change from Fiolax to TopLyo vials as primary 
container closure system for drug product, the robustness studies for drug product lyophilisation 
progress, the proposals for drug substance and drug product manufacturing process validation, the 
approach to establish the control strategy, and finally the control strategy for N-glycans. In general, 
the recommendations given in this advice have been taken into account; appropriate information to 
address the concerns raised in the scientific advice has been included into the dossier.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for solution for injection containing 25 mg or 75 mg of 
luspatercept as active substance. After reconstitution, each mL of solution contains 50 mg 
luspatercept. 
Other ingredients are: citric acid monohydrate (E330), sodium citrate (E331), polysorbate 80, sucrose, 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) as described in SmPC 
section 6.1.  
The product is available in 3 mL Type I glass vial with a hydrophobic inner coating closed with a 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal with yellow or orange (for the 25 mg and the 75 mg 
strength respectively) polypropylene flip-off cap, as described in the SmPC section 6.5. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of two identical chains, each consisting of the 
modified form of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) linked to 
the human IgG1 Fc domain (including the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) through a linker. 
The average molecular mass calculated using the most abundant glycoform observed on each N-
glycosylation site and the most abundant form of O-glycan occupancy is 94kDa.  A list of 
physicochemical and other relevant properties of the active substance, including the mode-of-action is 
given.  
Luspatercept binds selectively to TGF-β superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands 
(e.g., GDF-11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid maturation 
through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 
signalling is abnormally high in disease models characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis, i.e. 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and β-thalassemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing of the active substance takes place at Lonza Biologics Tuas Pte Ltd located in 
Singapore. 
The process is typical for a monoclonal antibody/recombinant fusion protein with the Fc domain of an 
IgG1: The commercial manufacturing process begins with the thawing of a single vial from the Working 
Cell Bank. The cell culture is expanded in a series of shake flasks followed by further expansion in cell 
bags. The contents of the cell culture bags are used to inoculate a production bioreactor. The 
production bioreactor conditions  and nutrient feeds are monitored and controlled. The culture is 
clarified using depth filtration into a bioprocess container, where it is held prior to further downstream 
processing. Information on the culture duration and agitation speed were provided. 
The downstream process includes three chromatography steps, low pH viral inactivation, viral filtration, 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) and final filtration/bulk fill/freezing steps. Luspatercept is stored at 
≤ -65°C. The pooling strategy for the chromatography fractions in the downstream process was 
21 
 
sufficiently explained. The batch numbering system has been explained and the batch and scale 
definition is given. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the production process have been listed and their quality grade is provided. 
Compendial materials are tested to the referenced compendia whereas for non-compendial raw 
materials in-house specifications are in place. The composition of buffers, solutions and cell culture 
media is given.   
Concerning the source, history, and generation of the cell substrate sufficient information on the origin, 
culture and storage conditions of the host cell line has been included in the dossier. A master cell bank 
(MCB) was manufactured from a research cell bank, consistent with current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMPs) and the relevant ICH guidelines. From this master cell bank, two working cell banks 
have been generated and were used for the production of early clinical batches and for process 
validation and post validation batches. 
Both working cell banks as well as the master cell bank have been extensively characterised and tested 
for safety. A protocol for the preparation of a replacement of working cell banks has been provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process parameters and critical process parameters as well as in-process controls (IPCs) and critical in-
process controls together with their acceptable ranges or action limits have been provided in a 
tabulated overview. No IPCs have been established with respect to purity during the purification, this 
strategy was appropriately justified. The Applicant indicated that in case of exceeding acceptance limits 
or action limits investigations on possible root causes and the impact of the deviation on the affected 
batch will be initiated. It was further clarified how excursions of critical in-process controls will be 
managed. Excursions that lead to batch rejection have been listed. The applicant was asked to perform 
an evaluation of proline supplementation to improve process robustness as part of lifecycle 
management.  This evaluation will be provided once available; this strategy is supported. 
Process validation 
Process validation was performed on consecutive process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. The 
process parameters and in-process control ranges used in the validation were based on protocols with 
pre-established ranges. Process validation was performed and confirmed that the active substance 
manufacturing process can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce an active substance 
meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. This conclusion is further supported by 
batch data from other post-PPQ batches which met all release criteria. A few deviations which occurred 
during validation activities have been sufficiently explained and the root cause has been identified, 
corrective actions have been implemented and the potential impact on product quality and process 
consistency could be excluded. Thus, the observed deviations do not jeopardize the validity of the 
conducted process performance qualification. Following the execution of process validation, process 
parameters and in-process controls were re-evaluated and certain changes were made leading to the 
commercial process parameters and in-process controls. These changes are considered to enhance the 
commercial control strategy and, since the PPQ batches meet the acceptance criteria for the post-PPQ 
changes, do not impact the validated status of the process. 
In addition to the process validation, supportive studies including lifetime studies of the ultrafiltration 
membranes and the chromatography resins, impurity clearance, stability/hold time studies of process 
intermediates and shipping qualification studies have been conducted. Regarding the chromatography 
22 
 
 
resin lifetime studies the maximal numbers of cycles have been defined and process parameters set 
based on appropriate studies; overall the information provided in this respect is deemed satisfactory. 
Finally, the validation of reprocessing for a unit operation will be considered complete when a minimum 
of one reprocessed run has been executed successfully at the commercial scale. This approach is in 
line with the relevant EMA guideline on process validation.  
Manufacturing process development 
Product critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been identified via a risk assessment including both 
impact and uncertainty of the knowledge affecting efficacy and safety. Process characterisation started 
with an initial risk assessment for each unit operation to identify process parameters for evaluation in 
process characterisation studies. These parameters were assessed based on their potential impact on 
CQAs. For each unit operation, a subset of parameters was selected for univariate, multivariate, and 
excursion studies. The impact of the process parameters on product quality attributes based on risk 
assessment, results from process characterisation and validation studies is summarised in a graphical 
layout for each single process manufacturing step. The approach for process characterisation is 
endorsed.   
The two production scale bioreactors used at the manufacturing site for the production of the active 
substance were qualified for commercial production of luspatercept during validation with successful 
PPQ batches. Equivalency of the two bioreactors was assessed and confirmed. 
The process development starting from Process I, the changes leading to Process II and later to an 
early Process III, and finally to the intended commercial version of Process III together with the 
rationale for the process changes has been sufficiently described. After each development step a 
separate comparability study has been conducted. Data from these comparability studies indicate a 
comparable quality profile of luspatercept produced via the different process versions. In addition, the 
change fromone WCB to another has been investigated by comparison of process performance 
parameters which indicate a comparable process performance. 
Characterisation  
Concerning the elucidation of structure and other characteristics a panel of standard and state-of-the-
art methods have been used to characterise the physicochemical as well as biological quality attributes 
of the luspatercept molecule. Various orthogonal techniques were used to study the primary structure, 
carbohydrate structure, higher order structure, the mass, size and charge heterogeneity, and the 
biological activity. In addition, a number of structure-function relationship studies have been 
performed which provide further inside in degradation pathways and the criticality of structural 
changes. The characterisation work was done with the process performance qualification batches as 
well as with clinical batches derived from the intended commercial version of the active substance 
manufacturing process. Further information on the qualification status of the characterisation methods 
has been provided. In addition, possible misfolded forms/incorrect disulfide bonding structures, the 
Pro-Ala exchange, and the relationship between deamidation and the charged variant profile of heat-
stressed samples have been discussed.  
Regarding the impurities, a comprehensive discussion on potential process and product-specific 
impurities as well as on potential elemental impurities in luspatercept has been provided. For process-
specific impurities clearance studies have been conducted in the course of process validation. 
Clearance of process-specific impurities has been shown on a number of luspatercept batches. These 
studies demonstrate a robust removal of process-specific impurities by the purification process. This 
conclusion is further supported by additional spiking studies which have been performed for a subset of 
process-related impurities. Taken together, sufficient evidence is provided that the manufacturing 
process is capable of consistently removing process-specific impurities to sufficient low levels. 
23 
 
Therefore, it is agreeable that no in-process or release testing of process-related impurities are 
needed. Product-related impurities have been extensively investigated in structure-function 
relationship studies in which luspatercept has been exposed to different stress factors. In addition, 
clearance of high and low molecular weight species has been studied during process validation 
activities. Furthermore, for high molecular weight species an additional spiking study has been 
conducted. As for the process-related impurities sufficient evidence is provided that the manufacturing 
process is capable of consistently removing product-specific impurities to sufficient low levels. This 
conclusion is also supported by the available batch release data, which confirm that the luspatercept 
manufacturing process consistently delivers material of high purity. Finally, potential elemental 
impurities have been addressed via a risk assessment according to ICH Q3D. The conclusion that the 
overall risk of elemental impurities in active substance is low and thus, no routine testing for these 
impurities is required is agreed. 
Specification 
The updated release specifications include tests for identity, protein concentration, purity and 
impurities, potency as well as tests for general quality attributes. 
Concerning the acceptance limits, the provided justifications for each specification are considered 
acceptable and so are the justifications for parameters omitted such as glycosylation and osmolality. 
The release specifications for Luspatercept active substance are considered acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions for the non-compendial methods were provided. Of note, a tabulated overview of 
method changes during the clinical development has been also provided. Bridging studies to compare 
the old versus the new methods have been conducted and support these changes.  
Non-compendial methods have been validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1) whereas compendial 
methods have been verified. The analytical methods for commercial release and stability testing are 
considered suitable for their intended use. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release data from 35 batches of luspatercept produced with different process versions have been 
provided. The release data complied with the release specifications in place at the time of testing and 
indicate a batch-to-batch consistency.  
Reference materials 
No national or international reference standard is available for luspatercept. Thus, internal reference 
standards have been established; the standards were representative for material used in the 
respective development phase where the standards were being used. A link between the current 
standards and the standards in use during earlier development phases has been established. The 
working reference standards have been appropriately characterised using standard and state-of-the-art 
methods. Storage conditions and the stability protocols for the primary and the working reference 
standards were given. A protocol for qualification for new reference standards will be submitted via a 
future variation.  
Container closure system 
A description as well as drawings of the container closure system have been provided. The suitability of 
the container closure system was demonstrated by physicochemical, biocompatibility and container 
closure integrity testing (CCIT). Specifications for the container closure were presented. Summaries of 
24 
 
relevant extractables and leachables studies were provided, which indicate that the 2L PETG bottle and 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) closure are suitable for the storage of luspatercept active substance.  
Stability 
An initial shelf-life of 48 months for active substance when stored at the recommended long-term 
storage condition of ≤-65°C is proposed.  
This shelf-life claim is primarily based on 48 month stability data available from three “registrational” 
batches. These stability batches were manufactured using the same process and scale as intended for 
commercial manufacturing and the completed process performance qualification. The container closure 
system used for these batches was representative to the commercial closure system; same material 
but smaller volume. It can be agreed that the registrational stability batches are representative of the 
proposed commercial batches. These three stability batches were stored for 48 months at long term 
conditions (≤-65°C) and for 6 months at accelerated conditions -20°C, 2-8°C, 25±2°C / 60% RH, and 
40±2°C / 75% RH.  
Data from another supporting stability batch with data available for 24 months at ≤ -65 °C and for 6 
months at -20°C, 2-8°C, 25±2°C / 60% RH, and 40±2°C / 75% RH was presented too. 
Additional stability data at long-term storage conditions from active substance batches are available 
covering 12 months from the process performance qualification batches. Moreover, stability data from 
two earlier process version batches for up to 36 months at ≤-65 °C and for 6 months at -20°C, 2-8°C, 
25±2°C / 60% RH, and 40±2°C / 75% RH were provided.   
In general, the provided data support the stability claim at the recommended storage temperature; 
whereas the observed out-of-specification results for protein concentration could be explained by 
improper sample preparation before measurement.  
Furthermore, stability has also been investigated at accelerated and stress conditions (6 month data 
for four different temperature conditions -20°C, 5°C, 25°C and 40°C). As expected for recombinant 
proteins certain degradation trends were observed for various quality attributes when stored at higher 
temperature conditions. The ongoing long-term stability studies will be continued up to the 60 month 
time-point. 
In general, a shelf-life claim of 48 month when stored at ≤-65°C as proposed above is acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Luspatercept is formulated as a single-use, sterile, preservative-free, lyophilized powder intended for 
subcutaneous administration after reconstitution with sterile water for injection (WFI). The bulk 
solution is compounded at 50 mg/mL. The finished product (FP) is available in two presentations, 
25 mg/vial and 75 mg/vial.  
The 25 mg/vial presentation contains 0.75 mL fill volume (37.5 mg luspatercept) which includes a 
0.25 mL overfill. When reconstituted with 0.68 ml sterile WFI, the resulting solution contains 0.75 ml 
of 50 mg/mL luspatercept. This reconstituted volume accommodates delivery of up to 0.5 mL of 
50 mg/mL luspatercept. 
25 
 
The 75 mg/vial presentation contains 1.75 mL fill volume (87.5 mg luspatercept) which includes a 
0.25 mL overfill. When reconstituted with 1.6 ml sterile WFI, the resulting solution contains 1.75 ml of 
50 mg/mL luspatercept. This reconstituted volume accommodates delivery of up to 1.5 mL of 
50 mg/mL luspatercept. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Formulation Development 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for luspatercept powder for solution for injection was 
established.  Three formulations of luspatercept powder for solution for injection have been used 
throughout clinical development and they have been described. The formulation development 
comprised a systematic evaluation of multiple buffers, pH ranges, and excipient combinations and their 
impact on product stability. Based on the results of these studies the final formulation was 
appropriately defined using a citrate buffer. An overfill study was performed in order to ensure that the 
required volume of the label claim can be withdrawn from the vials. Reconstitution volume studies 
confirmed that consistent target volume and target protein concentration is reached after 
reconstitution. Physicochemical properties of the reconstituted FP were defined. 
Manufacturing Process Development 
Manufacturing processes evolution and the manufacturing sites involved were discussed.  
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified, ranked and discussed in the active substance part. 
Based on the totality of process experience, release and stability data and structure function 
characterization the analytical control strategy was developed.  
Process parameters and ranges for the respective process steps were determined based on 
manufacturing experience at commercial site and scale. For each process parameter a risk assessment 
was performed that was informed by prior experience, and potential impact on product quality and/or 
performance. Critical process steps were assessed in characterization studies. Relevant quality 
attributes,  were tested in these characterization studies. Critical process parameters (CPPs) were 
defined. Updated stability data still show that assessed quality attributes stay within their acceptance 
limits with no apparent trends, which is indicative of a stable lyophilisate. Stability assessment of 
lyophilization robustness batches is still ongoing.  
Analytical comparability was shown between all four processes.  
Extractable and leachable studies were performed on all product touching parts of the container 
closure system. Photostability studies as well as moisture ingress and container closure integrity 
studies were performed as well. Low endotoxin recovery was assessed and showed no masking of 
endotoxins. Rubber coring studies confirmed a low risk of stopper coring during routine reconstitution 
and withdrawal procedure.  As these vials are also used for commercial supply, results of the crimping 
study are directly applicable for development of the commercial process. 
For the in-use syringe study of an “aged” batch, the most advanced commercial process batch that 
was available was used. The in-use test was performed at a time-point, which is about half the time of 
the proposed shelf-life of 36 months, and thus in principle is not in accordance to expectations of the 
guideline on in-use stability (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). However, considering the overall FP stability 
profile, and the fact that in-use results from vials after 2 and 17 months of storage are comparable the 
results can be considered indicative for the results to be expected at the end of the shelf-life. It was 
26 
 
 
shown that there is no trend regarding the potency results during in-use syringe stability testing and 
no absorption to the syringes takes place. It was also confirmed that no degradation of the protein 
occurred. 
Overall, the process development was adequately presented. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The FP manufacture is performed at Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG. in Langenargen, 
Germany. Labeling and secondary packaging is performed at Sharp Packaging Solutions, Hamont-
Achel, Belgium. Several laboratories are involved in quality control testing. Importation of active 
substance and batch release of FP is performed at Celgene Distribution B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands. 
Manufacturing process and controls 
Luspatercept FP manufacturing process consists of active substance thawing, compounding, sterile 
filtration and filling, lyophilization, and vial crimping. The manufacturing process for the two dosage 
strengths is identical with the exception of the pre-lyophilization fill volume in the vials. 
The general batch formula and exemplary formula which is the lower limit of the intended commercial 
batch size range as well as the respective approximate number of resulting vials were presented.  
The results from shipment validation studies showed that there is no impact from transportation on 
luspatercept FP product quality or container closure integrity. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs), process parameters (PPs), in-process controls (IPCs), and critical 
in-process controls (CIPCs) are appropriately defined and limits were established. The specified 
processing times and hold times are supported by physicochemical and microbiological data from 
small-scale studies, process validation or stability studies. 
Manufacturing process validation 
The commercial control strategy was established during the process design stage based on existing 
knowledge from process development, risk-based process characterisation studies, and commercial 
scale runs. 
For PPQ (stage 2), three consecutive runs for each presentation was performed. The lower and upper 
batch size was validated for both dosage strengths. Hold times for each process step were 
appropriately assessed in the PPQ, including a cumulative hold time study with exceeding time limits 
for one of each strength to confirm the maximum ranges for the hold times. Suitable additional testing 
was performed at the process steps. Overall the PPQ strategy covers relevant aspects of the 
manufacturing process and is acceptable. All relevant process parameters were assessed and set 
points and ranges were justified by pharmaceutical development. 
During execution of the PPQ runs, one Out of Specification (OOS) result for one parameter occurred for 
one batch which was then excluded from the PPQ and replaced by an additional manufacturing run. 
The OOS result was investigated and sufficiently discussed. The conclusion was that it was reflective of 
an aberrant run. Some further deviations concerning this batch were appropriately addressed and 
measures implemented. All further results of this excluded run were presented together with the PPQ 
batches and met the acceptance criteria. Overall, it is agreed that the OOS and the deviations had no 
overall impact on the outcome of the process validation. 
27 
 
Further validation activities appropriately addressed the aseptic processing, the qualification of 
sterilization equipment and filter validation. For EU commercial supply, a protocol for transport 
validation was described. The planned continued process verification was briefly described and is 
acceptable. 
Product specification 
The release and end of shelf-life specifications for luspatercept powder for solution for injection include 
appropriate test and limits for general characteristics of the lyophilized product cake, identity, purity, 
PS 80, endotoxin, and sterility as well as a bioassay for potency and an assay for protein content. The 
proposed specification parameters are accepteable and those omitted from the specification have been 
sufficiently justified. Thus, the panel of analytical methods established for batch release of the FP as 
well as the list of assays for stability assessment is considered adequate. However the finished product 
potency specification limits should be re-evaluated and the summary of the currently ongoing 
investigation of the sources of the potency method variability should be reported post approval after a 
specified number of batches. 
Analytical methods 
The test methods are mostly identical to those used for control of as the active substance. The non-
compendial analytical methods specific for testing of the FP are sufficiently described. Method 
validations are in line with requirements according to ICH Q2 (R1) and thus acceptable.  
For compendial methods a reference to the respective Ph. Eur./USP Monograph is provided and the 
methods were sufficiently verified. Stability indicating analytical methods were identified. 
Overall, the established specification limits were appropriately justified and are considered acceptable.  
Batch analysis 
In total, batch analysis data of 33 batches throughout development were presented;  The results 
complied with the specification at the time of analysisThe data demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process reliably delivers consistent and uniform product. 
Impurities are the same as those described for the active substance and no new impurities are 
introduced during FP manufacturing. 
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for luspatercept FP is the same as that used for luspatercept active 
substance. 
Container closure system 
The finished product is packaged in a 3 mL Type I glass vial with a hydrophobic inner coating closed 
with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal with yellow or orange (for the 25 mg and the 75 
mg presentation respectively) polypropylene flip-off cap. Vials are washed and depyrogenated prior to 
use. Stoppers and seals are received ready to sterilize. The suitability of the container closure system 
was tested by stability studies.  
Acceptable supplier specifications for the container closure system and technical drawings for the 
components are presented. Extractables and leachables have been appropriately addressed. The glass 
type of the vial and the rubber material of the stopper comply with compendial requirements.  
28 
 
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months for the FP when stored at the recommended storage conditions of 2 - 8°C was 
proposed. This shelf-life claim is primarily based on stability data available from six “registrational” FP 
stability batches in the commercial vials and four “supporting” FP stability batches packaged in 
different vials.  
The six registrational batches were stored for 24 months at 2 - 8°C, for 3 months at -20 ± 5°C, and 
for 6 months at 25±2°C / 60±5% RH and 40±2°C / 75±5% RH.  
The supporting stability batches were stored for 48 months at 2 - 8°C, for 6 months at -20 ± 5°C, for 
up to 36 months at 25±2°C / 60±5% RH, for up to 24 months at 30±2°C / 75±5% RH and for 6 
months at 40±2°C / 75±5% RH.  
Three of the four supporting batches have reached and surpassed the initial proposed shelf life of 36 
months. Since the supporting batches are endorsed to be representative for the registrational and PPQ 
batches using the commercial vials, the minimum requirement for three batches supporting the 
proposed shelf-life of 36 months based on real time, real-condition stability data is met.  
In addition to the above mentioned registrational and supportive batches, another three batches in the 
proposed vial and three further batches from earlier process development in different vials were 
included in the stability program. Stability data of these batches reached up to 12 months at 2-8°C 
conditions, with no trends detected. 
The shelf-life of 8 hours at room temperature (≤25°C) and up to 24 hours at 2 - 8°C claimed in the 
SmPC for the reconstituted FP is acceptable based on results presented on physicochemical stability 
and on a microbial challenge study. 
A photostability study was performed in accordance with Option 2 of the ICH Harmonized Tripartite 
Guidelines Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (Q1B). There were no marked 
differences in the results obtained for the light-exposed and dark control samples. The samples were 
tested without secondary packaging confirming that such packaging will provide additional beneficial 
protection to the finished product vials. 
The stability program and testing frequency conforms to requirements as laid down in ICH Q5C. No 
deviations from acceptance criteria are reported so far. It has been clarified that variability is seen for 
subvisible particles without an obvious trend, and this was justified by data and by the test 
methodology.  
Overall the presented data are within their defined limits and do not show significant trends. Thus, the 
proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions “Store in a refrigerator (2 - 8°C)”, “Do not 
freeze”, and “Store in the original carton in order to protect from light” as stated in the SmPC are 
accepted. Stability studies also indicate the suitability of the container closure system. The post 
approval stability protocol and stability commitment presented is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
A complete list of raw materials used for the luspatercept manufacturing process were provided. Raw 
materials used in the upstream and downstream processes are plant based or chemically synthesized 
or produced by recombinant DNA technology. Specifications are implemented for all raw materials for 
release by the raw material supplier. Where appropriate, this includes testing for non-viral adventitious 
agents at the upstream and downstream raw material supplier site. 
29 
 
Raw materials used in the luspatercept manufacturing process do not contain materials of animal 
origin. All the cell banks were extensively tested for non-viral adventitious agents. All testing 
specification were met and no bacterial, fungi, and mycoplasma contamination was detected. 
Appropriate characterisation and safety testing of the cell banks is in place; data derived thereof do not 
raise a concern. Unprocessed bulk from the cell culture is tested for adventitious agents, mycoplasma 
and mouse minute virus (MMV). The manufacturing process includes two dedicated virus 
inactivation/reduction steps, but also the three chromatography steps were included into the virus 
clearance studies. Virus clearance studies have been conducted with four model viruses in small scale 
models. The scale-down models have been appropriately qualified. The data demonstrate that the 
luspatercept purification process provides substantial clearance of viruses with a wide range of 
physicochemical properties through a combination of inactivation and removal.  
In summary, the provided information for both non-viral and viral adventitious agents is satisfactory, 
and no issues arise. 
GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner. No major deficiencies have been found. 
The active substance manufacturing process is well described. Raw materials and cell banks used in 
the manufacture of the active substance are of appropriate quality. An extensive process 
characterisation work has been conducted to gain process knowledge. The development of the process 
is well described, and comparability of material derived from the different process versions has been 
demonstrated. The quality control strategy is acceptable. The batch data and the performed validation 
of the manufacturing process are satisfactory and indicate that the process is capable to consistently 
deliver material meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes.  
The finished product formulation development process was presented in detail. Appropriate process 
development studies were performed based on the risk of process parameters to CQAs or process 
performance. Comparability between the different process versions was shown. The established control 
strategy was successfully confirmed in the process validation studies. The finished product 
manufacturing process has been sufficiently validated and the process was shown to be capable of 
delivering consistent quality. Stability results so far show satisfactory stability even at accelerated and 
stressed temperature. 
Three recommendations are proposed concerning the re-evaluation of the finished product potency 
specification limits, the outcome of the investigation of the sources of the potency method variability, 
and an evaluation of proline supplementation. 
Overall the results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
30 
 
 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends points for investigation. 
Three recommendations are proposed concerning the re-evaluation of the finished product potency 
specification limits, the outcome of the investigation of the sources of the potency method variability, 
and an evaluation of proline supplementation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent, is a recombinant fusion protein that binds selected 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF β) superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands 
(e.g. GDF 11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid maturation 
through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 
signalling is abnormally high in disease models characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis, i.e. MDS 
and β thalassaemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The Applicant submitted non-clinical pharmacology studies designed to characterise the biological 
activity of luspatercept with respect to mechanism of action (MoA) and pharmacodynamic effects. 
Pharmacodynamic studies were performed in diverse in vitro systems, as well as in healthy laboratory 
animals and in animal models of anaemia.  
Table 1 
31 
 
 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Mechanism of Action 
Erythropoiesis is a multi-step process of proliferation and differentiation leading to development of 
mature RBCs. Transforming growth factor-β superfamily ligand trap ACE-536/Luspatercept aims to 
correct anaemia by promoting late-state erythropoiesis (Suragani, 2014). 
The Applicant demonstrated that luspatercept binds to GDF11 and other TGF-β superfamily ligands 
(like GDF8, and activin B), and inhibits signalling downstream of activin receptors by phospho-
Smad2/3. Inhibition of this signalling pathway promotes differentiation of late-stage erythroid 
precursors or normoblasts in the bone marrow, and consequently leads to an increase in production of 
mature erythrocytes. 
The MoA of luspatercept is thus represented by enhancement of maturation of later stage erythroid 
precursors. This is distinct from the MoA of erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs), which promote 
proliferation and survival of erythroid progenitors. 
Figure 1 
In vitro data 
Binding specificity of luspatercept was determined by in vitro ligand binding experiments with ligands 
of the TGF-β superfamily in both, cell-free and cell-based assay systems. 
Binding of various TGF-ß superfamily ligands to ACE-536 (modified ActRIIB-human Fc) (study PPR089) 
and to both, ACE-536 and RAP-536 (same modified human ActRIIB as in ACE-536, but with murine Fc) 
has been assessed by SPR analysis. Results showed that both molecules bound the tested ligands with 
similar affinities. The highest affinity ligands for both ACE-536 and RAP-536 were GDF11, GDF8, activin 
B, and BMP6. BMP-2, -6, and -9 have the biggest osteoinductive potential. In this regard and especially 
in view of the significant increase in sternum malformations/ variations in rats and the hyoid bone in 
rabbits in the EFD studies, binding to the major osteoinductive ligands (BMP-2, -6, and -9), and 
possible safety related effects from binding to these ligands. Luspatercept treatment results in skeletal 
effects during foetal development.   
A second-tier assessment by cell-based assays showed that the investigational medicinal product 
inhibited signalling by GDF8 and GDF11, but not Activin A, Activin B, BMP6, BMP9, or BMP10. 
Members of the TGF-β superfamily, including ligands, receptors and accessory molecules, are highly 
conserved across mammalian species. In silico, amino acid sequence alignment of the human ActRIIB 
receptor protein with the bovine, rodent (rat & mouse), rabbit and Cynomolgus monkey sequence 
indicated a > 99% sequence homology (study PPR125) of the human sequence with that of each of 
these species. 
32 
 
 
In vivo studies 
Homology between the human and Cynomolgus monkey sequences is 100%. Given the high degree of 
homology between the species, luspatercept is predicted to bind human, Cynomolgus monkey, rabbit, 
and rodent ligands with similar affinity, indicating the relevance of the laboratory animals used. 
In in vivo studies in physiologically normal mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, luspatercept/RAP-536 
increased RBC, HGB, haematocrit (HCT) and reticulocytes. In general, all haematology values returned 
toward control or baseline values after cessation of dosing. 
The pharmacological effect of luspatercept was not only explored in healthy mice, rats, and 
Cynomolgus monkeys, but also in different rodent models in which anaemia contributes significantly to 
morbidity, including models of anaemia associated with nephrectomy, acute blood loss, sickle cell 
anaemia and chemotherapy. Defined pharmacology studies focused specifically on the efficacy of 
luspatercept in a mouse model of MDS (NUP98-HOXD13) and a model of β-thalassemia (haemoglobin 
beta (Hbb) major-/-, Hbbth1/th1 mice), representing relevant models for the proposed initial target 
indications of the drug. 
The NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mouse mirrors several features of MDS in humans, including peripheral 
blood cytopenias, bone marrow dysplasia, anaemia, and increased apoptosis in the presence of a 
hypercellular or normocellular bone marrow. Likewise, the mouse β-thalassemia model (Hbbth1/th1) 
resembles human disease, as it presents with increased reticulocyte counts, splenomegaly due to 
ineffective erythropoiesis, and severe anaemia. 
Some of the rodent pharmacology studies used a murine orthologue of luspatercept, referred to as 
RAP-536. The RAP-536 molecule contains the identical extracellular domain (ECD) found in 
luspatercept, but with an Fc portion derived from murine IgG2a, instead of human IgG1. Such murine 
orthologues are generally less immunogenic in mice compared to the humanised molecules (i.e., 
luspatercept), facilitating the conduct of longer-term pharmacology studies (generally greater than 3 
weeks) by minimising the confounding influence of immunogenicity. No differences in ligand binding 
specificity or affinity between luspatercept and RAP-536 were observed, attributable to the identical 
ECD between the two molecules. Studies conducted with either luspatercept or the murine orthologue 
of luspatercept, RAP-536 had similar effects on maturation of erythroid precursors and increases in 
RBC, HCT, and HGB in vivo. 
Results: 
When luspatercept was administered twice on Day 0 and Day 4 to healthy mice, a rapid increase in 
RBC was measurable as soon as 12 hours following administration and sustained for up to 34 days 
(Report PPR084). The increase in RBC was associated with a concomitant decline in EPO expression. 
The decline in EPO expression is likely a negative feedback mechanism associated with an increase in  
circulating rRBC HCT and Hgb. After luspatercept treatment, an increase in serum EPO levels was seen 
after 14 days, but there was no increase 30 days after the final dose, suggesting that the increase in 
EPO levels induced by luspatercept is transient and completely reversible after withdrawal of 
treatment. 
To investigate the effects of Luspatercept on long term erythropoietin expression, mice received ACE-
536 at 10 mg/kg for 3, 7 and 28 days, or 1mg/kg for 28 days (Report PPR083). The study 
demonstrated that ACE-536 was effective in increasing RBC parameters independent of EPO for the 
first three days. However, repeated ACE-536 (10mg/kg) treatment for 28 days resulted in both 
increased RBC and serum EPO levels, although the increase in EPO levels was not considered very high 
(statistically not relevant), as observed in patients suffering from anemia. At 1mg/kg while EPO levels 
33 
 
 
were not changed, RBC parameters were significantly increased demonstrating that at low dosage the 
physiological levels of EPO are enough to support the erythropoietic response induced by ACE-536. 
As luspatercept and EPO target different cell populations in the erythropoiesis, it was hypothesised that 
treatment of mice with both luspatercept and EPO would result in larger increases in RBCs than either 
substance alone would. To prove this hypothesis, the combined effect of luspatercept and recombinant 
erythropoietin on red blood cell maturation was tested (study report PPR087). Three days after a single 
dose of luspatercept (10 mg/kg IP) and EPO (1800 U/kg) to mice, the combination of the two agents 
resulted in a greater increase in RBC than the single treatments alone. 
The murine orthologue of luspatercept, RAP-536, improved haematology parameters (increased RBC, 
HGB, HCT, improved RBC morphology), increased bone mineral density, and decreased RBC inclusion 
bodies, bilirubin, and spleen size in the NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mouse model of myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS), and/or in the β-thalassemia mouse model (haemoglobin beta (Hbb)th1/th1 mice). 
However, it should be noted that although RAP-536 treatment significantly increased red blood 
parameters (RBC, HGB, and HCT) compared to vehicle, dosing with RAP-536 simultaneously led to 
very modest decreases in mean cell parameters (MCV, MCH, and MCHC) compared to vehicle, probably 
caused by a relative lack of iron (iron deficiency anemia) in comparison to the increased RBC 
production. 
As measured by whole body DEXA scans, treatment of Hbbth1/th1 mice with RAP-536 significantly 
increased bone mineral density (by 17%), trabecular bone volume (by 100%), trabecular number (by 
14%), and trabecular thickness (by 14%), compared to vehicle treatment, completely restoring these 
parameters to wild type levels. Bone parameters were unchanged by RAP-536 treatment in wild type 
mice, on the other hand. 
Effects of the in vivo administration of the test compound RAP-536 on the frequency of haematopoietic 
progenitors in mouse bone marrow and spleen was analysed in another study (ACL04). The RAP-536 
administered mice showed an increase in WBC counts, albeit not statistically significant and considered 
consistent with indirect changes related to inflammatory processes, such as the glomerulonephritis 
documented in all of these studies. None of the WBC increases was accompanied by abnormal white 
blood cell morphology or distribution, as indicated by microscopic examination of hematopoietic or 
lymphoid tissues.  
The Applicant did not carry out longer term experiments, nor has an analysis of bone mineral density 
in the recovery phase been conducted. Due to the lack of data on the stability of an increase in bone 
mineral density in Hbb major-/- mice treated with RAP-536, it is not possible to estimate the 
significance of this effect for therapeutic use of luspatercept. In the current situation, despite the 
extensive pharmacological and toxicological documentation, no non-clinical data are available to 
describe the stability of bone mineralisation observed after luspatercept administration. 
RAP-536 was also tested in a murine model of sickle cell disease. The treatment improved SC disease 
phenotype indicated by reduced spleen weights, oxidative stress, reticulocytes, percentage of sickle 
cells and RBC haemolysis compared to vehicle treated mice. However, RAP-536 at 1mg/kg to SCD 
mice did not result in a statistically significant increase in the RBC parameters. 
In another study (Report PPR063), the effects of luspatercept on red blood cell production were tested 
in the absence or presence of an EPO neutralizing monoclonal antibody (EPO mAb). The study 
consisted of two time points (days 4 and 7) in order to assess the effects of luspatercept and EPO mAb 
during the acute and the subacute phases of treatment. On days 4 and 7 of treatment, luspatercept 
administration significantly increased total RBCs, haemoglobin and haematocrit, while the EPO mAb 
significantly decreased the same parameters. When administered together, luspatercept was able to 
34 
 
compensate the decline in all RBC parameters associated with EPO mAb only at Day 4 but not at Day 
7. This supports that the effect of luspatercept on RBCs is different from that of EPO. 
In sham-operated and unilateral nephrectomised mice (15/group), luspatercept administration (10 
mg/kg IP twice weekly for 4 weeks) significantly increased total RBC, HGB, and HCT, while unilateral 
nephrectomised mice dosed with TBS (IP twice weekly for 4 weeks) showed a significant decline in 
these same parameters over the 4-week experimental period (Report PPR0043). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Studies of the secondary pharmacodynamics of luspatercept have not been conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies with luspatercept were not conducted, in agreement with 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S6 guidance for the Preclinical Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH S6 (R1), 2011).  
However, relevant safety pharmacology measurements (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, body temperature, neurological examinations, and electrocardiograms [ECGs]) were included as 
part of the 1- and 3-month repeat-dose general toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. Of note, in 
the juvenile toxicity study in rats a significantly lower mean body temperature (considered adverse) 
was measured in males dosed at 10 mg/kg during the dosing period. 
The findings of 1- and 3-month toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys do not reveal relevant 
concerns on safety pharmacology endpoints. However in the study No.PPR083 & study No.PPR084 
luspatercept treatment results in a moderate increase in the circulating levels of EPO. In summary, 
luspatercept binds members of the TGF-β superfamily that participate in the later stages of 
erythropoiesis, stimulating differentiation of late stage cells already committed to the erythroid lineage. 
The non-clinical evidence for an increased production of mature erythrocytes was generated on the 
level of in vitro and in vivo studies (in healthy rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, in murine models of 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and beta-thalassaemia and acute and chronic anaemia models), in 
some of them by making use of a murine orthologue (RAP-536). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) parameters of luspatercept were assessed in Sprague 
Dawley rats, NZW rabbits, and Cynomolgus monkeys, the same species used in the pivotal toxicology 
studies. Both, single-dose and repeat-dose studies were carried out by the Applicant to characterise 
the PK/TK of luspatercept in these animals. Luspatercept was administered as a solution in tris-
buffered saline (TBS), the same formulation as used in clinical studies. The PK was characterised for 
the single-dose intravenous (IV) (monkey) and in subcutaneous (SC) routes of administration (rat, 
rabbit, and monkey), which is the intended route of administration in humans.  
Bioanalytical methods were validated for the determination of luspatercept concentrations and for the 
detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to luspatercept in toxicokinetic (TK) studies. 
35 
 
An ELISA-based sandwich immunoassay method was used for the measurement of luspatercept 
concentrations in rat milk and serum. The mean ratio of luspatercept concentrations in milk to 
concentrations in serum was 0.12, with an individual range of 0.06 to 0.17 across the time-points 
tested. The mean percent lacteal transfer (calculated as mean ratio*100) was 12% (Study number 
ACE-536-DMPK-2549). 
In the embryo-foetal development studies, luspatercept was found in the embryo, indicating that 
luspatercept can cross the placental membrane in rats and rabbits. As part of the PPND study, the 
placental transfer of luspatercept was quantitatively determined after SC administration at 3, 10, and 
30 mg/kg to Sprague Dawley rats to assess the exposure of the animals to luspatercept in utero. The 
ratio of luspatercept concentrations in pooled foetal serum to maternal serum was calculated for each 
dam, ranging from 4% to 33%. The mean ratios of luspatercept concentrations in pooled foetal serum 
compared to concentrations in maternal serum collected at the same time-point were 18% and 9% at 
8 and 24 hours, respectively. The mean percent placental transfer (calculated as mean ratio*100) was 
13.4%. 
As luspatercept is a large protein that is not expected to be renally eliminated and whose catabolism is 
expected to take place through the normal proteolytic pathways, studies on metabolism and excretion 
of the drug in animals have not been conducted. Equally, due to luspatercept being a large 
biotherapeutic molecule, drug interactions have not been conducted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The Applicant conducted a broad range of non-clinical studies to assess the toxicology of luspatercept. 
All pivotal and dose-range finding studies with the purpose of investigating the toxicological profile of 
luspatercept were conducted in accordance to GLP regulations. In all studies, luspatercept has been 
administered subcutaneously, the administration route which is also intended for its clinical use.  
Single dose toxicity 
No stand-alone studies on single dose toxicity have been conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats in two studies of 1 month and 13 weeks, 
respectively, and in Cynomolgus monkeys in three studies of 4 weeks, 13 weeks and 6 months, 
respectively. A Q14D treatment regimen was applied in all of these studies. 
In the 1-month study in rats (study 024488), the animals were dosed at 6, 20 and 60 mg/kg and 
terminated on Day 29; a subset of animals was maintained for a two months recovery period and 
terminated on Day 92. A NOAEL could not be established in this study. Apart from dose-related 
increases in RBC and related parameters, which are considered pharmacological effects of 
luspatercept, important adverse findings included increased platelet volume and decreased platelet 
count at high dose, increase in monocytes, WBC and lymphocytes at 20-60 mg/kg, increases in several 
serum parameters in males in all dose groups and in females at ≥20 mg/kg, decreased heart and lung 
weights at ≥6 mg/kg, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis in the kidney in all dose groups, 
hepatocellular coagulative necrosis of the liver at all dose levels, minimal to mild congestion of the 
adrenal gland in females at all dose levels and in males at 60 mg/kg, mild to marked necrosis and 
mineralisation of the adrenal gland in females at all dose levels, mineralisation of the stomach and 
minimal focal or multifocal congestion of the thymus at all dose levels. 
36 
 
Minimal to mild mineralisation of the lamina propria in the glandular portion of the stomach was 
present in both male and female rats dosed with ≥ 6 mg/kg for 1 month. The multifocal mineralisation 
in the stomach persisted after the 2-months recovery period in males at all doses and females at ≥ 20 
mg/kg. Data is presented describing the mechanism of formation of mineralisation changes in the 
stomach. Minimal to mild mineralisation of the lamina propria in the glandular portion of the stomach 
as a manifestation of azotemia/uremia is a consequence of bilateral membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis. The mineralisation changes in the stomach are probably of secondary in 
significance to the underlying renal alteration and resulting systemic uremia. This mechanism is 
common to experimental animals and humans. ‘Gastric mucosal calcinosis’ is occasionally connected to 
epigastric pain and/or dyspepsia and was mostly identified as a post mortem finding in people. 
In the 13-week rat study (20017484) dose levels of 1, 3 and 15 mg/kg were applied. Main group 
animals were terminated on Day 93 after 7 doses of luspatercept and recovery animals were 
terminated on Day 162. In addition to the mature male and female rats used in this study, male and 
female young adult rats (approximately 8 weeks of age at first dosing) were dosed at 15 mg/kg. Again, 
a NOAEL could not be established based on findings of minimal cortical necrosis of the zona fasciculate 
of the adrenal gland, and minimal to mild membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis in the kidney at 
all dose levels. Other effects included decreased heart, liver, kidney and lung weights at 3 and 15 
mg/kg and minimal to mild mid-zonal hepatocellular vacuolation at all dose levels (not considered 
adverse). Additional effects in young adult rats included minimal increases in leukocyte, lymphocyte, 
monocyte, and basophil counts, minimal increases in ALP, decreases in prostate weight and increased 
adrenal gland weight in females.  
Though not considered adverse by the investigators, young adult rats had minimally larger changes in 
haematology parameters than mature adult rats, including increases in total leukocyte, lymphocyte, 
monocyte and basophil counts at 15 mg/kg. At the end of the recovery period (Day 162), leukocyte 
counts were still minimally increased in young adult females that had been dosed at 15 mg/kg.  
During the 3-month study, one adult female rat in the high-dose (15 mg/kg) group was found dead 
during Week 11, with a diagnosis of disseminated pleiomorphic lymphoma. According to the 
investigators, the death of this animal was not attributed to treatment considering the spontaneous 
occurrence of this condition in rats of this age and strain, and the absence of any similar finding in 
remaining animals receiving ACE-536. However, although occurring spontaneously, a relation to the 
IMP cannot be ruled out. 
In the 4-week study in Cynomolgus monkeys (WHH00067), animals were dosed subcutaneously at 0.4, 
2, 10 and 30 mg/kg and a separate group was dosed intravenously at 10 mg/kg for the main necropsy 
on Day 29. Additionally, recovery groups were dosed at 10 mg/kg (SC and IV) and 30 mg/kg for 
necropsy on Day 99. At all doses of ACE-536 through the two routes of administration, there were no 
adverse clinical signs, effects on food consumption, body weight, or organ weights, nor were there any 
abnormal electrocardiographic, neurologic, physiologic, gross, or microscopic pathology findings due to 
the administration of ACE-536. Statistically significant increases in RBC, HgB, and HCT were seen in 
both males and females on Days 13 and 28 that showed signs of recovery by Day 99 and were 
consistent with the expected ACE-536 pharmacologic effect. Increases in these measures of red blood 
cell mass were dose dependent and reached a plateau at 2 mg/kg. The NOAEL for this study was 
considered 30 mg/kg when dosed via SC injection and 10 mg/kg when dosed via IV injection. 
Animals in the 13-week study (20017483) were dosed at 1, 6 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. The main study 
animals were necropsied on Day 99 and the control and high dose recovery animals on Day 162. 
Administration of ACE-536 at dosages ≥ 1 mg/kg resulted in generally time- and dose-dependent 
minimal to moderate mean increases in indicators of circulating erythrocyte mass consistent with the 
expected pharmacodynamic effects of ACE-536. At the end of the recovery period, most of the 
37 
 
haematology changes were comparable to the control values. Increases in ALP in males at dosages ≥ 1 
mg/kg and in single females at ≥ 6 mg/kg and increases in ferritin were not considered adverse as they 
were not statistically significant compared to controls and exhibited recovery at Day 162.  
ACE-536-related macroscopic changes on Day 99 comprised dark discoloration in the renal cortex 
which correlated histologically with haemorrhage, and thin cortex which correlated with interstitial 
fibrosis in the kidneys of two males at 30 mg/kg. Test article-related histopathologic changes were 
identified in the kidneys of animals at a dosage of ≥ 1 mg/kg, which persisted at the Day 162 recovery 
necropsy. However, these findings were only considered adverse in relation with increased BUN and 
creatinine values at ≥ 6 mg/kg.  
There was a dose-related decrease in absolute thymus weight and ratios to brain and body weight in 
males at ≥ 6 mg/kg and in females at ≥ 1 mg/kg. The decrease in thymus weight was associated with 
the microscopic finding of thymic involution. Thymic involution is a common incidental physiologic 
change in Cynomolgus monkeys associated with aging, stress, malnutrition, and many other 
conditions. However, the increased incidence amongst dosed animals in this study indicates a direct or 
indirect association with ACE-536 administration. Thymic involution is a normal physiologic process, 
and as such, was not considered adverse. 
According to the Applicant, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for this study was 
determined to be 1 mg/kg based on increases in BUN and creatinine and the nature and incidence of 
the kidney histopathology findings. It is acknowledged that increases in BUN and creatinine reflect a 
functional deficit and were only present at ≥ 6 mg/kg, however, the histologic changes in the kidney 
consisting of membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis at ≥ 1 mg/kg were not considered adverse. 
While morphologic alterations should be considered adverse when occurring in an organ sensitive to 
such changes, in this instance, considering the minimal severity, the lack of functional consequence, 
and the well-recognised reserve capacity of the kidney in the face of these scattered alterations, it is 
acceptable that within the scope of this study, the histologic changes in the kidney at the lowest dose 
were assessed as non-adverse.  
In the 6-months toxicity study (20039148) in Cynomolgus monkeys ACE-536 was administered at 
dosages of 0.3, 1, and 6 mg/kg (5/sex/group). The main study animals were necropsied on Day 197 
and the recovery animals on Day 281. Minimal to mild increases in indicators of circulating erythrocyte 
mass were observed at dosages of ≥ 0.3 mg/kg and were consistent with the expected 
pharmacodynamic effects of ACE-536. ACE-536 at a dosage of 6 mg/kg in males was associated with 
minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase. An explanation for the change was not evident since there 
were no histopathologic findings in the liver or increases in other markers of hepatobiliary injury. 
Ferritin was increased in males and females at 6 mg/kg. Following a 3-months recovery period, all 
clinical chemistry and urine chemistry parameters were comparable to control and/or similar or 
trending toward pre-study values, except alkaline phosphatase in 1 male at the 6 mg/kg dosage. 
Effects related to renal changes comprised dose-dependent minimal increase in creatinine in males and 
females at ≥ 1 mg/kg, minimal increases in BUN at 6 mg/kg and histopathology changes in the kidney 
consisting of membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis at ≥ 1 mg/kg in males and females. This was 
accompanied by other effects, such as accumulation of tubular protein, interstitial or tubular 
haemorrhage, interstitial fibrosis/fibroplasia, increased extracellular matrix, vacuolization of interstitial 
cells and/or degeneration/atrophy of tubules in the medulla, near the corticomedullary junction, as well 
as interstitial mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates. The renal changes were considered adverse at a dose 
of ≥ 1 mg/kg in both sexes resulting in a LOAEL of 1 mg/kg. Although the ACE-536-related microscopic 
findings identified at the terminal euthanasia in the kidney were resolving at the end of the recovery 
phase, most of them were still present to some extent.   
38 
 
At terminal necropsy (Day 197), ACE-536-related microscopic findings were identified in the choroid 
plexus of the brain at ≥ 1 mg/kg. Microscopic findings included one or more of the following: vascular 
degeneration, deposition of pigment (hemosiderin), deposition of eosinophilic proteinaceous material, a 
mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate (small numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes 
including plasma cells), and an infiltrate of foamy (vacuolated) macrophages. These changes were 
further investigated by a second pathologist, who concluded that none of the microscopic changes 
should be considered adverse for various reasons which were mainly based on comparison to findings 
with other drug formulations observed in other studies. 
The NOAEL for this study was determined to be 0.3 mg/kg based on the nature and incidence of the 
kidney histopathology findings at dosages ≥ 1 mg/kg. At the NOAEL dose of 0.3 mg/kg, the combined 
male and female mean Cmax was 5.4 µg/mL and the mean AUC0-336hr was 1228 hr*μg/mL. 
It was concluded that the ACE-536-related microscopic findings in the choroid plexus of the brain at ≥ 1 
mg/kg at terminal necropsy should not be considered adverse. However, the reasoning provided 
mainly refers to comparison with other cases with completely different drug products and is not based 
on a scientific discussion related to luspatercept and its mechanism of action. During the scientific 
advice procedure of June 2015 (EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III), the Applicant was advised to 
generate an integrated risk assessment on choroid plexus findings. Such an assessment has not been 
provided and the argumentation given in the pathology report is not considered sufficient to judge on 
the (non-)adversity of the choroid plexus findings. The Applicant was thus asked to discuss the choroid 
plexus findings in more detail. The provided literature data suggests that the findings are unlikely to be 
related to the known mechanism of action of luspatercept; however, the data was obtained in rodents, 
not in monkeys. The actual aetiology of the observed lesions in monkeys remains undetermined, but it 
is acknowledged that they were considered non-adverse.  
As mentioned above, the following safety pharmacology parameters were assessed in the 4-weeks and 
13-weeks toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body 
temperature, neurological examinations, and electrocardiograms [ECGs]. All changes in physiological 
measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body temperature) were considered 
incidental and not related to ACE-536 administration. There were also no changes in neurological 
function associated with the administration of ACE-536. Also, no abnormal electrocardiographic 
findings were attributable to the administration of ACE-536; in one animal of the high dose group in 
the 13-week study, a second-degree AV block was observed. However, a relationship to luspatercept 
was likely incidental.  
Genotoxicity 
No stand-alone studies on genotoxicity have been conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
Although stand-alone carcinogenicity studies are not considered appropriate due to the immunogenicity 
of luspatercept in rodents, product-specific assessment of carcinogenic potential would be expected of 
a product designed to modulate cell maturation and/or proliferation, such as luspatercept. In this 
regard, the effects of RAP-536 on Lewis lung carcinoma growth were studied (report PPR113). The 
results of this study are considered inconclusive and are not adequate to conclude on the presence or 
absence of a tumorigenic potential of luspatercept.  
Furthermore, the three hematologic malignancies detected at the highest dose level of luspatercept in 
the definitive juvenile toxicity study in rats (Report WIL-961003) prompt a concern for potential 
39 
 
malignancies in patients. The Applicant argued that a causal relationship of the tumours observed in 
the juvenile rat study to luspatercept has not been definitively established. However, the lack of 
malignancies in the control group and lower dose groups makes an influence of luspatercept high dose 
in this study more likely. In this context, it is also interesting to note that increases in total leukocyte, 
lymphocyte, monocyte and basophil counts were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, 
especially in young adult rats, where leukocyte counts were partly still increased at the end of the 
recovery period. 
Haematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats of the highest dose group examined in 
the definitive juvenile toxicity study (Report WIL-961003). As this incidence of malignant 
haematopoietic neoplasms was identified at a comparably short experimental duration (all identified 
approximately within half a year of study duration), the incidence of malignant haematopoietic 
neoplasms in a typical two years rat carcinogenicity study might be expected to be considerably 
higher. However, the Applicant argues that the mechanism of luspatercept’s carcinogenicity is specific 
to the developing haematopoietic system in immature rats and that luspatercept would not necessarily 
lead to a higher incidence of tumours in adult rats.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
While no adverse effects of luspatercept on male fertility were observed, significant reductions in 
average numbers of corpora lutea and decreased mean ovarian weights and uterus with cervix 
weights, a decreased mean number of implantation sites and viable embryos and a decrease in FSH 
were identified at 15 mg/kg each. Based on these observations, a general NOAEL for toxicity to female 
fertility in rats when exposed to luspatercept was claimed at 3 mg/kg.  
Adverse effects in rat and rabbit EFD studies ranged from decreased foetal weight, decreased average 
litter size and live litter size, increased average number of resorptions and percent post-implantation 
loss, maternal toxicity and skeletal variations as well as increased incidences of especially skeletal-, 
but also gross- and visceral malformations. For the endpoints “reduced foetal weight” in rats and 
“increased incidence of the skeletal variation angulated hyoid ala” in rabbits, no NOAEL could have 
been determined in the pivotal EFD studies (these treatment related effects were already observed at 
the lowest tested dose). 
Gross and visceral malformations in the pivotal rat EFD study (Report 20040548) were mainly 
observed in foetuses of treatment groups (four out of five observed malformed foetuses). These 
malformations were characterised by a strikingly low incidence in the control group data of the Testing 
Facility (e.g. agnathia, no tongue present, situs inversus with 1 out of 21065 rat foetuses each); 
hence, the increased incidence of such malformations in treatment group foetuses could point towards 
a teratogenic potential of luspatercept. This assumption was strongly supported by the pivotal rabbit 
EFD study (Report 20040550), in which skeletal malformations of the ribs and vertebrae were detected 
in ten foetuses of ten litters exclusively from treatment groups. One can calculate the likelihood that all 
these ten foetuses fall into a treatment group exclusively by chance by the following approach: 
Sum of all live foetuses examined: 798; sum of all live foetuses of treatment groups examined: 583   
The probability that all 10 foetuses developed malformations of the ribs and vertebrae in treatment 
groups completely by chance is hence low (4.2%, below the p value significance level of 5%), 
indicating that the maternal administration of luspatercept was most likely the rationale for the 
increased incidence of malformations in rabbit foetus treatment groups. As the target of Reblozyl (i.e. 
TGF-β superfamily ligand binding) is evolutionarily highly conserved among animals, the embryo/foetal 
toxicity and teratogenicity of Reblozyl observed in the EFD studies are most likely also relevant in 
humans.  
40 
 
In the PPND study, adverse effects observed at all tested dose levels (lowest one being 3 mg/kg) were 
significantly lower F1 pup body weights in both sexes from birth until post-weaning (in F1 males until 
the mating period at all doses) and adverse kidney findings. The latter were membrano-proliferative 
glomerulonephritis, and/or minimal to mild tubular atrophy/hypoplasia as well as minimal to mild 
vessel ectasia occasionally associated with haemorrhage. The delay in growth and the adverse kidney 
findings, in the F1 generation, precluded the determination of a NOAEL for F1 general toxicity. Growth 
retardation was demonstrated to be long lasting (especially in male pups), and the nephrotoxicity of 
luspatercept likely irreversibly disrupted general kidney maturation, these effects should additionally 
be characterised under the category of developmental toxicity (which generally implies long-lasting or 
even permanent effects).  
In the juvenile toxicity studies (WIL-961002 and -3), significant effects were determined at all dose 
levels (the lowest one being 1 mg/kg, which is below the intended maximum therapeutic dose of 1.75 
mg/kg). They comprised impaired use of hind limbs, swollen paws and/or reddened hind limbs, lower 
mean mating indices, adverse adrenal gland findings, adverse kidney findings with associated findings 
in urinalysis, decreased heart weights and effects on bone geometry, bone mass and bone density. 
Furthermore, gastric mucosal lesions were observed at 1 mg/kg in the dose-range finding juvenile 
toxicity study, and at 3 mg/kg in the pivotal juvenile toxicity study. In the pivotal juvenile rat toxicity 
study, luspatercept-related adrenal gland, kidney, glandular stomach and adverse hind limb findings 
persisted throughout the recovery phase at all dose levels. Additionally, malignant haematopoietic 
neoplasms were observed in high dose groups, as discussed before.  
The Applicant hypothesises that the mechanism of the observed carcinogenicity is specific to the 
developing hematopoietic system in immature rats and that this notion is supported by results of the 
three-month repeat dose toxicity study in young and mature rats (Report 20017484), where a similar 
test article-related increased incidence of malignancies was not noted. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies have not been conducted. However, local tolerance parameters were integrated 
in RDTS and DART studies. Mild adverse skin effects at the injection sites were observed in rabbit EFD 
studies and followed a dose-response trend, however, at a relatively low incidence. No treatment 
related injection site reactions were reported in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats or Cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Other toxicity studies 
To better understand the effect of luspatercept on the progression of renal injury, a 13-week non-GLP 
study (CC-DISC-TOX-2024) was conducted, in which luspatercept was given to rats that had 
undergone one of 2 rodent models of renal compromise: 5/6 nephrectomy or unilateral ureteral 
ligation (UUL). In the 5/6 nephrectomised animals a notable exacerbation of glomerular and 
tubulointerstitial lesions was observed, which was accompanied amongst others by increased pSmad2 
immunostaining. Indeed, literature data indicate that impairment of the TGF-B/Smad signalling 
pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease, although the exact mechanism 
is not completely understood (Böttinger & Bitzer 2002, Huang et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2010). 
Antigenicity was assessed in ADA analyses in a variety of toxicology studies. In the 13-week repeat-
dose toxicity study in rats (study 20017484), 30 of the 47 PK animals had an ADA response. Nineteen 
of these 47 animals (approximately 40%) exhibited limited exposure or concentrations below the limit 
of quantitation on Day 85, which resulted in AUC values that were greater than 2 standard deviations 
(SD) below the mean for animals without an antibody response; therefore these animals were 
41 
 
excluded from pharmacokinetic analysis. The other 11 animals had an ADA response of low titre and 
their individual AUC values were within 2 SD. These animals were included in the PK analysis on Day 
85; however, they had a lower mean AUC0-336 value compared to the ADA negative animals in the 
same dose groups. These data demonstrate that ADA response reduced the ACE-536 exposure in rats. 
No such effect was observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys, where TK 
analysis confirmed that ACE-536 exposure was maintained, in a dose-dependent manner, following 
administration of up to 30 mg/kg. 
ADAs were also observed in the 13-week renal toxicity study in rats (CC-DISC-TOX-2024); 25% of 
luspatercept-treated animals and 33% of RAP-536 treated animals were identified as ADA-positive. 
Drug concentrations in post-last dose samples were reduced in most (but not all) of the ADA-positive 
animals, compared to the ADA-negative animals, indicating reduced exposure due to immunogenicity. 
In DART studies, the incidence of ADA formation towards luspatercept was low. However, the 
formation of ADA considerably reduced luspatercept sera levels. Immunotoxicity parameters were 
integrated in the pivotal juvenile rat toxicity study (Report WIL-961003). In a TDAR assessment, no 
immunosuppression by up to 10 mg/kg luspatercept was detected. Immunophenotyping in the same 
study indicated increased T, B and NK cell plasma levels, likely related to inflammatory processes 
associated with the pronounced organ toxicity of luspatercept observed in this study.  
To better understand the effect of luspatercept on the progression of renal injury, a 13-week non-GLP 
study was conducted in which luspatercept (0.5 or 5 mg/kg, once Q2W) or its murine homologue RAP-
536 (10 mg/kg, once Q2W) was given to rats representing a rodent model of renal compromise: 5/6 
nephrectomy or unilateral ureteral ligation (UUL). Administration of luspatercept or RAP-536 to 5/6 
nephrectomised animals caused notable exacerbation of glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions, 
increased pSmad2 and aSMA immunostaining and elevated urinary albumin, TIM-1, and/or osteopontin 
levels when compared to vehicle-treated nephrectomised or respective sham-operated luspatercept or 
RAP-536 treatment groups. In the UUL arm of the study, there was no notable difference in the 
severity of obstructive nephropathy between vehicle and luspatercept/RAP-536 treatment groups. 
Furthermore, different TGF-β growths factors that can effectively be bound by luspatercept (BMP6) 
participate in bone and cartilage development (Cao and Chen, 2005). Hence, binding of these ligands 
may be a rationale for the observed adverse effects of luspatercept on hind limbs, bone geometry, 
bone mass and bone density, but might also determine the increased incidences of skeletal 
malformations and variations identified during EFD.  
Immunohistochemistry of kidney sections from control and select luspatercept-treated animals from 
the 3-month rat study and the 3- and 6-month monkey studies revealed immune component 
deposition (increased IgG, IgM, and/or C3-containing granular deposits in intramembranous and/or 
mesangial locations) in areas of affected glomeruli in most of the affected animals. However, there was 
a lack of association of kidney findings with ADA seropositivity in rats in the renal toxicity study. 
Therefore, a direct drug effect on renal function was presumed. Indeed, literature data indicates that 
impairment of the TGF-B/Smad signalling pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic 
kidney disease. Although Smad2 and Smad3 were found to be overexpressed in a mouse model of 
kidney disease, inhibition of Smad2 in kidney cells led to more severe fibrosis, suggesting an 
antagonistic mechanism of Smad2 and Smad3 in the progression of renal fibrosis (Böttinger & Bitzer 
2002, Huang et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2010). 
Finally, factors of the TGF-β superfamily also act on the function and ontogeny of the thymus and 
adrenal gland (Jurberg et al, 2015; Vinson 2016), thus a correlation of TGF-β inhibition by luspatercept 
to adverse effects observed in these organs seems possible. 
42 
 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As luspatercept is a protein, it is not expected to have a negative environmental impact.  
Even though proteins such as Reblozyl may be renally excreted due to luspatercept-mediated in 
patients with kidney damages (as demonstrated in the juvenile rat toxicity study, Report WIL-961003), 
the protein can be expected to be rapidly degraded by microbes into smaller peptides, its amino acids 
or even completely mineralised. 
Therefore, Luspatercept is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Mechanism of action and primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The Applicant’s non-clinical pharmacodynamic programme is comprehensive and was designed to 
characterise the biologic activity of luspatercept with respect to mechanism of action and 
pharmacodynamic effects in vitro and in different in vivo models, thereby using healthy animals and 
animal disease models.  
Luspatercept binds to GDF11 and other TGF-β superfamily ligands (e.g., GDF8, activin B) and inhibits 
signalling downstream of activin receptors by phospho-Smad 2/3. Luspatercept enhances 
differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow and consequently 
leads to an increase in the production of mature erythrocytes. As such, binding specificity of 
luspatercept was determined by in vitro ligand binding experiments with ligands of the TGF-β 
superfamily. However, several TGF-β superfamily ligands possess osteoinductive activity. Although the 
ligands most implicated in osteoinductive activity do not interact with luspatercept, there was a great 
redundancy among these ligands. Effects on bone development (most likely indirect) were observed as 
a result of luspatercept administration to prenatal or neonatal animals. The Applicant acknowledged 
that luspatercept treatment results in skeletal effects during fetal development, and as such, 
luspatercept is contraindicated during pregnancy (SmPC, Section 4.3). There was no evidence from the 
provided pharmacology studies of such an effect on bone in adult animals. 
Due to the high degree of homology between species, luspatercept was predicted to bind human, 
Cynomolgus monkey, rabbit, and rodent ligands with similar affinity. As such, all the laboratory 
animals used in this context may be considered relevant. The pharmacological effect of luspatercept in 
vivo was investigated in healthy mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, but also in a selection of rodent 
models in which anaemia contributes significantly to morbidity, including models of anaemia associated 
with nephrectomy, acute blood loss, sickle cell anaemia and chemotherapy. In addition, 
pharmacological studies were performed with luspatercept in a mouse model of MDS (NUP98-HOXD13) 
and a model of β-thalassemia (hemoglobin beta (Hbb) major-/-, Hbbth1/th1 mice), representing 
relevant models for the targeted indications. Some of the rodent pharmacology studies used a murine 
orthologue of luspatercept, referred to as RAP-536. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of increases in RBC, haemoglobin (HGB), and haematocrit (HCT) were 
observed in all tested species (mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys) and disease models. However, 
there was no statistically significant increase in the RBC parameters in the murine model of sickle cell 
disease. Increases in white blood cell counts were consistent with indirect changes related to 
inflammatory processes, such as the glomerulonephritis documented in these studies. None of the 
increases was accompanied by abnormal morphology or distribution of white blood cells as indicated by 
microscopic examination of hematopoietic or lymphoid tissues. 
43 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Studies of the secondary pharmacodynamics of luspatercept have not been conducted, as such studies 
are generally not warranted for large molecule biotherapeutics. 
Safety pharmacology 
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies have not been conducted with luspatercept. However, safety 
pharmacology parameters were incorporated into the repeat dose general toxicity studies of up to 3 
months duration in monkeys. This is in line with the ICH M3(R2), Guidance on Nonclinical Safety 
Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK was characterised for the single-dose intravenous (IV) (monkey) and in subcutaneous (SC) 
routes of administration (rat, rabbit, and monkey), which is the intended route of administration in 
humans.  
Toxicology studies 
The Applicant’s non-clinical toxicology program on Reblozyl (luspatercept) is considered to fulfil the 
study requirements on non-clinical toxicity testing for filing a marketing authorisation of a medicinal 
product according to the ICH S5(R2), ICH S6(R1) and ICH M3(R2) guidelines. However, a considerable 
range of adverse toxicological effects was identified that demanded thorough discussion and 
clarification by the Applicant. 
Repeat-dose toxicity was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats in two studies of 1 month and 13 weeks, 
respectively, and in Cynomolgus monkeys in three studies of 4 weeks, 13 weeks and 6 months, 
respectively. A Q14D treatment regimen was applied in all of these studies. In rats, the toxicity 
findings included increases in RBC and related parameters, increased platelet volume and decreased 
platelet count, increase in monocytes, WBC and lymphocytes, increases in several serum parameters, 
decreased heart, liver, kidney and lung weights, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, minimal 
to mild mid-zonal hepatocellular vacuolation, hepatocellular coagulative necrosis of the liver, minimal 
to mild congestion of the adrenal gland, mild to marked necrosis and mineralization of the adrenal 
gland, and minimal focal or multifocal congestion of the thymus. Additional effects in young adult rats 
included minimal increases in leukocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, and basophil counts, minimal 
increases in ALP, decreases in prostate weight and increased adrenal gland weight in females.  
A NOAEL could not be established in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats; the LOAEL was 1 mg/kg.  
Anti-drug antibody formation was also observed in rats at all dose levels, which had an impact on 
luspatercept exposure levels in affected animals.  
In Cynomolgus monkeys, the toxicity findings included increases in indicators of circulating erythrocyte 
mass consistent with the expected pharmacodynamic effects of ACE-536, increases in ALP and ferritin, 
increased BUN and creatinine, and histopathologic changes in the kidney mainly consisting of 
membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis. ACE-536-related microscopic findings were also identified 
in the choroid plexus of the brain.  
In the 13-week study in monkeys, the NOAEL was determined to be 1 mg/kg despite mild   
histopathologic kidney findings observed at this dose level.  
In the 6-month study in monkeys, the NOAEL was determined to be 0.3 mg/kg based on kidney 
histopathology findings at dosages ≥ 1 mg/kg.  
Anti-drug antibody formation was only incidently observed in monkeys and did not impact luspatercept 
exposure levels.  
44 
 
To better understand the effect of luspatercept on the progression of renal injury, a 13-week non-GLP 
study was conducted in which luspatercept was given to rats with one of two rodent models of renal 
compromise: 5/6 nephrectomy or unilateral ureteral ligation (UUL). In the 5/6 nephrectomised animals 
a notable exacerbation of glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions was observed, which was 
accompanied amongst others by increased pSmad2 immunostaining. Indeed, literature data indicates 
that impairment of the TGF-B/Smad signalling pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic 
kidney disease, although the exact mechanism is not completely understood. 
Results of these above findings have been reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Carcinogenicity 
Three hematologic malignancies detected at the highest dose level of luspatercept in the definitive 
juvenile toxicity study in rats (Report WIL-961003) prompt a concern for potential development of 
malignancies in patients. The Applicant argued that a causal relationship to luspatercept of the 
tumours observed in the juvenile rat study has not been definitively established. However, the lack of 
malignancies in the control group and lower dose groups makes an influence of high dose luspatercept 
in this study more likely. In the response, the Applicant hypothesises that the mechanism of the 
observed carcinogenicity is specific to the developing hematopoietic system in immature rats and that 
this notion is supported by the data from the three-month repeat dose toxicity study in young and 
mature rats (Report 20017484), where a similar test article-related increased incidence of 
malignancies was not observed. Therefore, the wording of the SmPC was revised in order to properly 
describe the malignancy findings in section 5.3 and corresponding measures were added to the RMP.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
In DART studies, luspatercept was toxic with regards to female fertility in the rat at the highest tested 
dose of 15 mg/kg (Report 20040551); however, the observed effects were demonstrated to be 
reversible. Adverse effects of luspatercept to embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits comprised 
a decreased foetal weight, decreased average litter size and live litter size, increased average number 
of resorptions and percent post-implantation loss, maternal toxicity and skeletal variations as well as 
an increased incidence of especially skeletal-, but also gross- and visceral malformations. Regarding 
the latter, significant increases in foetuses of treatment groups relative to control groups having 
skeletal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In rats (Report 20040547), multiple gross and 
visceral malformations of a strikingly low background incidence (e.g. 1 out of 21065 rat foetuses) were 
mainly observed in foetuses of the treatment groups. In the pivotal rabbit EFD study (Report 
20040549), malformations of the ribs and vertebrae were detected in ten foetuses of ten litters 
exclusively from treatment groups, constituting a low probability that these effects were observed by 
chance (4.2%). As the target of luspatercept (TGF-β superfamily ligand binding) is evolutionarily highly 
conserved among animals, the embryo/foetal toxicity and teratogenicity of luspatercept observed in 
the EFD studies are most likely also relevant in humans.  
Because of these adverse effects, the Applicant agreed to a contraindication for luspatercept in 
pregnancy, which should be an effective means for risk mitigation. Section 5.3 of the SmPC wording 
was amended to adequately communicate the reproductive toxicity of luspatercept.  
Throughout peri- and postnatal development (Report ACE-536-TOX-2485), adverse effects observed in 
rats at all dose levels (lowest one 3 mg/kg) were significantly lower F1 pup body weights that 
maximally lasted from birth until the mating period of F1 males as well as adverse kidney findings 
(especially membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, tubular atrophy/hypoplasia and vessel ectasia).  
In the juvenile toxicity studies (WIL-961002 and -3), significant adverse effects were determined at all 
dose levels (the lowest one being 1 mg/kg). They comprised impaired adverse hind limb findings, 
lower mean mating indices, adrenal gland findings, kidney findings with associated findings in 
45 
 
urinalysis, decreased heart weights, effects on bone geometry, bone mass and bone density and 
gastric mucosal lesions. In the pivotal juvenile rat toxicity study, luspatercept-related adrenal gland, 
kidney, glandular stomach and adverse hind limb findings persisted throughout the recovery phase at 
all dose levels. As the target of Reblozyl (TGF-β superfamily ligand binding) is evolutionarily highly 
preserved among animals, the developmental toxicity of Reblozyl observed in the juvenile toxicity 
study is most likely also relevant in humans. However, it is unclear whether the pathogenesis 
mechanism of haematopoietic malignancies in juvenile rats might potentially also be relevant in young 
children (not included in the current MAA), in which the haematopoietic system is still developing. In 
human paediatrics, the incidence of e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukaemias shows a peak at 
approximately 5 years of age, it may therefore be speculated that the microenvironment and/or 
leukaemia-initiating cells undergo a transition in their susceptibility to oncogenic transformation during 
early childhood (Copley and Eaves 2013, DOI: 10.1038/emm.2013.98). Furthermore, the pathogenesis 
of haematopoietic malignancies is considered to differ between young children and adults (Copley and 
Eaves 2013, DOI: 10.1038/emm.2013.98). One reason for this may be the high rate of haematopoietic 
stem cell (HCS) replication in young children. HCS replication decreases from ≈42/year immediately 
after birth to ≈2.5/year at the age of 3 years, whereas between the ages of 3 and 13 years the rate of 
HSC replication is relatively stable at ≈2.5/year and after the age of 13 years decreases and remains at 
≈0.7/year (Sidorov et al. 2009, DOI: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.11.009). A second reason for the 
different pathogenesis of haematopoietic malignancies in young children and adults may be a different 
expression pattern of the oncogenes Lin28b and Hmga2 and the tumour suppressor let-7 miRNA in 
these two populations. In early HSCs, both, Lin28b and Hmga2 are expressed at higher levels, and let-
7 miRNA at lower ones compared to expression levels in adult HSCs (Copley and Eaves 2013, DOI: 
10.1038/emm.2013.98). These observations demonstrate that the molecular aetiology of 
haematopoietic malignancies in humans is (to a certain degree) age dependent, as similarly speculated 
by the Applicant in the discussion of the observed haematopoietic malignancies in juvenile rats. 
Considering that the MoA of luspatercept is evolutionarily highly preserved, it is conceivable that the 
pathogenetic mechanism of the observed malignancies in the juvenile toxicity study might also be 
relevant in young children with developing haematopoietic system.  
Additionally, it is unclear whether the nephrotoxicity that was commonly observed in most non-clinical 
studies (which frequently persisted throughout recovery phases, also in the juvenile toxicity study), 
could also be relevant in young patients in which the renal system is still developing. As the kidney 
development in humans lasts until ≈3.5 years of age (GFR reaches adult levels after 1-2 years of age, 
glomeruli reach adult size at ≈3.5 years of age; Gomez et al. 1999), administration of luspatercept to 
very young infants may also be problematic in this respect. Finally, the other adverse effects observed 
in young rats (adverse adrenal gland findings, problems in bone growth, lower heart weights etc.), 
could similarly be problematic in young children exposed to luspatercept. Relevant information has 
been added to section 4.2, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Environmental risk assessment 
As luspatercept is a protein, it is not expected to have a negative environmental impact.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data package is considered acceptable.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK parameters of luspatercept have been characterised in a small study in healthy subjects as well 
as in three clinical studies in patients with β-thalassaemia and three clinical studies in patients with 
MDS.  
Dose levels of 0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/kg were evaluated in the first in human study A536-02 
conducted in healthy subjects.   
Tested dose levels ranged from 0.125 to 1.75 mg/kg in the phase II study A536-03 in MDS. In the 
pivotal trial ACE-536-MDS-001 the starting dose was 1 mg/kg SC Q3W. Dose titration to a maximum 
dose of 1.75 mg/kg (i.e., 2 serial intrasubject dose escalations to 1.33 and then 1.75 mg/kg) was 
allowed. 
Tested dose levels ranged from 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg in the phase II study A536-04 in β-thalassemia. In 
the pivotal trial ACE-536-B-THAL-001 the starting dose was 1 mg/kg SC Q3W, with one dose titration 
to 1.25 mg/kg allowed. 
In total, 7 clinical studies contributed PK data. Furthermore, a Population PK Analysis was conducted 
for each indication.  
Absorption  
Luspatercept is slowly absorbed after SC injection and reaches Cmax after approximately 7 days in 
both disease populations. AUC and Cmax values appear to be approximately dose proportional over the 
dose range evaluated in the phase I study as well as in both phase II studies where ascending doses 
up to 1.75 mg/kg were tested.  
Steady state at the tested 3-weekly dosing interval is reached after 3 doses. Accumulation is moderate 
with an accumulation ratio of 1.5. Interindividual variability of AUCss is moderate (36% and 38% for β-
thalassaemia and MDS, respectively). 
Distribution 
Based on population PK analysis for the pivotal Phase 3 study, the mean apparent volume of 
distribution of the central compartment (V1/F) was 7.08 L in subjects with β-thalassemia and 9.68 L 
for subjects with MDS. The small volume of distribution indicates that luspatercept is confined primarily 
in extracellular fluids, consistent with its large molecular mass. 
Elimination 
Luspatercept is expected to be catabolised into amino acids by general protein degradation processes 
in multiple tissues, and thus its elimination is not dependent on a single organ. The mean apparent 
clearance was 0.437 L/day in patients with β-thalassemia and 0.516 L/day in subjects with MDS. The 
mean half-life in serum was 11 and 13 days, in β-thalassemia and MDS, respectively.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
The increase of luspatercept Cmax and AUC in serum is approximately proportional to increases in 
dose from 0.125 to 1.75 mg/kg. Luspatercept clearance was independent of dose or time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 52/195 
 
  
  
 
When administered every three weeks, luspatercept serum concentration reaches the steady state 
after 3 doses, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.5. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In β-thalassaemia patients as well as in MDS patients with no or only one dose modification, trough 
levels appeared to be stable over the observed duration of exposure.  
Special populations 
Luspatercept has not been specifically investigated in special patient populations, such as the elderly or 
patients with hepatic or renal impairment. The studied MDS patient population was old, with a median 
age of 71.0 years, with approximately 80% of subjects ≥ 65 years of age and > 36% of subjects ≥ 75 
years of age.

PK Trials 
Population PK analyses found limited influence of renal or hepatic impairment on the PK parameters of 
luspatercept. 
Body weight exerts a statistically significant and clinically relevant influence on the exposure to 
luspatercept. Simulations were performed on the population PK data to identify the consequences of 
fixed dose, BW-based dosing and modified BW-based dosing which capped the highest dose on 
predicted AUCss and Cmaxss. For lower bodyweights, the fixed dose resulted in higher exposure while 
both BW-based approaches were able to replicate levels expected in patients with average weight. For 
higher bodyweights, the fixed dose resulted in lower exposure, while both BW-based approach 
produced comparable levels to patients with average weight, supporting the BW-based dosing 
recommendation. 
With regards to race and gender, no significant effect was observed. Increasing age suggested a trend 
towards decreased elimination in MDS patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interactions have been conducted.  
Data from population PK analyses with regards to concomitant iron chelating products showed no 
apparent influence on the PK parameters of luspatercept. 
Analyses of binding and neutralising antibodies showed that while binding antibodies did not influence 
PK, neutralising antibodies had the ability to render trough levels of luspatercept unmeasurable.  
Bioequivalence  
The applicant supports the comparability of the different drug products used in the clinical 
development plan with a population PK analysis using PK data from those MDS patients treated with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 53/195 
 
  
  
 
 
 
starting dose of 1 mg/kg and evaluable PK data for the first treatment cycle. Data from 192 subjects 
fulfilled these requirements and were included into the analysis. The bioequivalence criteria of 80%-
125% for the proportion of the 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC for the three different 
presentations tested were fulfilled, thus demonstrating adequate comparability of PK parameters 
between the different drug products for a single dose of 1 mg/kg. 
In the population PK analysis for MDS, the different presentations were assessed as a covariate and 
were found to have not statistically significant effect on steady state parameters or elimination 
kinetics, thus supporting the finding of the more sensitive single dose BE evaluation. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein that binds select transforming growth factor-beta 
superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands (e.g., growth differentiation factor-11, 
activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid maturation through 
differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 
signalling is abnormally high in disease models characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, i.e., 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and β-thalassemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. 
The role of the TGF-beta superfamily in regulating erythropoiesis in vivo is not completely understood 
and information provided by the Applicant with regard to the pharmacodynamic effects of luspatercept 
in humans is sparse. However, in the non-clinical dossier mouse models for β-thalassaemia as well as 
MDS established the effect of luspatercept on red blood cell count, haemoglobin and haematocrit. 
Mechanistic studies demonstrated the ability of luspatercept to induce an erythroid maturation 
independent of erythropoietin. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In a phase I trial in healthy volunteers, doses of 0.0625 up to 0.25 mg/kg luspatercept were evaluated 
in 24 subjects. All investigated PD endpoints (haemoglobin, red blood cell count, reticulocyte count, 
haematocrit) showed a dose dependent increase, which slowly returned to values near baseline over 
the 18 week observation period. 
In the clinical phase II ascending dose trials in patients with β-thalassaemia and MDS, haemoglobin 
levels showed a response approximately 7 days after the first injection of luspatercept. The increase 
from baseline levels was sustained during the treatment period. Unfortunately, for transfusion 
dependent patients with thalassaemia as well as MDS patients with a high transfusion burden, the 
efficacy outcomes were described as surrogates for PD endpoints. Therefore, a PD evaluation using 
haemoglobin levels (excluding levels within 14 days of a transfusion) instead of efficacy endpoints was 
requested for these two populations. The PD effect of luspatercept treatment on haemoglobin values 
for the phase II trials has been summarised by the Applicant: The analyses provided are supportive of 
a dose-dependent haemoglobin increase and are consistent with the results observed in the phase 3 
studies. However, due to the small numbers of patients, the lack of a control arm and a dynamic 
transfusion administration scheme with potential impact on the haemoglobin increase, no robust 
conclusion can be drawn from this analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 54/195 
 
  
  
 
The dose groups in the phase II ascending dose trials in both indications were evaluated for reduction 
of transfusion requirements as a correlate for a desired PD response. However, numbers of patients in 
these dosing groups were small (n~3), therefore no relevant differences could be identified between 
these dosing brackets. 
A major negative influence of ADAs on the effects of luspatercept was not observed in the majority of 
cases. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
For large proteins, an effect on ventricular repolarisation is not expected. To substantiate the lack of 
this effect, an exposure-response analysis examined the influence of repeated doses of luspatercept up 
to the highest recommenced dose of 1.75 mg/kg Q3W on the QTc interval. Both, the original analysis 
as well as a sensitivity analysis including all outliers, found that the upper bound of the two-sided 90% 
confidence interval for the QTc was below 10 ms, proposed as a relevant margin for risk estimation by 
ICH E14. Furthermore, a categorical analysis of all patients with available QTc data demonstrates that 
MDS patients receiving the highest dose have QTc changes comparable to placebo patients. 
In order to gain a better understanding of potential safety concerns, the Applicant was asked to 
elaborate on potential off-target effects caused by binding to TGF-β ligands other than the desired 
activin B receptor ligand. In response, the Applicant has provided a literature overview with regards to 
the effects of inhibition of GDF11, GDF8, activin B and BMP-6. Due to the manifold effects of those 
ligands, no specific off-target effect can be singled out, with the exception of renal toxicity associated 
with BMP-6 inhibition. The clinical studies did not reveal a risk for the decline of renal function for a 
treatment duration of up to 18 months.  
Additionally, the Applicant has provided an overview over all known factors contributing to kidney 
injury in the non-clinical studies, i.e. inhibition of reno-protective ligands, immune complex deposition 
and accumulation of renotoxic ligands. Clinical safety data does not show a comparable effect on renal 
function, as the subjects experiencing kidney EOIs had a predisposing event or intervention and kidney 
function recovered while on treatment. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK parameters of luspatercept have been adequately characterised. 
The PD effects of luspatercept were characterised in a phase I trial in healthy volunteers and further 
explored in patients with β-thalassaemia and MDS. The highly complex mode of action was not 
completely elucidated, however, and possible off-target effects and interactions were only inferred by 
discussing the known effects of inhibition of single TGF-β ligands.  
The Applicant was asked to discuss the potential for PD interactions with regards to medicinal products 
used in MDS and β-thalassaemia. The Applicant has appropriately discussed the potential for PD drug-
drug interactions in both disease population in their response to the D120 LoQ. A conceivable 
enhancing effect of ESAs will very likely be not relevant for patients with MDS or beta-thalassaemia 
due to the reasons lined out above, i.e. patients having high endogenous EPO, not responding well to 
ESAs. 
Stopping rules are detailed in section 4.2 of the SmPC and will prevent unnecessary drug exposure in 
those subjects who experience a loss of efficacy due to any reason, including immunogenicity, 
therefore monitoring for the development of ADA is not considered mandatory. 
No drug-drug interactions have been conducted; these are not expected for large proteins as they are 
not subject to metabolisation by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 55/195 
 
  
  
 
However, considering that no subjects with severe renal or hepatic impairment have been included in 
the studies and consequently in the population PK model, the SmPC appropriately mentions that no 
specific dose recommendation can be made in this patient population. The Applicant´s plan to further 
monitor renal function in ongoing and future clinical trials is strongly endorsed. 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of luspatercept has been sufficiently characterised and there are no 
outstanding issues. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of luspatercept is considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy MDS 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose response studies (phase 2) 
The dose recommendations are derived from phase I and II studies and based on the dose-exposure-
response relationship as well as safety- and efficacy considerations, from observed and modelled data 
(see pharmacology section, table 6).  
Dose-Exposure-Response Relationship 
Luspatercept exposure and other key factors that might impact efficacy and dose escalation were 
evaluated by the maximum dose level administered in the primary treatment phase of Week 1 to 24 
(Table 8). Luspatercept AUCss for the starting dose (1 mg/kg) was similar among subjects with or 
without dose escalation, and the time-averaged AUC during the first 24 weeks (AUCavg24) increased 
in subjects who had dose escalation. Higher baseline RBC-transfusion burden, higher baseline serum 
EPO, and higher baseline IPSS-R score were more frequent in subjects with dose escalation, especially 
in those with escalation to 1.75 mg/kg.

dose level (ACE-536-MDS-001)

To understand if dose escalation improved response durability, the relation between dose escalation 
and multiple response episodes was summarised (see Table 9) and inspected in a swimmer plot 
(Figure 5).

entire treatment phase (ACE-536-MDS-001)

entire treatment phase in subjects who achieved red blood cell transfusion independence ≥8 
weeks in week 1 to week 48 (ACE-536-MDS-001) 
Exposure-efficacy response relationship 
Two sets of exposure-efficacy analyses were therefore conducted: one included all luspatercept-treated 
subjects (N = 153) and the other included only the subjects without dose escalation (N = 51). The 
analysis with all subjects provided the real-world “exposure-response” relationship under the titration 
dosing regimen and was more suitable for identifying risk factors for efficacy, but it was less sensitive 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 57/195 
 
  
  
 
 
 
for determining an exposure-dependent event due to the selection bias. The analysis with subjects who 
did not have any dose escalation was more sensitive to exposure-dependent events, but it might 
inflate the response rate and affect identification of risk factors by excluding non-responders who 
underwent dose escalation. Although both approaches have limitations, the combination of both 
allowed a reasonable assessment of the effective exposure (dose). 
For RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks in Week 1 to Week 24, no significant exposure (AUCavg24)-dependent trend was 
observed in both univariate and multivariate analyses, while for RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks in Week 1 to Week 
24, in the more sensitive analysis including subjects without dose escalation, the probability of 
achieving RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks was found to be significantly associated with AUCavg24 (odds ratio [OR] 
= 2.05 per 50 day•μg/mL increase in AUCavg24), but the response plateaued at the 2nd AUCavg24 
quartile. 
Although the E-R analyses demonstrated a significant treatment effect on RBC-TI and indicated an 
exposure-driven trend for RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks, the E-R curves for efficacy endpoints tested were 
generally nearly flat (plateaued at 1st or 2nd AUCavg24 quartile) for the following reasons: 
- 
- 
only the more effective doses were studied (1 to 1.75 mg/kg), 
luspatercept serum exposure (AUCavg24) largely overlapped between 1 to 1.75 mg/kg due to 
individual variability, 
-  when including all subjects, the E-R trend was obscured to some degree by the titration to- 
response regimen at which dose escalations (thus higher AUCavg24) occurred more frequently 
in non-responders and 
-  placebo-treated subjects were excluded from E-R models. 
In addition, the response as measured by RBC-TI was not sensitive to small changes in exposure, and 
transfusion decisions were made based on multiple clinical factors, which could vary among subjects. 
Therefore, the dosing regimen with the option of escalation to 1.75 mg/kg allowed most subjects to 
reach an efficacious exposure accounting for individual variability in sensitivity to the drug. 
The nearly flat E-R curve with responses at most AUC quartiles greater than those observed with 
placebo suggests that the maximum effective exposure of luspatercept was reached in most subjects 
for the tested efficacy endpoints under the current titration dosing regimen. 
The multivariate analysis suggested that the probability of achieving RBC-TI was reduced by high 
baseline RBC-T burden (≥ 6 units/8 weeks), high baseline EPO (> 500 U/L), and older age (OR = 0.56-
0.59 for a 10-year increase in age). On the other hand, the probability of achieving RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks 
was found to be greater in subjects with baseline total bilirubin > 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; 
originally defined as moderate/severe hepatic impairment by National Cancer Institute-Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group [NCI-ODWG] criteria). 
In a Kaplan-Meier analysis stratified by luspatercept serum exposure level (≤ median AUCavg48 vs. > 
median AUCavg48) in early responders (Week 1 - 24), there was no significant difference in the RBC-
TI duration between low and high AUCavg48 groups.

c After completion of the Week 25 Visit MDS disease assessment by the investigator, subjects who experienced 
clinical benefit and had not experienced disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria for altering natural history of 
MDS (Cheson, 2006), may have continued double-blind treatment with IP beyond the Week 25 Visit in the 
Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until they met the protocol discontinuation criteria. 
d The MDS disease assessment was to be repeated by the investigator at Extension Cycle 8, Day 1 and Day 1 of 
every eighth Extension Cycle thereafter (ie, Extension Cycle 8, 16, 24+, etc, or every 24 weeks in the event of dose 
delays) until the subject was discontinued from treatment. For subjects to continue double-blind treatment in the 
Extension Phase of the Treatment Period, each MDS disease assessment had to confirm continued clinical benefit 
and absence of disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria for altering natural history of MDS (Cheson, 2006).

MDS disease assessment 
Screening MDS diagnosis confirmation required bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow aspirate, and 
peripheral blood samples. Samples may have been reviewed locally but must also have been sent to 
the central laboratory for analysis.  
Cytomorphology assessment:  
Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were prepared locally and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis to confirm MDS diagnosis and baseline WHO prior to randomization. 
If the central reviewer and local pathologist disagreed on the diagnosis of a subject, a third reviewer at 
the central laboratory may have been consulted to provide an adjudication assessment. The central 
laboratory may also have requested the site to send in samples reviewed by the local pathologist for 
further assessment.  
Cytogenetics analysis:  
The central laboratory conducted cytogenetic analysis throughout the study. The central laboratory 
provided standardized analysis and reporting for all subjects. Bone marrow samples were sent to the 
central laboratory for processing and cytogenetic analysis prior to randomization. 
Treatments 
Subjects were assigned to treatment as per one of the following regimens: 
• 
Experimental group: Luspatercept at a starting dose level of 1.0 mg/kg SC injection q3w 
(administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle); or 
• 
Control group: Placebo (volume equivalent to experimental group) SC injection q3w 
(administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle) 
Luspatercept or placebo was administered as an SC injection to subjects by the study staff at the 
clinical site. Subjects were required to undergo assessments of Hgb, blood pressure, and weight prior 
to each IP administration. 
Subcutaneous injections were given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses 
requiring reconstituted volume greater than 1.2 mL were divided into separate similar volume 
injections across separate sites, using the same anatomical location, but on opposite sides of the body 
(e.g., left thigh and right thigh). The maximum volume per SC injection should not have exceeded 1.2 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020

mL. The maximum total dose per administration did not exceed 168 mg, which resulted in 3.36 mL 
maximum total volume after reconstitution. 
The first dose of IP (either luspatercept or matching placebo) was to be administered within 3 days 
after randomization and could have been on the same day of randomization. 
Subjects received IP on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle. 
In both treatment groups, best supportive care (BSC) may have been used in combination with the IP 
when clinically indicated per investigator. Best supportive care included, but was not limited to, 
treatment with RBC transfusions; antibiotic, antiviral, and/or antifungal therapy; and nutritional 
support as needed. Best supportive care for this study excluded the use of ESAs. 
Permitted concomitant medication 
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors (i.e., G-CSF, GM-CSF) were allowed only in cases of neutropenic 
fever or as clinically indicated per product label.  
Concurrent corticosteroids used for medical conditions other than MDS were allowed provided subject 
was on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week prior to randomization.  
Administration of attenuated vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine) was allowed if clinically indicated, per 
investigator’s discretion. 
Iron chelation therapy (ICT) 
Subjects who were using ICTs at the time of randomization were to be on a stable or decreasing dose 
for at least 8 weeks. Concurrent treatment with ICTs during the Treatment Period was allowed at the 
discretion of the investigator and was recommended to be used per product label. 
Prohibited concomitant medications 
Best supportive care for this study specifically excluded cancer surgery, immunotherapy, biologic 
therapy, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy where the goal was to eradicate or slow the 
progression of the disease. 
The following concomitant medications were specifically excluded during the course of the study: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic, targeted or investigational agents/therapies 
Azacitidine, decitabine, or other HMAs 
Lenalidomide, thalidomide, and other IMiDs 
Erythropoietin stimulating agents and other RBC hematopoietic growth factors (eg, IL-3). 
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors (ie, G-CSF, GM-CSF), except in cases of neutropenic 
fever or as clinically indicated per product label. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hydroxyurea 
Androgens, unless to treat hypogonadism 
Oral retinoids (topical retinoids were permitted) 
Arsenic trioxide 
Interferon

Decision criteria for Rescue RBC transfusions 
Concurrent treatment for anaemia with blood transfusions was allowed, at the discretion of the 
investigator, for low Hgb levels, symptoms associated with anaemia (e.g., hemodynamic or pulmonary 
compromise requiring treatment), or comorbidity. For any RBC transfusions received during the study, 
information on Hgb values just prior to transfusion was collected. Each subject had a “pretransfusion 
Hgb threshold” for requiring transfusion during the study, which was to be determined based on 
transfusion history. Baseline pretransfusion Hgb threshold was the mean of all documented 
pretransfusion Hgb values during the 16 weeks prior to Dose 1 Day 1.  
During treatment, if the pretransfusion Hgb level was increased by ≥ 1.0 g/dL (at the time of a next 
anticipated transfusion event) compared with the pretransfusion Hgb threshold for that subject, 
transfusion should have been delayed by a minimum of 7 days and/or the number of units transfused 
should have been reduced by 1 or more RBC units. Subjects may have been transfused at the 
investigator’s discretion for symptoms related to anaemia or other requirements (e.g., infection). 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The starting dose level was 1.0 mg/kg and the maximum dose level 1.75 mg/kg. Dose reduction was 
also possible. 
Increase:  
If all criteria below were met, the dose may have been increased by 1 dose level, starting as soon as 
Cycle 3 Day 1 and assessed by the investigator prior to every subsequent treatment cycle. 
o 
Subject had ≥ 1 RBC transfusion event (for pretransfusion Hgb of < 9 g/dL) during the 2 most 
recent prior treatment cycles (~ 6 weeks) 
o 
o 
The 2 most recent prior treatment cycles assessed must have been at the same dose level 
Subject must not have met protocol dose delay and/or reduction criteria in the 2  most recent 
treatment cycles (exception of dose delay required due to influence of RBC transfusions). 
Reduction or delay:  
Dose delay and/or reduction or discontinuation may have been required due to increased Hgb or AEs in 
either treatment group (luspatercept or placebo). 
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
•  To evaluate Red Blood Cell-transfusion independence (RBC-TI) of luspatercept compared with 
placebo for the treatment of anaemia due to IPSS-R very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS 
in subjects with ring sideroblasts who required RBC transfusions. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To assess the safety and tolerability of luspatercept compared with placebo 
•  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept on reduction in RBC transfusions, increase in Hgb, 
duration of RBC-TI, improvement in HRQoL (ie, European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30]), increase in neutrophils, 
increase in platelets, decrease in serum ferritin, decrease in ICT use, and time to RBC-TI 
compared with placebo

Rationale for the Efficacy Endpoints Related to Red Blood Cell Transfusion Independence 
In order to mitigate the potential bias should subjects in the control group (placebo group) drop out 
early due to the lack of a rapid response, the primary efficacy analysis in this study was the proportion 
of subjects achieving RBC-TI with a duration of ≥ 8 weeks measured at 24 weeks. 
After completion of the MDS disease assessment by the investigator at the Week 25 Visit, subjects who 
exhibited clinical benefit with no evidence of disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria for altering 
natural history of MDS (Cheson, 2006) were to continue the double-blind treatment. The proportion of 
subjects achieving RBC-TI with a duration of ≥ 8 weeks at 48 weeks was assessed as a secondary 
endpoint to capture potential late responders. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI 
with a duration of ≥ 12 weeks was assessed as a key secondary endpoint, representing extended 
duration of benefit achieved with IP. 
MDS Disease Assessment (week 25 visit) 
Treatment response was assessed locally by the investigator in accordance with IWG 2006 criteria for 
MDS (Cheson, 2006) with modifications for the erythroid response criteria through transfusion 
assessments, haematology laboratory parameters, peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspirates 
and/or biopsies, and cytogenetics. 
Central laboratory results from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (e.g., cytomorphology, 
cytogenetics analysis) were required as part of the MDS disease assessment. 
In order for the subjects to remain on double-blind treatment beyond the first 24 calendar weeks, the 
following criteria must have been confirmed upon the completion of the MDS disease assessment by 
the investigator: 
•  Evidence of clinical benefit (e.g., decrease in RBC transfusion requirement compared with 
baseline requirement or Hgb increase compared with baseline); and  
•  Absence of disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria for altering natural history of MDS 
(Cheson, 2006) 
Efficacy data were also reviewed by an external unblinded DMC and external blinded steering 
committee at specified time points detailed in each committees’ respective charters. 
Sample size 
A total sample size of 210 (140 in experimental arm [luspatercept (ACE-536)], 70 in control arm 
[placebo]) will have 90% power to detect the difference between a response (RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks Week 
1 through Week 24) rate of 0.30 in the experimental arm (luspatercept [ACE-536]) and a response 
rate of 0.10 in the control arm (placebo). The sample size calculation is based on one sided alpha of 
0.025, test statistics on difference of proportions using pooled estimate of variance and 10% dropout 
rate. 
An interim analysis to assess futility on the primary and key secondary endpoint will be performed 
when approximately 105 subjects have completed the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period (first 24 
weeks of double-blind treatment) or discontinued before reaching 24 weeks of double-blind treatment 
(50% information for primary endpoint). There will be no plan to claim luspatercept superiority based 
on efficacy results so the type I error rate remains at 0.025 one sided for the final analysis.

Randomisation 
Randomization occurred by a central randomization procedure using integrated response technology 
(IRT). Authorized site personnel must contact the IRT for randomization, study drug assignment at the 
beginning of each cycle, to register dose reductions or titrations, and treatment discontinuation. 
Confirmation of each call will be sent to the investigational site and Celgene. After randomization, no 
crossover between the treatment arms will be permitted at any point during the study. 
Subjects were randomized with a ratio of 2:1 to either treatment with luspatercept or placebo. 
Randomisation was additionally stratified by RBC Transfusion burden at baseline (≥ 6 RBC units/8 
weeks and < 6 RBC units/8 weeks [mean of the two consecutive 8 weeks periods immediately prior to 
randomization)]) and by IPSS-R at baseline (Very low/low and Intermediate). 
Randomization, drug dispensing, dose reduction/titration, and drug discontinuation were accomplished 
by an IRT system. Authorized site personnel must have contacted the IRT for randomization, IP 
assignment at the beginning of each cycle, registering dose reductions or titrations, and treatment 
discontinuation. Confirmation of each call was to be sent to the investigational site and Celgene. 
Blinding (masking) 
All subjects, study site staff, and Celgene representatives, with the exception of designated individuals 
(e.g., the pharmacist at the investigational site, the bioanalytical laboratory), remained blinded to all 
treatment assignments until all subjects completed the study or at the time the study was unblinded 
(per DMC recommendation) and the database was locked. 
The designated site individual (e.g., the pharmacist) at the investigational site used a syringe (that 
exactly matched the syringe used for reconstituted luspatercept) and sterile normal saline (0.9% 
sodium chloride for injection) to prepare a matching placebo. Thus, the designated site individual at 
the investigational site was unblinded and gave investigators and their staff luspatercept and placebo 
in a blinded manner. 
The blind was not to be broken during the course of the study unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, it was absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it was medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject was receiving, IP had to be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of the 
investigator, continuing IP could have negatively affected the outcome of the subject’s treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets  
The following analysis populations were planned for this study: 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomized subjects, regardless of whether or not the 
subject met the eligibility criteria or received IP. All efficacy analyses were conducted for the 
ITT population. Subjects were analysed based on randomized treatment group. 
•  Safety population: all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP. The 
safety population was used for all safety analyses. Subjects were analysed according to IP they 
actually received. 
•  Health-related QoL evaluable population: all subjects in the ITT population who completed the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline assessment visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 67/195 
 
  
  
 
•  Pharmacokinetic population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of luspatercept and had 
measurable luspatercept serum concentrations 
Handling of Dropouts, Missing Data and Intercurrent events 
Missing data were imputed and reference was made to Appendix A of the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9) for 
comprehensive information on handling of missing data. This could however not be found. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 56-day RBC transfusion independence, the response rate will be 
calculated using the number of responders divided by number of subjects (responders plus non-
responders). Subjects discontinued from the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period without achieving 
at least 56 days consecutive of RBC transfusion independence will be counted as nonresponders. 
Since the Hgb value can be influenced by a RBC transfusion, the Hgb values used in efficacy analyses 
are required to satisfy the 14/3-day rule below: 
14/3-day rule: Only Hgb values that are at least 14 days after a transfusion may be used unless there 
is another transfusion within 3 days after the Hgb assessment. If this occurs, the second Hgb value 
may be used (despite being < 14 days after the previous transfusion).  
The rationale is that the Hgb value < 14 days from the first transfusion was only somewhat influenced 
by that transfusion. In efficacy analyses, after applying above 14/3-day rule, the baseline Hgb value is 
defined as the lowest Hgb value from the central, local laboratory, or pre-transfusion Hgb from 
transfusion records that is within 35 days on or prior to the first dose of IP if it is available. 
Erythropoietin value can also be influenced by a RBC transfusion. Baseline EPO is defined as the 
highest EPO value within 35 days of the first dose of IP. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 56-day RBC transfusion independence, the response rate was 
calculated using the number of responders divided by number of subjects (responders plus non-
responders). Subjects discontinued from the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period without achieving 
at least 56 days consecutive of RBC transfusion independence will be counted as nonresponders. The 
response rates of the subjects who were randomized to luspatercept and the placebo were calculated. 
In the primary efficacy analysis, the following statistical hypothesis was tested: 
H0: P1= P2 
Ha: P1> P2 
where P1 denotes the true response rate in the luspatercept group, and P2 denotes the true response 
rate in the placebo group. 
The number and percentage of subjects who achieved RBC-TI and corresponding 97.5% upper bound 
confidence interval (CI) were tabulated and presented by treatment group. The Cochran- Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test was used to test the difference between the 2 response rates at a 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025, stratifying for average baseline RBC transfusion requirement (≥ 6 units 
versus < 6 units of RBC per 8 weeks) and baseline IPSS-R score (very low or low versus intermediate). 
The p-value from the stratified CMH chi-square test was to be the confirmatory p-value for the test of 
the null hypothesis that the proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI was equal between the 2 
treatment groups. If the p-value was less than 0.025, the null hypothesis was rejected, indicating that 
the true response rate in the luspatercept treatment group was more than the true response rate in 
the placebo group. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 68/195 
 
  
  
 
The key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with duration of ≥ 12 weeks, was 
tested in the same manner as the primary efficacy endpoint using the CMH test. 
The analyses for the key secondary endpoint were based on the ITT population. In order to perform 
hypothesis testing on multiple endpoints while controlling the overall Type I error rate, a sequential 
testing approach was employed where the order of the endpoints to be tested was prespecified. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was tested first at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. If superiority of 
luspatercept was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, then the key secondary endpoint was 
tested, at a 1-sided 0.025 significance level.

demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint (RBC-TI of ≥ 8 weeks), at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. 
b 2-sided p-value from Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified for average baseline RBC transfusion requirement (≥ 
6 units versus < 6 units of RBC per 8 weeks), and baseline IPSS-R score (very low or low versus intermediate).

Post hoc analysis of change from baseline in RBC transfusion rates 
In Table 18, change in the frequency of postbaseline transfusion events between the 2 treatment 
groups was analyzed for the overall ITT population regardless of treatment discontinuation by 24-week 
intervals and overall for Weeks 1 to 48 using a negative binomial regression model for the analysis of 
count data. Baseline for these analyses is defined as the number of transfusion events during the 24-
week interval on or prior to the first dose date. As historical transfusion records in Study ACE-536-
MDS-001 were only collected for 16 weeks prior to randomization, the 24-week baseline transfusion 
frequency was calculated as the event rate in the 16 weeks prior to the first dose multiplied by 1.5. 
Missing data were imputed using baseline values.

a 
Defined as the number of transfusion events during the 24-week interval on or prior to first dose for comparability 
to the 24-week on-treatment intervals. As transfusion data were collected for 16 weeks prior to randomization, the 
baseline transfusion frequency was calculated as the event rate in the 16 weeks prior to the first dose * 1.5. 
b 
Nominal p-value and 95% CI are from negative binomial regression model with post-baseline transfusion 
frequency as dependent variable, and with treatment arm, baseline RBC transfusion burden (≥ 6 units versus 
< 6 RBC units/8 weeks), and baseline IPSS-R (very low/low versus intermediate), and baseline RBC transfusion 
event frequency per 24 weeks as independent variables. 
All observed data from all subjects were included through Day 336. This includes data collected after 
treatment discontinuation for subjects who discontinued treatment before Day 336. If a subject’s 
transfusion records ended prior to Day 336, then the number of transfusion events is imputed from the 
last visit date where transfusion (yes/no) was recorded up to Day 336. Imputation is based on the 
average number of RBC transfusion events in the 24 weeks prior to first dose (calculated on a per day 
basis). 
Post Hoc Analysis of RBC Transfusion Units 
The mean difference in RBC transfusion units between treatment groups in the intervals from Week 1 
to Week 24 and Week 25 to Week 48 was determined using ANCOVA to compare the treatment 
difference between groups. This analysis included the parameter of interest in the time interval (ie, 
number of RBC units transfused) as the dependent variable, treatment group (2 levels) as a factor, 
and baseline value (ie, transfusion units during the 24-week baseline period) as a covariate. The 
analysis was stratified by average baseline RBC transfusion requirement (≥ 6 RBC units versus < 6 
RBC units/8 weeks) and baseline IPSS-R (very low or low versus intermediate). If a subject’s record 
was curtailed prior to Day 336, then the data were imputed from baseline as follows: 
The number of transfusion units was imputed from the last visit date where transfusion (yes/no) was

a 
If a subject’s record of transfusion was curtailed prior to Day 336 (ie, Week 48), then the number of transfusion 
units is imputed from the last visit date where transfusion (yes/no) was recorded up to Day 336. Imputation is

Day 1 visit label for analysis at Week 48. If missing, the data were searched for an event date within the first dose 
date + 168 (± 14 days) for Week 24, or within the first dose date + 336 (± 14 days) for Week 48. If no hemoglobin 
values were found in the designated intervals, the hemoglobin value was imputed using the baseline hemoglobin 
value (as defined in Section 5.1 of the ACE-536-MDS-001 SAP).

hemoglobin value as a covariate, stratifying by average baseline RBC transfusion requirement (≥ 6 RBC units 
versus < 6 RBC units/8 weeks), and baseline IPSS-R (very low or low versus intermediate). 
All central laboratory hemoglobin values were included in the analysis after applying the 14/3 rule to take into 
account RBC transfusions as intercurrent events with a potential impact on hemoglobin levels. 
Modified Hematologic improvement – Erythroid (mHI-E) (Table 21; excerpt of the originally 
provided) 
For subjects with baseline RBC transfusion burden of ≥ 4 units/8 weeks (HTB), mHI-E was defined as a 
reduction in RBC transfusion of at least 4 units/8 weeks.  
For subjects with baseline RBC transfusion burden of < 4 units/8 weeks (LTB), mHI-E was defined as a 
mean increase in haemoglobin of ≥ 1.5 g/dL for 8 weeks in the absence of RBC transfusions. 
Table 19: Analysis of subjects who achieved mHI-E (ITT population) 
Of note, no conclusions can be drawn on the haematologic improvement in terms of neutrophils and 
platelets (as defined by the IWG MDS heaemtologic response criteria), since an insufficient number of 
patients had low baseline levels.

The mean difference between treatment groups in serum ferritin, and mean daily dose of ICT in the

treatment group (2 levels) as a factor, and baseline value (ie, baseline serum ferritin, or baseline mean 
daily dose of ICT) as a covariate. The analysis was stratified by average baseline RBC transfusion

versus intermediate). If a subject’s record was curtailed prior to Day 336, then the data were imputed 
from baseline as follows: 
For serum ferritin, missing values at protocol-defined scheduled visits (ie, no values within the analysis 
interval) were imputed using the baseline value. 
For ICT, the mean daily dose of ICT from the stop date of the last record up to Day 336 was imputed 
from the baseline mean daily dose.

Health-related Quality of Life and Healthcare Resource Utilization Endpoints 
The main HRQoL questionnaire used was the EORTC QLQ-C30.  
The HRQoL-evaluable population consisted of 225 subjects, 149 in the luspatercept group and 76 in 
the placebo group (only 4 subjects from the luspatercept treatment group were excluded). 
Mean scores were comparable at baseline between treatment groups across all domains of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for both treatment groups 
across all the primary domains of interest over the 24-week treatment phase. The distributions of 
observed change scores across the 5 primary domains of interest (fatigue, dyspnea, global health 
status, physical functioning, emotional functioning) and the scheduled visits within the 24-week 
treatment phase showed that HRQoL was maintained over time and comparable between treatment 
groups (ie, no clinically meaningful changes). 
According to the applicant, maintenance of HRQoL is a clinically relevant outcome in this population 
since HRQoL is expected to worsen over time in MDS patients due to chronic transfusions (Oliva, 
2012).  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Forest plots were provided for the primary endpoint (week 1-24), key secondary endpoint (week 1-24) 
and mHI-E (week 1-24) for the following subgroups: age (≤ 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and ≥ 75 years), 
gender, time since initial diagnosis, ECOG performance status, average baseline transfusion burden (< 
4, ≥ 4 and < 6, ≥ 6 units), IPSS-R, baseline serum EPO (< 100, 100 to < 200, 200 to 500, and > 500 
U/L), renal (creatinine clearance > 40 to 60 versus ≥ 60 mL/min) (and several more, please see clinical 
assessment report).

Point estimates mostly favoured Luspatercept treatment. The small sample sizes in each group must 
be kept in mind; however, these anayses are overall in support of the primary endpoint and strengthen 
the internal validity of the trial.

a 
If a subject’s record of transfusion was curtailed prior to Day 336 (ie, Week 48), then the number of transfusion 
units is imputed from the last visit date where transfusion (yes/no) was recorded up to Day 336. Imputation is based on the average 
number of RBC units transfused in the 24 weeks prior to first dose (calculated on a units per day basis).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Due to the differences in the subject populations and efficacy endpoints between the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies, the Phase 2 and Phase 3 data sets were not pooled for integrated efficacy analyses. 
However, in order to compare efficacy data across studies, results from Study ACE-536-MDS-001 were 
presented side-by-side with the results from the combined Phase 2 studies.  
The combined Phase 2 data were presented by dose group: < 1.0 mg/kg and ≥ 1.0 mg/kg. In addition, 
a subset of subjects from the Phase 2 studies that approximated the dosing of Study ACE-536-MDS-
001 and also matched key inclusion criteria of Study ACE-536-MDS-001 were defined as follows: 
-  baseline RBC transfusion burden of ≥ 2 units/8 weeks 
-  RS+ 
-  prior exposure to ESA or endogenous EPO > 200 U/L 
This subset of Phase 2 subjects is referred to as the “Phase 3-like Population” of the Phase 2 studies 
and is presented side-by-side with the Phase 3 data for subjects in the “Phase 3-like population” who 
received luspatercept ≥ 1.0 mg/kg. The “Phase 3-like Population” was identified for MDS SCE analysis 
using the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints from Study ACE-536-MDS-001, as well

as subgroup analyses. The number of subjects for analysis in the MDS SCE are shown in the table 
below. 
Table 31: Number of subjects for analysis 
Duration of treatment and follow-up is another consideration in comparisons between the Phase 3 and 
Phase 2 studies. The median duration of treatment for the data cut included in this submission was 
longer in Phase 2: 55 weeks (min, 12; max, 165) in extension Study A536-06) than in Study ACE-536-
MDS-001: 49 weeks (min, 6; max 114) in the luspatercept + BSC group and 24 weeks (min, 7; max, 
89) in the placebo + BSC group).

Subject disposition across studies: 
Table 32: Subject disposition (ITT population)
Baseline characteristics were generally consistent with the phase 3 study population, except for a 
higher percentage of subjects with intermediate risk MDS (42.9% vs. 16.3%), a higher median EPO 
level at baseline (271.4 U/L vs. 156.9 U/L), and a greater variety of MDS subtypes based on the WHO 
classification system. Patients had lower mean baseline Hgb (7.3 g/dL) and a higher proportion of 
patients with higher baseline burden (≥ 6 units of RBC transfusion/8weeks). In addition, a slightly 
lower percentage of subjects had used prior ESA therapy compared with Study ACE-536-MDS-001 
(78.6% versus > 90%) and the median duration of ESA therapy was slightly shorter (9.6 months 
versus 11.8 months). 
Results 
The RBC-TI response rate of 32.1% (9/28) during Week 1 to Week 24 for the “Phase 3-like 
Population” was consistent with the response rate in the luspatercept group of Study ACE-536-MDS-
001. Four of 9 (44.4%) subjects maintained response at the last evaluation. 
An additional subject in the “Phase 3-like Population” achieved response after Week 24, for a total of 
10 responders during Week 1 to Week 48. The median duration of the longest single episode of RBC-TI 
was 41.7 weeks (95% CI: 8.7, NE) for these 10 responders. The longer duration of response for the 
Week 1 to Week 24 responders in the “Phase 3-like Population” reflects the impact of individual

subjects on the outcome with a small sample size (ie, the additional responder after Week 24 who had 
a shorter duration of response). 
The RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks response rates for the “Phase 3-like Population”were 25.0% (7/28) during 
Week 1 to Week 24 and 28.6% (8/28) during Week 1 to Week 48. Both results were consistent with 
the response rates in the luspatercept group of Study ACE-536-MDS-001. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of the longest single episode of RBC-TI was 94.9 
weeks (95% CI: 8.1, not estimable [NE]) for the 9 responders. The longer median duration of 
response in the “Phase 3-like Population” compared with Study ACE-536-MDS-001 (94.9 weeks versus 
30.6 weeks) reflects the earlier start date of the Phase 2 studies, and thus, the longer duration of 
treatment and follow-up. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, in elderly or paediatric patients (not included 
in the label) were conducted in the MDS indication. 
Age  
Table 33: Baseline characteristics of subjects – continuous data 
Starting dose adjustments based on age are not supported by PK, efficacy, safety, and E-R data. 
Although the population PK analysis suggested that luspatercept CL/F decreased with age, the effect 
size was modest (exponential coefficient = -0.534) and is not anticipated to influence luspatercept 
serum exposure substantially. No large difference in luspatercept serum exposure was observed 
among age groups.  
In multivariate exposure-efficacy analyses for the pivotal Phase 3 study, older age appeared to be 
associated with a reduced chance of achieving RBC-TI, but this effect was not considered critical given 
that an age effect was not observed in the more robust integrated exposure-efficacy analyses. In 
addition, a treatment effect in favour of luspatercept over placebo was observed across all age groups 
in subgroup analyses for efficacy. 
Renal impairment: 
No clinically significant differences in Cmax.ss and AUCss were found across renal function groups 
(normal, mild renal impairment, and moderate renal impairment). 
No starting dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(eGFR 89 – 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The recommendation is supported by PK, efficacy, safety, and E-R 
data. Subgroup analyses results from phase 3 data for mild/moderate renal impairment are consistent 
with the overall treatment effect. No dose recommendation can be made for patients with eGFR < 30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 due to the lack of clinical data. 
Hepatic impairment: 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 105/195 
 
  
  
 
 
No clinically significant differences in Cmax.ss and AUCss were found across hepatic function groups 
defined by NCI-ODWG criteria (normal, mild hepatic impairment, and moderate/severe hepatic 
impairment). No clinically significant differences in Cmax.ss and AUCss were predicted for subjects 
with extreme baseline albumin values and those with normal albumin values. Baseline liver enzymes 
(AST and ALT, up to ~3 x ULN) had also no clinically meaningful effect on luspatercept PK. 
In MDS studies, a significant portion of luspatercept treated subjects was defined by the NCI-ODWG 
criteria to have compromised hepatic function at baseline, including 31.5% (82/260) of subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1-1.5 x ULN or AST or ALT > ULN), 8.8% (23/260) with 
moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN, any ALT or AST), and 0.4% (1/260) with 
severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, any ALT or AST).  
In β-thalassemia studies, more subjects were classified as having severe hepatic impairment (N = 39) 
by the NCI-ODWG criteria due to their elevated total bilirubin. However, most of the subjects had 
elevated total bilirubin without increases in liver enzymes, suggesting the bilirubin elevations might not 
necessarily be of hepatic origin. Total bilirubin increases could be confounded by ineffective 
erythropoiesis with haemolysis and apoptosis, which are clinical features of MDS and β-thalassemia. 
Thus, according to the applicant, the NCI-ODWG criteria may not be a desirable measure of hepatic 
function in the MDS population. 
Subjects with a baseline total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN (or moderate/severe hepatic impairment by the 
NCI-ODWG criteria) showed better efficacy than those with lower baseline total bilirubin even though 
their mean exposure was comparable. This observation was supported by the exposure-efficacy 
analysis in which the probability was statistically greater in achieving RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks, RBC-TI ≥ 12 
week, or mHI-E for luspatercept-treated subjects with a baseline total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN after 
accounting for the effect of luspatercept exposure and significant baseline risk factors. The effect of 
high bilirubin implied that luspatercept may be more efficacious in a subgroup of subjects, in whom the 
increased bilirubin results from enhanced ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis, though further 
verification may be needed. No robust conclusions can be drawn based on the limited number of cases 
observed. No dose recommendation can be made for patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 ULN due to 
insufficient clinical data. 
Supportive studies 
Besides the pivotal phase 3 study ACE-536-MDS-001, two phase 2 studies were submitted to support 
luspatercept for the treatment of MDS; A536-03 and A536-05 (please see dose response study section 
above). Of note, several subgroups in the broader phase 2 populations were evaluated for erythroid 
response and RBC transfusion independence. There are indications that patients eg. with RS, SF3B1 
mutation, lower baseline EPO or no prior ESA treatment might better respond to luspatercept 
treatment. Furthermore there are two phase 2 studies and one phase 3 study submitted to support the 
‘Beta-Thalassaemia’ indication, which also evaluate erythroid response. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1.0 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks. 
In patients who are not RBC transfusion-free after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.0 mg/kg 
starting dose, the Reblozyl dose should be increased to 1.33 mg/kg. If patients are not RBC 
transfusion-free after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.33 mg/kg dose level, the Reblozyl dose 
should be increased to 1.75 mg/kg. The dose should not be increased more frequently than every 6 
weeks (2 doses) or beyond the maximum dose of 1.75 mg/kg. The applicant justifies the titration 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 106/195 
 
  
  
 
scheme (amongst others) by keeping the risk of exaggerated Hgb increase (>2g/dL) low, when 
starting at lower doses (i.e. 1 mg/kg). The transfusion-reducing effect of luspatercept in subjects with 
MDS relies on its ability to increase Hgb. Since the dosing schedule resulted in sustained Hgb response 
in LTB subjects, this should also be appropriate for reducing the frequency of RBC transfusions. In the 
phase 3 study, reasons for dose reductions in the active treatment arm were an increase in Hgb ≥2 
g/dL compared to previous treatment cycle (2%), suspected related Grade 3 AE (3.3%) and ‘other’ 
(1.3%). Reasons for dose delays were: suspected related Grade 3 AE (2.6%), pre-dose Hgb ≥11.5 g/dL 
(6.5%), elevated WBC (2%), and Other (35.9%). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The target population is adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
with ring sideroblasts (RS) associated with transfusion dependent anaemia who are 
refractory/intolerant or ineligible to ESA therapy.  
The application for treatment of MDS-related anaemia includes one pivotal multi-centre, double-blind 
randomised phase 3 trial (ACE-536-MDS-001) and one open label phase 2 study (multi-dose 
ascending) with cross-over to an open label extension study (A536-03/05).  
The single pivotal study setting might be acceptable considering that the applicant conducted a second 
phase 3 study in the Beta-Thalassemia indication, for which the mechanism of action is the same, and 
results coming from this second study are considered supportive for the MDS indication. 
The open label phase 2 study recruited 107 subjects, out of which 28 had similar disease and baseline 
characteristics (baseline RBC transfusion burden of ≥ 2 units/8 weeks, RS+, prior exposure to ESA or 
endogenous EPO > 200 U/L) as the phase 3 population. The efficacy outcomes observed for the 
different endpoints were consistent with the phase 3 results.  
For the pivotal double-blind phase 3 trial, a total of 290 subjects were screened, of whom 229 were 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the luspatercept (n = 153) or placebo (n= 76) treatment groups. Patients 
were recruited over 65 centres in the US, Canada, Turkey and Europe. In Europe, patients from 48 
centres have been included (Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, France, Spain, Italy and 
Sweden), recruited overall 172 patients, and are considered representative for patients treated in the 
EU.  
Most subjects (95.6%) had a centrally reviewed diagnosis of MDS classified as refractory cytopenia 
with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) per the WHO 2008 criteria, which was well-balanced between the 
luspatercept and placebo groups (94.8% and 97.4%, respectively). Approximately 75% of subjects 
had an MDS diagnosis of > 2 years before entering the study.  
Most subjects (83%) were classified as having an IPSS-R score of very low/low (10.5% were IPSS-R 
very low and 72.5% IPSS-R low), the remaining were classified as intermediate. The treatment arms 
were largely balanced in terms of IPSS-R category. 
The majority (approximately 86%) of subjects had a serum EPO ≤ 500 U/L at baseline (median 
baseline EPO = 153.2 U/L). Overall, approximately 60% of the subjects had a baseline EPO < 200 U/L 
with a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the placebo treatment arm. A slightly higher proportion 
of subjects in the luspatercept treatment group had EPO > 200 to 500 U/L (28.1 %) compared with 
the placebo group (19.7%). This imbalance is not considered relevant for the interpretation of the 
results. 
Most included patients were ESA therapy refractory (97.3% for luspatercept and 98.6% for placebo in 
the phase 3 study). 2.7% (n=4) of patients in the luspatercept group and 1.4% (n=1) in the placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 107/195 
 
  
  
 
group were intolerant. 3.3% (n=5) of patients in the luspatercept and 7.9% (n=6) in the placebo arm 
were ESA ineligible with elevated serum EPO > 200 U/L and did not previously receive ESA therapy. 
Appropriate justification based on the mechanism of action and individual response data was provided. 
There is currently no clear indication that a differential response to treatment is to be expected in the 
different ESA subgroups.  
The median age was 71.0 years (range: 26 to 95 years), with approximately 80% of subjects ≥ 65 
years of age and > 36% of subjects ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of subjects were male (62.9%). 
The majority of subjects (90.0%) had the SF3B1 mutation: 92.2% and 85.5% for luspatercept and 
placebo groups, respectively. 
The median 8-week RBC transfusion volume over the 16 weeks was 5.0 units in both groups (range 1-
15 for the active treatment arm and 2-20 for the placebo arm). The number of subjects available for 
analysis is limited for subjects with baseline transfusion burden > 8 RBC units/8 week (15% and 
18.4% for luspatercept and placebo, respectively), and particularly for subjects with baseline 
transfusion burden > 12 RBC units/8 weeks (2.6% and 1.3% for luspatercept and placebo, 
respectively). This has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Of note, the applicant’s definition of transfusion dependence (TD) seems to be based on the IWG 2006 
response criteria (Cheson et al., Blood 2006), but the additional classification of TD by low and high 
transfusion burden (2-3 RBC units/8 weeks and ≥4 RBC units/ 8 weeks averaged over two consecutive 
8 weeks-periods, respectively)  also appears to be in accordance with the ‘Proposals for revised IWG 
2018 hematological response criteria in patients with MDS included in clinical trials’ (Platzecker et al., 
Blood 2019). The employed endpoints however differ from both IWG 2006 and 2018 MDS response 
criteria. Post hoc analyses were provided using the definitions of the MDS 2018 criteria. 
The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 7.7 g/dL and was similar between treatment groups.  
Median baseline serum ferritin (centrally assessed) was 1101.9 μg/L, which was consistent with 
historical serum ferritin levels from local evaluations that were available in approximately 70% if 
subjects (median: 1242.5 μg/L).   
Low proportions of patients had platelet counts <100*109/L (5.2 and 7.9 % for luspatercept and 
placebo); the majority of patients had platelet counts of 100 to 400*109/L (83.7 and 80.3%, 
respectively), and 11.1 and 11.8%, respectively, had platelets >400*109/L. Mean platelet counts at 
baseline were 259.3 and 251.7 *109/L for luspatercept and placebo, respectively.  
Similarly, low proportions of patients had lower ANC at baseline (<0.5 *109/L: 0.7 and 0% for 
luspatercept and placebo; 0.5- <1*109/L for 9.2 and 13.2%, respectively); the majority of patients 
had ANC ≥1.0*109/L (90.2 and 86.8% for luspatercept and placebo). Mean ANC were 2.8 and 2.7 * 
109/L for luspatercept and placebo. 
Taken together, the recruited study population corresponds to the intended target population and the 
baseline characteristics were overall balanced.  
Comparison to placebo is acceptable in view of the target population, for which no medicinal product is 
approved in the EU.  
The indication was amended during the evaluation to refer to patients with loss of/lack of response to 
prior ESA therapy and now reads: ‘who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for 
erythropoietin-based therapy’ (see section 5.1). The description of the population as ‘transfusion-
dependent’ rather than with ‘anaemia requiring transfusions’ has also been agreed.  
As based on the analyses and discussion provided, there is no indication that patients with a lower 
percentage of RS (5-15% RS with SF3B1 mutation) would respond differently to treatment than those

EMA/270924/2020 
Page 108/195 
 
  
  
 
investigated in the phase 3 study population (RS>15%), the wording related to RS (without further 
specification) is accepted.   
As a side note, the applicant’s plan to include ‘and have received or are not eligible for erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents’ only in regions where ESAs are approved in MDS is not supported, as for centrally 
authorised medicinal products the indication wording is standardised across EU countries. 
Study objectives and endpoints  
The goals of therapy comparing lower- and higher risk MDS patients are slightly different: in patients 
with lower risk disease, treatment is focused on improving cytopenias, given that a large proportion of 
patients develop anaemia and become transfusion-dependent. Improvement of quality of life, which is 
impaired not only by the symptoms related to cytopenia, but also by the chronic need of RBC 
transfusion in transfusion-dependent patients, is also an important treatment goal. In contrast, 
treatment in higher risk disease patients rather aims at modifying the disease course (partial or 
complete remission, stability of disease). 
In this regard, the primary objective, i.e. the evaluation of transfusion independence, is considered 
clinically relevant, but should be supported by secondary outcome parameters evaluating RBC 
transfusion over time, since also a reduction in transfusion units corresponds to a benefit to the 
patient. A reduction in transfusion frequency not only helps to reduce iron overload and other 
transfusion-related adverse effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, but should also improve quality 
of life. Further relevant secondary objectives that were analysed in this study to support the primary 
assessment were haemoglobin increase (post hoc), serum ferritin levels and QoL endpoints.  
The definition of the primary and key secondary endpoints and, more specifically, the time period 
chosen, i.e. any 8 (12) weeks during 24 and 48 weeks, does not provide any information on long-term 
benefits. It is evident that the longer the response to treatment, the higher the clinical benefit to the 
patient. 
From a technical perspective, the statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint is considered 
adequate. However, the responder criterion applied in the definition of the primary endpoint and 
related analyses are not considered optimal for the evaluation of treatment benefit in terms of a 
reduction in transfusion burden. Consequently, additional analyses focusing on the rate of RBC 
transfusions and transfusion units were requested. Results thereof were included in the SmPC.  
There is an important limitation to the study design: after 24 weeks of treatment, all patients were 
permitted to discontinue treatment, if progression of disease or no clinical benefit (defined as decrease 
in RBC requirements or increase in Hb compared with baseline) was experienced. Consequently, a 
large proportion of placebo patients were discontinued from treatment after week 24. Statistical 
evaluations of potential long-term treatment effects beyond 24 weeks are therefore hampered. 
Moreover, results including data from Weeks 25 to 48 were only presented for subjects who continue 
treatment and additional analyses were requested for subjects discontinuing treatment but remaining 
in the study and using conservative imputation methods. Of note, the SmPC states that luspatercept 
must be discontinued if no clinical benefit is observed after a maximum of two dose increases and 
overall 18 weeks of treatment, which mitigates concerns about long-term treatment of non-
responders. 
About 15% of subjects did not complete 24 Weeks of treatment. The proportion of subjects who did 
not complete 24 weeks of treatment was slightly lower in the placebo group than the luspatercept 
group. As subjects who discontinued treatment were counted as responders, in case they achieved 8 
weeks of transfusion independence prior to discontinuation, additional sensitivity analyses of the 
primary endpoint were requested.

The transfusion policy employed before and during the study may be different. Considering however 
the controlled, randomised study setting, no concern is raised. Decision criteria during the study 
included subjective elements (i.e. a transfusion was to be given in case of symptoms due to anaemia, 
regardless of the haemoglobin value). This underlines the importance of impeccable blinding 
techniques, which are however considered to be appropriate for this Phase 3 study. Of note, the GCP 
inspection that was conducted for the Phase 3 ß-Thalassaemia trial, which had similar blinding 
techniques, did not reveal any critical findings regarding the blinding of the study. Most of transfusions 
given at baseline and throughout the study were reported as ‘due to anemia’ and potential imbalances 
are not of concern.   
Dose may have been increased dependent on patient’s response (starting at 1 mg/kg with two 
incremental steps up to maximally 1.75 mg/kg) or decreased when adverse effects were noted. 
Corresponding SmPC recommendations were implemented. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Regarding efficacy results of the pivotal study, the primary and key secondary endpoints (RBC-TI ≥ 8 
weeks and ≥12 weeks during Weeks 1 through 24 and Weeks 1 through 48) were met, with statistically 
significantly higher response rates observed in the luspatercept treatment group compared with 
placebo. 
To substantiate efficacy across the whole range of baseline transfusion burden (LTB defined as 2-3 
units/8 weeks; HTB defined as ≥4 units/8 weeks), the applicant analysed the primary endpoint (for 
weeks 1-24) separately for the TB subgroups, for luspatercept and placebo, respectively. All analyses 
favoured luspatercept treatment (LTB: responder rates of 80.4 vs. 40%; HTB: responder rates of 
19.6% and 3.6%, respectively, for luspatercept and placebo). 
The following secondary outcomes support the primary endpoint and inform about long-term efficacy 
(bearing in mind above noted limitations as regards robustness): 
 ‘Change in RBC Units Transfused compared to baseline’ was analysed for a fixed 16-Week period 
(weeks 9 through 24 and weeks 33 through 48): Median change from baseline was -4.0 and 0 units 
(week 9-24) and -5.0 vs. -2.5 units (weeks 33-48) for luspatercept- and placebo-treated patients, 
respectively.  
Re-analysis of the transfusion data to estimate the ratio in transfusion rates between treatment arms 
based on a generalised linear model for count data (i.e. negative binomial regression) was presented. 
Model fit was adjusted for baseline transfusion burden, IPSS-R, and baseline transfusion frequency. 
This is considered adequate. Results are in support of a reduction of transfusion frequency. Estimates 
for the rate ratio (i.e. the number of transfusion events with luspatercept treatment divided by the 
number of transfusion events with placebo during Weeks 1 to 24 as well as weeks 25 to 48) range 
from 0.58 to 0.80 (95% CI) (week 1 to 24) as well as 0.60 to 0.86 (95%CI) (week 25 to 48) in favour 
of luspatercept. Since a large proportion of patients, in particular in the placebo arm, discontinued 
treatment after week 24, the results from the second period need to be cautiously interpreted.  
Results from the analysis of the mean difference in transfusion units using an ANCOVA model are quite 
similar to those presented for the number of transfusion events. These indicate a reduction of the 
transfused RBC units in the luspatercept group (compared to placebo) by about 3.6 to 7.1 units (95% 
CI) during Weeks 1 to 24. Considering that the estimated number of RBC units transfused in the 
placebo arm during this period is about 18, this equates to a rate ratio roughly between 60% to 80%.

When analysed by baseline burden (<6 and ≥ 6 units/ 8 weeks) or IPSS risk category at baseline (very 
low/low and intermediate), consistent results were observed, with a slightly lower effect difference to 
placebo in the higher transfusion burden group. 
Mean Hb values over time starting from baseline through week 48 showed that active-treated patients 
achieved sustained higher Hb values compared to placebo, also when analysed by transfusion burden. 
The mean increase in Hb over time appears a more informative, thus relevant endpoint as compared to 
the responder analysis. However, all Hb analyses are hampered by a large number of missing values. 
Further, the suitability of the 14/3 rule that was applied to exclude an influence of transfusions on Hb 
was questioned and sensitivity analyses excluding all Hb values within 14 days of a transfusion were 
requested. These results are consistent with the previous analyses. However, the Applicant also states 
that even the more stringent 14-day rule would be insufficient to exclude an influence of transfusion on 
Hb. Therefore, respective analyses need to be interpreted with caution and luspatercept´s effect on 
haemoglobin increase cannot be reliably quantified. 
To investigate regional differences in transfusion policy, the proportions of patients having received a 
transfusion at an hb level of more than 9 g/dL were evaluated. Overall, more patients in the 
luspatercept than in the placebo arm received at least one transfusion with a pre-transfusion Hb level 
of more than 9 g/dL (33.3 vs. 23.7%, respectively).  
A discussion was requested on responders with RBC-TI of at least 8 weeks who had Hb values below 8 
g/dL and for whom RBC-TI could theoretically be questioned as coming at the expense of a decrease in 
Hb rather than true transfusion independence. Reassuringly, in the luspatercept group, there was no 
haemoglobin value below the pretransfusion haemoglobin threshold that did not trigger a transfusion, 
and all subjects had an effective increment in haemoglobin during the RBC-TI period. The Applicant’s 
conclusion that all luspatercept-treated subjects with a Hb value of <8 g/dL can be considered true 
RBC-TI responders is supported. 
With regards to the endpoint ‘modified haematologic improvement – erythroid’ (mHI-E) (based on 
2006 IWG response criteria), a favourable effect of Luspatercept was evident in LTB patients (mean Hb 
increase of at least 1.5 g/dL in the absence of transfusions) and in HTB patients (a reduction of at least 
4 units/8 weeks). The additional analyses using the proposed IWG 2018 hematological response 
criteria (Platzecker et al., 2019) are supportive of a favourable effect in LTB and HTB patients in the 
luspatercept compared to the placebo arm. 
During the whole treatment period, more than one single response period has been observed in a 
proportion of responders. 18.9% of luspatercept responders were reported to be transfusion-
independent starting from the first dose for at least 48 weeks.  
At the latest cut-off date (07 January 2019), 31.4% (48/153) of the initially luspatercept treated 
patients were still on treatment (22 subjects discontinued since the last cut off), while none of the 
placebo patients remained on treatment.    
Several forest plots of subgroup analyses for the primary and main secondary endpoints mostly show 
consistent effects with the overall treatment effect. 
Regarding analyses on the mean change in daily dose of iron chelation therapy (ICT) and the change in 
serum ferritin, which were complemented by additional analyses with imputation of missing data by 
baseline, showed a favourable treatment effect of luspatercept compared to placebo for serum ferritin 
despite balanced use of ICT in both treatment groups. 
Special populations 
No studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, in elderly or paediatric patients (not included 
in the label) were conducted in the MDS indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 111/195 
 
  
  
 
The MDS population is an elderly one and the study population was externally valid in this regard 
(median age of 71 years, ranging from 40 to 95 years). Starting dose adjustments based on age are 
not supported by PK, efficacy, safety, and exposure/response data. 
As regards patients with renal impairment, no clinically significant differences in Cmax.ss and AUCss 
were found across renal function groups. No starting dose adjustment is recommended for patients 
with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR <90 – 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Subgroup analyses results 
from phase 3 data for mild/moderate renal impairment are consistent with the overall treatment effect. 
No dose recommendation can however be made for patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 due to 
the lack of clinical data. 
No clinically significant differences in Cmax.ss and AUCss were found across hepatic function groups 
defined by NCI-ODWG criteria (normal, mild hepatic impairment, and moderate/severe hepatic 
impairment). No starting dose adjustment is recommended for these patients. No dose 
recommendation can however be made for patients with severe hepatic disease (ALT or AST ≥ 3 ULN) 
due to insufficient clinical data. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the primary endpoint results favour luspatercept and results for the secondary endpoints 
as well as the post hoc analyses are all in support of the primary endpoint analysis. The clinical data 
supports the granting of the Marketing Authorisation of Reblozyl in the following indication: “Reblozyl is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low 
and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an 
unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy (see section 5.1).” 
2.6.  Clinical efficacy beta-thalassemia 
Dose response studies 
Dose recommendations for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 were derived from phase I and II studies (dose 
escalating study A536-04 and it’s extension study A536-06) and are based on the dose-exposure-
response relationship as well as safety and efficacy considerations, from observed and modelled data 
(see also pharmacology assessment).

Exposure-Response 
The exposure-dependence of erythroid response over a broader dose range was assessed. The 
exposure endpoint was the steady-state luspatercept AUC for the starting dose. The erythroid response 
endpoints included Hgb in non-transfusion dependent ß-thalassemia patients and RBC transfusion 
burden reduction (units) in transfusion-dependent patients.

Dosing Approach 
The recommended dosing approach is body weight-based dosing. This approach was used in the early 
stage of Phase 2 studies and showed erythroid response in the primary treatment phase of Phase 3 
studies. The dosing approach was also supported by PK and E-R data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 114/195 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Body weight is a statistically significant covariate of luspatercept apparent clearance (CL/F) and 
volume of distribution in population PK analysis for subjects with β-thalassemia. Model-based 
simulations predicted that the weight-based dosing would perform better than the fixed dosing by 
limiting the exposure difference between light/heavy subjects and normal weight subjects to within 
10% instead of approximately 25% predicted for the fixed dose, with low risk of overexposing or 
under-exposing subjects with extreme body weight. Further, in the multivariate exposure-safety 
analysis for β-thalassemia, the proportion of subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) did not increase with increasing luspatercept serum exposure or body weight.  
Dosing Schedule 
The recommended dosing schedule, which was used in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, is once every 3 
weeks. This schedule is supported by the observed time profile of Luspatercept serum concentrations, 
Hgb response, and RBC transfusion burden reduction in clinical studies. 
Luspatercept is slowly absorbed and eliminated. In a Phase 1 study with healthy volunteers (A536-02), 
the time to reach the maximum concentration in serum was approximately 1 week and the terminal 
half-time in serum was approximately 2 weeks (Report A536-02). Thus, a once every 3 weeks dosing 
schedule was expected to maintain approximately 50% of peak concentration at the end of a dosing 
interval, and was hence used for subsequent clinical studies.  
In the clinical studies, different treatment intervals were possible as dose delays based on clinical 
parameters were possible. 
Starting Dose and Dose Titration 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg, SC, Q3W. If a patient does not achieve a reduction in RBC 
transfusion after at least 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the 1.0 mg/kg starting dose, it is 
recommended to increase the luspatercept dose to 1.25 mg/kg; down-titration is based on safety and 
elevated Hb levels. A titration-to-response regimen was used in the expansion/extension stages of 
Phase 2 studies as well as in the Phase 3 study. 
In the phase III trial, in principle, 5 different dose levels were used; the starting dose (1 mg/kg), 
down-titration (to 0.8, 0.6 or 0.45mg/kg) due to AEs or excessive Hgb increase and up-titration to 
1.25mg/kg.

Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
During screening and throughout the study, subjects were permitted to take stable doses of 
medications for chronic conditions that were not specifically excluded by the protocol. 
Prior/concomitant medications were collected beginning at the Screening/Run-in Period and included all 
medications taken within 12 weeks prior to Dose 1 Day 1. 
All concomitant treatments, used from 12 weeks prior to first dose of the study drug until 9 weeks post 
last dose, were to be reported in the eCRF. All prior and concomitant blood and blood products 
received, and ICTs used from 24 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug until 9 weeks post last 
dose were to be reported in the eCRF. 
Treatments 
Luspatercept or placebo was administered as an SC injection to subjects by the study staff at the 
clinical site, and administration was documented in the subject’s source record. Subcutaneous 
injections were given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen.  
Subjects were assigned to treatment as per one of the following regimens: 
- 
- 
Luspatercept starting dose level 1.0 mg/kg SC once q3w 
Placebo SC once q3w 
The study drug was to be administered according to the following criteria: 
- 
Pretreatment/pretransfusion Hb value was to be < 11.5 g/dL and increase of Hb was to be ≤ 
2.0 g/dL compared with the predose Hb on Day 1 of the previous treatment dose cycle; 
-  Any related AEs must have been < Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE criteria (Appendix C of the 
study protocol [Appendix 16.1.1]); and 
-  White blood cell (WBC) count < 3 x baseline. Corrected WBC values were to be used to 
establish the baseline WBC. Baseline was equal to the highest WBC value between screening 
WBC and Dose 1 Day 1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 118/195 
 
  
  
 
Subjects must have had Hb assessed, and results had to be available prior to each study drug 
administration. Haemoglobin not influenced by a transfusion was to be considered for dosing, delays, 
and reduction actions related to luspatercept. Haemoglobin not influenced by a transfusion was initially 
considered a valid Hb measurement 14 days post-transfusion.  
In addition to the above treatments, all subjects received BSC (RBC transfusions; ICTs; antibiotic, 
antiviral, and antifungal therapy; and/or nutritional support as needed) at the investigator’s discretion.  
Identity of Investigational Products 
Luspatercept was provided by the sponsor. Luspatercept for injection was formulated as a sterile, 
preservative-free, lyophilised cake/powder, available in 2 strengths. The drug product was packaged in 
a 3-mL glass vial at the following strengths; a 25 mg/vial (containing 37.5 mg of luspatercept protein) 
and a 75 mg/vial (contained 87.5 mg of luspatercept protein). 
Placebo used in the study was sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) administered 
as an SC injection. Sterile, normal saline was prepared in syringes by the investigational site’s 
designated individuals to match the active syringe. The investigator and subject were blinded to 
treatment assignment.  
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose up-titration criteria were defined as follows: 
-  Transfusion reduction over at least 2 dose cycles (approximately 6 weeks) was < 33%, 
compared with the transfusion burden (units/week) at baseline; or 
-  Transfusion reduction over at least 2 dose cycles (approximately 6 weeks) was ≥ 33%, but ≤ 
50% compared with baseline, at the discretion of the investigator. After safety and efficacy 
data review, the sponsor may allow dose titration following special requests, such as, but not 
limited to, subjects whose dose had been reduced once and whose response to treatment had 
been lost.  
Table 36: Starting dose level with dose reductions and dose titration 
Dose Delay and Dose Reduction 
Dose delay of luspatercept from the planned dosing schedule was allowed due to increased Hb or AEs 
and per the guidelines for dose modifications and dose delay. Dose reduction may have been required 
based on the change in mean Hb level (Hb not influenced by a transfusion) with respect to the last 
dose, as well as related Grade ≥3 AEs. If a subject experienced a dose delay due to Hb increase, Hb 
measurement was to be performed every week. If the dose delay was 15 weeks or longer from the 
previous dose administered, including cases of elective surgery/hospitalization, the treatment was to 
be discontinued.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomized with a ratio of 2:1 to either treatment with luspatercept or placebo. 
Randomisation was additionally stratified by geographical region. 
All subjects, study site staff, and Celgene representatives with the exception of designated individuals 
(e.g., the pharmacist at the investigational site) remained blinded to all treatment assignments until all 
subjects completed 48 weeks of double-blind treatment or discontinued before reaching 48 weeks of 
double-blind treatment, whichever was earlier, or at the time the study was unblinded (per DMC 
recommendation) and the database was locked. The designated site individual (e.g., the pharmacist) 
at the investigational site used a syringe (that exactly matched the syringe used for reconstituted 
luspatercept) and sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) to prepare a matching 
placebo. Thus, the designated site individual at the investigational site was unblinded and gave 
investigators and their staff luspatercept and placebo in a blinded manner. 
Randomization, drug dispensing, dose reduction/titration, and drug discontinuation were accomplished 
by an IRT system. Authorised site personnel must have contacted the IRT for randomization, study 
drug assignment at the beginning of each cycle, registration of dose reductions or titrations, and 
treatment discontinuation. Confirmation of each call was to be sent to the investigational site and 
Celgene. 
The blind was not to be broken during the course of the study unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, it was absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it was medically imperative to 
know what study drug the subject was receiving, the study drug had to be discontinued if, in the 
opinion of the investigator, continuing to receive study drug could have negatively affected the 
outcome of the subject’s treatment. The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remained 
the responsibility of the treating physician. Emergency unblinding was only to be performed by the 
investigator through the IRT by using an emergency unblinding personal ID number, and the 
investigator had to call the IRT for unblinded dose information. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations were planned for this study: 
• 
Intent-to-treat population: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all subjects, 
regardless of whether or not the subject received the study drug. All efficacy analyses were 
conducted for the ITT population and were analysed based on randomization group. 
•  Safety population: The safety population consisted of all subjects who were randomized and 
received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Subjects were included in the treatment group 
corresponding to the study drug they actually received. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic population: The PK population consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of luspatercept and had measurable luspatercept serum concentrations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 122/195 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Health-related QoL evaluable population: The HRQoL evaluable population consisted all 
subjects in the ITT population who completed the HRQoL assessment at screening and at least 
1 post Baseline/Screening Visit. The completion of an HRQoL assessment was defined for each 
health-related QoL measure. 
• 
TranQoL: Completion at a given visit was defined as ≥ 75% of all items being answered (ie, ≥ 
27 items of the 36 items or a nonmissing total score). 
•  SF-36: Completion at a given visit was defined as ≥ 50% of all items being answered (ie, ≥ 18 
items of the 36 items). 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population. The primary efficacy analysis was 
performed based on 24 weeks of data after all subjects completed the double-blind 24-week Treatment 
Period or discontinued before reaching 24 weeks of double-blind treatment (for this study, 1 month 
was considered equal to 4 weeks). A higher response rate in the luspatercept over placebo and a 2-
sided p-value < 0.05 was required to confirm the superiority of luspatercept in the efficacy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was defined as subjects with ≥ 33% reduction from baseline 
in RBC transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units from Week 13 to Week 24 compared with 
the 12-week interval on or prior to Dose 1 Day 1 for luspatercept + BSC versus placebo + BSC. For the 
early discontinued subjects, i.e., who did not complete 24 weeks of double-blind Treatment Period, the 
transfusion records were collected up to 48 weeks. All the transfusion records up to the last dose + 20 
days were used to evaluate primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The first day to be used for efficacy analysis was defined as the date of the first dose. A transfusion 
received on Dose 1 Day 1 was counted in the baseline transfusion burden. The primary endpoint 
response rate was calculated using the number of responders divided by all subjects in the ITT 
population. The response rates of the subjects who were randomized to luspatercept and placebo were 
calculated.  
The following statistical hypothesis was tested: 
•  H0: P1 (response rate in the luspatercept group) = P2 (response rate in the placebo group) 
•  Ha: P1≠P2 
The number and percentage of subjects in the ITT population who achieved the response were 
calculated for luspatercept and placebo. The difference in proportions between luspatercept and 
placebo was calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the geographical regions 
defined at randomization as a stratification factor. The odds ratio (OR; luspatercept versus placebo) 
with corresponding 2-sided (at 0.05 alpha level) 95% confidence intervals and p-value were provided. 
A higher response rate in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group over the placebo + BSC treatment 
group with a p-value < 0.05 inferred that luspatercept was significantly superior to placebo. 
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The analyses of key secondary efficacy endpoints were performed on the ITT population. The results 
were presented by treatment groups. The statistical tests were conducted to compare the treatment 
groups. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were measured at 24 weeks or 48 weeks from randomization 
and were statistically tested in a sequential order at the α = 0.05 level.

analysed as described in Section 9.7.1.4.1 for the primary endpoint. 
3. Proportion of subjects with hematologic improvement, defined as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in 
RBC transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units, from Week 37 to Week 48. Subjects were 
analysed as described in Section 9.7.1.4.1 for the primary endpoint. 
4. Mean change in transfusion burden (RBC units/12 weeks) from Week 13 to Week 24. The mean 
change in transfusion burden (RBC units) from baseline was analysed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) method with stratification factor and baseline transfusion burden as covariates from Week 
13 to Week 24. Corresponding 95% Cis associated with the test were provided. 
The totality of RBC transfusion burden reduction was evaluated using 24 weeks baseline (sum of 12-
week historic data and 12-week run-in data). Baseline of 48 weeks of transfusion burden was 
calculated based on 2 times 24 weeks transfusion burden baseline data. Descriptive statistics (n, 
mean, median, standard deviation [SD], and range) for totality of RBC transfusion burden reduction, 
along with the change from baseline, were summarized for each treatment group by A waterfall plot 
was provided for the 24-week baseline and postbaseline RBC transfusion burden by treatment group 
and time point. Each individual subject’s RBC transfusion burden was displayed in a single bar. 
Multiplicity 
After the result from the primary efficacy analysis in the ITT population showed statistical significance, 
the key secondary efficacy Endpoint 1 was tested next. The key secondary efficacy Endpoint 2 was 
tested only if the test results for both the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy 
Endpoint 1 were significant. The key secondary efficacy Endpoint 3 was tested only if the test results 
for the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy Endpoints 1 and 2 were all significant. 
The testing procedure above was implemented strictly in order to control the family-wise error rate for 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints at a level of 0.05. 
Missing Data Imputation 
In case of any missing data for RBC transfusion units records and MRI liver iron content, imputation 
will be applied for each section. 
The imputation for RBC transfusion units was: if at the time of data summary, a subject’s efficacy cut-
off date is before the end of the 12-week interval or a subject has any invalid transfusion records (i.e., 
transfusion unit not available) during the specified 12-week interval, this subject will be included in the 
analysis as a non-responder. 
The imputation logic for missing LIC value is stated in section 10.4.1: the value of LIC will be either the 
value collected from eCRF or the value derived from T2*, R2* or R2 parameters depending on which 
techniques and software were used for MRI LIC data acquisition.

Baseline data 
The majority of subjects was female (58.0%), white (54.2%), and ≤ 32 years of age (57.1%); the 
median age was 30.0 years (range: 18 to 66 years). The median baseline body weight and BMI were 
56.4 kg (range:  34 to 94 kg) and 21.97 kg/m2 (range: 13.9 to 38.3 kg/m2), respectively, and were 
generally well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Based on the prespecified protocol 
stratification by geographical regions, 44.6% of subjects were randomized at sites from North America 
and Europe; 23.2% of subjects were randomized at sites from the Middle East and North Africa and 
32.1% of subjects were randomized at sites from the Asia-Pacific region.

Medical History 
All subjects had at least one medical history condition or β-thalassemia comorbidity, and the 
proportion of subjects with specific medical history condition and/or comorbidities was generally similar 
(difference of ≤ 10% of subjects) between the 2 treatment groups. Overall, the medical history 
conditions or β-thalassemia comorbidities were typical of a population with TD β-thalassemia. 
Nearly all patients (>93%) had (severe) iron overload (more than 1000 mcg/L serum ferritin or LIC 
>7mg Fe/g dw and received iron chelation therapy (ICT).

Other analysis, endpoints and subgroup analyses of interest  
It is noted that no alpha control is applied for endpoints discussed below this point and that described 
results are mainly relevant for assessment of internal validity of data and description of study 
population, but these results need to be interpreted with caution in terms of the risk for false positive 
conclusions. 
In addition to the fixed period of analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints on reduction of 
transfusion burden, a rolling analysis, to reflect clinical practice, was also conducted per the pre-
defined SAP, see Table 47.

For the overall ITT population, the mean reduction in RBC transfusion burden per subject in RBC units 
from baseline was 4.75 RBC units/48 weeks in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group. At baseline, 
the average patient had received approx. 7 units within 12 weeks or 14 units within 24 weeks, which 
translates to approx. 28 RBC units/48 weeks. A reduction of 4.75 RBC units/48 weeks translates to 
approx. -17% or 3-5 transfusion-visits less per year. 
The transfusion window time for the overall ITT population is longer for every fixed 12-week interval 
during the study than at baseline. Data are available until week 84 for a small number of patients. The 
LS mean of difference between the luspatercept and placebo group however is rather small: 3.1 (0.9, 
5.3 95% CI) and not statistically significant (p-value = 0.006). 
Red blood cell transfusion independence: 9 patients (4%) in the luspatercept group vs 0 in the 
placebo group achieved 12 week transfusion independence at one point during the study. 24 patients 
(10.7%) (N=2 in the placebo group) were TI for 8 weeks, 38 patients (17%) (N=7 in the placebo 
group) for 6 weeks. The difference between the two arms is numerically notable, although not 
statistically significant. 
The median (mean) time from first dose of study drug to first erythroid response was 12.0 (56.1) days 
in ≥ 33% reduction in RBC transfusion burden responders and 24.5 (80.5) days in ≥ 50% reduction in 
RBC transfusion burden responders.  
For the overall ITT population, in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group, there was a modest 
improvement (increase) in the mean pretransfusion Hb levels from baseline during all fixed 12-week 
intervals (mean increases from 0.09 to 0.38 g/dL). In the placebo + BSC treatment group, the mean 
pretransfusion Hb levels during all fixed 12-week intervals remained relatively stable from baseline 
(mean changes between -0.04 and +0.03 g/dL). Overall, pretransfusion Hb levels were stable over the 
48 weeks of treatment, indicating that   subjects were transfused at the same Hb level as before 
coming into the study.

Changes in Hb concentrations from baseline were summarized by fixed 12-week intervals. For the 
overall ITT population, in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group, the mean Hb levels increased in the 
range of 0.20 to 0.54 g/dL from baseline across the individual fixed 12-week intervals.

Most subjects in both treatment groups were on iron chelation monotherapy at baseline and 
postbaseline (60.7% in each treatment group). Use of iron chelation therapy (at baseline and 
postbaseline) was reported in 23.2% and 19.6% of subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively. There were no significant changes from baseline in the mean daily doses of 
deferasirox, deferiprone, or deferoxamine mesylate/deferoxamine between the 2 treatment groups. 
There was no difference between the Luspatercept and the Placebo group in the QoL endpoints SF-36 
and TranQoL based on descriptive statistics applied.

•  Subject disposition 
As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, in the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-
thalassemia Data Pool, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment was 35.2% (101 of 287 
subjects). The proportion of subjects who discontinued from treatment in the placebo treatment group 
was 26.6% (29 of 109 subjects). A total of 92 subjects who received placebo during the double-blind 
Treatment Period in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 crossed over to receive luspatercept during the Open-
label Phase of the study. 
As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, in the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-
thalassemia Data Pool, the proportion of subjects who discontinued the study was 14.3% (41 of 287 
subjects). The proportion of subjects who discontinued from the study in the placebo treatment group 
was 5.5% (6 of 109 subjects). A total of 267 subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
(including cross-over subjects) were still receiving treatment as of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date.

In both, the original MAA and this updated data report, the most frequently cited reason for treatment 
discontinuation and study discontinuation in the pooled luspatercept treatment group was withdrawal 
by subject. 
• 
Efficacy 
A postbaseline mean increase in ranging from +0.13 to +0.97 RBC units/24 weeks was reported in the 
placebo + BSC treatment group. At fixed 48-week intervals, the mean change from baseline in RBC 
transfusion burden in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 was -
4.75 RBC units/48 weeks for Week 1 to Week 48 and -5.99 RBC units/48 weeks for Week 49 to Week 
96. For the 48-week intervals, the postbaseline mean increase in RBC transfusion burden was +1.04 
RBC units/48 weeks for Week 1 to Week 48 and +0.31 RBC units/48 weeks for Week 49 to Week 96 in 
the placebo + BSC treatment. In the “Phase 3-like Population” of the Phase 2 studies, a reduction in 
the mean RBC transfusion burden was observed for each time period measured, which ranged from -
6.60 to -8.78 RBC units/24 weeks and -13.31 to -16.56 RBC units/48 weeks. 
From the time of the data cut-off date for the original MAA to the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date for this 
updated report, the response rates for both, ≥ 33% and ≥50% RBC transfusion burden reduction in 
any 12-week interval in the Phase 3 study increased: 
≥ 33% reduction: 76.3% subjects for 07 Jan 2019 data cutoff date versus 70.5% subjects for the 
original MAA;  
≥ 50% reduction: 44.6% subjects for 07 Jan 2019 data cutoff date versus 40.2% subjects for the 
original MAA.  
A similar result was observed for the time period in any 24-week interval in the Phase 3 study. The 
response rates for both ≥ 33% and ≥ 50% RBC transfusion burden reduction in any 24-week interval 
in the Phase 3 study increased: 
≥ 33% reduction: 45.1% subjects for 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date versus 41.1% subjects for the 
original MAA;  
≥ 50% reduction: 20.5% subjects for 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date versus 16.5% subjects for the 
original MAA). 
For the “Phase 3-like population”of the Phase 2 studies, the response rates for both ≥ 33% and ≥ 
50% RBC transfusion burden reduction in any 12-week interval remained the same in the 07 Jan 2019 
data cut-off date versus the initial cut-off date. The response rates for both ≥ 33% and ≥ 50% RBC 
transfusion burden reduction for any 24-week interval also remained the same. 
With updated data, a total of 83.0% (142/171) of responders experienced more than 1 response 
during the entire treatment period and 47.4% (81/171) of responders had > 5 episodes. 
An increase in the median total duration of the transfusion burden reduction was observed with longer 
exposure. For those subjects in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 who achieved an erythroid response (≥ 
33% transfusion burden reduction) during any rolling 12-week interval, the median total duration 
(cumulative) of RBC transfusion burden reduction was longer in the luspatercept + BSC treatment 
group (397.0 days) than in the placebo+ BSC treatment group (171.0 days). Among the subjects with 
≥ 50% transfusion burden reduction during any rolling 12-week interval, the median total duration 
(cumulative) of RBC transfusion burden reduction was 276.0 days in the luspatercept + BSC treatment 
group and 169.0 days in the placebo + BSC treatment group. The median total duration of the 
transfusion burden reduction increased with longer exposure (median total duration of the transfusion 
burden reduction was 210.0 days in the original MAA versus 276.0 days as of the 07 Jan 2019 data 
cut-off date).

was observed with extended exposure compared to placebo.

consecutive rolling 6-week, 8-week, or 12-week interval continued to be higher in the luspatercept + 
BSC group compared with the placebo + BSC group: 
•  RBC-TI during any 6-week interval: the response rate increased slightly compared with original 
MAA (response rate 17.0% for luspatercept and 6.3% for placebo for the original versus 21.0% 
for luspatercept and 8.0% for placebo for updated data  
•  RBC-TI during any 8-week interval: The response rate continued to be higher for the 
luspatercept group vs placebo group and the difference was statistically significant. For the 
luspatercept group, the response rate increase slightly compared with the original MAA 
(response rate 10.7% for luspatercept and 1.8% for placebo for the original versus 11.2% for 
luspatercept and 1.8% for placebo for the updated data. 
•  RBC-TI during any 12-week interval: The response rate for the luspatercept group in the 07 Jan 
2019 data update (4.0%) was unchanged from the initial cut-off date  
Among the subjects in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group who maintained RBC transfusion 
independence for ≥ 6, ≥ 8, and ≥ 12 weeks, the median longest duration of transfusion independence 
was 56.0, 74.0, and 270.5 days, respectively. 
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, subjects in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group showed a modest 
improvement (increase) in the mean pretransfusion Hgb levels from baseline during all fixed 12-week 
intervals (mean increase of 0.09 to 0.38 g/dL). In the placebo + BSC treatment group, the mean 
pretransfusion Hgb levels during all fixed 12-week intervals remained relatively stable from baseline 
(mean changes between -0.04 and 0.10 g/dL). 
Iron Parameters 
Serum ferritin 
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, a significantly greater decrease from baseline to Week 96 (last 12 
weeks) in mean serum ferritin was observed in the luspatercept + BSC group compared with the 
placebo group (nominal p < 0.0001) as of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date. The between-group 
difference in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in serum ferritin level at Week 96 (last 12 
weeks) was -549.50 μg/L, which favored luspatercept treatment versus placebo. 
As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, overall for the luspatercept group, 42.9% of subjects with 
mean serum ferritin ≥ 1000 µg/L at baseline shifted to < 1000 µg/L during the last 24 weeks on or 
prior to Week 96, versus 7.1% of subjects in the placebo group 
45.5% of luspatercept responders (who had ≥ 33% transfusion burden reduction during any 12-week 
interval) experienced a shift in serum ferritin category from ≥ 1000 µg/L at baseline to < 1000 µg/L. 
A higher decrease in serum ferritin was observed in responders versus the overall luspatercept group 
or placebo group. 
Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) 
The mean changes from baseline in LIC for responders in the luspatercept + BSC group at Week 96 
were as follows: 
• 
-1.33 mg/g dw for subjects in the luspatercept + BSC group who were ≥ 33% responders in 
any rolling 12 weeks (Table BEE.193a.9.1b.1.b) 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020

• 
• 
• 
-1.82 mg/g dw for subjects in the luspatercept + BSC group who were ≥ 33% responders in 
any rolling 24 weeks (Table BEE.193a.9.1b.2.b) 
-1.61 mg/g dw for subjects in the luspatercept + BSC group who were ≥ 50% responders in 
any rolling 12 weeks (Table BEE.193a.9.1b.3.b) 
-1.54 mg/g dw for subjects in the luspatercept + BSC group who were ≥ 50% responders in 
any rolling 24 weeks (Table BEE.193a.9.1b.4.b) 
Mean change from baseline in the ITT was -0.38mg/g dw at week 96. 
Myocardial Iron by MRI 
As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, the overall mean myocardial iron T2* at Week 96 in Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001 remained in the normal range of cardiac iron (> 20 ms; Kirk, 2009). The mean 
change from baseline in myocardial iron T2* for the luspatercept group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 
was -0.39 ms at Week 96, which was not a clinically significant change. The LS mean difference for the 
luspatercept + BSC treatment group versus the placebo + BSC treatment group was -2.95 ms (95% 
CI: -41.38, 8.49) (p = 0.6101). 
For shifts from baseline in myocardial iron T2* at Week 96, the majority of subjects in the overall 
luspatercept group remained in the same category as baseline. 
Iron Chelation Therapy 
No significant change from baseline in mean daily dose was observed but a trend in favour of IP 
(slightly higher decrease of daily dose compared to placebo) was noted. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A document named ‘integrated summary of clinical efficacy’ was provided in the dossier for the beta-
thalassemia dataset, including data from ACE-536-BTHAL-001 (phase III), A536-04 and A536-06 
(phase II). The ITT population for the comparison of efficacy across studies included 336 subjects in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 (224 randomized to luspatercept + BSC and 112 randomized to placebo + 
BSC) and 24 subjects in the “Phase 3-like Population” of the Phase 2 studies. 
Due to the differences in the subject populations and efficacy endpoints between the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies, the Phase 2 and Phase 3 data sets were not pooled for integrated efficacy analyses. A 
subset of subjects from the Phase 2 studies that approximated the dosing of the Phase 3 study and 
matched key inclusion criteria was identified and efficacy results were presented next to one another 
for comparison. 
Baseline characteristics of the “Phase 3-like Population” were consistent with those of the Phase 3 
population, except for a lower mean LIC at baseline and a higher rate of splenectomy among subjects 
in the Phase 2 studies, and the more diverse, global subject population in the Phase 3 study compared 
with the limited number of sites in the Phase 2 studies. 
Duration of treatment and follow-up has to be considered in comparisons between the Phase 3 and 
Phase 2 studies. The median duration of treatment for the data cut included in this submission was 
longer in Phase 2 (e.g., 715 days [approximately 102 weeks] in extension Study A536-06) than in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 (449 days [64.1 weeks] in the luspatercept group and 448 days [64.0 
weeks] in the placebo group). 
The “Phase 3-like Population” of the Phase 2 studies performed comparable in many endpoints and 
thus provided consistent supportive evidence for the efficacy of luspatercept.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, in elderly or paediatric patients (not included 
in the label) were conducted in the beta-thalassaemia indication. In the pivotal trial ACE-536-B-THAL-
001 most patients were < 32 years of age and only 22 patients (6.5%) were > 50 years old, the oldest 
patient was 52 (see baseline characteristics in the description of the main study above). In A536-04 
the oldest patient was 62 years old (A536-06 was the long-term extension of this study). Age was not 
restricted in terms of an upper age limit in the trials, but no elderly patients were recruited (the oldest 
patient was 66 years).  
Data from the MDS development, where the population is significantly older, and also respective POP 
PK analyses showed no clinically significant difference in AUC or clearance across age groups (< 65, 65 
74, and ≥ 75 years for MDS patients; 18 23, 24 31, 32 41, and 42 66 years for beta-thalassaemia 
patients). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria restricted the population in the pivotal trial to patients without significant 
hepatic or renal disease. Excluded were patients with liver disease with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
> 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or history of evidence of cirrhosis and patients with creatinine 
clearance < 60 mL/min (per Cockcroft-Gault formula). 
Supportive studies  
Besides the pivotal phase III study ACE-536-BTHAL-001, two phase II studies were submitted to 
support Luspatercept for the treatment of beta-thalassaemia; A536-04 and A536-06. Two phase II 
studies and one phase III study submitted to support the ‘MDS’ indication also evaluated erythroid 
response. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy in beta-thalassaemia 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the dose escalating study A536-04, six dose levels were evaluated (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.25 
mg/kg). Data indicates that there could be an increased response with increased dose. This was more 
clear based on the PD surrogate Hgb used in NTD subjects than for number of RBC units which was 
used as efficacy marker in TD subjects. Data from the NTD dataset seem informative for the TD 
population as well. The PD parameter Hgb likely is more sensitive to reflect dose response, directly 
related to the postulated mechanism of action of the drug and also more objective (while decision for 
transfusion could be influenced by several factors).  
Study A536-06 (ongoing) is the long-term extension study of A536-04 and evaluates erythroid 
response in patients receiving 0.8-1.25mg/kg (N=10). The preliminary results support the conclusion 
from the parent study. 
The dose finding was not extensive, the sample size in the phase II studies for beta thalassemia was 
small (N=33 in NTD patients and N=31 in TD patients in the parent trial) and thus, the description of 
the dose-exposure-response relationship is based on limited data. 
As the phase II studies are still ongoing, they are of value for the assessment of long-term 
performance. Updated data provided after the clock-stop with a data cut-off 07 Jan 2019 supports the 
primary analyses and does not indicate a loss of response over time. 
The pivotal Phase 3 study (ACE-536-B-THAL-001) is a double blind, randomised (2:1), placebo-
controlled, multicentre (65 centres) study of luspatercept & BSC vs. placebo & BSC in adults who 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 141/195 
 
  
  
 
require regular red blood cell transfusions. The study is still ongoing; the initial submission included the 
48-week results. After the clock stop, updated results were provided (see below).  
Submitting only one pivotal trial could be acceptable in this case, if results from the phase III in MDS 
(also investigating erythroid response) are supportive, also considering that beta-thalassaemia is an 
orphan disease with high unmet medical need. 
The design of the study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, the choice of comparator and choice of the target 
patient population are largely in line with the EMA Scientific Advice (2015) and overall acceptable. The 
patient population included in the study is a rather severely affected one. At baseline, this patient 
population received about 2 units of RBCs every 3 weeks. The patients were severely iron overloaded 
with multiple thalassaemia-associated co-morbidities. There are some minor differences in baseline- 
and disease characteristics between the treatment arms, but they seem of little clinical relevance.  
The primary endpoint is a responder analysis of the proportion of patients with a ≥ 33% reduction from 
baseline in transfusion burden (units RBCs/time) of at least 2 RBC units from week 13 to 24. Four 
secondary endpoints that were hierarchically tested evaluated also 50% reduction, response at later 
time intervals (week 37-48), and mean change from baseline (to week 13 – 24). A responder analysis 
bears the risk of loss of information compared to an analysis based on continuous outcomes. However, 
the Applicant gave a clinical justification for the responder definition, which was accepted also in the 
EMA SA: A reduction in RBC transfusion burden of 33% or greater is considered clinically meaningful 
for transfused patients based on the associated decrease in accumulation of transfusional iron and 
related complications. It was estimated that a patient who achieves reduction in transfusion need from 
2 RBC units every 4 weeks to 2 RBC units every 6 weeks would thus reduce the transfusional iron 
intake by approximately 1700 mg/year, based on an estimated 200-mg iron/RBC unit (Cohen, 2008; 
Porter, 2001). In a patient weighing 50 kg, this would translate into a reduction of liver iron content of 
approximately 3 mg/g dw (Angelucci, 2000), which has been considered a clinically meaningful change 
in recent iron chelation studies in β-thalassemia populations (Taher, 2012; Cappellini, 2006). Reduced 
transfusional iron can also lead to a reduction in the dose of iron chelators (Cohen, 2008), thus 
reducing the risks and costs associated with ICT.  
Overall, while the responder analysis has some weaknesses, in context with the other endpoints 
evaluated and the updated data on efficacy from the ongoing studies, the dataset seems sufficiently 
mature to base a benefit/risk assessment on.  
In the study as well as for the set-up of the baseline data, the numbers of transfusion units given to a 
patient within a pre-defined time frame (12 or 24 weeks) was counted. The decision for transfusion 
(length of transfusion window, number of units transfused per visit…) and luspatercept dosing (dose, 
interval…) could have direct influence on the (primary) endpoint(s) of this study, both including 
subjective or variable elements. This makes the trial closer to a real world setting but stresses the 
necessity of impeccable blinding and randomisation techniques, which are considered robust.  
Statistical methods - planned and performed – are in general considered adequate.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The number of responders was 21.4% (N=48/224) in the luspatercept + BSC group and 4.5%, 
(N=5/112) in the placebo + BSC group; the treatment effect on the primary endpoint is statistically 
significant (p< 0.001). The calculated odds ratio was 5.79 (95% CI; 2.24, 14.97) and the difference in 
proportions was 17% (95% CI; 10.4, 23.6).  
While there is a clear difference between the groups in responders, the percentage of responders is 
rather small for the fixed period of analysis. It is noticed that in the power calculation, the response 
rate was expected to be twice as high as observed in the results. The Applicant attributes this to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 142/195 
 
  
  
 
differences between study designs and study population included in the phase 2 that served as basis 
for the power calculations and the patient population actually recruited in phase 3 (EU setting vs global 
setting and other subject specific variation). However, the clinical relevance of the observed 
luspatercept effect is difficult to determine based on the responder analysis alone, and needs to be 
assessed together with results from the other endpoints and analyses:  
Statistical significance was reached also in all other hierarchically tested secondary endpoints, but key 
secondary endpoint 1-3 also evaluated binary outcomes and key secondary endpoint 4 evaluated the 
mean change from baseline to the fixed week 13 - 24 interval only (ITT), although 48 week data are 
available. A reduction of 0.67 RBC units in the luspatercept group within the 12 week period was 
found. A reduction of -4.75 RBC units/48 weeks (ITT), corresponding to approximately -17% or 3-5 
transfusion visits less, was measured in another secondary endpoint (not statistically powered). 
Usually, patients receive (1-)2 units per transfusion visit and thus the reduction in terms of units and 
transfusion-associated hospital visits seems fairly modest. 
Trends for favourable outcomes with luspatercept were also observed for most of the other secondary 
endpoints (but not for QoL endpoints and change in LIC, see below) further evaluating red blood cell 
transfusion burden reduction, iron parameters, etc., and for all associated subgroup analyses, which 
strengthens the internal validity of the data.  
The rate of discontinuations was around 12% until week 48 and rather balanced between study arms. 
Post-hoc, the Applicant recognised that measures of Hb change during the study were not reliable 
indicators of drug effect, as 14 days were not sufficient to exclude the influence of transfusion on Hb. 
This could have led to unjustified dose delays/reductions. The Applicant therefore proposed increase of 
the ‘no transfusion’ window to 3 weeks and amended the titration/dosing rules in the SmPC 
accordingly.  
In the 12 weeks prior to randomization (the time period were ‘baseline’ was established), prospectively 
collected RBC transfusion counts were lower compared to the preceding 12 weeks (12-weeks of 
historical retrospective transfusion data that was transcribed from medical records) and also compared 
to transfusion data collected in the placebo group during the treatment phase. It seems that the 
baseline RBC transfusion counts were (slightly) underestimated for unknown reasons. However, 
baseline transfusion counts were very similar in the Placebo and Verum groups, and also very similar, 
if higher, in the Placebo and Verum groups in the 12-week historical dataset. Therefore this 
observation (the lower transfusion counts at baseline) seems unlikely to significantly have influenced 
the relevant efficacy study outcomes. 
Subgroup analyses and description of disease characteristics between responders and non-responders 
(primary endpoint) show some minor differences. Therefore the Applicant was asked to comment on 
subgroups with smaller response (e.g. patients with more severe disease, renal impairment, patients 
with ß0/ß0 mutation or patients <32 years). Patients with ß0/ß0 mutation in particular have very high 
unmet need as they are excluded from treatment with the recently approved gene-therapy product 
Zynteglo and a treatment option for them would be very desirable. Additional analyses revealed that 
while some patients (with ß0/ß0 mutation, with start of transfusions <2 years of age, with renal 
disease) might have a somewhat smaller benefit from treatment, the effect is still robust across all 
subgroups, and there is no indication to exclude specific subgroups from the label (see also Guideline 
on the Investigation of Subgroups in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013)). 
Respective results were included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Iron parameters are of major interest, as the iron burden in beta thalassaemia patients is associated 
with severe (long-term) risks and reduced life expectancy. Iron chelation therapy was not standardised 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 143/195 
 
  
  
 
or stratified for in the study, but the groups were comparable in terms of chelator product used. 
Overall, 97% of patients were on iron chelator treatment.  
Over the 48 weeks of luspatercept treatment ICT did not change significantly. Iron levels were reduced 
in some body compartments; (small) results in favour of luspatercept were seen for change in serum 
ferritin and myocardial T2*.  
However, included patients were highly iron overloaded both at baseline and after 48 weeks, and an 
ICT dose decrease was therefore not indicated (from an efficacy perspective). Treatment with 
Luspatercept did not result in significant reduction in LIC over the 48-week double-blind treatment 
period and the Applicant states that this could be due to a delayed response of this parameter, 
requiring a longer observational period. It is noted that the primary responder threshold (33% 
reduction in RBC units) as initially justified by an estimated yearly decrease in LIC by ~ 3 mg/g dw 
(see above), could not be shown in ACE-536-B-THAL-001 at the cut-off presented for this application. 
There was no difference between the Luspatercept and the placebo group in quality of life endpoints 
SF-36 and TranQoL. The Applicant claims that this is because of the good baseline values, which were 
better than in comparable populations from historical data sources (Sobota, 2011, Klaasen, 2014) and 
that this starting point makes it more challenging to demonstrate further improvement in HRQoL, 
despite responding to treatment. This rationale can be followed to a certain degree; however, it also 
questions the relevance of a reduction in transfusion units/visits for patients since the studied 
population had a good QoL despite the need for many transfusions and severe co-morbidities. The 
Applicant further claims that beneficial effects on QoL may not be observable in the initial years of 
treatment, but only manifest later. However, this cannot be verified based on the available data. 
Initially, 48-week double-blind data was submitted in the dossier. As the study is still ongoing, further 
data became available and updated efficacy (and safety) data with data cut-off 07 Jan 2019 
was provided during the evaluation: 
Data from an additional 92 subjects became available from study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 for patients 
who crossed over from the initial placebo group into the open-label phase, where they started to 
receive luspatercept. At this point in time, no more placebo data is collected, which has to be 
considered when comparing the groups. Updated long term data from patients initially randomised to 
luspatercept and then transferred into the open-label phase (still receiving luspatercept) seem also 
included in the updated dataset, yielding in a mix of controlled and uncontrolled data.  
RBC transfusion burden expressed in the responder analyses (≥ 33% or ≥ 50% reduction in RBC 
transfusion burden from baseline with a reduction of at least 2 units) and evaluated during rolling 12- 
or 24 week intervals yielded results consistent with the original MAA set, indicating superiority of 
luspatercept over placebo. Time to erythroid response did not differ relevantly either between the 
original and the updated dataset. Assessment of multiple response periods over the treatment duration 
indicates that many responders achieve several response periods (during any 12- or 24-week interval).  
Results for the endpoint ‘transfusion independence’ (only a small proportion of subjects achieved 
transfusion independence during any 6-, 8-, or 12 week intervals) were in line with data from the 
initial cut-off date and indicate a beneficial effect of luspatercept as well. Pre-transfusion Hb values 
remained relatively stable (which would be a treatment goal in the management of ß-thalassemia), 
with a slight increase of pretransfusion Hb in the luspatercept group compared to baseline and to 
placebo.  
The change from baseline in transfusion burden is considered a more sensitive and informative 
endpoint compared with the responder analyses. For the 48-week interval of Week 1 - 48, a decrease 
of -4.67 RBC transfusion units compared to baseline was observed in the luspatercept group. In 
contrast, transfused RBC units remained relatively stable (or increased slightly) in the placebo group 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 144/195 
 
  
  
 
(+1.04 RBC units/48 weeks for Week 1 – 48). The difference in the change in RBC transfusion burden 
(Units/48 Weeks) is -5.83, with a corresponding nominal 95% confidence interval of (-7.01, -4.65).  
For the 48-week interval for Week 49 - 96, a continued decrease of -5.66 units compared to baseline 
was seen in the luspatercept group. The corresponding result for the placebo group is +0.31 RBC units, 
but comparisons are not considered meaningful, because only 3 placebo patients remain.  
Iron parameters 
With a mean reduction in RBC transfusion burden of -4.75 RBC units/48 weeks in the overall ITT 
population on luspatercept, the average patient would be expected to be spared from approx. 1 g of 
transfusion iron per year (calculated result). The reduction of RBC units and thus, iron burden is higher 
in the (predefined) responder groups. 
Serum ferritin levels continued to respond to luspatercept treatment and decreased over time in 
luspatercept patients (while slightly increasing in placebo patients).  
Based on the original and updated numbers on LIC, it is difficult to assess the beneficial effect of 
luspatercept on liver iron over time and compared with placebo. Confidence intervals of mean changes 
are very broad and results are difficult to interpret as the patient population available for assessment 
decreases for each time point. However, it is acknowledged that the mean change from baseline in LIC 
in the second year of luspatercept treatment showed a small decrease (as compared with the first 48 
weeks, where a small increase was observed). The Applicant claims that clinically relevant LIC results 
might only manifest after longer treatment duration and agrees to further collect relevant data in the 
long-term open-label follow-up Study ACE-536-LTFU-001, and to report respective results to the 
authorities annually for 5 years.  
It is reassuring that when comparing mean changes over time between responders and non-
responders in the luspatercept group, it seems that a reduction in transfusion units as defined for the 
responder thresholds correlates with LIC as the mean change in LIC was always better (i.e., higher 
decrease) in responders compared to non-responders. 
While the recorded LIC reductions in the Reblozyl study are far below from what has been observed in 
registrational studies with iron chelators such as e.g. deferasirox (see SmPC Exjade), it is 
acknowledged that the pivotal luspatercept study was not primarily designed to investigate iron 
reduction. As no longer-term data are available, the potential for iron sparing in the liver with chronic 
luspatercept treatment remains not fully elucidated. 
Mean change in myocardial iron over 48 weeks indicates a slight advantage of luspatercept over 
placebo, but no clinically meaningful improvement.  
Regarding concomitant iron chelator treatment, updated data shows a trend for a larger decrease in 
ICT in the luspatercept group compared with placebo over time. However, these differences are very 
small and likely not clinically meaningful and the corresponding confidence intervals are wide.  
Special Populations 
No dedicated studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, in elderly or paediatric patients (not 
included in the label) were conducted in the beta-thalassemia indication.  
In the pivotal trial ACE-536-B-THAL-001 most patients were < 32 years of age and only 22 patients 
(6.5%) were > 50 years old, the oldest patient was 52. In A536-04 the oldest patient was 62 years 
old. Age was not restricted in terms of an upper age limit in the trials, but no elderly patients were 
recruited. Transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia patients have a life expectancy of around 40-50 
years, improvement of survival during recent years has been frequently reported by different authors. 
Based on the dataset provided, efficacy in elderly beta-thalassemia patients cannot be evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 145/195 
 
  
  
 
However, data from the MDS development, where the population is significantly older, are available 
and also respective POP PK analyses found no clinically significant difference in AUC or clearance 
across age groups (< 65, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years for MDS patients; 18-23, 24-31, 32-41, and 42-66 
years for beta-thalassaemia patients). There is no indication for a different pathophysiological response 
in elderly beta-thalassemia patients. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria restricted the population in the pivotal trial to patients with no significant 
hepatic or renal disease therefore no dose recommendations can be made for these severe cases 
(please see SmPC). 
Some patients with mild-moderate renal and hepatic impairment were included in the studies, 
however. In the POP-PK model mean luspatercept AUCss was higher in subjects with β-thalassemia 
who had mild renal impairment (+38%) than those with normal renal function, but the Applicant 
considers this aberration irrelevant. There are indications that renally impaired beta-thalassemia 
patients could have impaired efficacy and this might need to be reflected in the PI. The amount of 
patients with mild/moderate renal impairment in the beta thalassemia study was however small and 
the results should be interpreted with caution.  
Another subgroup of interest are splenectomised patients, as they will likely be treated also later in 
clinical practice. More than half of the phase III population (57.7%) were splenectomised patients. 
Subgroup analyses of main efficacy results showed positive results for patients with and without 
spleen, with a trend for better response in splenectomised patients. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy in beta-thalassemia 
In conclusion, available data from the pivotal study supports a rather small, if considering the fixed 
period of analysis alone , but robust effect of luspatercept on reduction in transfusion burden during 96 
weeks of treatment in adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with ß-
thalassaemia.  
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety of luspatercept has been examined in a clinical development programme comprising 571 
subjects exposed to luspatercept (including 260 subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], 287 
subjects with β-thalassaemia, and 24 healthy, postmenopausal females) in 7 clinical studies, i.e. one 
phase I trial in healthy volunteers (A536-02), one open-label phase II ascending dose study followed 
by an extension study for each indication (MDS: A536-03 & A536-05; β-thal: A536-04 & A536-06) and 
one randomized, double-blind pivotal phase III study for each indication (MDS: ACE-536-MDS-001; β-
thal: ACE-536-B-THAL-001). Safety data are presented in 3 separate data pools: the total luspatercept 
Data pool, the MDS Data Pool and the β-thalassemia Data Pool. 
Patient exposure 
The total luspatercept pool includes 571 subjects, the total placebo pool 193 subjects. The total 
luspatercept pool contains all subjects treated with luspatercept from the two MDS phase 2 studies 
(A536-03 & A536-05, n=107), the two β-thalassemia phase 2 studies (A536-04 & A536-06, n=64), the 
MDS phase 3 study (ACE-536-MDS-001, n=153), the β-thalassemia phase 3 study (ACE-536-B-THAL-
001, n=223) and the phase 1 study with healthy subjects (A536-02, n=24). The total placebo pool 
contains all subjects treated with placebo from the MDS phase 3 study (ACE-536-MDS-001, n=76), the

β-thalassemia phase 3 study (ACE-536-B-THAL-001, n=109) and the phase 1 study with healthy 
subjects (A536-02, n=8). 
Duration of exposure 
Table 52 
For MDS, the mean treatment duration of the entire MDS data pool was 49.0 weeks (median 45.6), in 
the phase 2 studies (A536-03/-05) 52.4 weeks (median 30.9), and in the phase 3 study (ACE-536-
MDS-001) 46.6 weeks (median 49.0) for Luspatercept-treated and 30.6 weeks (median 24.0) for 
placebo-treated subjects. 171 (63.6%), 123 (45.7%), and 98 (36.4%) subjects received a minimum of 
6, 12, and 18 months of luspatercept treatment at any dose, respectively. 
For ß-thalassemia, the mean treatment duration of the entire ß-thalassemia data pool was 64.7 weeks 
(median 63.4), in the phase 2 studies (A536-04/-06) 78.2 weeks (median 78.5), and in the phase 3 
study (ACE-536-ß-THAL-001) 60.8 weeks (median 63.3) for Luspatercept-treated and 58.9 weeks 
(median 62.1) for placebo-treated subjects. 256 (67.5%), 230 (60.7%), and 204 (53.8%) β-
thalassemia subjects received a minimum of 6, 12, and 18 months of luspatercept treatment at any 
dose, respectively. 
Dose  
The studies included a variety of Luspatercept doses ranging from 0.0625 mg/kg in phase 1 (study 
A536-02) to 1.75 mg/kg in the phase 2 MDS study (study A536-03). In addition, the doses and thus 
exposure differs between the indication in the phase 2 studies: MDS phase 2 study A536-03: 0.125 
mg/kg to 1.75 mg/kg Luspatercept versus β-thalassemia phase 2 study A536-04: 02 mg/kg to 1.25 
mg/kg. 
Adverse events 
95.3% of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 91.2% of subjects in the pooled 
placebo treatment group reported at least 1 TEAE. Incidence rates of serious TEAEs, TEAEs of Grade 3 
or 4, TEAEs leading to dose interruption, and TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation, were higher in the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group. It is noted that there 
was a shorter exposure duration in the MDS placebo treatment group than in the luspatercept 
treatment group. Fifteen subjects (10 subjects [1.8%], luspatercept; 5 subjects [2.6%], placebo) had 
Grade 5 (fatal) TEAEs during the study.

Luspatercept data pool 
In the Luspatercept Data Pool, the SOCs with the highest subject incidence of TEAEs in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group were Infections and infestations, General disorders and administration 
site conditions, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The proportion of subjects with 
TEAEs in any SOC was generally numerically higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in 
the pooled placebo treatment group. The most frequently reported TEAEs (at least 15% of subjects) in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group were headache (Nervous system disorders SOC); back pain, 
bone pain, and arthralgia (Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC); diarrhoea 
(Gastrointestinal disorders SOC); fatigue and pyrexia (General disorders and administration site 
conditions SOC); and cough (Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC). This largely 
corresponds with the most frequently reported SOCs. With the exception of upper respiratory tract 
infection and pyrexia, TEAEs reported in at least 15% subjects in either treatment group were reported 
more frequently in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment 
group. (For treatment-emergent AEs reported for at least 10% of subjects see clinical AR or Table 53 
in the ISS).

is the overall treatment exposure for subjects without the event and the time up to the first event start date for 
subjects with the event. 
Note: Treatment-emergent adverse events include adverse events that started on or after the date of first dose and 
up to 63 days after the date of the last dose of study treatment. If a subject experienced multiple events under the

same SOC and PT, then the subject was counted only once for that SOC and PT level. MedDRA version 20.0 was for 
coding. 
As of the initial data cut-off date, the most frequently reported (≥ 15.0%) TEAEs for the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group of the MDS Data Pool were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, cough, dizziness, 
hypertension, and peripheral edema. As of the data cut-off date of 07 Jan 2019, in addition to the 
preferred terms mentioned above, headache, viral upper respiratory tract infection, and back pain 
were reported at an incidence of ≥ 15.0%. In general, compared with those reported in the original 
MAA, the nature and estimated incidence rates of TEAEs have not changed, and the EAIRs for the most 
frequently reported adverse event preferred terms (except peripheral edema) did not increase.

Malignancies were reported in the MDS data pool but not in the β-thalassaemia data pool as of the 
data cut-off date 11 May 2018. (Note: After database lock, a 27 year old β-thalassaemia patient 
developed unconfirmed AML M6 (acute erythroid leukaemia) after 27 treatment cycles and died from 
sepsis due to neutropenia. The histopathological diagnosis of AML M6 was confounded by the effects of 
erythroid hyperplasia due to the underlying beta-thalassaemia. Molecular screening found no 
mutations diagnostic for AML, which are present in almost 90% of AML cases, but could also not 
definitely rule out the possibility of erythroleukemia. In summary, the experts concluded that AML M6 
cannot with absolute certainty be ruled out, however, available data points to a very unlikely 
probability of this diagnosis. 
In the β-thalassemia clinical program, the only confirmed malignancy reported to up to the new cut-off 
data of July 2019 was a single event of hepatocellular carcinoma. An increased rate of hepatocellular 
carcinoma has been reported in patients with thalassemia (Borgna-Pignatti, 2014; Finianos, 2018; 
Zanella, 2016).

with the event. 
c Progression to AML. 
In the MDS data pool, malignancy EOIs were reported for 15 subjects (5.8%; exposure-adjusted 
incidence rate (EAIR) 6.3/100 subject-years; 95% CI, 3.8 to 10.5) in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 1 subject (1.3%; EAIR 2.2/100 subject-years; 95% CI, 0.3 to 15.9) in the 
placebo group. The 95% CIs were overlapping for the pooled luspatercept and placebo treatment 
groups for the EAIRs of malignancy EOIs.  
The most frequently reported malignancy EOI in luspatercept-treated subjects in the MDS data pool 
was transformation to AML in 7 subjects (2.7%; EAIR 2.9/100 subject years) followed by basal cell 
carcinoma in 3 subjects (1.2%; EAIR 1.2/100 subject-years). All other malignancy EOIs were reported 
in 1 subject each (0.4%; EAIR 0.4/100 subject-years). The Applicant claims that the overall rates of 
malignancies were within the expected range for an elderly cohort with MDS (Balleari, 2015; Falantes, 
2017).  
Data cut-off date of 07 Jan 2019 
As of the data cut-off date of 07 Jan 2019, malignancy EOIs were reported for 8.6% of subjects (EAIR 
7.4 per 100 subject-years). There were no new malignancy events reported in the Phase 3 study, as of 
the data cutoff date of 07 Jan 2019. All new malignancies were reported from the Phase 2 studies, 
which included a subject population who had more follow-up time, compared to subjects in the Phase 3 
study, and more indicators of severe disease, as described in the original MAA. 
Data cut-off dates of 01 Jul 2019 (Phase 3 Study) and 13 Jul 2019 (Phase 2 Studies) 
As of the data cut-off dates of 01 Jul 2019 (for the Phase 3 study) and 13 Jul 2019 (for the Phase 2 
studies), 2 additional treatment-emergent malignancy events were reported since 07 Jan 2019. One 
subject in the luspatercept treatment group of the Phase 3 study reported basal cell carcinoma and one 
subject in the Phase 2 studies had transformation to AML.

c Progression to AML 
d Progression to high-risk MDS 
Juvenile animal toxicity studies with luspatercept have identified a potential signal for malignant 
transformation. 
A total of 5 premalignant disorder EOIs were reported in the Phase 3 study in 2 subjects (1.3%; EAIR 
1.5/100 subject-years) in the luspatercept group and in 3 subjects (3.9%; EAIR 7.0/100 subject-
years) in the placebo group. Progression to high-risk MDS was reported for 1 subject in the 
luspatercept group (0.7%; EAIR 0.7/100 subject-years) with the PT “refractory anaemia with an 
excess of blasts” and for 1 subject (1.3%; EAIR 2.2/100 subject-years) in the placebo group. In 
addition, 1 subject (0.7%; EAIR 0.7/100 subject years) in the luspatercept group had intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasm and 2 subjects (2.6%; EAIR 4.7/100 subject-years) in the placebo group 
had actinic keratosis.  
A proportion of patients with lower-risk MDS is expected to progress to higher-risk MDS or AML as part 
of the natural history of the disease. The rate of disease progression is influenced by a number of

prognostic factors. In the review of disease progression, it should be noted that the Phase 2 and Phase 
3 populations were different as to prognostic factors. The Applicant claims that, as compared to the 
Phase 3 population, the Phase 2 population had more indicators of severe disease such as higher IPSS-
R scores, lower rates of SF3B1 mutation (indicator of lower risk), and 35% of patients being ring 
sideroblast negative. Updated safety data shows that progression to AML occurred in 2 (2.6%) patients 
receiving placebo and 3 (2%) patients receiving luspatercept in the pivotal study. There was no signal 
for earlier transformation in luspatercept versus placebo treated subjects. Seven patients (6%) from 
the phase II studies showed disease progression at the updated cut-off July 2019. 
An in-depth assessment was conducted to determine the background rate of clinical disease 
progression from other controlled clinical trials in a similar population of subjects with MDS and from 
an external MDS registry, and to further inform whether luspatercept treatment had any measurable 
impact on that rate. According to the Applicant, the outcome of that analysis indicates that 
luspatercept treatment does not pose an increased risk of progression to higher-risk MDS or AML as 
compared to placebo in the pivotal Phase 3 study and compared to background rates from the 
lenalidomide studies and external MDS registry data.

In the clinical phase 3 studies for MDS and ß-thalassemia, some events related to the kidney occurred 
more often in the luspatercept group. There were adverse kidney findings in non-clinical studies with 
luspatercept (see non-clinical part). 
The impact on renal function (creatinine clearance) and on proteinuria was also investigated in the 
trials. Among luspatercept-treated subjects with renally associated AEs, renal function generally 
recovered substantially while the subject was still on treatment. Mean ACR (albumin/creatinine ratio) 
values remained clinically stable over time, with no prolonged elevations of mean ACR values in 
subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. According to the Applicant, administration of luspatercept 
was not associated with prolonged or irreversible worsening of clinically important indicators of kidney 
injury over the course of treatment.  
The Applicant has provided a comprehensive discussion on kidney toxicity and a detailed overview of 
the kidney function parameters in the pivotal trial for beta-thalassaemia for subjects both on placebo 
and luspatercept. Comparative data of the safety profile for exposure below and above 48 weeks does 
not show an increase in renal AEs with longer treatment duration. Kidney parameters will further be 
monitored in the long-term extension study to gain additional information. Influencing factors for 
patients with beta-thalassaemia are chronic anaemia, hypoxia and iron overload as well as a possible 
role of iron chelators, which all contribute to the deterioration of renal function (Demosthenous et al, 
2019, Hematology, 24:1, 426-438). 
Embolic and Thrombotic EOI 
For subjects with MDS, the assessment was unchanged from the original MAA with no difference in 
TEEs observed between luspatercept and placebo in the Phase 3 study. 
An imbalance in thromboembolic events was observed in subjects treated with luspatercept in study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001. Therefore, embolic and thromboembolic events (TEE) were further analysed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 156/195 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence of embolic and thrombotic events EOIs in the luspatercept data pool was 4.0% (23 
subjects) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 2.1% (4 subjects) in the pooled placebo 
treatment group (similar if exposure adjusted). The higher incidence in the luspatercept pool was 
driven by splenectomised subjects from the β-thalassaemia data pool. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
embolic and thrombotic events EOIs was similar between the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
(1.8%) and pooled placebo treatment group (1.0%). All of the Grade 3 or 4 embolic and thrombotic 
events EOIs were each experienced by at most 1 or 2 subjects per pooled treatment group. 
Thromboembolic events are common complications of thalassaemia, especially thalassaemia 
intermedia (TI). The increased risk of thromboembolic events is likely due to abnormalities in platelet, 
red blood cell, endothelial cell, and thrombin activation which all contribute to hypercoagulable state 
(Thiersch, 2017; Taher, 2010 a,b). In addition to these haematological abnormalities, splenectomy has 
also been shown to be a major risk factor contributing to hypercoagulability among patients with 
thalassemia (Natesirinilkul, 2016). In the Phase 3 luspatercept treatment group in the ß-thalassemia 
study, 4.5% of subjects had a known history of thrombosis. The majority of subjects in the 
luspatercept and placebo treatment groups had a splenectomy prior to study participation (57.4% and 
56.9%, respectively). All subjects who experienced thromboembolic events in this study were 
splenectomised. Occurrence of TEE was not correlated with elevated Hb levels. 
As of the initial data cut-off date, in the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-thalassemia Data 
Pool, thromboembolic events (TEEs) were reported for 12 subjects (4.2%, EAIR 3.4 per 100 subject-
years). All preferred terms in this category were reported by single subjects, with the exceptions of 
cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombophlebitis superficial (3 subjects each, 
1.0%, EAIR 0.8 per 100 subject-years).  
As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, TEEs were reported for 14 subjects (4.9%, EAIR 2.8 per 100 
subject-years) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-thalassemia Data Pool excluding 
the cross-over subjects and 16 subjects (4.2%, EAIR 2.4 per 100 subject-years) including the cross-
over subjects. Two subjects in the Phase 3 Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 experienced transient ischemic 
attack since the original MAA, compared with no subject at the time of the original MAA. In the Phase 3 
study, 1 event of ischemic stroke reported in the original MAA was updated to transient ischemic 
attack; this diagnosis was confirmed by imaging. There were 4 new subjects who reported TEEs, all of 
whom were splenectomized and had other recognised risk factors, including hypertension, increased 
platelets, history of thrombosis, and use of sex hormones. 
As of the data cut-off dates of 01 Jul 2019 (for the Phase 3 study) and 13 Jul 2019 (for the Phase 2 
studies), there was 1 additional TEAE under the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) of TEE reported 
since the data cut-off date of 07 Jan 2019. The event, transient ischaemic attack, occurred in the 
Phase 3 Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001. However, this event was non-thrombotic/embolic in nature 
because there was no evidence of vessel occlusion. The event involved a 49-year-old female 
splenectomized subject with relevant medical history of hypertension. 
Hypertension EOI 
In the MDS Phase 3 study, the proportion of TEAEs was balanced; however, in the β-thalassemia Phase 
3 study, there was a higher rate of hypertension TEAEs in the luspatercept treatment group, although 
proportions were generally less compared to the MDS population. None of these events were serious or 
led to treatment discontinuation. One (0.3%) subject in the beta-thalassaemia pool had an SAE of 
hypertension (Updated Safety 07Jan2019. Patients treated with Reblozyl had an average increase in 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg from baseline.  
The incidence rate of hypertension TEAEs was similar in for the updated safety report compared to that 
in the initial data cut-off.

Hypersensitivity Type Reactions EOI 
The incidence of hypersensitivity type reactions EOIs in the luspatercept data pool, independent of the 
development of ADA, was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (8.4%) than in the pooled 
placebo treatment group (4.1%), also for the EAIR. The imbalance was primarily driven by injection 
site reactions (eg, PTs of injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, injection site swelling, 
injection site reaction). None of the PTs that comprise the hypersensitivity type reactions EOI had an 
incidence of ≥ 2% in any treatment group. All of the hypersensitivity type reactions EOIs were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity. No Grade 3 or higher hypersensitivity type reactions EOIs were reported in either 
treatment group. All hypersensitivity type reactions EOIs were nonserious. In the luspatercept clinical 
program, no anaphylactic reactions have been reported. 
Musculoskeletal Disorder-Bone Pain EOI Category 
The incidence of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs in the Luspatercept Data Pool was higher in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group (37.5%) than in the pooled placebo treatment group (29.5%) 
(similar if exposure adjusted). The most frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs (
≥ 10% of subjects in either treatment group) were back pain and bone pain. The incidence of back pain 
was similar between the pooled luspatercept treatment group (20.3%) and the pooled placebo 
treatment group (19.2%), whereas the incidence of bone pain was higher in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group (15.9%) compared with the pooled placebo treatment group (6.2%), which accounted 
for the imbalance in the overall incidence. Bone pain is common in patients with β-thalassemia and the 
imbalance was primarily driven by subjects in the β-thalassemia studies.  
The incidence of Grade 3 musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was 2.6% in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 1.0% in the pooled placebo treatment group. In the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group, the only Grade 3 events were bone pain and back pain (7 subjects each; 1.2%) and 
spinal pain (1 subject; 0.2%). In the pooled placebo treatment group, the only Grade 3 events were 
bone pain and back pain (1 subject each; 0.5%). No Grade 4 or higher musculoskeletal disorder-bone 
pain EOIs were reported. The median time to the first event was earlier in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group compared with the pooled placebo treatment group (23.5 versus 61.0 days, 
respectively). However, the median total duration of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOI was lower 
in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group (32.0 versus 
53.0 days), respectively. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
Considering the original data cut-off for MAA, a total of 27 subjects in the Luspatercept Data Pool died 
during the study (on treatment and off treatment): 17 subjects (3.0%) in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 10 subjects (5.2%) in the pooled placebo treatment group. 
While on treatment, 14 subjects died: 9 subjects (1.6%) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
and 5 subjects (2.6%) in the pooled placebo treatment group. The majority of these subjects died 
within 12 months after receiving the first dose of treatment.  
While off treatment, 13 subjects died: 8 subjects (1.4%) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
and 5 subjects (2.6%) in the pooled placebo treatment group. The majority of these subjects died 
between 12 and 24 months after receiving the first dose of IP.

There were 10 subjects (1.8%) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 5 subjects (2.6%) in 
the pooled placebo treatment group who had Grade 5 (fatal) TEAEs. The majority of Grade 5 (fatal) 
TEAEs were experienced by 1 subject each, with the exception of sepsis (2 subjects [0.4%], pooled 
luspatercept) and general physical health deterioration (1 subject [0.2%], pooled luspatercept and 1 
subject [0.5%], pooled placebo). 
Similar to the underlying demographics of the population, the majority of subjects in the Luspatercept 
Data Pool who had a Grade 5 (fatal) TEAE were male (11 of 15 subjects), white (11 of 15 subjects), 
and from North America or Europe (14 of 15 subjects). 
MDS 
A total of 24 subjects in the MDS Data Pool died: 15 subjects (5.8%) in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 9 subjects (11.8%) in the placebo treatment group. All deaths were assessed as 
not related or unlikely related to luspatercept by the investigator. There was no notable association 
between luspatercept treatment and type or frequency of events with fatal outcomes. 
As of the data cut-off date of 07 Jan 2019, 19 additional deaths occurred in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group bringing the total number of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group who 
died to 34 (12.6%), and 5 additional deaths occurred in the placebo treatment group bringing the total 
number of subjects in the placebo treatment group who died to 14 (18.4%). Of the 19 additional 
deaths in the pooled luspatercept treatment group, 8 deaths occurred while the subject was on study 
and 11 deaths occurred while the subject was off study. 
During the post-treatment phase of the study (off-study), 5 additional deaths occurred in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group since the data cutoff date of 07 Jan 2019, bringing the total number of 
subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group who died to 39 (14.5%), and 4 additional deaths 
occurred in the placebo treatment group bringing the total number of subjects in the placebo 
treatment group who died to 18 (23.7%). 
β-thalassaemia Studies 
A total of 3 subjects in the β-thalassemia Data Pool died: 2 subjects (0.7%) in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 1 subject (0.9%) in the placebo treatment group. None of the AEs leading to 
death were considered related to treatment. 
After data cut-off, two further patients enrolled in study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 died: 
- 
a young male adult died from neutropenia and sepsis following a diagnosis of AML M6 (Acute 
erythroid leukaemia). 
The investigator assessed causal relationship between study therapy and fatal acute myeloid leukemia 
(M6) as suspected, and not suspected for neutropenia sepsis, neutropenic sepsis (second episode), 
thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, multiple splenic abscess. Based on a study in Taiwan, which reported 
a 5.32-fold increased risk for haematological malignancy in thalassemia compared to the general 
population, and thalassemia patients given transfusions 9.31-fold more likely to develop 
haematological malignancy than non-transfused thalassemia patients (Chung WS et al, 2015), the 
investigator expressed underlying transfusion dependent thalassemia as possible risk factor to develop 
AML.  
Additional information received including bone marrow biopsy showing erythroid hyperplasia with 
adequate granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis indicates that the pancytopenia is likely to be due to 
hypersplenism. The most recent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated mostly blastic cells belonging to 
erythropoiesis, with negative myeloid markers; the peripheral blood showed adequate granulocytosis

and no blasts. Based on the above picture it was considered difficult to discriminate between AML and 
thalassemia-related findings.  
The sponsor considers the clinical course to be consistent with beta-thalassaemia major complicated by 
neutropenia possibly triggered by deferiprone therapy, splenomegaly/hypersplenism causing 
pancytopenia with subsequent sepsis, and does not attribute causality to study drug. A review of the 
biopsy samples by an independent pathologist concluded that the diagnosis of AML is not certain and 
further that it is still extremely unlikely that Luspatercept has played a causative role, or could have 
demonstrated changes in the bone marrow that can be compared to AML. 
Independent expert opinion: all analyses after chemo no evidence of AML. At time of report, no 
confirmation of leukaemia. Independent molecular genetic analysis: unable to detect mutation in any 
of the typical predetermined breaking points of genes known in AML. Leukaemia mutations in at least 
one of the investigated genes are found in 90% of cases. Rare individual cases of malignant disease 
(MDS, AML) development known for thalassemia.  
The Applicant has submitted full detailed documentation of this case. AML M6 cannot with absolute 
certainty be ruled out, however, available data point to a low probability of this diagnosis. 
-  A 57 year old male, died due to hepatic carcinoma and liver resection operation site infection. 
The investigator assessed the causal relationship as follows: Well-differentiated hepatocellular 
carcinoma: blinded ACE-536 (not suspected). Per the investigator, the event was due to iron overload 
secondary to the underlying disease. 
Updated safety data showed two additional on-study deaths in the luspatercept group, one was due to 
intracranial haemorrhage (post-neurosurgery), the other due to cardiac arrest in a subject with severe 
cardiac iron overload and suspected acute viral infection, leading to cardiac arrhythmia and death.

Overall, the incidence of SAEs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (23.8%) than in 
the pooled placebo treatment group (15.0%). The SOC with the highest subject incidence of SAEs in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group was Infections and infestations (incidence of 8.8%). 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported only in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (2.5% of 
subjects). Deep vein thrombosis was the only SAE assessed as related to treatment by the investigator 
experienced by > 1 subject (2 subjects [0.4%]). 
In the MDS pool, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group (37.7%) than in the placebo treatment group (30.3%). The SOCs with the highest percentage of 
subjects with SAEs (at least 5% of subjects) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group were 
Infections and infestations; Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps); Cardiac disorders; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders. 
In the β-thalassemia data pool, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was higher in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group (13.2%) than in the placebo treatment group (5.5%). The difference was 
driven by imbalances in the percentages of subjects with TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC 
(4.5% and 2.8%, respectively) and thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident (1.0% 
and 0%) and deep vein thrombosis (0.7% and 0%).  
For both indications, data provided with the newer cut-offs showed that the incidences and types of 
SAEs were similar to those in the original MAA. 
Laboratory findings 
In line with the intended PD effect of luspatercept, a treatment-dependent effect was observed for the 
incidence of haemoglobin > 11.5 g/dL: a higher proportion of subjects had haemoglobin > 11.5 g/dL in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group (42.0%) than in the pooled placebo treatment group 
(28.0%).  
A treatment-dependent effect was observed on the incidence of neutropenia (threshold < 0.5 × 109 
cells/L; Table 61), with a nominally higher incidence in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than 
in the pooled placebo treatment group.  
The incidence of thrombocytosis, based on a threshold of ≥ 500 × 109 cells/L, was treatment 
dependent, with a higher incidence in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled 
placebo treatment group. For 8.1% of subjects (8.3/100 subject-years) in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and 5.7% of subjects (6.8/100 subject-years) in the pooled placebo treatment group, 
platelet counts were ≥ 1000 × 109 cells/L. 17 instances of TEEs occurred in 13 subjects (of whom 1 on 
placebo). Only three subjects had a baseline below 400 x109/L before the event, of whom 1 increased 
to 964 x109/L while the other two stayed below 400 x109/L. Reassuringly, the figures plotting platelet

Neutrophil segmented was used for neutrophil count in the Phase 3 studies. 
A trend towards elevated liver enzymes as well as bilirubin values can be observed in patients treated 
with luspatercept in both indications. Neither the mode of action nor the catabolic pathway of 
luspatercept are liver dependent. The underlying disease itself as well as concomitant medication/ 
infections etc. can influence liver parameters. 
A slight decrease in creatinine clearance can be observed for patients in the luspatercept treatment 
groups versus patients who received placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically relevant differences were noted between age subgroups, genders, white- and non-white 
subjects or subjects with- and without splenectomy exposed to luspatercept. 
No clinically relevant differences were noted across regions in the β-thalassemia data pool. There were 
too few subjects from the ROW (N = 3) compared to subjects from North America or Europe (N = 257) 
in the MDS Data Pool to draw any meaningful conclusions. 
Analyses comparing incidences of TEAEs in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment to 
that in patients with normal liver function found no specific trends towards a shift in AE profile in either 
the MDS, the beta-thalassaemia or the overall safety pool. Analyses according to renal function 
revealed no specific worrying trends for patients with mild or moderate impairment compared to 
patients with normal kidney function in any of the safety pools. 
The safety of Luspatercept in children and adolescents under the age of 18 has not been established 
and this population is not included in the SmPC. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study population and throughout the clinical 
development program. Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants in any 
luspatercept study were to use highly effective (Pearl index < 1% per year) birth control methods. 
As of the safety data cut-off date, there are no data regarding the clinical effects of luspatercept in 
pregnancy. There have been no pregnancies reported in female subjects participating in luspatercept

clinical studies, and there was 1 pregnancy in the partner of a male subject in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-
001. Given a lack of consent from the pregnant partner for collecting pregnancy data, no safety data 
for this pregnancy are available. 
Updated safety data submitted during evaluation showed that an unintended pregnancy was reported 
in the Phase 3 study, requiring IP discontinuation. A 23-year-old subject experienced a spontaneous 
abortion on Study Day 517. The subject reported the last day of menses as Study Day 468, and had 
the last negative pregnancy test on Study Day 498. The subject had a positive pregnancy test on 
Study Day 505, with β-human chorionic gonadotropin of 1294.00 mIU/mL (0-3) and positive urine 
pregnancy test. After approximately 8 weeks of pregnancy, the subject complained of vaginal spotting 
and vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain. Based on the symptoms and ultrasound findings, the 
subject was diagnosed with threatened abortion. On Study Day 554, she had a follow-up abdominal 
ultrasound, which revealed a completed abortion. The event was not suspected to be related to study 
treatment (luspatercept) by the investigator. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity Assay Validation 
The validation of the anti-drug antibody (ADA) methods and sample analysis were conducted in 
accordance with scientific guidance and in compliance with appropriate regulations. 
Overall Incidence of Antidrug Antibodies in Clinical Studies 
In the MDS population, in 8.85% of patients receiving luspatercept versus 3.95% receiving placebo 
developed treatment emergent ADAs. In β-thalassaemia, the incidence of TEADAs was lower, namely 
1.41% of patients on luspatercept versus 1.87% of patients on placebo. 
Preexisting ADAs could be determined in about 5% of MDS patients and ~ 1% of β-thalassaemia 
patients. 
Correlation of Antidrug Antibody versus Safety 
No obvious correlation of ADAs with specific TEAEs could be observed. The 4 instances of kidney injury 
observed in the MDS population, while positive for ADA, had significant underlying risk factors for 
kidney disease and were temporally associated with acute events that may lead to kidney injury. 
Hypersensitivity 
No systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in ADA positive subjects. In MDS, local reactions were 
observed in 4 patients who were ADA positive or had pre-existing ADA. However, similar reactions 
were also reported in ADA-negative patients in a comparable number. In β-thalassaemia, only ADA-
negative subjects experienced hypersensitivity AEs or local reactions. 
The observed influence of either pre-existing or treatment emergent anti-drug-antibodies on the safety 
profile of luspatercept appears limited, however, no long-term data are available. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies with luspatercept have not been conducted.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was higher (8.8%) in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group (3.6%). AEs leading to study 
discontinuation were most often related to the mode of action of luspatercept (i.e. bone pain, back 
pain) or related to the disease (progression of MDS). In addition, in the β-thalassemia pool, nervous 
system disorders and headache were observed. 
In the MDS Data Pool, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 
similar in the pooled luspatercept (11.5%) and the placebo (7.9%) treatment groups. For the data cut-
off date of 07 Jan 2019, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation was 
16.4% (EAIR 13.7 per 100 subject-years) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group. The most 
frequently (≥ 1% of subjects) reported TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group were MDS (ie, progression to high-risk MDS; 7 subjects, 2.6%), transformation to 
AML (6 subjects, 2.2%), and general physical health deterioration and sepsis (3 subjects each, 1.1%). 
In the β-thalassemia Data Pool, there were 19 luspatercept subjects in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group (6.6%) and 1 (0.9%) subject in the placebo treatment group with TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of IP. For the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs 
leading to IP discontinuation was 8.7% (EAIR 5.0 per 100 subject-years) and 7.1% (EAIR 4.1 per 100 
subject- years) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-thalassemia Data Pool excluding 
and including the cross-over subjects, respectively. As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, arthralgia 
and bone pain remained the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation, and the 
number of subjects reporting these events did not change. 
Post marketing experience 
Not post-marketing data were submitted in this application as luspatercept was not yet marketed in 
any country. 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Luspatercept is a novel first-in-class recombinant fusion protein that binds select transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily ligands and inhibits Smad2/3 signalling. In subjects suffering from 
MDS and β-thalassemia, Smad2/3 inhibition is expected to reduce the abnormal high Smad2/3 activity 
that hampers effective erythropoiesis.  
While Luspatercept has shown promising effect on erythropoiesis during preclinical- and clinical trials, 
the mechanism of action and the implication of the interference in its totality (‘off-target’ effects, 
secondary pharmacodynamics) have not been extensively studied. The inhibition of TGF-ß superfamily 
ligands has many potential consequences for the body as TGF-ß signalling is involved in cellular 
development and differentiation of various tissues and cell types besides erythropoiesis. (Long-term) 
treatment with substances that regulate such pleiotropic pathways, especially pathways involved in cell 
growth, harbour an intrinsic potential of abnormal cell growth, among others. 
The safety of luspatercept has been examined in a clinical development programme comprising 571 
subjects exposed to luspatercept (including 260 subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], 287 
subjects with β-thalassemia, and 24 healthy, postmenopausal females) in 7 clinical studies, i.e. one 
phase I trial in healthy volunteers (A536-02), one open-label phase II ascending dose study followed 
by an extension study for each indication (MDS: A536-03 & A536-05; β-thal: A536-04 & A536-06) and 
one randomized, double-blind pivotal phase III study for each indication (MDS: ACE-536-MDS-001; β-

thal: ACE-536-B-THAL-001). Safety data are presented in 3 separate data pools: the total luspatercept 
Data pool, the MDS Data Pool and the β-thalassemia Data Pool. The total luspatercept pool includes 
571 subjects, the total placebo pool 193 subjects.  
Duration of exposure 
For MDS, the mean treatment duration of the entire MDS data pool was 49.0 weeks (median 45.6), in 
the phase 2 studies (A536-03/-05) 52.4 weeks (median 30.9), and in the phase 3 study (ACE-536-
MDS-001) 46.6 weeks (median 49.0) for Luspatercept-treated and 30.6 weeks (median 24.0) for 
placebo-treated subjects. As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group of the MDS Data Pool, 269 subjects received at least 1 dose of luspatercept, increasing the 
overall exposure from 244.13 subject-years in the original MAA to 322.93 subject-years. The median 
total treatment duration increased from 45.6 weeks to 48.1 weeks, and the median number of doses 
received increased from 13.5 to 15.0. 
For ß-thalassemia, the mean treatment duration of the entire ß-thalassemia data pool was 64.7 weeks 
(median 63.4), in the phase 2 studies (A536-04/-06) 78.2 weeks (median 78.5), and in the phase 3 
study (ACE-536-ß-THAL-001) 60.8 weeks (median 63.3) for Luspatercept-treated and 58.9 weeks 
(median 62.1) for placebo-treated subjects. As of the 07 Jan 2019 data cut-off date, exposure for the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group in the β-thalassemia Data Pool increased from 355.70 subject-
years in the original MAA to 503.14 subject-years for the 287 subjects (excluding the 92 subjects from 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 who crossed over from placebo to luspatercept after the study was 
unblinded) and to 537.50 subject-years for the 379 subjects (including the cross-over subjects). In the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group of the β-thalassemia Data Pool, the median total treatment 
duration increased from 63.4 weeks to 95.6 weeks for the 287 subjects (excluding the cross-over 
subjects) and to 83.6 weeks for the 379 subjects (including the cross-over subjects). The median 
number of doses received increased from 21.0 to 31.0 and 27.0, respectively. 
Dose  
The studies included a variety of Luspatercept doses ranging from 0.0625 mg/kg to 1.75 mg/kg in 
MDS and 0.2 mg/kg to 1.25 mg/kg in ß-thalassemia studies.   
Duration of follow-up 
302 subjects completed 18 months of treatment with luspatercept, 98 patients with MDS and 204 
patients with beta-thalassaemia. The study duration and duration of follow-up is of particular 
importance for the assessment of safety of this first-in-class agent, but follow-up duration in the MDS 
phase III trial was initially not fully clear. The Applicant has clarified the different protocol defined 
follow-up durations for the MDS and the beta-thalassaemia developments.  
The Applicant has submitted updated safety results from the ongoing phase II studies, which include 
patients treated for considerably longer periods than in the phase III trials. The long term safety profile 
of >48 weeks of treatment was discussed in comparison to the safety profile <48 weeks of treatment, 
especially with regard to differences in detected signals as well as signals related to the kidney and 
malignancies. Overall, the safety profiles up to 48 weeks and after 48 weeks of exposure were 
comparable, with many AEs decreasing in frequency and no new safety signals emerging. A follow up 
of a minimum of three years will be provided for each indication, during which serious adverse events 
and specific adverse events of special interest agreed with PRAC will be collected in the long-term 
follow-up study ACE-536-LTFU-001 (please see Section 2.8 RMP below). Long-term safety is 
considered as missing information in the RMP.

Adverse Events 
For MDS as well as ß-thalassaemia the overall TEAE rate is high, reflecting the severity of underlying 
diseases and disease burden in the populations. In the controlled studies, the proportion of TEAEs is 
mostly higher in the verum groups compared to placebo. There are some differences in the TEAE rates 
between the phase III and the phase II datasets that could be a consequence of the differences in 
exposure times (phase II studies were ongoing for longer and thus the exposer durations were longer 
compared to phase III). TEAEs reported in ≥ 15 and ≥ 5% of subjects with a > 2% higher frequency for 
luspatercept were overall comparable between the MDS and the ß-thalassemia dataset, apart from 
headache, diarrhoea, and pain (pain as a general disorder, to be distinguished from bone pain) which 
were no longer higher after adjustment for exposure in the ß-thalassemia phase III study.  
MDS: Focussing on the EAIR, the luspatercept group had significant higher rate of fatigue (35.4 vs 
24.4), bronchitis (13.2 vs 2.3), influenza (7.6 vs 0), diarrhoea (29.1 vs 16.5), nausea (27.3 vs 14.2), 
dizziness (25.4 vs 9.3), headache (20.2 vs 12.0), dyspnoea (18.4 vs 11.8), back pain (24.0 vs 12.1) 
compared to placebo. 
ß-thalassaemia: Focussing on the EAIR, the luspatercept group had significant higher rates of bone 
pain (20.6 vs 7.7), arthralgia (18.9 vs 11.6), dizziness (10.4 vs 4.2) and hyperuricaemia (6.5 vs 0.0) 
than placebo.  
Exposure-safety analyses were conducted based on a population PK model for both indications, and an 
inverse E-R relationship was shown. However, in studies with dose titration for efficacy and various 
lengths of treatment duration among subjects, the dose- or exposure-TEAE relationship is confounded 
by effect of time and dose increase over time. Therefore additional dose- and exposure-response 
analyses were conducted by using the data during the first two treatment cycles when most subjects 
did not have any dose modifications. A dose- or exposure- dependent increase in the incidence of 
TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 was not found for either indication, although the dose-TEAE relationship was affected 
by the small sample size at most dose levels 
Adverse Events of Interest  
Adverse events of interest were selected based on non-clinical findings or clinical findings from the 
Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 studies and the proposed mode of action and included events of malignancy or 
premalignant disorders, embolic and thrombotic events, kidney injury, hypertension, hypersensitivity 
reactions and musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain.  
Malignancy, Premalignant Disorders, Progression to AML or High-risk MDS 
In the beta-thalassaemia clinical trial, one case of hepatocellular carcinoma was found in a subject with 
a medical history of liver fibrosis and liver iron overload prior to study entry. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
is a known complication of chronic iron overload and is not considered related to luspatercept 
treatment. For MDS, the number of subjects as well as the number of events is rather small in the MDS 
pool, hampering interpretation and reliability of conclusions. It is noted that a between-group 
comparison (luspatercept -placebo) has to be done with caution also because the placebo group in the 
phase III MDS study included significantly fewer data due to discontinuation of subjects (mostly due to 
lack of efficacy) in this treatment arm.  
In the MDS Data Pool, malignancy EOIs were reported for 15 subjects (5.8%; EAIR 6.3/100 subject-
years; 95% CI, 3.8 to 10.5) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 1 subject (1.3%; EAIR 
2.2/100 subject-years; 95% CI, 0.3 to 15.9) in the placebo group. There were no meaningful 
differences in the rate of patients transforming to AML between the groups. Incidence rates of 
progression to AML also indicate no increased risk with luspatercept compared to external data 
sources. Solid tumours occurred only in the phase II MDS trial (in three patients), which was longer in

duration but not controlled. Updated safety data shows that progression to AML occurred in two 
(2.6%) patients receiving placebo and three (2%) patients receiving luspatercept in the pivotal study. 
There was no signal for earlier transformation in luspatercept versus placebo treated subjects. Seven 
patients (6%) from the phase II studies showed disease progression at the updated cut-off July 2019. 
Carcinogenicity 
No malignancies were reported in the β-thalassemia data pool until the original data cut-off. However, 
one possible event of AML M6 (erythroid leukaemia) in a 27 year old β-thalassemia patients was 
reported as late breaking information. This finding together with the occurrence of haematological 
malignancies in the juvenile toxicity study has led to concerns about the potential carcinogenicity of 
luspatercept treatment. During the evaluation of the MAA; the following data were submitted: 
The Applicant has provided detailed narratives and clinical reports including results of bone marrow 
aspirates, molecular and cytogenetic evaluations as well as external experts’ review of these data. The 
external haematology experts concluded that the histopathological diagnosis of AML M6 was 
confounded by erythroid hyperplasia due to the underlying beta-thalassaemia. Molecular screening 
found no mutations diagnostic for AML, which are present in almost 90% of AML cases, but could also 
not definitely rule out the possibility of erythroleukemia. In summary, the experts concluded that AML 
M6 cannot with absolute certainty be ruled out, however, available data points to a low probability of 
this diagnosis. Based on the submitted documentation this view can be supported. 
Furthermore, the Applicant has identified one study from Taiwan (Chung, 2015) investigating the 
incidence of cancer in 2655 patients diagnosed with thalassaemia between 1998 and 2010 compared 
to a cohort comprised of 10 620 age and gender matched persons from the general population without 
thalassaemia. An increased risk for haematological malignancies could be identified for subjects with 
thalassaemia, most pronounced in those who had received blood transfusions. These data point to the 
possibility of a higher incidence rate of haematologic malignancies in patients with thalassaemia at 
baseline. 
The Applicant discussed the non-clinical toxicity findings in the context of the mechanism of action of 
luspatercept and included a literature review and a discussion, highlighting the current state of 
knowledge and the remaining gaps. Apart from the experiments performed for this MA and presented 
in the dossier, literature offers a perspective on the potential carcinogenic risk associated with the 
inhibition of the targets of luspatercept, which are members of the superfamily of transforming growth 
factors (TGF)-β. Considering the complex ligand binding profile of luspatercept and the mixed 
results/conclusions on the role of these different ligands in tumour promotion or suppression, it is 
indeed very difficult to draw a conclusion about its possible influence on tumorigenesis. The risk of AML 
has been added as an important potential risk and will be monitored in study ACE-536-LTFU-001 
(please see RMP). 
The Applicant hypothesised that the mechanism of carcinogenicity observed in the juvenile toxicity 
study is specific to the developing hematopoietic system in immature rats and that this notion is 
supported by the data from the three-month repeat dose toxicity study in young and mature rats 
(Report 20017484), where no test article-related increased incidence of malignancies was noted. In 
consequence, the potential risk of a carcinogenic effect on the developing haematopoietic system 
might not be relevant to the adult populations sought to be included into the SmPC for MDS and beta-
thalassaemia. However, clinical studies with infants/toddlers from the age of 6 months onwards are 
planned within the agreed PIP. Taking into account that the increased incidence of haematopoietic 
malignancies in the juvenile toxicity study might be related to a mechanism of carcinogenicity specific 
to the developing hematopoietic system, and that the early haematopoietic system in young 
children/infants exhibits specific risks towards malignant degeneration (Copley and Eaves 2013, DOI: 
10.1038/emm.2013.98;), the CHMP was of the opinion that inclusion of young children and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 167/195 
 
  
  
 
eventually proposed lower age range for paediatric trials should be reconsidered and off-label use in 
children was reflected as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Comparing phase 3 MDS subjects on placebo to those receiving luspatercept, no substantial differences 
were identified for progression from IPSS-R very low or low-risk to intermediate-risk. Specifically, 
there is no indication that subjects on luspatercept treatment worsen more often or earlier. For 
progression to high-risk MDS, the rates of subjects experiencing this AE are comparable for 
luspatercept and placebo, with 3.3% (5/153 subjects) and 2.6% (2/76 subjects), respectively. 
Data from the complete clinical study programme in MDS, beta-thalassaemia and myelofibrosis does 
not point to an increase in the incidence of malignancies with luspatercept treatment. The provided 
updated safety data is appreciated and does not raise concern. But exposure is still limited to a median 
treatment duration of 48 (max 221) weeks for MDS and about 84 (max 231) weeks for beta-
thalassaemia, which is not sufficient to exclude an increase in malignant transformation in the longer 
term. Continuing surveillance of this potential risk for long-term exposure is thus warranted. 
Therefore, this major issue was considered adequately addressed by the Applicant through the 
presentation of updated data from the complete clinical development programme, evaluation of 
relevant published data and the initiation of pharmacovigilance measures as agreed in the RMP. 
Thromboembolic Events 
The incidence of embolic and thrombotic events EOIs in the Luspatercept Data Pool was 4.0% (23 
subjects) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 2.1% (4 subjects) in the pooled placebo 
treatment group. The higher incidence of thromboembolic events in the luspatercept pool was driven 
by splenectomised subjects from the β-thalassemia Data Pool.  
Thromboembolic events are common complications of thalassaemia, however, event rates in the 
placebo arm were small and smaller also compared to the phase III MDS placebo group. Event 
incidence rates in the phase II and phase III Luspatercept arms were comparable, also regarding the 
EAIRs, but higher compared to the placebo group of phase III.  
All subjects with at least one embolic or thrombotic event in phase III were splenectomised, and 
splenectomy is indeed a known risk factor for thrombosis among patients with thalassaemia. A 
respective warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In the total ß-thalassaemia data pool, more 
than half of the subjects were splenectomised prior to the study.  
Comparing Luspatercept-treated splenectomised subjects to Luspatercept-treated non-splenectomised 
subjects, the former had a higher incidence of infections and infestation (69.0% vs 56.5%), 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (40.9% vs 25.8%) and investigations (19.9% vs 6.5%). 
However, efficacy subgroup analyses showed that patients with splenectomy had a trend for better 
response (primary efficacy analysis) compared to non-splenectomised patients, thus rendering the B/R 
sufficiently positive for these patients. 
In MDS, there are no clear indications of a higher incidence in thromboembolic event rates with 
luspatercept. However, the comparison is hampered by the fact that in phase III nearly all placebo 
patients discontinued and fewer data are available from this group. Thromboembolic events has been 
added as an important identified risk in the RMP and additional data will be provided in study ACE-536-
LTFU-001 (please see pharmacovigilance plan in the RMP). 
Kidney Injury 
In the clinical phase III studies for MDS and ß-thalassemia, while some events related to the kidney 
occurred more often in the luspatercept group, the differences are small and no relation to treatment 
can be determined with certainty at this stage of the assessment. It is questioned whether the 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 168/195 
 
  
  
 
performed clinical phase II and III were indeed sensitive to detect respective signals in humans. The 
extent of exposure might have been too limited (in terms of number of patients exposed, duration of 
treatment and observational periods) to detect changes in kidney function. However, the number of 
kidney injury events and proteinuria was higher in Studies A536-04/06, compared to Study ACE-536-
THAL-001 (6,3% vs 3,6 for kidney injury and 6,3% vs 2,2% for proteinuria). The Applicant was asked 
to discuss whether these differences could be related to type of luspatercept formulation administered 
(liquid vs lyophilised). The difference in kidney injury events and proteinuria between Studies A536-
04/A536-06 and ACE-536-B-THAL-001 was unlikely related to type of luspatercept formulation as 
almost all subjects with kidney injury EOI were on lyophilized powder formulation at the time of their 
first kidney injury event (3 out of 4 subjects in A536-04/A536-06 and all subjects in ACE-536-B-THAL-
001.   
With regards to laboratory findings, slight decrease in creatinine clearance can be observed for patients 
in the luspatercept treatment groups versus patients who received placebo. Furthermore, 
albumin/creatinine ratios appeared to be changed from the baseline in the luspatercept treatment 
group compared to placebo. The Applicant has provided a comprehensive discussion on kidney toxicity 
and a detailed overview over the kidney function parameters in the pivotal trial for beta-thalassaemia 
for subjects both on placebo and luspatercept. In addition, comparative data of the safety profile for 
exposure below and more than 48 weeks provided for both the MDS and the beta-thalassaemia trials 
do not show an increase in renal AEs with longer treatment duration. Kidney parameters will further be 
monitored in the long-term extension study to gain additional data. The SmPC recommends the 
monitoring of RFP in patients with kidney impairment in section 4.2. This measures are considered 
adequate. Influencing factors for patients with beta-thalassaemia are chronic anemia, hypoxia and iron 
overload as well as a possible role of iron chelators, which all contribute to the deterioration of renal 
function (Demosthenous et al, 2019, Hematology, 24:1, 426-438). 
Hypertension 
When looking at the comparison of the pooled luspatercept group with placebo, hypertension EOIs 
seem to occur more frequently with luspatercept treatment than with placebo. The incidence of 
hypertension EOIs is rather high in the MDS studies (note: significantly older patient population 
compared to ß-thalassemia) and highest in the phase II patient population (longest exposure), which 
seems to be the driver for the overall observed difference. In the controlled MDS trial, rates were 
balanced between luspatercept and placebo arms, however. In ß-thalassaemia, a slightly higher 
hypertension EOIs rate was observed in the luspatercept groups (phase III and II) compared to the 
placebo group in phase III, however, the differences were very small. Blood pressure monitoring is 
recommended in section 4.4 of the SmPC to alert the treating physician to this risk. 
Hypersensitivity 
Overall, the proportion of patients experiencing hypersensitive like events was higher in the pooled 
Luspatercept group compared to placebo (8.4 % vs. 4.1%), mostly driven by phase II results where 
the exposure and observational periods are longer. No anaphylactic reactions have been reported. 
Musculoskeletal Disorder – Bone Pain 
The incidence of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was higher in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group (37.5%) than in the pooled placebo treatment group (29.5%), also, if the incidence 
was adjusted for exposure (EAIR). Back pain and bone pain are the predominant drivers and a relation 
to the MoA appears likely. 
Deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 169/195 
 
  
  
 
27 deaths were reported from the clinical investigation programme in MDS and β-thalassaemia until 
data cut-off. 17 subjects (3.0%) died in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 10 subjects 
(5.2%) in the placebo group. None of the deaths were assessed as related by the investigator. The 
provided narratives allow secondary assessment of the events leading to the death of each subjects 
and the investigators’ assessment is conclusive and can be followed. The new cut-off July 2019 
provided the following data: In the MDS programme, 39 (14.4%) subjects died in the luspatercept 
treatment group versus 18 (23.7%) in the placebo group on-study. In the beta-thalassaemia 
programme, 6 (2.1% excluding cross-over patients or 1.6% including cross-over) patients receiving 
luspatercept versus 1 (0.9%) patient receiving placebo died-on study. 
SAE 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (23.8%) than in 
the pooled placebo treatment group (15.0%). The SOC with the highest subject incidence of SAEs in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group was Infections and infestations (incidence of 8.8%). 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported only in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (2.5% of 
subjects). Deep vein thrombosis was the only SAE assessed as related to treatment by the investigator 
experienced by >1 subject (2 subjects [0.4%]). 
In the MDS pool, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group (37.7%) than in the placebo treatment group (30.3%). The SOCs with the highest percentage of 
subjects with SAEs (at least 5% of subjects) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group were 
Infections and Infestations; Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps); Cardiac disorders; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders. 
In the β-thalassaemia Data Pool, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was higher in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group (13.2%) than in the placebo treatment group (5.5%). The difference was 
driven by imbalances in the percentages of subjects with TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC 
(4.5% and 2.8%, respectively) and thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident (1.0% 
and 0%) and deep vein thrombosis (0.7% and 0%).  
The nature of the observed SAEs reflects the different patient populations, with the MDS population 
significantly older and with more cardiac comorbidities than the β-thalassaemia subjects. Disease 
progression and cardiac disorders are clearly evident in the MDS data pool. Consistently reflected 
across the two different populations is the increased incidence of thromboembolic events and of 
infections in luspatercept treated subjects versus placebo.  
Safety in special populations 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study population and throughout the clinical 
development program. Given the findings in the nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies together with the high probability of a similar effect in humans due to the mode of action, a 
contraindication for pregnancy was included in section 4.3 of the SmPC. Additional measures 
(educational materials have also been put in place to assess HCP awareness of key messages included 
in the HCP Checklist for luspatercept including recommendations for counselling of WCBP and 
instructions for providing WCBP with the Patient Card, please see RMP). In addition, a study to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the additional risk Minimisation Measures in Europe has been requested 
(please see RMP). 
Immunological Events 
The observed influence of either pre-existing or treatment emergent anti-drug-antibodies on the safety 
profile of luspatercept appears limited and does not cause concern at the present time. The incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 170/195 
 
  
  
 
of TEADA was higher in subjects with MDS than in those with β-thalassemia (8.85% versus 1.41%). 
One potential explanation for such a difference might be the difference in MDS and beta-thalassaemia 
patients´ age (median age: 71 years vs. 30 years) and the disease-associated immune status, 
however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The Applicant addressed the concerns raised during the evaluation of the MAA with the provision of 
updated safety data and additional analyses. The original data set with a cut-off of May 2018 was 
supplemented by comprehensive safety data until January 2019 and updated information for deaths, 
SAEs and AESIs up to July 2019. The new analyses did not reveal new safety signals, but rather 
alleviated most of the concerns highlighted earlier. Additional information pertaining to unfavourable 
effects and recommendations for patient management was introduced into the PI. The remaining 
uncertainties concerning the effect of luspatercept on renal function, malignancies and other adverse 
events of interest will be addressed by post-marketing study (please see RMP). 
In conclusion, the safety database is considered sufficient to support a marketing authorisation of 
Reblozyl. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- ACE-536-LTFU-001: To evaluate the long-term safety, including TEEs (only in the β-thalassaemia 
population with splenectomy) and progression to AML and/or other malignancies/ pre-malignancies, of 
luspatercept in patients who have participated in Acceleron or Celgene-sponsored luspatercept clinical 
trials. 
- Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Additional Risk Minimisation Measures in Europe: To assess 
HCP awareness of key messages included in the HCP Checklist for luspatercept including 
recommendations for counselling of WCBP and instructions for providing WCBP with the Patient Card.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MDS-associated anaemia  
The initially claimed indication was “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
anaemia requiring transfusions due to very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
(MDS), who have ring sideroblasts and loss or lack of response to, are ineligible for, or intolerant to 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy”.  
The indication was later slightly amended to “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for 
erythropoietin-based therapy (see section 5.1). 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are acquired bone marrow disorders occurring predominantly in the elderly   
population characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis, development of peripheral cytopenias, and risk 
of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS patients classified as lower risk based on the IPSS 
criteria, progression to AML is delayed and survival is longer compared to patients with higher risk 
disease. Therefore, treatment in lower risk patients is mainly focussed on controlling anaemia (and 
other cytopenias) and improving quality of life. Anaemia is the most common cytopenia among 
patients with lower-risk MDS. The target population for Reblozyl are MDS patients with ring 
sideroblasts, most of which carry an SF3B1 mutation; the latter being associated with a more 
favourable disease course. 
Patients requiring RBC transfusions of at least 2 units/8 weeks were included into the pivotal trial. This 
corresponds to a transfusion-dependent population as defined by the IWG 2006 criteria. The recruited 
patient population is also in line with the proposals for revised MDS IWG response criteria (Platzecker 
et al., 2019).  
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
The initially claimed indication was ‘Reblozyl is indicated for treatment of adult patients with anaemia 
requiring transfusions due to beta thalassaemia (β thalassaemia).’ 
This was changed during assessment to “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1)” to more 
adequately reflect the target population. 
The β-thalassaemias are a group of inherited disorders characterised by absent or reduced production 
of the β-globin chains of haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in human RBCs.  
Transfusion-dependent (TD) beta thalassaemia refers to the most severe form of beta thalassemia in 
which there is minimal to no beta globin chain production and consequently, little to no HbA and HbG, 
which then has to be externally substituted (by regular transfusions).  
Patients with TD β-thalassaemia (which includes conventional β-thalassaemia major and severe forms 
of HgbE/β-thalassaemia) commonly come to clinical attention in early childhood (before 2 years of 
age) with severe anaemia (< 7 g/dL); they require life-long, regular blood transfusion therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 176/195 
 
  
  
 
Patients with NTD β-thalassemia present later in childhood or adolescence with mild to moderate 
anaemia and require no or only occasional transfusions in instances of blood loss or worsening 
anaemia due to periods of physiological stress (e.g., during infections, surgery, or pregnancy). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
MDS-associated anaemia 
Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is the first line option in patients with lower 
risk MDS-associated symptomatic anaemia without del(5q) mutation and with serum EPO levels ≤500 
mU/mL. Despite an initial response to ESA treatment, approximately 70% of patients eventually 
become unresponsive to ESAs. If no response occurs with ESAs alone, addition of G-CSF can be 
considered, especially in patients with ≥15% RS in the marrow (Greenberg 2017).  
Second line treatment options include immunomodulatory agents such as lenalidomide (approved for 
lower risk MDS patients with a del(5q) mutation) and azacitidine (a hypomethylating agent approved in 
higher risk MDS patients). Immunosuppressive therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (±cyclosporine) 
may be considered in selected younger patients with lower risk MDS.  
Chronic RBC transfusions often remain the mainstay of therapy in insufficiently responding MDS 
patients, but RBC transfusions carry the risk of iron overload resulting in cardiac, hepatic or endocrine 
dysfunction and a higher infection risk, as well as immunogenicity. Whether iron overload indeed 
contributes to negative clinical outcomes in transfusion-dependent patients with MDS remains 
disputed, however (Fenaux 2009, Ades 2014). 
In summary, an unmet medical need exists in transfusion-dependent MDS patients with symptomatic 
anaemia, who are ineligible for ESA or become unresponsive to ESA treatment. 
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
Transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia is a condition of high unmet medical need. The main available 
management options are RBC transfusions (leading to iron overload disorders), iron chelation therapy, 
(splenectomy) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
Zynteglo, a gene therapy medicinal product, was recently authorised in the EU for the treatment of β-
thalassaemia in patients with a non-β0/β0 genotype. No approved treatment addressing the underlying 
ineffective erythropoiesis and anaemia is available for the β0/β0 genotype. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
MDS-associated anaemia 
The pivotal Study ACE-536-MDS-001 is an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study to determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo in subjects with 
anaemia due to IPSS-R very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, who require 
RBC transfusions. In addition, subjects were refractory to (nonresponse or response that is no longer 
maintained), intolerant of, or ineligible for (serum EPO > 200 U/L) ESA treatment.  
Eligible subjects were randomized to luspatercept (at a starting dose level of 1.0 mg/kg SC injection 
every 3 weeks [Q3W]) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and entered the 24-week double-blind Primary Phase 
of the Treatment Period. If subjects did not achieve RBC transfusion independence after at least 2 
consecutive doses at the 1.0 mg/kg starting dose level, luspatercept dose could be increased to 1.33 
mg/kg; after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.33 mg/kg dose level, the luspatercept dose level 
could be increased to a maximum of 1.75 mg/kg.

Subjects who experienced clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria per 
protocol at the Week 25 Visit MDS Disease Assessment continued double-blind treatment in the 
Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until they met any discontinuation criteria as per protocol. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of luspatercept as compared with placebo 
on RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) over > 8 weeks in these MDS patients. As of the clinical 
data cut-off date of 08 May 2018, enrolment in the study is complete; however, long-term treatment 
and follow-up are ongoing. The initial submission includes data for all subjects who either completed 
the Week 48 visit or discontinued treatment before Week 48 and entered Post-treatment Follow-up. 
The ITT population for the evaluation of efficacy included 229 subjects (153 randomized to 
luspatercept and 76 randomized to placebo). The median duration of treatment was 49.0 weeks in the 
luspatercept treatment group and 24.0 weeks in the placebo group. 
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 is an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 
to compare the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo for the treatment of subjects with β-
thalassaemia who require regular RBC transfusions.  
Consenting subjects entered a 12-week screening/run-in period during which eligibility was assessed 
and 12 weeks of transfusion history was collected prospectively, in addition to 12-weeks of historical 
retrospective transfusion history (i.e., total of 24 weeks of RBC transfusion history for determination of 
eligibility). Eligible subjects were randomized to luspatercept or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The study 
includes a double-blind treatment period [weeks 1 to 48] and long-term treatment period [after week 
48; subjects continued to receive the study drug to which they were initially randomized]. A post-
treatment follow-up period of 156 weeks after the last dose of study treatment is planned.  
After unblinding for the primary analysis, eligible subjects (including those randomized to placebo) 
were given the option of open-label luspatercept treatment for up to 5 years (until all subjects initially 
assigned to luspatercept in the double-blind Treatment Period completed a total treatment duration of 
5 years from Dose 1 of the double-blinded phase).  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the proportion of subjects treated with luspatercept 
plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC who achieve erythroid response. The primary 
endpoint was the percentage of “responders”, defined as subjects achieving RBC transfusion reduction 
of ≥ 33% (min. 2 units) from baseline to week 13-24. Enrolment in the study is complete; however, 
long-term treatment and follow-up are ongoing. The initial submission includes data for all subjects, 
who were either treated for at least 48 weeks (and were continuing treatment after the cut-off date) or 
had discontinued treatment before the cut-off date and had entered post-treatment follow-up. 
The ITT population of efficacy included 336 subjects (224 randomized to luspatercept plus BSC and 
112 randomized to placebo plus BSC). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
MDS associated anaemia 
The pivotal phase III study ACE-536-MDS-001 showed statistically significant results in favour of 
luspatercept in the primary and all hierarchically tested (key) secondary endpoints: 
Primary analysis (pre-specified): RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks from Week 1 to 24 was achieved in 58/153 
(37.91%) and 10/76 (13.16%) patients in the luspatercept and Placebo arm, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 178/195 
 
  
  
 
Key secondary endpoints: RBC-TI ≥ 12 weeks from Week 1 to 24 and from Week 1 to 48 showed 
slightly lower effect sizes. A post hoc analysis on the effect of TI during 16 weeks was supportive of a 
sustained treatment effect (19% and 3.9% achieved 16 weeks of TI during weeks 1 to 24 in the 
luspatercept and placebo arm, respectively). 
Additional endpoints evaluating the change from baseline in transfusions, modified haematologic 
improvement, duration of response, mean haemoglobin over time, changes in serum ferritin all showed 
results in favour of luspatercept. 
The change from baseline in RBC transfusions in weeks 9 to 24 was -4.0 and 0 for luspatercept and 
Placebo, respectively; in weeks 33 to 48 -5.0 and -2.5 for luspatercept and Placebo, respectively. 
The results of a reanalysis of the transfusion data to estimate the ratio in transfusion rates between 
treatment arms are in support of a reduction of transfusion frequency. Estimates for the rate ratio (i.e. 
the number of transfusion events with luspatercept treatment divided by the number of transfusion 
events with placebo during Weeks 1 to 24) range from 0.58 to 0.80 (95% CI) in favour of luspatercept. 
Results from the analysis of the mean difference in transfusion units using an ANCOVA model are 
consistent to those presented for the number of transfusion events. These indicate a reduction of the 
transfused RBC units in the luspatercept group (compared to placebo) by about 3.6 to 7.1 units (95% 
CI) during Weeks 1 to 24. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary, key secondary endpoints and ‘modified Hematological 
improvement – erythroid’ (mHI-E) support the overall results for all investigated subgroups. 
All additionally provided analyses investigating effects according to low and high transfusion burden 
indicate a slightly smaller effect in the higher baseline transfusion burden groups, although still in 
favour of luspatercept.  
The data that is available in patients with very high transfusion burden (>8 units/8 weeks) is limited, 
which is reflected in the SmPC.  
Phase 2 results, although derived from a broader patient population, provided proof of concept; in a 
‘phase 3 like’ population, results were consistent with the Phase 3 results. 
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
The pivotal phase III study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 showed statistically compelling results in favour of 
luspatercept in the primary and all hierarchically tested (key) secondary endpoints: 
Primary analysis (pre-specified): RBC transfusion reduction of ≥ 33% (min. 2 units) from baseline to 
week 13-24 was achieved in 21% (48/224) in the luspatercept & BSC arm versus in 4.5% (5/112) in 
the Placebo & BSC arm. 
Key secondary endpoints evaluating 50% response and response at later time intervals (week 37-48) 
as well as mean change from baseline (to week 13 – 24) showed comparable effect sizes. 
Additional endpoints evaluating response with rolling week analyses, time to erythroid response, 
duration of response, transfusion independence, change from baseline in serum ferritin and cardiac 
T2* showed results in favour of luspatercept.  
The mean RBC transfusion burden reduction per subject in RBC units from baseline to Week 1 - 48 
interval was 4.75 RBC units/48 weeks with luspatercept (ITT). The difference between Luspatercept 
and Placebo in the change in RBC transfusion burden is -5.83 (Units/48 Weeks, 95% CI; -7.01, -4.65). 
For the 48-week interval Week 49 to Week 96, a continued decrease of -5.66 Units compared to 
baseline was observed in the Luspatercept group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 179/195 
 
  
  
 
In the last 12 weeks of 96 weeks of treatment, a statistically significant mean decrease of -464.96 
ug/L of serum Ferritin (+73.20 ug/L in the Placebo group) in the Luspatercept group compared to 
baseline was recorded. 
By and large, the above stated results apply irrespective of baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics.  
Results from the phase II dose escalating study A536-04 showed erythroid response defined as ≥ 20% 
reduction in RBC transfusion burden in TD subjects during any rolling 12-week window on treatment 
compared to pretreatment in 25 (80.6%) subjects, all of whom received luspatercept at dose levels of 
0.6 to 1.25 mg/kg transfusion. Erythroid response could also be shown in the extension study A536-06 
over 48 weeks. Results support choice of doses used in phase III. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
MDS-associated anaemia 
A large proportion of placebo patients was discontinued from treatment after Week 24 for fulfilling the 
criteria of “progression of disease” or “lack of clinical benefit”, hampering the statistical evaluation of 
potential long-term treatment effects beyond 24 weeks. Additional analyses using adequate imputation 
methods were provided that are supportive of the primary analysis. Nevertheless, the discontinuation 
of a large number of patients, especially in the placebo arm, limits the interpretation of the study. This 
appears especially relevant in view of the intended chronic treatment with luspatercept. To prevent 
futile treatment in case no clinical benefit is observed over several weeks at the highest recommended 
dose, a stopping rule has been introduced in the SmPC. 
The provided sensitivity analyses on change of Hb over time indicate a small treatment effect in favour 
of luspatercept. However, all analyses on the effect of luspatercept on haemoglobin need to be 
interpreted with caution, as a large number of Hb values was likely influenced by previous 
transfusions. Importantly, neither the 14/3 rule nor the exclusion of all hb values within 14 days of 
transfusion that was applied in the requested sensitivity analyses were sufficient to rule out any 
influence of previous transfusions on Hb. 
Luspatercept failed to show an effect on quality of life. The HRQoL results appear of limited value to 
support the primary analysis and the clinical relevance of the results due to imbalances between 
treatment arms in some subdomains. 
The dose response is only weakly characterised, with dose-exposure-response analyses relying on 
clinical endpoints rather than PD parameters.  
Beta-thalassaemia associated anaemia 
The effect, though statistically compelling, seems small in absolute numbers. It is noticed that for the 
power calculation, the response rate was expected to be approximately twice as high (40% vs 20%) as 
actually seen in the trial (21.4% and 4.5%). The primary endpoint was a binary outcome, and thus 
less informative than the analysis of mean changes over time. The relevance of the achieved reduction 
in transfusion units/hospital visits for the quality of life of individual patients is not easy to interpret 
since the studied population indicated a good quality of life at baseline (which was not improved by 
luspatercept treatment) despite the need for frequent transfusions. To prevent futile treatment in case 
no clinical benefit is observed over several weeks at the highest recommended dose, a stopping rule 
has been introduced in the SmPC. 
Inter-group comparisons after 48 weeks become less robust as the number of patients per group 
decreases. At week 96 only 3 placebo patients remain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 180/195 
 
  
  
 
Luspatercept treatment also could not reduce liver iron content (LIC) after 48 weeks of treatment and 
no convincing evidence of a relevant reduction was seen after 96 weeks. It should be pointed out that 
the primary responder threshold (33% reduction in RBC units) was initially justified by an estimated 
yearly decrease in LIC by ~ 3 mg/g dw.  
The dose response is only weakly characterised as the phase II dose response study was very small. 
Support from pharmacological investigations and models is also limited.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the juvenile toxicity study WIL-961003, 3 cases of haematologic malignancies (1 case each of 
lymphoma, myeloid- and lymphoid leukaemia), which developed within 6 months of treatment 
initiation, were observed in juvenile rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The Applicant hypothesises that the 
mechanism of carcinogenicity is specific to the developing hematopoietic system in immature rats and 
that this notion is supported by the data from the three-month repeat dose toxicity study in young and 
mature rats (Report 20017484), where no similar test article-related increased incidence of 
malignancies was noted.  
In a mouse model of tumour progression (study PPR113), slight increases in tumour weight were 
observed after 6 administrations of RAP-536 (murine analogue of ACE-536) of 1 and 10 mg/kg. 
However, after further discussion it was concluded that the data obtained in this model were not 
adequate to judge on a potential tumorigenic effect of luspatercept. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, membrano-proliferative 
glomerulonephritis in the kidney was observed at doses of 1 mg/kg and above. These histopathologic 
findings were accompanied by increases in BUN and creatinine at higher dose levels. Based on the 
nature and incidence of these kidney findings, a LOAEL in rats was determined at 1 mg/kg and a 
NOAEL in monkeys was established at 0.3 mg/kg.  
TEAEs 
95.3% of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 91.2% of subjects in the pooled 
placebo treatment group reported at least one TEAE. Incidence rates of serious TEAEs, TEAEs of Grade 
3 or 4, TEAEs leading to dose interruption, and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were higher 
in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group. 
The most frequently reported (≥ 15.0%) TEAEs for the pooled luspatercept treatment group of the MDS 
Data Pool were fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, cough, dizziness, hypertension, and peripheral edema in 
the original MAA. With the cut-off 07 Jan 2019, additionally headache, viral upper respiratory tract 
infection and back pain were reported at an incidence of ≥ 15.0%. For the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group of the β-Thalassaemia Data Pool, the most frequently reported (≥ 15.0%) TEAEs 
were headache, back pain, bone pain, arthralgia, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, 
asthenia, oropharyngeal pain, and cough for the original MAA. No additional preferred terms at an 
incidence of ≥15.0% were reported at the later cut-off. 
Adverse events of special interest  
Malignancy, Premalignant Disorders, Progression to AML or High-risk MDS 
MDS: Progression to AML occurred in two (2.6%) patients receiving placebo and three (2%) patients 
receiving luspatercept in the pivotal study. There was no signal for earlier transformation in 
luspatercept versus placebo treated subjects. Seven patients (6%) from the phase 2 studies showed 
disease progression at the updated cut-off July 2019. However, as compared to the phase 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 181/195 
 
  
  
 
population, the phase 2 population had more indicators of severe disease. The incidence rates of solid 
tumors do not give rise to concern in comparison with published data on patients with or without MDS. 
Beta-thalassaemia: In the beta-thalassamia clinical trials supporting the current MAA, in addition to the 
one unconfirmed AML case, a case of hepatocellular carcinoma occurred.  
In other ongoing clinical trials in either MDS or beta-thalassaemia, not supporting the currently sought 
indications, no malignancies were reported. In a single arm phase II trial in myelofibrosis, 
transformation to AML was observed in one patient; transformation to AML is however also a 
characteristic of the underlying disease. 
The risk of haematologic malignancies (including AML) has been added as an important risk in the 
RMP, monitoring of the risk will take place in study ACE-536-LTFU-001. 
TEEs: 
The incidence of embolic and thrombotic events in the luspatercept data pool was 4.0% (23 subjects) 
in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 2.1% (4 subjects) in the pooled placebo treatment 
group. The higher incidence in the luspatercept group was driven by the splenectomised subjects 
(more than 50% of subjects) from the β-thalassaemia data pool. It is noted that all subjects with at 
least 1 embolic or thrombotic event in phase 3 were splenectomised, and splenectomy is indeed a 
known risk factor for thrombosis among patients with thalassaemia. A respective warning is included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. Thromboembolic events in splenectomised patients has been added as an 
important identified risk and monitoring of this risk will take place as part of study ACE-536-LTFU-001 
(please see RMP). 
The incidence of hypertension EOIs in the Luspatercept Data Pool was higher in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group (11.2%) than in the pooled placebo treatment group (5.7%). The most 
frequently reported hypertension EOI (≥ 10% of subjects in either treatment group) was the preferred 
term of hypertension (10.7% and 4.7% of subjects in the pooled luspatercept and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively), driven by the (elderly) patient population in the MDS phase II study. 
Luspatercept was associated with mean increases in SBP and DBP of approximately 5 mm Hg from 
baseline. The proportion of patients experiencing hypersensitivity-like events was higher in the pooled 
luspatercept group compared to placebo (8.4 % vs. 4.1%), mostly driven by phase II results. 
The incidence of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was higher in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group (37.5%) than in the pooled placebo treatment group (29.5%). Back pain and bone 
pain are the predominant drivers and could be related to the MoA. 
27 deaths were reported for the clinical investigation programme in MDS and β-thalassaemia until 
initial data cut-off. 17 subjects (3.0%) died in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 10 
subjects (5.2%) in the placebo group. None of the deaths were assessed as related by the investigator.  
The new cut-off July 2019 provided the following data: In the MDS programme, 39 (14.4%) subjects 
died in the luspatercept treatment group versus 18 (23.7%) in the placebo group on-study. In the 
beta-thalassaemia programme, 6 (2.1% excluding cross-over patients or 1.6% including cross-over) 
patients receiving luspatercept versus 1 (0.9%) patient receiving placebo died-on study. 
The incidence of serious AEs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (23.8%) than in 
the pooled placebo treatment group (15.0%). The SOC with the highest subject incidence of SAEs in 
the pooled luspatercept treatment group was Infections and infestations (incidence of 8.8%). Deep 
vein thrombosis was the only SAE assessed as related to treatment by the investigator experienced by 
>1 subject (2 subjects [0.4%]). For both indications, data provided with the newer cut-offs showed 
incidences and types of SAEs similar to those in the original MAA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 182/195 
 
  
  
 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was higher (8.8%) in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group (3.6%).  
Immunogenicity 
Of 544 evaluable subjects treated with luspatercept, 27 subjects (4.96%) tested positive for TEADA 
against luspatercept, with neutralizing TEADAs detected in 11 subjects (2.02%). The incidence of 
TEADAs was 8.85% in subjects with MDS and 1.41% in subjects with beta-thalassemia.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Non-clinical data indicates a potential for renal toxicity in multiple species even at subclinical doses; no 
NOAEL could be established for renal safety in rats and a NOAEL of only 0.3 mg/kg in the Cynomolgus 
monkey.  
In the clinical studies, a slight decrease in creatinine clearance was observed for patients in the 
luspatercept treatment groups. However, other markers of renal injury were not appreciably increased 
and a comparison of the safety profile of exposures below and above 48 weeks yielded no worrying 
signals. Median exposure in the luspatercept treated group is approximately 48 weeks for MDS and 84 
weeks for β-thalassaemia, while unlimited treatment duration is envisaged. Continuing surveillance of 
renal function is planned in the still ongoing clinical trials as well as in the long-term follow-up trial 
(please see RMP). 
The interpretation of comparative safety data from the phase 3 trials is hampered by the fact that 
significantly less data from placebo patients is available. Most subjects in the placebo group of the 
phase 3 MDS study discontinued treatment early (mostly due to lack of efficacy), while in the β-
thalassaemia trial such a differential drop-out was less noticeable.  
No malignancies were reported in the β-thalassemia data pool until the original data cut-off. However, 
one possible event of AML M6 (erythroid leukaemia) in a 27 year old β-thalassemia patients was 
reported as late breaking information. Data from the complete clinical study programme in MDS, beta-
thalassaemia and MF does not point to an increase in the incidence of malignancies with luspatercept 
treatment. The updated safety data does not raise concern, but exposure is still limited to a median 
treatment duration of 48 (max 221) weeks for MDS and 84 (max 231) weeks for beta-thalassaemia, 
which is not sufficient to exclude an increase in malignant transformation in the long term. Continuing 
surveillance of this potential risk for long-term exposure is thus warranted (please see RMP).

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
MDS 
In patients classified as lower risk MDS based on the IPSS criteria, progression to AML occurs later and 
survival is longer compared with patients with higher risk MDS. Therefore, treatment is mainly 
focussed on controlling anaemia (and other cytopenias) and improving quality of life.  
ESAs are an established first line treatment in MDS-associated anaemia, but the majority of patients 
will eventually become unresponsive to ESAs; others might not respond/not tolerate them at all. 
Especially patients with high endogenous EPO levels and high transfusion needs seem to respond 
poorly to ESA treatment, and are in need of other treatment options. These patients are proposed to 
be targeted with luspatercept treatment. 
Transfusion independence and reduction of transfusion requirement are important objectives of 
treatment, and this was evaluated in the pivotal phase 3 trial. The primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints show a statistically significant result in favour of luspatercept. However, the clinical 
relevance of these responder endpoints (i.e. proportion of patients with any 8- or 12 weeks of RBC-TI 
during 24 or 48 weeks) is difficult to interpret. Understanding the effect in terms of transfusion burden 
reduction is important, as e.g. patients with high transfusion burden hardly achieve periods of 
transfusion independence. In addition, sustainability of the effect over time is a relevant consideration, 
as a single period of 8 or 12 weeks of transfusion independence may not justify taking the risk of 
experiencing unfavourable effects. An important limitation to the interpretation of long-term efficacy is 
however the high attrition rate in placebo patients, who were allowed to discontinue the study after 
week 24 in case of no clinical benefit.   
Reassuringly, the presented secondary analyses mostly support the primary and key secondary results. 
The post hoc analyses most relevant for interpretation of the clinical relevance of the effect are those 
on the change in transfusion rates/units as well as serum ferritin levels over time, using adequate 
imputation methods for missing data.  
Estimates for the rate ratio (i.e. the number of transfusion events with luspatercept treatment divided 
by the number of transfusion events with placebo during Weeks 1 to 24) range from 0.57 to 0.79 
(95% CI) in favour of luspatercept. This result is consistent with a mean reduction of 3.6 to 7.1 units 
(95% CI) compared to placebo during the same period. The effect is largely maintained during weeks 
25 to 48, albeit associated with a larger uncertainty due to the large number of imputed patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 189/195 
 
  
  
 
 
Of note, there is an indication of a smaller effect in patients with higher baseline transfusion burden. 
Efficacy and safety data in patients with a baseline transfusion burden of more than 12 units/8 weeks 
are scarce; this has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Taken together, the treatment effect as observed in this study, albeit small, is regarded clinically 
relevant in patients experiencing a sustained response and is further supported by the results of serum 
ferritin levels that are in favour of luspatercept. 
To prevent patients from receiving futile treatment, a stopping rule (i.e. stop after 9 weeks of 
treatment if no clinical benefit at highest dose) was introduced in the SmPC. 
The focus of treatment with luspatercept is improvement of MDS associated anaemia, without any 
claims regarding delaying progression to higher MDS risk groups or AML and prolonging overall 
survival. Nonetheless, any detrimental effect in terms of progression of disease or shortened OS 
compared to patients treated with best standard of care would not be acceptable. Reassuringly, there 
is no indication of a detrimental treatment effect with the currently provided data. While the study is 
still ongoing and all patients will be further followed, the data are considered mature enough to draw 
meaningful conclusions on the benefit risk.  
Beta-thalassaemia  
Transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia is a condition of high unmet medical need. The main available 
management options are very limited and do not include all affected patients. HSCT is a potentially 
curative option, but only for young patients with an HLA matched HSC donor. The recently approved 
gene-therapy product Zynteglo is not indicated for patients with a ß0/ß0 genotype.  
Transfusions are the key management tool in TD ß-thalassaemia. However, regular transfusions lead 
to an iron overload, which is associated with severe long-term risks and reduced life expectancy. The 
primary objective of reducing RBC transfusions has thus acknowledged relevance for patients. 
Compared with the current symptomatic treatment of anaemia with transfusions and iron chelators a 
treatment option addressing the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis is highly desirable. 
The pivotal study showed statistically compelling results in favour of luspatercept in the primary and all 
hierarchically tested (key) secondary endpoints. Some patients (the so called “responders”) 
experienced a significant erythroid response with luspatercept treatment, achieving a ≥ 33% reduction 
and some even 50% reduction in RBC units at week 13-24 compared to baseline. However, the 
fraction of patients with such clinical improvement is rather small (about 20%).  
While the iron parameter serum ferritin improved from baseline with luspatercept treatment, other 
indicators, such as liver iron content, cardiac T2* values or iron chelator requirements, did not change 
significantly. Notably, the responder threshold for the primary endpoint was initially justified by an 
expected clinically relevant reduction in liver iron content (LIC). It is plausible that a reduction of 
transfused iron reduces the iron overload of ß-thalassemia patients; however, no such reduction was 
demonstrated in the phase 3 trial after 48 or 96 weeks of treatment. LIC measured by MRI appears to 
be superior to measurement of serum ferritin for estimating total body iron burden (Taher A. et al 
2008) and the effect of long-term luspatercept treatment on LIC will be further monitored post 
marketing.  
Many patients had no benefit from treatment and remained stable (or slightly deteriorated) in their 
transfusion need. To prevent futile treatment, a respective stopping rule (stop after 9 weeks of 
treatment if no clinical benefit at highest dose) was introduced in the SmPC .   
Luspatercept did not demonstrate an improved effect on quality of life, but it was maintained in the ITT 
population. This is due to the fact that patients had a good quality of life at baseline making 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 190/195 
 
  
  
 
demonstration of further improvement more challenging, or because effects on QoL may not be 
observable in the initial phase of treatment, but manifest only later. 
Safety MDS/Beta-thalassaemia 
There are uncertainties pertaining to long-term safety in both indications. Non-clinical findings suggest 
a carcinogenic potential with luspatercept in juvenile animals in whom the haematopoietic system is 
not yet fully developed. The Applicant has provided updated safety data from the complete clinical 
study programme in MDS, beta-thalassaemia and myelofibrosis. While this data does not raise 
concern, exposure is still limited to a median treatment duration of 48 (max 221) weeks for MDS and 
about 84 (max 231) weeks for beta-thalassaemia. This is not sufficient to exclude an increase in 
malignant transformation in the long term, and continuing surveillance of this potential risk is thus 
warranted (please see RMP). 
Other safety findings probably associated with the use of luspatercept, such as e.g. TEEs and 
hypertension, are highlighted in the SmPC to alert the treating physician to these potential risks.  
In addition, signals from non-clinical data indicate a detrimental effect of luspatercept on renal 
function. A slight decrease in creatinine clearance was observed in patients in the luspatercept 
treatment groups. Other markers of renal injury were not appreciably increased and a comparison of 
the safety profile for an exposure below and above 48 weeks also yielded no worrying signals. 
Nevertheless, continuing surveillance of renal function is planned in the still ongoing clinical trials as 
well as in the long-term follow-up trial. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
MDS 
In the pivotal trial, luspatercept showed superiority over placebo in all primary and key secondary 
analyses. The mean reduction in RBC units was 3.6 to 7.1 units (95% CI) compared to placebo during 
weeks 1 to 24 (mean, -5.3 units), and the effect was largely maintained in the second period of the 
study (weeks 25 to 48). A small proportion of patients even achieved a sustained response period of 
transfusion independence. There is some uncertainty on the long-term treatment effects as a large 
proportion of patients mainly from the placebo arm discontinued the study after Week 24. Secondary 
analyses of change in transfusion rates and RBC units as well as in serum ferritin using appropriate 
imputation methods are in support of the primary/key secondary analyses. Although haemoglobin 
levels did not increase significantly over time, secondary analyses indicate that the reduction in 
transfused RBC units does not come at the expense of a decrease in haemoglobin.   
For the elderly population of MDS patients (with a mean age above 70 years), chronic anaemia 
represents a significant burden associated with multiple complications, but frequent RBC transfusions 
are also burdensome. In transfusion-dependent MDS patients, for whom regular transfusions are a 
substantial burden due to adverse events or cumbersome scheduling of clinical appointments and 
affect their quality of life, the achieved reduction in transfusion frequency is considered beneficial, in 
line with the main goals of treatment in lower risk MDS (treatment of cytopenia(s) and improvement of 
QoL; Fenaux, 2014). To prevent futile treatment in case no clinical benefit is observed over several 
weeks at the highest recommended dose, a stopping rule has been introduced in the SmPC. 
The updated safety profile of luspatercept (cut-off Jan 2019 for all AEs and July 2019 for deaths, SAEs 
and AESIs) shows a manageable adverse event profile, which is comparable to the safety outcomes 
with the initial cut-off (May 2018). No signal for an increase in progression to/ time to progression to 
high risk MDS or AML was identified. However, due to the still limited duration of exposure, uncertainty 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 191/195 
 
  
  
 
remains with regard to long-term safety, which has to be addressed by continuing surveillance, both in 
the still ongoing clinical trials as well as in the long-term follow-up study ACE-536-LTFU-001.  
For patients with a lower transfusion burden, the B/R balance is less favourable in view of the 
uncertainty on long-term safety and the potential risk for haematologic malignancies. 
Beta-thalassaemia 
Despite some minor uncertainties regarding interpretation of efficacy results, superiority of 
luspatercept over placebo in all primary and key secondary analyses has been robustly established. 
Some patients, the so called ‘responders’ achieved a remarkable reduction in RBC transfusion needs; 
the number of responders was only around 20%, however. The effect on RBC transfusions is 
considerably smaller in the average patient, but also robust and clinically relevant. The effect appeared 
durable over the 96 week treatment period.  
Responses favouring luspatercept over placebo were fairly consistent across subgroups. In particular, 
patients with a ß0/ß0 mutation have a very high unmet medical need as they are excluded from 
treatment with the recently approved gene-therapy product (Zynteglo). Additional analyses revealed 
that while some patients (i.e. with ß0/ß0 mutation, start of transfusions <2 years of age, renal 
disease) might have a somewhat smaller benefit from treatment, the effect is still robust across all 
subgroups, and thus, there is no need to exclude specific subgroups from the SmPC. 
There is some uncertainty on the effect on iron overload, as provided LIC results were below 
expectations, and LIC did not considerably drop during 96 weeks of luspatercept treatment. Longer 
observation might be needed to quantify the effect. 
The updated safety data shows a manageable adverse event profile of luspatercept, which is 
comparable to the safety outcomes with the initial cut-off (May 2018). However, duration of exposure 
is still limited to a median treatment duration of about 84 (max 231) weeks, while long-term treatment 
over many years or even decades might be foreseen in a patient population requiring transfusions from 
a very young age onwards.  
The remaining uncertainties with regards to long-term safety and durability of the beneficial effects are 
especially relevant for this indication considering the rather young population and chronic use, and will 
be addressed by continuing surveillance in the still ongoing clinical trials as well as in the long-term 
follow-up study ACE-536-LTFU-001. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Clinical studies in infants/toddlers from the age of 6 months onwards are planned within the agreed 
PIP. Since the increased incidence of haematopoietic malignancies in the juvenile toxicity study might 
be related to a mechanism of carcinogenicity specific to the developing hematopoietic system, and as 
the early haematopoietic system in young children/infants exhibits specific risks towards malignant 
degeneration (Copley and Eaves 2013, DOI: 10.1038/emm.2013.98), the CHMP is of the opinion that 
inclusion of young children and the eventually proposed lower age range for paediatric trials should be 
reconsidered. Furthermore, off-label use in children has been added as an important potential risk in 
the RMP. Finally, having development of luspatercept in the paediatric population in mind, further 
mechanistic (in vitro) studies might be considered to help in further elucidating the risk for 
haematologic malignancies seen in juvenile animals.  
This recommendation is further supported by the nephrotoxicity that was commonly found in most 
non-clinical studies and frequently persisted throughout recovery phases (also in the juvenile toxicity 
study). Finally, the other adverse effects observed in young rats even at the lowest dose administered 
Assessment report  
EMA/270924/2020 
Page 192/195 
 
  
  
 
(adverse adrenal gland findings, problems in bone growth, lower heart weights etc.), should also be 
considered, when deciding to include young infants in the planned clinical trials. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Reblozyl (luspatercept) in adult patients with transfusion-dependent MDS and beta-
thalassaemia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Reblozyl is not similar to Revlimid and Zynteglo within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Reblozyl is favourable in the following indication: 
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to 
very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had 
an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy (see section 5.1). 
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated 
with beta thalassaemia (see section 5.1).

3. 
Information on where to find latest SmPC; 
HCP Checklist; 
Patient Card (for WCBP only). 
Healthcare Professional Checklist 
The HCP Checklist is to be used before initiating treatment, at each administration, and then at regular 
intervals when performing follow-up. The HCP Checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
• 
Information on studies in animals showing luspatercept reproductive and embryo-foetal toxicity 
and is therefore contraindicated during pregnancy. 
•  Reminder that luspatercept is contraindicated during pregnancy and in WCBP not using 
effective contraception. 
•  Need to provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding the 
potential teratogenic risk of luspatercept and required actions to minimise this risk. 
•  A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the prescriber before 
starting treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. 
•

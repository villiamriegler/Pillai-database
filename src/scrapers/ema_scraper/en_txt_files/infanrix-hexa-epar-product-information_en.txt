CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Infanrix hexa is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers against diphtheria, 
tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of Infanrix hexa should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology  
The primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses (of 0.5 ml) which should be 
administered according to official recommendations (see the table below and section 5.1 for schedules 
evaluated in clinical trials). 
Booster doses should be given in accordance with the official recommendations, but, as a minimum, a 
dose of Hib conjugate vaccine must be administered. Infanrix hexa can be considered for the booster if 
the antigen composition is in accordance with the official recommendations. 
Primary vaccination  Booster 
General considerations 
Full-term infants 
3-dose 
vaccination 
A booster dose 
must be given. 
2-dose 
A booster dose 
must be given. 
•  There should be an interval of at least 1 month 
between primary doses. 
•  The booster dose should be given at least 6 months 
after the last priming dose and preferably before 18 
months of age. 
•  There should be an interval of at least 2 months 
between primary doses. 
•  The booster dose should be given at least 6 months 
after the last priming dose and preferably between 
11 and 13 months of age. 
Preterm infants born after at least 24 weeks of gestational age 
A booster dose 
3-dose 
must be given. 
between primary doses. 
•  There should be an interval of at least 1 month 
•  The booster dose should be given at least 6 months 
after the last priming dose and preferably before 18 
months of age. 
The Expanded Program on Immunisation schedule (at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) may only be used if a 
dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. 
Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Infanrix hexa can be used as a replacement for 
supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of six weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B 
vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. 
Locally established immunoprophylactic measures against hepatitis B should be maintained. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Infanrix hexa in children over 36 months of age have not been established.  
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Infanrix hexa is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably at alternating sites for subsequent 
injections. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or 
formaldehyde, neomycin and polymyxin. 
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio or Hib 
vaccines. 
Infanrix hexa is contraindicated if the infant or toddlers has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown 
aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In 
these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should be 
continued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B, polio and Hib vaccines. 
As with other vaccines, administration of Infanrix hexa should be postponed in subjects suffering from 
acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous 
vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. 
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 
5.1). 
Infanrix hexa will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae, 
Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused 
by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 
If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis-
containing vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be 
carefully considered: 
  Temperature of ≥ 40.0°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause; 
  Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of 
vaccination; 
Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; 
 
  Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. 
There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh 
possible risks. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily 
available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
As for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Infanrix hexa or deferring this vaccination 
should be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a 
severe neurological disorder. 
Infanrix hexa should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding 
disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. 
Do not administer the vaccine intravascularly or intradermally. 
A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Infanrix hexa. Vaccinees with a history of 
febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days 
post vaccination. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is co-
administered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13), or with a measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, compared to that occurring following the administration of 
Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39°C) and transient 
(see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode 
(HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (see section 
4.8). 
Prophylactic administration of antipyretics before or immediately after vaccine administration can 
reduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Clinical data generated with 
paracetamol and ibuprofen suggest that the prophylactic use of paracetamol might reduce the fever rate, 
while prophylactic use of ibuprofen showed a limited effect in reducing fever rate. 
The use of prophylactic antipyretic medicinal products is recommended for children with seizure 
disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures. 
Antipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. 
Special populations 
HIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not be 
obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. 
Clinical data indicate that Infanrix hexa can be given to preterm infants, however, as expected in this 
population, a lower immune response has been observed for some antigens (see section 4.8 and section 
5.1). 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered 
when administering the primary immunisation series to very preterm infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of 
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. 
As the benefit of the vaccination is high in these infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.  
Interference with laboratory testing 
Since the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be 
observed within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm 
Hib infection during this period. 
Excipients with known effect 
Infanrix hexa contains para-aminobenzoic acid. It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and 
exceptionally, bronchospasm. 
The vaccine contains 0.0298 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. 
The vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
The vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infanrix hexa can be given concomitantly with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10 and 
PCV13), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 
(MenB), oral rotavirus vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. 
Data have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual 
antigens, although inconsistent antibody response to poliovirus type 2 in co-administration with 
Synflorix was observed (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%) and the immune response rates to 
the PRP (Hib) antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were higher if co-
administered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine (see section 5.1). 
The clinical relevance of these observations remains unknown. 
When Infanrix hexa was co-administered with MenB and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, 
inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to inactivated poliovirus type 2, 
pneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B antigen and to the pertussis pertactin antigen but these data do not 
suggest clinically significant interference.  
Data from clinical studies indicate that, when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the 
administration of Infanrix hexa alone. Data from one clinical study indicate that when Infanrix hexa is 
co-administered with MMRV vaccine, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring 
following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone and similar to that occurring following the 
administration of MMRV vaccine alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The immune responses were 
unaffected. 
Due to an increased risk of fever, pain at the injection site, appetite lost and irritability when Infanrix 
hexa was co-administered with MenB vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, separate 
vaccinations can be considered when possible. 
As with other vaccines it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, an 
adequate response may not be achieved. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
As Infanrix hexa is not intended for use in adults, adequate human data on use during pregnancy or 
lactation and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines   
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
As has been observed for DTPa and DTPa-containing combinations, an increase in local reactogenicity 
and fever was reported after booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa with respect to the primary course.

2 Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. 
• 
Experience in co-administration: 
Analysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions (with or 
without fever) and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Infanrix hexa with Prevenar 13 
to those which reported use of Infanrix hexa alone. 
In clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar 
(PCV7) as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 43.4% of infants 
receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the 
hexavalent vaccine alone. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix 
hexa with or without Prevenar, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The incidence and severity of 
fever following co-administration of the two vaccines in the primary series was lower than that observed 
after the booster dose. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data from clinical studies show similar incidences of fever when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with 
other pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine. 
In a clinical study in which some of the vaccinees received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa 
concomitantly with measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 
76.6% of children receiving MMRV vaccine and Infanrix hexa at the same time, as compared to 48% of 
children receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 74.7% of children receiving MMRV vaccine alone. Fever of 
greater than 39.5°C was reported in 18% of children receiving Infanrix hexa with MMRV vaccine, as 
compared to 3.3% of children receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 19.3% of children receiving MMRV 
alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
• 
Safety in preterm infants: 
Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 1000 preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 
24 to 36 weeks) in primary vaccination studies and in more than 200 preterm infants as a booster dose in 
the second year of life. In comparative clinical studies, similar rates of symptoms were observed in 
preterm and full-term infants (refer to section 4.4 for information on apnoea). 
• 
Safety in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy 
In two clinical studies, Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 500 subjects born to mothers 
vaccinated with dTpa (n=341) or placebo (n=346) during the third trimester of pregnancy (see section 
5.1). The safety profile of Infanrix hexa was similar regardless of exposure/non-exposure to dTpa during 
pregnancy. 
• 
Experience with hepatitis B vaccine: 
In extremely rare cases, allergic reactions mimicking serum sickness, paralysis, neuropathy, neuritis, 
hypotension, vasculitis, lichen planus, erythema multiforme, arthritis, muscular weakness, Guillain-
Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis and meningitis have been reported. The causal 
relationship to the vaccine has not been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No case of overdose has been reported.

Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa has been evaluated in clinical studies from 6 weeks of age. The 
vaccine was assessed in 2-dose and 3-dose priming schedules, including the schedule for the Expanded 
Program on Immunisation, and as a booster dose. The results of these clinical studies are summarised in 
the tables below.

After a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 95.7% of infants had developed seroprotective or 
seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. After booster vaccination (post-dose 
4), at least 98.4% of children had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each 
of the vaccine antigens.

After a 2-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 84.3% of infants had developed seroprotective or 
seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. After a complete vaccination 
according to a 2-dose primary and booster schedule with Infanrix hexa, at least 97.9% of the subjects 
had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. 
According to different studies, immune response to the PRP antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given 
at 2 and 4 months of age will vary if co-administered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine. Infanrix 
hexa will confer an anti-PRP immune response (cut-off ≥ 0.15µg/ml) in at least 84% of the infants. This 
rises to 88% in case of concomitant use of pneumococcal vaccine containing tetanus toxoid as carrier

and to 98% when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with a TT conjugated meningococcal vaccine (see

Serological correlates of protection have been established for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, Hepatitis B and 
Hib. For pertussis there is no serological correlate of protection. However, as the immune response to 
pertussis antigens following Infanrix hexa administration is equivalent to that of Infanrix (DTPa), the 
protective efficacy of the two vaccines is expected to be equivalent. 
Efficacy in protecting against pertussis 
The clinical protection of the pertussis component of Infanrix (DTPa), against WHO-defined typical 
pertussis (≥ 21 days of paroxysmal cough) was demonstrated after 3-dose primary immunisation in the

Considerations 
Based on data collected from secondary

Persistence of the immune response 
efficacy was confirmed up to 60 months 
after completion of primary vaccination 
without administration of a booster dose 
of pertussis. 
The persistence of the immune response to a 3-dose primary (at 2-3-4, 3-4-5 or 2-4-6 months of age) 
and booster (in the second year of life) schedule with Infanrix hexa was evaluated in children 4-8 years 
of age. Protective immunity against the three poliovirus types and PRP was observed in at least 91.0% 
of children and against diphtheria and tetanus in at least 64.7% of children. At least 25.4% (anti-PT), 
97.5% (anti-FHA) and 87.0% (anti-PRN) of children were seropositive against the pertussis 
components.

With regards to hepatitis B, seroprotective antibody concentrations (≥10 mIU/ml) following a 3-dose 
primary and booster schedule with Infanrix hexa have been shown to persist in ≥ 85% of subjects 4-5 
years of age, in ≥72% of subjects 7-8 years of age, in ≥60% of subjects 12-13 years of age and in 53.7% 
of subjects 14-15 years of age. Additionally, following a 2-dose primary and booster schedule, 
seroprotective antibody concentrations against hepatitis B persisted in ≥ 48% of subjects 11-12 years of 
age. 
Hepatitis B immunological memory was confirmed in children 4 to 15 years of age. These children had 
received Infanrix hexa as primary and booster vaccination in infancy, and when an additional dose of 
monovalent HBV vaccine was administered, protective immunity was observed in at least 93% of 
subjects.

Immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy 
The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa in infants and toddlers born to healthy mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa at 27-36 weeks of pregnancy was evaluated in two clinical studies.  
Infanrix hexa was co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infants at 2, 4 
and 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months in three-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=241), or at 3 and 5 
months or 2 and 4 months in two-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=27); and to the same 
infants/toddlers from 11 to 18 months as booster dose (n=229). 
Post-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological data did not show clinically relevant 
interference of maternal vaccination with dTpa on the infant’s and toddler’s responses to diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. 
Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-
booster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the pre-
booster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born to 
mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune system. 
In the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these observations 
remains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis disease following 
the implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical relevance of this 
immune interference. 
Immunogenicity in preterm infants 
The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa was evaluated across three studies including approximately 300 
preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 24 to 36 weeks) following a 3-dose primary vaccination 
course at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The immunogenicity of a booster dose at 18 to 24 months of age was 
evaluated in approximately 200 preterm infants. 
One month after primary vaccination at least 98.7% of subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria, 
tetanus and poliovirus types 1 and 2; at least 90.9% had seroprotective antibody levels against the 
hepatitis B, PRP and poliovirus type 3 antigens; and all subjects were seropositive for antibodies against 
FHA and PRN while 94.9% were seropositive for anti-PT antibodies. 
One month after the booster dose at least 98.4% of subjects had seroprotective or seropositive antibody 
levels against each of the antigens except against PT (at least 96.8%) and hepatitis B (at least 88.7%). 
The response to the booster dose in terms of fold increases in antibody concentrations (15- to 235-fold), 
indicate that preterm infants were adequately primed for all the antigens of Infanrix hexa. 
In a follow-up study conducted in 74 children, approximately 2.5 to 3 years after the booster dose, 
85.3% of the children were still seroprotected against hepatitis B and at least 95.7% were seroprotected 
against the three poliovirus types and PRP. 
Post marketing experience 
Results of long term follow-up in Sweden demonstrate that acellular pertussis vaccines are efficacious 
in infants when administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a 
booster dose administered at approximately 12 months. However, data indicate that protection against 
pertussis may be waning at 7-8 years of age with this 3-5-12 month’s schedule. This suggests that a 
second booster dose of pertussis vaccine is warranted in children aged 5-7 years who have previously 
been vaccinated following this particular schedule. 
The effectiveness of the Hib component of Infanrix hexa was investigated via an extensive post-
marketing surveillance study conducted in Germany. Over a seven year follow-up period, the 
effectiveness of the Hib components of two hexavalent vaccines, of which one was Infanrix hexa, was 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
89.6% for a full primary series and 100% for a full primary series plus booster dose (irrespective of the 
Hib vaccine used for priming). 
Results of ongoing routine national surveillance in Italy demonstrate that Infanrix hexa is effective in 
controlling Hib disease in infants when the vaccine is administered according to the 3 and 5 months 
primary vaccination schedule, with a booster dose administered at approximately 11 months. Over a six 
year period starting in 2006, where Infanrix hexa was the principal Hib-containing vaccine in use with 
vaccination coverage exceeding 95%, Hib invasive disease continued to be well controlled, with four 
confirmed Hib cases reported in Italian children aged less than 5 years through passive surveillance.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Powder in a vial (type I glass) containing 1 dose with a stopper (butyl rubber) and 0.5 ml of suspension 
in a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (butyl rubber) and with a rubber tip cap.  
The tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the pre-filled syringe and the stopper of the vial are made with 
synthetic rubber. 
Pack sizes of 1 and 10, with or without needles and a multipack of 5 packs, each containing 10 vials and 
10 pre-filled syringes, without needles. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Upon storage, a clear liquid and white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the 
DTPa-HBV-IPV suspension. This is a normal observation. 
The pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension. 
The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing 
the powder. The mixture should be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to 
administration. 
The reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component 
alone. This is a normal observation. 
The vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the 
vaccine.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.    What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for  
Infanrix hexa is a vaccine used to protect your child against six diseases:  
•  Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. The 
airways become swollen causing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The 
bacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. 
•  Tetanus: tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that 
are more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have soil, 
dust, horse manure or wood splinters in them. The bacteria release a poison. This can cause muscle 
stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to 
cause bone fractures of the spine. 
•  Whooping cough (Pertussis): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe 
coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a “whooping” sound. 
The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear infections, 
chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain 
damage and even death.  
•  Hepatitis B: is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in body 
fluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen or spit (saliva) of infected people. 
•  Polio: a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness. However, sometimes it can be very serious 
and cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to move (paralysis). 
This includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected by the disease 
may be painfully twisted (deformed). 
•  Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib):  can cause brain swelling (inflammation). This can lead to 
serious problems such as mental slowness (retardation), cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blindness. It can also cause swelling of the throat. This can cause death by suffocation. Less 
commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes 
and mouth. 
How Infanrix hexa works 
•  Infanrix hexa helps your child’s body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your 
child against these diseases. 
•  As with all vaccines, Infanrix hexa may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated. 
•  The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from. 
2.   What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa  
Infanrix hexa should not be given 
•  if your child is allergic to: 
- Infanrix hexa or any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).  
- formaldehyde. 
- neomycin or polymyxin (antibiotics). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face 
or tongue. 
•  if your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, 
hepatitis B, polio or Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
•  if your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a 
vaccine against whooping cough 
•  if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. 
Infanrix hexa should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa: 
•  if after previously having Infanrix hexa or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child had 
any problems, especially:  
- a high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination 
- a collapse or “shock-like” state within 48 hours of vaccination 
- persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination 
- fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination 
•  if your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not 
controlled. After control of the disease the vaccine can be given. 
•  if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily 
•  if your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family. 
•  if your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the vaccination, please 
contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4 Possible side effects.  
•  if your baby was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal 
between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. These babies may require respiratory 
monitoring for 48-72h following the administration of the first two or three doses of Infanrix hexa. 
If any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before 
your child is given Infanrix hexa. 
Other medicines and Infanrix hexa 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before 
or immediately after Infanrix hexa is given. This can help to lower some of the side effects (febrile 
reactions) of Infanrix hexa. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken, might take any other medicines 
or has recently received any other vaccine. 
Infanrix hexa contains neomycin, polymyxin, para-aminobenzoic acid, phenylalanine, sodium and 
potassium 
This vaccine contains neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics). Tell your doctor if your child has had an 
allergic reaction to these ingredients.  
Infanrix hexa contains para-aminobenzoic acid. It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and 
exceptionally, bronchospasm. 
The vaccine contains 0.0298 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. 
The vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
The vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3.   How Infanrix hexa is given  
How much is given 
•  Your child will have a total of two or three injections with respectively at least 2 or 1 month(s) 
between each injection. 
•  You will be told by the doctor or nurse when your child should come back for their next injections. 
•  If additional injections (boosters) are necessary, the doctor will tell you. 
How the vaccine is given 
•  Infanrix hexa will be given as an injection into a muscle. 
•  The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel or into the skin. 
If your child misses a dose 
•  If your child misses an injection which is due, it is important that you make another appointment. 
•  Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course. If not, your child may not be 
fully protected against the diseases. 
4.   Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following 
side effects may happen with this vaccine: 
Allergic reactions 
If your child has an allergic reaction, see your doctor straight away. The signs may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
These signs usually start very soon after the injection has been given. Talk to a doctor straight away if 
they happen after leaving the doctor’s surgery. 
rashes that may be itchy or blistering 
swelling of the eyes and face 
difficulty in breathing or swallowing 
a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. 
See your doctor straight away if your child has any of the following serious side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
collapse 
times when they lose consciousness or have a lack of awareness 
fits – with or without fever 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These side effects have happened very rarely with Infanrix hexa as with other vaccines against 
whooping cough. They usually happen within 2 to 3 days after vaccination. 
Other side effects include: 
Very common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): sleepiness, loss of 
appetite, high temperature of 38°C or higher, swelling, pain, redness where the injection was given, 
unusual crying, feeling irritable or restless. 
Common (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), 
high temperature of more than 39.5°C, swelling larger than 5 cm or hard lump where the injection was 
given, feeling nervous. 
Uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): upper respiratory tract 
infection, tiredness, cough, large swelling at the injected limb. 
Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): bronchitis, rash, swollen glands in 
the neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal 
(thrombocytopenia), in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps 
than normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination, temporarily stopping breathing 
(apnoea), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or 
breathing (angioedema), swelling of the whole injected limb, blisters. 
Very rare (these may happen with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): itching (dermatitis). 
Experience with hepatitis B vaccine 
In extremely rare cases the following side effects have been reported with hepatitis B vaccine: paralysis, 
numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), inflammation of some nerves, possibly with 
pins and needles or loss of feeling or normal movement (Guillain-Barré syndrome), swelling or 
infection of the brain (encephalopathy, encephalitis), infection around the brain (meningitis).  
The causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established. 
Bleeding or bruising more easily than normal (thrombocytopenia) has been reported with hepatitis B 
vaccines. 
Reporting of side effects 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
5.   How to store Infanrix hexa  
•  Keep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. 
•  Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to 
the last day of that month. 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
• 
• 
•  Do not freeze. Freezing destroys the vaccine.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Upon storage, a clear liquid and white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the 
DTPa-HBV-IPV suspension. This is a normal observation. 
The pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension. 
The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing 
the powder. The mixture should then be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to 
administration. 
The reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component 
alone. This is a normal observation.  
The vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the 
vaccine. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions for the pre-filled syringe 
Luer Lock Adaptor 
Hold the syringe by the barrel, not by the plunger. 
Unscrew the syringe cap by twisting it anticlockwise. 
Plunger 
Barrel 
Cap 
Needle hub 
To attach the needle, connect the hub to the Luer Lock 
Adaptor and rotate a quarter turn clockwise until you 
feel it lock. 
Reconstitute the vaccine as described above. 
Do not pull the syringe plunger out of the barrel. If it 
happens, do not administer the vaccine.  
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Verkazia 
ciclosporin 
On 20 July 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Verkazia, 
intended for the treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Verkazia, which was designated as an 
orphan medicinal product on 6 April 2006, was reviewed under EMA’s accelerated assessment 
programme. The applicant for this medicinal product is Santen Oy. 
Verkazia will be available as 1 mg/ml eye drops. The active substance of Verkazia is ciclosporin, an 
immunosuppressant (ATC code: S01XA18) which blocks the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. 
The benefits of Verkazia are its ability to improve ocular surface damage and reduce symptoms of severe 
vernal keratoconjunctivitis in children and adolescent patients. The most common side effects are eye 
pain (11%) and eye pruritus (9%) which usually occur at the time of instilling the eye drops. 
The full indication is: "Treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis in children from 4 years of age and 
adolescents". Treatment with Verkazia must be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare 
professional qualified in ophthalmology. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

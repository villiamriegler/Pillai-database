Scientific conclusions  
Based on the review of the cumulative data and literature review submitted in this PSUR procedure, 
the PRAC considers it necessary to update the Product Information of Fareston and include events of 
thrombocytopenia,  anaemia  and  leukopenia  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  (‘Undesirable  effects’)  with 
frequency ‘unknown’. 
In  addition,  in  section  4.4  ‘Precaution  for  use’,  the  statement  that  anaemia,  leukopenia  and 
thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported;  red  blood  cell,  leukocyte  or  platelet  counts  should  be 
monitored when using FARESTON is to be added. The PL is to be modified accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TOREMIFENE the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance TOREMIFENE is 
favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

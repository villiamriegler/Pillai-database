2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kisqali is proposed for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 7/121 
  
  
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. An 
estimated 1.67 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide in 2012 (representing around 
25% of all cancers in women) and approximately 522,000 deaths were recorded1. In EU there were 3.7 
million new cases, and 1.9 million cancer deaths and 9.7 million people living with cancer (within 5 years of 
diagnosis) in 20122. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Breast cancer is a molecularly diverse disease with several clearly defined molecular subgroups (Perou et al 
2000). The predominant subset is HR-positive, HER2-negative disease. Of the new breast cancer cases 
diagnosed worldwide each year, roughly 60% to 65% are HR-positive, 20% to 25% are HER2-positive, and 
15% to 18% are triple-negative (Estrogen receptor-negative, Progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-
negative)3. The expression of these biological markers in breast cancer is correlated with prognosis and 
response to treatment, and therefore plays an important role in treatment decisions. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging, and confirmed 
by pathological assessment. Clinical examination includes bimanual palpation of the breasts and locoregional 
lymph nodes and assessment for distant metastases (bones, liver and lungs; a neurological examination is 
only required when symptoms are present)4. 
Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease with a median overall survival of 2~3 years and a 5-year 
survival of only~25%. Median overall survival in patients with advanced breast cancer patients with tumours 
expressing the estrogen receptor (ER) but not the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is better, i.e. 
approximately 2.5 to 4 years.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients derive benefit mainly from systemic treatments. 
Endocrine therapy remains the therapeutic backbone for the treatment of HR+ cancers. For postmenopausal 
women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, the endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, 
selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor antagonists (e.g. 
fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI; e.g. anastrozole and letrozole) and steroidal 
aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane). TTP/PFS in the range of 5- 15 (20) months is typical in endocrine 
therapy trials in the postmenopausal population (Kümler ESMO Open 2016). Endocrine therapy may be given 
in first, second or later lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer5,6. Progressive disease ultimately 
develops in all patients, either as early failure to respond to endocrine therapy (primary or de novo 
resistance) or as relapse/progression following an initial response (acquired resistance). A first in class cyclin 
dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, was recently approved in the EU as an add-on to endocrine 
therapy (see EPAR Ibrance).

According to treatment guidelines, chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease 
or proven endocrine resistance2,3. 
About the product 
Ribociclib (LEE011) is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6. 
Ribociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) 
values of 0.01 (4.3 ng/ml) and 0.039 μM (16.9 ng/ml) in biochemical assays, respectively. These kinases are 
activated upon binding to D cyclins and play a crucial role in signalling pathways which lead to cell cycle 
progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through 
phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (see SmPC 5.1). 
In vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation, leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and 
reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, treatment with single agent ribociclib led to 
tumour regressions which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. 
In vivo studies using patient-derived oestrogen-positive breast cancer xenograft model combinations of 
ribociclib and antioestrogens (i.e. letrozole) resulted in superior tumour growth inhibition with sustained 
tumour regression and delayed tumour regrowth after stopping dosing compared to each substance alone. 
When tested in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with known ER status, ribociclib demonstrated to be more 
efficacious in ER+ breast cancer cell lines than in the ER- ones. 
The initially applied indication for Kisqali 200 mg film-coated tablets was: 
Kisqali in combination with letrozole is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone 
receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy. 
The recommended indication is: 
Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy. 
The recommended dose is 600 mg (three 200 mg film-coated tablets) of ribociclib once daily for 
21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment, resulting in a complete cycle of 28 days. The 
treatment with Kisqali  should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or 
until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Kisqali should be used together with 2.5 mg letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor. The aromatase inhibitor 
should be taken orally once daily continuously throughout the 28-day cycle. Please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of the aromatase inhibitor for additional details. 
Management of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may require temporary dose 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Kisqali. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose 
reduction guidelines are listed in the SmPC. Dose reduction can be made to 400 mg/day or 200 mg/day 
according to guidelines in the SmPC, section 4.2.   
Treatment with Kisqali should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies.

Type of application and aspects on development 
See section 1.1. 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. The applicant’s claim that ribociclib was of major interest 
from the point of view of public health, in particular based on therapeutic innovation and an unmet medical 
need was not considered fulfilled taking into account the upcoming CHMP positive opinion on the approval of 
Ibrance (palbociclib) which is a CDK4/6 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR) 
positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer.

Figure 1 – Structure of ribociclib succinate 
The chemical structure of ribociclib succinate was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet 
spectroscopy. It is achiral. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by differential 
scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray powder diffraction. 
The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic yellow to brown crystalline powder, soluble in acidic aqueous 
media, becoming less soluble as pH increases. 
Polymorphism has been observed for ribociclib succinate. Production of the correct polymorphic form is 
ensured by an XRPD method in the active substance specification. As described under the stability section, 
ribociclib succinate form A has been demonstrated to be stable and not to convert into other polymorphic 
forms under long term and accelerated stability studies when stored in the proposed packaging. 
Ribociclib is considered to be a new active substance. The applicant demonstrated that neither it, nor its 
derivatives and salts have ever been active substances in products authorised in Europe. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ribociclib is synthesized in nine main steps using four well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
 The synthetic process uses a convergent approach with the four starting materials being converted in several 
steps to two intermediates, by two separate manufacturers. The intermediates are unified late in the 
sequence. In the final step, the succinate salt is formed, the conditions being carefully controlled in order to 
produce the desired polymorph. The process from the intermediates to ribociclib succinate is carried out by a 
third manufacturer. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Critical steps were identified 
and critical process parameters defined in order to ensure the quality of the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. Elemental impurities are controlled in line with ICH Q3D and mutagenic impurities 
are controlled in line with ICH M7. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and 
EC 10/2011 as amended, as well as the Ph. Eur. monograph on polyolefins. The bags are placed in quadruple 
laminated PE/PET/ALU/PET foil bags which are sealed and stored in drums. The selected packaging is very 
tight in order to prevent moisture ingress. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, XRPD), assay of ribociclib 
(HPLC), assay of succinic acid (titration), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content 
(KF), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (laser 
diffraction), clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 11/121 
  
  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. As mentioned above, limits for 
elemental and mutagenic impurities are in line with the published guidance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 38 batches of the active substance used in clinical trials, toxicology and stability 
studies, the last 8 of which used the proposed commercial process and were manufactured on production 
scale, are provided. The earlier batches used an earlier process which has since undergone only minor 
modifications and are considered representative. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial package for 
up to 12 months under refrigerated conditions (5 ºC), up to 6 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were 
made at a different manufacturing site but are considered representative of commercial batches. A further 
stability program will be instigated using four production scale batches from the intended commercial 
manufacturers. 
Batches were tested for appearance, identity (including crystalline form), related substances, water content, 
assay, clarity of solution and microbial enumeration. No significant changes to any of the measured 
parameters were observed and all attributes remained within specification under all the conditions tested. 
Polymorphic form A was demonstrated to be stable over the duration of the studies. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. One impurity increased 
slightly but remained within its specification limit. No changes to any other measured parameter were 
observed. Therefore, ribociclib succinate is photostable. 
Stress tests were carried out in both solid and solution state. Samples were exposed to heat, heat and 
humidity, acid, base, humidity, and an oxidant. Impurities remained well within specification. No degradation 
was observed when solid ribociclib succinate was heated with oxygen. 
In aqueous solution, the active substance decomposed to a varying extent when heated with acid, base, 
water alone, or hydrogen peroxide. The results show that the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the 
proposed retest period of 24 months not above 30 oC in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Kisqali is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg ribociclib as succinate salt. The drug product is 
packaged in either PCTFE/PVC or PA/Al/PVC blisters.

The aim of development was to find a stable immediate release dosage form. A capsule formulation was used 
throughout clinical trials. In addition, an oral solution was developed for patients with difficulty swallowing 
capsules. The two were found to exhibit similar pharmacokinetic behaviour. To aid patient compliance and for 
convenience, a smaller tablet formulation was subsequently developed and shown to be bioequivalent to the 
200 mg hard gelatin capsule in a clinical study. 
The active substance is a BCS class 4 molecule with moderate permeability. It is soluble in acidic media 
below pH 5.5 but solubility decreases at neutral and basic pH and stable in the solid form. A dry granulation 
process was developed in order to prevent changes in polymorphic form which could impact bioavailability. 
Suitable controls are in place to prevent detrimental solid form changes and ensure manufacturability. 
Excipients were chosen to enable manufacture of a robust film-coated tablet which performs adequately in 
vivo. Compatibility of the active substance with the chosen excipients was demonstrated through stability 
studies.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. As mentioned above, they were 
selected based on compatibility studies with the active substance and knowledge gained from development of 
Kisqali and other tablet products. 
Development of the dissolution method has been described. The method was evaluated against meaningful 
changes in process parameters and input material attributes. The method is considered sufficiently 
discriminatory and the associated specification limit is deemed adequate to ensure product quality.  
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PCTFE  and  PA/Al/PVC  blisters.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the  product,  providing  adequate  protection  from  moisture  uptake  and 
potential polymorph conversion. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  blending  of  intra-granular  components;  roller 
compaction;  milling  and  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients;  compression;  film-coating.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The granulation, compression and film-coating steps are considered to be critical. Critical process parameters 
have been defined in order to ensure the process routinely delivers tablets of acceptable quality. In-process 
controls are carried out following compression and film-coating on in-process intermediates. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive production scale batches 
of  finished  product  at  the  intended  commercial  manufacturing  site  with  a  focus  on  the  critical  steps.  It  has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process 
and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications re-produced below include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form  including  appearance,  identity  (UV,  HPLC),  identity  of  colourants  (colour  reaction),  mean  mass, 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF), 
Assessment report

dissolution (UV) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). The omission of a test for polymorphic form is justified 
since no meaningful changes in solid state were found during stability studies. A risk assessment according to 
ICH  Q3D  and  additional  screening  studies  were performed indicating  that  elemental  impurities  are  routinely 
below 1% of their PDE. Therefore, no tests for elemental impurities are carried out. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for two production scale batches from the intended manufacturer and 
three pilot scale batches from a different site (including the biobatch) confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), and for 
up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product were manufactured at a different site but using the same process 
as those proposed for marketing and were packed in both primary packaging formats intended for marketing. 
Batches  were  tested  for  appearance,  dissolution,  assay,  degradation  products  and  microbial  enumeration. 
Additional tests for water content, crushing strength and disintegration time were carried out for information. 
The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured 
parameters  were  observed  under  long  term  or  intermediate  conditions,  other  than  a  slight  decrease  in 
crushing  strength  at  30  oC.  Under  accelerated  conditions,  no  changes  were  observed  to  appearance,  assay, 
impurities  or  dissolution  time.  A  small  increase  in  water  content,  well  within  the  specification  limit,  and  an 
increase in disintegration time was noted, with a concomitant decrease in crushing strength. 
In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  unpacked  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant change to any of the measured parameters was 
observed, other than an increase in water content. Kisqali is not considered to be photosensitive. 
A further study examined conditions likely to be experience during transportation, for example, termperature 
excursions. However, all quality characteristics remained within the proposed specifications indicating no 
likely issues. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. Magnesium stearate is of vegetal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The correct polymorphic form of ribociclib succinate is ensured by the 
crystallization process, a test in the active substance specification, and the storage conditions. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in 
Assessment report

turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical data consisted of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies, safety pharmacology studies, 
single-dose toxicity in dogs, and repeat-dose toxicity for up to 27 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs, in 
vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, embryo-foetal development toxicity in rats and rabbits, in vitro phototoxicity. 
In addition, potential impurities have been addressed. The non-clinical pharmacokinetics of ribociclib was 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies conducted in mice, rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
The potency and selectivity of ribociclib as a CDK4/6 inhibitor were determined by biochemical assays using 
isolated enzyme complexes. Ribociclib inhibited CDK4/Cyclin D1 and CDK6/Cyclin D3 complexes with IC50 of 
0.008 μM and 0.039 μM, respectively, while exhibiting less potent activity against other CDK family members. 
IC50 for binding to CDK9 was 1.52 µM. This concentration is similar to clinical free Cmax at the therapeutic 
dose (600 mg) of ribociclib (1.2 µM).  
Target inhibition and effects on proliferation and cell cycle were investigated in a number of different cancer 
cell lines, including breast cancer cell lines. In Jeko-1 cells (a retinoblastoma protein (pRb)-positive mantle 
cell lymphoma cell line containing translocated cyclin D1), ribociclib inhibited the CDK4/6 specific 
phosphorylation of pRb, with an IC50 of 0.18 μM. Ribociclib also inhibited BrdU uptake and induced a selective 
G1 cell cycle arrest in Jeko-1 cells, with an IC50 of 0.08 μM and 0.11 μM, respectively.  
In other cancer cell lines the IC50 values between assays showed greater variation, for instance in two HER2-
positive breast cancer cell lines (BT474, HCC1954) where the IC50 for proliferation was considerably higher 
(1.8-3.3 µM) than the IC50 for cell cycle arrest (0.07-0.46 µM).  
The major metabolites of ribociclib observed in human hepatocytes are LEQ803 and the secondary metabolite 
CCI284. Both were tested in Jeko-1 cells, with G1 arrest IC50 of 0.240 uM (LEQ803) and 1.137 uM (CCI284). 
Thus both metabolites were less potent inhibitors of CDK4/6 than ribociclib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 15/121 
  
  
In vivo 
The anti-tumour activity of ribociclib in vivo was evaluated in mouse and rat xenograft models, including 
Jeko-1 cells, human breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived breast cancer xenografts. In the Jeko-1 cell 
model in SCID mice, ribociclib at 150 mg/kg/day orally for 21 days caused complete tumour regression, 
which correlated with 90% inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. After cessation of treatment, tumours re-grew 
rapidly. Despite an increase of the dose to 300 mg/kg/day during a 2-week extension phase, anti-tumour 
activity was suboptimal and at the end of dosing the tumour volume was increasing.  
In the Jeko-1 cell model in male nude rats, ribociclib at 300 mg/kg/day orally was the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD). Ribociclib at 10, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day reduced the phosphorylation of pRB by 35, 80 and 
100%, respectively. At the highest dose level this effect was maintained over 24 h. Complete tumour 
regression was observed in the 75 and 150 mg/kg dose groups after 28 days of dosing. In the 30 mg/kg dose 
group, there was a 44% tumour volume reduction as compared to vehicle controls. Integration of PK/PD data 
suggests that a sustained plasma exposure corresponding to approximately > 10 uM must be maintained 
over the dose interval for full effect. 
In three estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cell line xenograft models (KPL-1, ZR751, MCF7) in athymic 
nude mice, ribociclib at 75 mg/kg/day orally for 28 days caused significant tumour growth inhibition. Plasma 
exposure in the MCF7 xenograft model was AUC 12513 ng.h/mL and Cmax 2683 ng/mL, which is in a similar 
range as the exposure achieved at a dose of 600 mg once daily in humans. When ribociclib was combined 
with the ER antagonist fulvestrant, at 5 mg/week (subcutaneous injection), the anti-tumour effect was 
enhanced.   
The anti-tumour activity of ribociclib was further tested in patient-derived ER+ breast cancer xenograft 
models (PDX191, HBCx-34) in athymic nude mice. Ribociclib administered at 75 mg/kg/day 6 days/week for 
40 days caused significant tumour growth reduction in the PDX191 model. In the HBCx-34 model, ribociclib 
given alone at 75 mg/kg/day for 56 days did not cause any significant inhibition of tumour growth. In 
contrast, combination treatment with ribociclib at 75 mg/kg/day + the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor 
letrozole at 2.5 mg/kg/day caused marked inhibition of tumour growth, without any tumour regrowth 
observed during a 1-month follow-up period. Ribociclib (75 mg/kg/day) was also administered in combination 
with the ER modulator tamoxifen (1 mg/kg/day) orally for 56 days in the HBCx-34 xenograft model. This 
treatment scheme resulted in significant tumour growth inhibition, with an enhanced anti-tumour activity as 
compared to monotherapy.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The effect of ribociclib on myelopoiesis and selected blood chemistry parameters was evaluated as part of the 
efficacy study in male nude rats. Ribociclib at all dose levels (30, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day) caused significant 
reductions of white blood cells (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC).  
Ribociclib was assessed for its off-target activity on 147 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), transporters, 
ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes. An activity of >50% inhibition at 10 μM was found on 4 
targets. Of these, binding to PDE4d (IC50 = 0.59 µM) occurred at a concentration relevant to the clinical 
situation (free Cmax 1.2 µM). IC50 values were not determined for the apelin and orexin-2 receptors.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 16/121 
  
  
LEQ803 was assessed for its off-target activity on 144 GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors 
and enzymes. An activity of >50% inhibition at 10 μM was found on 7 targets; however, the IC50 
concentrations were 20-900x above clinical free Cmax.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Studies in the rat did not reveal any effects on respiratory functions (tidal volume, respiratory rate, and 
minute volume) after a single oral gavage administration of ribociclib at 200 mg/kg. The Functional 
Observational Battery revealed slightly decreased rectal temperature 7h postdose, as well as reduced activity 
and rearing 7 and 24 h postdose after a single oral dose of ribociclib at 200 mg/kg.  
Ribociclib decreased concentration-dependently hERG channel activity in stably transfected HEK293 cells with 
significant inhibition at concentrations >30 µM (13.0 µg/mL). The estimated IC25-, IC50- and IC75-values for 
ribociclib-induced block of the hERG tail current were 26.0 µM (11.3 µg/mL), 53.0 µM (23.0 µg/mL) and 
111.0 µM (48.1 µg/mL), respectively.   
In vivo cardiac safety pharmacology (telemetry) studies in dogs demonstrated a clear signal for QT 
prolongation at doses of ribociclib >20 mg/kg. Mean changes of QTc at 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg versus vehicle 
for the time period of 1.75 h post dose until end of the recording period were +12.1 ms (+5.3 %), +23.4 ms 
(+10.2 %), +37.9 ms (+16.5 %), respectively. There were no effects on heart rate, blood pressure, ECG 
morphology, rhytm or duration of other intervals. The lowest Cmax level where QTc prolongation was 
observed was 929 ng/mL (for comparison, Cmax at steady state in patients following a 600 mg dose is 1820 
ng/mL).  
In an investigative follow-up telemetry study, a single dose of ribociclib at 100 mg/kg produced QTc 
prolongation (up to 12%), as well as QRS prolongation, increased heart rate and premature ventricular 
contractions (PVCs) in one dog. Cmax in this dog was 9720 ng/mL.  
The metabolite LEQ803 inhibited the hERG current with IC50 values of 4.8 µM and 15.8 µM in two 
experiments. It produced 76% inhibition at 30 µM, the highest concentration tested. In a non-GLP telemetry 
study in dogs, LEQ803 caused up to 16% increase in mean QT and QTc at a dose of 5 mg/kg, corresponding 
to mean Cmax of 50 ng/mL. Mean human Cmax at steady-state for LEQ803 following a 600 mg dose of 
ribociclib was 116 ng/mL.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No drug interaction study was conducted in animals which was considered acceptable (see discussion on non-
clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Ribociclib was rapidly absorbed after a single oral dose, with Tmax ranging from 0.25 to 4 h in the plasma of 
mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, which is similar to Tmax in humans (2-4 h). Oral bioavailability was moderate 
in mouse, rat and dog (65%, 37.1-55% and 63.8-85.6%, respectively) and low (16.6%) in monkey.   
Ribociclib showed moderate to high clearance in the mouse, rat, dog and monkey following iv dosing. The 
plasma systemic half-life was moderate (1.91 to 5.0 h) in the mouse, rat and monkey and long in the dog 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 17/121 
  
  
and human (12-38.8 h and 49.4 h, respectively). The volume of distribution was large (7.88 to 27.9 L/kg) 
across species. In rat a gender difference was observed. Clearance was faster in females compared to males 
due to a more pronounced sulfoconjugation pathway in females (see Metabolism). In female rats, blood 
clearance was higher than hepatic blood flow indicating extrahepatic sulfation.  
In all species where LEQ803 was measured (rat, dog, monkey and human) exposure to LEQ803 was lower 
compared to that of ribociclib. LEQ803 AUC represented between 1% and 73% of ribociclib AUC in rat, dog 
and monkey and 27% in human. The LEQ803/ribociclib AUC ratio was higher in male rats compared to 
females because in males oxidative metabolic pathways leading to LEQ803 were more prominent (see 
Metabolism). In rat and dog, the relative exposure to LEQ803 was higher after oral dosing compared to iv 
dosing, indicating a first-pass effect in formation of this metabolite.  
Distribution 
Tissue distribution in albino and pigmented rats was evaluated by quantitative whole body autoradiography 
(QWBA). Ribociclib was widely distributed into tissues except for the brain and was rapidly eliminated from 
most tissues. Highest concentrations of radioactivity in albino rats after iv dosing were found in the thyroid 
gland, kidney, pineal body, pituitary gland, adrenal medulla, and spleen. After oral dosing, the highest tissue 
concentrations were found in the pituitary gland, preputial gland, thyroid gland, and spleen.  
Pigmented rats showed a similar tissue distribution as albino rats, except that melanin-containing structures 
like the eye (choroid, ciliary body), meninges and hair follicles had high exposure to radiolabeled material 
and a slow elimination. In the choroid and ciliary body of the eye, radioactivity was still measurable after 840 
h (the last time-point analysed).  
Low or absent brain penetration in the rat was demonstrated after intracarotid injection; however, significant 
brain penetration was observed after intravenous injection. Plasma protein binding of ribociclib was moderate 
in all species. The unbound plasma fraction (fu) ranged from 0.20 in rat to 0.34 in dog (human: 0.30). The 
blood:plasma concentration ratios were between 0.90 in rat and 1.30 in dog (1.01 in human). 
Ribociclib passed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits (see Toxicology). Fetal plasma concentrations were 
4 to 29% of maternal plasma concentrations. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
The in vitro metabolism of ribociclib was evaluated in hepatocytes of mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human. 
Ribociclib was a substrate for liver metabolism in all species tested. CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, FMO3 
were identified as the enzymes responsible for the majority of the metabolic clearance (see the Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics Assessment Report). The metabolism rate was highest in monkey, rat and human 
hepatocytes. All human metabolites identified in vitro were later detected in vivo with the exception of the 
glutathione conjugates M2 and M5. In dog intestinal microsomes, ribociclib was metabolically stable.  
In vivo 
Ribociclib underwent extensive metabolism in vivo in rat, dog and human. In the rat, metabolism was 
dominated by direct Phase II sulfation, whereas in the dog and human metabolic pathways were 
predominantly oxidative. Female rats had lower exposure to ribociclib compared to males due to a more 
pronounced Phase II metabolism to the sulfate metabolite M8. This pathway was minor in dog and human. 
The major component in plasma of rat, dog and human was unchanged ribociclib. The most prominent 
plasma metabolites in human were M4 (LEQ803) and M13 (CCI284). Exposure to these metabolites was 
covered in rat toxicology studies (see Toxicology).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 18/121 
  
  
Metabolites in milk  
Metabolites in rat milk were assessed following a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg 14C-ribociclib. The major 
component in milk and maternal plasma was ribociclib. Major metabolites in milk were M12, M18 (5.0%), 
M11 and M15.  The exposure to total radiolabeled material and to ribociclib was higher in milk compared to 
plasma. The milk/plasma ratio (AUCinf) was 4.87 for total radiolabeled components, and 3.56 for ribociclib. 
Based on the average concentrations in maternal milk and daily milk consumption by neonatal rats, a daily 
ribociclib intake of 0.08 mg/kg bw was estimated for the suckling pups. 
Reactive intermediates in the liver 
The potential of ribociclib to form reactive intermediates and as a consequence covalent drug-protein adducts 
was investigated in human liver microsomes as well as in human, rat and dog hepatocytes incubated with 
3H-ribociclib.  In human liver microsomes, low levels (below the pre-defined threshold) of covalent drug 
protein adducts were observed. In contrast, incubation of human, rat and dog hepatocytes with 3H-ribociclib 
led to high amounts of covalent drug protein adducts. Preincubation with the non-selective CYP450 inhibitor 
AXR642 as well as azamulin (CYP3A4 specific) were effective in blocking protein adduct formation leading to 
a decrease of 72% and 83%, respectively.  Menadione (non-selective CYP inhibitor) and methimazole (FMO-3 
specific) at a concentration of 10 μM, led to 91% and 58% decrease in protein adduct formation, 
respectively. 
Analysis of the protein adducts in human hepatocytes revealed 20 target proteins in different mass ranges 
(20 – 150 kDa). The proteins were not identified by LC-MS/MS.  
Analysis of the protein adducts in rat hepatocytes revealed a target pattern that was less complex when 
compared to human hepatocytes.  Five major proteins in the range of 25-150 kDa were identified. In dog 
hepatocytes, 10 target proteins in the range of 20-75 kDa were detected.  In all three species (human, rat, 
dog) there appeared to be an identical, intense protein band at around 25 kDa.  
Excretion 
Mass balance data was obtained from rats and male Beagle dogs.  
The majority of absorbed drug-related radioactivity being eliminated by metabolism via bile, and a minor 
fraction by direct secretion into urine and feces. Following oral dosing in the rat, the majority of radiolabelled 
material was excreted within the first 24 h. In contrast, excretion in the dog was slow, with a sampling period 
of 336 h needed for good recovery.

In  rat  and  dog  toxicity  studies,  effects  on  bone  marrow  (hypocellularity),  lymphoid  tissue  (lymphoid 
depletion),  the  hepatobiliary  system  (proliferative  changes,  cholestasis, sand-like gallbladder calculi, and 
inspissated bile) and testes (atrophy) were  observed. In dog toxicity studies providing up to 4 weeks of 
treatment, a QT interval  prolongation and effects on  intestinal mucosa  (atrophy),  skin  (atrophy)  and 
bone/ribs  (decreased  bone formation) were also reported. In rat toxicity studies only, changes in the lung 
(increased  incidence of alveolar macrophages) and  kidney (concurrent degeneration and regeneration of 
tubular epithelial cells) were observed. 
Mortality/clinical signs 
In rats, no ribociclib-related mortality  occurred in studies up to 15 weeks duration. In the 27-week study, 
two  males  given 150 mg/kg/day were  euthanized in a moribund condition on Days 120 and 149, 
respectively. Their  deaths  were  considered  possibly  due  to  a  ribociclib-related  infiltrate  of  alveolar 
macrophages resulting in respiratory distress.  The group mean AUC exposure in males at 150 mg/kg/day 
corresponds to about 2-fold the clinical AUC. In the 4-week rat study, a  dose-related  increased  salivation 
and rales was seen at ≥75 mg/kg/day and a slightly reduced body weight gain in males at 150 mg/kg/day. A 
reduced body weight gain was also observed in males given ≥75 mg/kg/day in the 15- and 27-week studies. 
However, during the dose-free weeks, body weight changes rebounded and  were slightly higher than the 
controls. 
In dogs, no mortalities were observed. In the preliminary 2-week non-GLP study, vomiting, increased 
salivation and severe body weight loss were observed at 25 mg/kg/day, corresponding to AUC exposures ~2-
fold the clinical exposure. A marked body weight loss (up to -17%) was also observed at 20 mg/kg/day in the 
4-week GLP study.  In the 15- and 27-week studies at slightly lower dose levels, no ribociclib-related clinical 
signs or effects on body weight were observed. 
Effects on the hepatobiliary system 
Dose-related hepatobiliary toxicity was observed in both rats and dogs. Reversibility was demonstrated in 
rats, while partial reversibility was shown in dogs. In  rats,  the  changes  were  characterized  by  bile  duct 
epithelium  vacuolation  and/or  hypertrophy with correlating increased plasma total bilirubin.  In  the  27-week 
rat  toxicity  study,  immunohistochemistry  for  lysosome-associated  membrane  protein-2  (LAMP-2)  was 
performed  on  the  liver  from  selected  animals.  Increased  LAMP-2  positivity suggested  a ribociclib-related 
increase  in  lysosomes  (phospholipidosis) in rats.  
In dogs treated for up to 4 weeks, the changes consisted of hyperplasia/hypertrophy/proliferation  of intra- 
and  extra-hepatic  bile  ducts  with  periductular  fibrosis,  inflammatory cells  and  single  cell  degeneration, 
gallbladder  hyperplasia/hypertrophy with  wall  and  arterial  necrosis,  cholestasis;  inspissated  bile  with 
calculi  in  gallbladder,  arteriopathy  with  focal  wall  degeneration,  and  hemorrhage  and  fibrin  in  arteries 
near  the  liver  hilus.  Lysis  of  periportal  hepatocytes  and  vacuolated  macrophages  in  the  wall  of  the 
common  bile  duct  were  also  observed.  Clinical  chemistry  changes  indicative  of  hepatobiliary  toxicity 
were  observed  and  included increases  in  ALP,  ALT,  AST and total bilirubin, as well as an increased

cholesterol and decreased  triglycerides, glucose and/or albumin and globulin. No liver histopathology or liver 
enzyme elevation were observed in dog 15- or 39-week studies at lower exposures. 
Effects on the bone marrow and lymphoid system 
In  rat  and  dog  studies,  bone  marrow  hypocellularity,  reduced  extramedullary  hemopoiesis in the spleen, 
lymphoid depletion in the thymus, spleen, gut-associated lymphoid  tissues and lymph nodes with reduced 
germinal center development were observed. Correlating  bone  marrow  smears  and  hematological  changes 
were  also  seen  with  decreases in myeloid: erythroid ratio, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, 
hemoglobin and  hematocrit as well as decreases in lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils. 
These changes were reversible or showed a trend towards reversibility. 
Effects on the kidney 
In the 15- and 27-week rat toxicity studies, increased kidney weight and concurrent degeneration and 
regeneration of kidney  tubular epithelial cells were observed. No effects were noted in dogs.   
Effects on the lung and mesenteric lymph nodes 
In the 4-week dog study, minimal to moderate (not dose-related) pulmonary inflammation with 
accumulation of alveolar  macrophages was observed in several dogs of all dose groups. There was a trend 
towards reversibility during the recovery period. In rats, increased alveolar macrophages in the lungs and 
histiocytosis in the lymph nodes  w a s   observed in all studies with partial reversibility during the recovery 
period. In the 27-week  rat study, additional immunohistochemistry for  LAMP-2 was performed on  the lung 
and mesenteric lymph node from selected animals. Increased LAMP-2 positivity suggests a ribociclib-related 
increase  in  lysosomes i. e. phospholipidosis.  This  was  further confirmed by electron microscopy showing the 
presence  of  various  sized  and  shaped  lysosomes  containing  electron  dense  lamellar  inclusion  bodies. 
Effects on the skin, intestinal mucosa, bone/ribs and ovaries 
In dogs treated for up to 4 weeks, epidermal atrophy of the skin, mucosal atrophy mainly in the jejunum and 
decreased bone formation at the costochondral junction and increased number of ovarian corpora lutea (one 
dog only) were observed. All changes were fully reversible after a 4-week treatment free period. The effects 
on skin, intestinal mucosa, bone/ribs and ovaries were not present in the 15- or 39-week dog studies where 
slightly lower dose levels were used. 
Effects on the testes 
In rats and dogs (up to  26  and 39  weeks of  treatment,  respectively),  focal/multifocal  tubular  vacuolation 
with  spermatic  giant  cells,  abnormal spermatids and germ cell depletion, predominantly affecting the 
spermatogonia and  spermatocytes, were detected. At the end of recovery periods, signs of spermatogenesis 
regeneration in the testes (tubular regeneration) were noted with the reappearance of spermatogonia and 
pachytene spermatocytes in both species. However, a complete reversibility was not demonstrated. 
Electrocardiography (ECG) 
In the 4-week dog toxicity study, ECG revealed no overt treatment-related effects on morphology and heart 
rate. Prolongation in QT and QTc intervals in comparison with pre-test was observed in individual dogs. A 
dose- and concentration-related QT and QTc interval prolongation (up to 16%) was observed in the single-
dose telemetry study in dogs. No QT effects were noted in the longer duration toxicity studies.  
Genotoxicity 
The in vitro mutagenicity studies, micronucleus test study, and chromosome aberration test study, in which 
either cytotoxic concentrations (mammalian cell tests) or the maximum recommended concentration (5000 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 22/121 
  
  
µg/plate; AMES test) were used, were negative and did not reveal any evidence for a genotoxic potential of 
ribociclib. In the in vivo rat micronucleus test, ribociclib did not induce micronuclei in the polychromatic 
erythrocytes of the bone marrow of male rats treated up to the estimated MTD of 350 mg/kg/day. Small 
but statistically significant increases in micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes were observed in 
female rats at doses of ≥350 mg/kg/day. However, with the exception of a single animal at the 
intermediate dose (350 mg/kg/day), all individual animal micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes 
frequencies fell within historical control ranges.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity study has been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Embryo-foetal development toxicology studies were conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits.  In rats, a 
marked maternal toxicity was observed by clinical observations, markedly reduced body weight and food 
consumption and by mortality/moribundity at 1000 mg/kg/day and consequently the high dose group was 
terminated and not further evaluated. No significant maternal toxicity was observed at  300  mg/kg/day,  but 
foetal toxicity evidenced by reduced foetal weights accompanied  by skeletal changes considered to be 
transitory and/or  related to the lower foetal weights were  noted.  There  were  no  effects  upon  embryo-foetal 
mortality or  adverse  effects  on  foetal  morphology at 50 or 300 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity 
was 300 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.5-fold the clinical AUC exposure and the NOAEL for embryo-foetal 
development was 50 mg/kg/day, corresponding to <0.1-fold the clinical AUC (maternal exposure). 
In the pivotal rabbit study, no maternal toxicity was observed. At  doses  ≥30  mg/kg,  there  were  significant 
adverse  effects  on  the  embryo -foetal  development as evidenced by increased incidences of foetal 
abnormalities (malformations and  external, visceral and skeletal variants) and reduced foetal weight. These 
findings  included reduced/small lung lobes and additional vessel on the aortic arch and diaphragmatic 
hernia,  absent  accessory  lobe  or  (partly)  fused  lung  lobes  and  reduced/small  accessory  lung  lobe  (30  and 
60  mg/kg),  extra/rudimentary 13th ribs  and  misshapen  hyoid  bone  and  reduced  number of phalanges in 
the pollex. There was no evidence of embryo -foetal mortality. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 
mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.5-fold clinical AUC exposure, and the NOAEL for embryo-foetal development 
was 10 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.3-fold the clinical AUC (maternal exposure).  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic assessment of ribociclib was included in all toxicology studies conducted in rats, dogs and 
rabbits. In addition, metabolite LEQ803 exposure was also included in all studies while metabolite CCI284 
exposure was measured in plasma samples of the high dose males from the 27 week rat study using a non-
validated non-GLP method. 
In the rat 4-week study, all animals were exposed to ribociclib and LEQ803. In general, the exposure of 
ribociclib and LEQ803 in terms of AUC increased with increasing dose in a roughly proportional manner over 
the dosing regimen and irrespectively of the gender.  
In the rat 27-week study, all animals were exposed to ribociclib and LEQ803 with a few exceptions where 
values were below the LLOQ. In general, the exposure to ribociclib and LEQ803 in terms of AUC increased 
with increasing dose in a rough proportional manner irrespective of dose, gender or study day.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 23/121 
  
  
The non-GLP analysis of metabolite CCI284 from high dose male samples revealed that all male rats were 
exposed to CCI284. The male rats were roughly 10 times more exposed to ribociclib than to LEQ803 and 
roughly 2 times more exposed to ribociclib than to CCI284. 
In the dog 4-week study, all animals were exposed to ribociclib and LEQ803. In general, the exposure to 
ribociclib and LEQ803 in terms of AUC increased with increasing dose in a rough proportional manner 
irrespective of dose, sex or study day.  
In the dog 39-week study, all animals were exposed to ribociclib and LEQ803, except for LEQ803 at the 
lowest dose where values were generally below the LLOQ. For this reason, no toxicokinetic profile could be 
calculated for LEQ803 at the lowest dose. In general, the exposure to ribociclib and LEQ803 in terms of AUC 
increased with increasing dose in a rough proportional manner irrespective of dose, sex, or study day. No 
accumulation of ribociclib or LEQ803 was noted after multiple administrations. No sex difference based on the 
AUC for ribociclib and LEQ803 was noted, irrespective of dose or study day. Based on the dose normalized 
AUC, dogs of both sexes were far more exposed to ribociclib than to LEQ803, from 23-fold to 33-fold.  
Local Tolerance  
Ribociclib did not show a skin irritation  potential  in rabbits,  nor  a  sensitizing  or  irritating  potential  (after 
3 days of topical administration) in the murine local lymph node assay. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Ribociclib showed light absorption in the UVB and UVA range up to approximately 400 nm with MEC values 
above the threshold value.  In pigmented rats, specific distribution and retention of ribociclib-derived 
radioactivity was observed in melanin-containing structures (choroid and ciliary body of the eye, meninges 
and hair follicles). An in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test did not identify a relevant 
phototoxicity potential for ribociclib, since neither under irradiation with simulated sunlight nor without 
irradiation any cytotoxicity was observed up to 1000 µM.

Ribociclib is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, ribociclib is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The in vivo results in breast cancer xenograft models showed an enhanced tumour growth inhibition activity 
of ribociclib when given in combination with endocrine therapies used in breast cancer treatment (letrozole, 
fulvestrant, tamoxifen).  
The potential biological consequences of the observed IC50 for binding to CDK9 (1.52 µM) was discussed. The 
Applicant clarified that the IC50 concentration in vivo is likely to be at least 10-fold higher than the IC50 in 
vitro, due to the considerably higher ATP concentration in vivo. In addition, the selectivity between CDK4 and 
CDK9 is estimated to be about 190-fold. Ribociclib was inactive (IC50 >10 μM) against 34 kinases and weakly 
active against Aurora A, HER1, and LCK with IC50 values of 2.0 μM, 9.0 μM, and 7.7 μM, respectively.  
There is some concern over the findings in the Jeko-1 cell model in SCID mice, where ribociclib given as 
monotherapy at 150 mg/kg/day orally for 21 days caused complete tumour regression during the treatment 
period, correlating with 90% inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. However, after cessation of treatment, 
tumours re-grew rapidly. Despite an increase of the dose to 300 mg/kg/day during a 2-week extension 
phase, anti-tumour activity was suboptimal and at the end of dosing the tumour volume was increasing. It is 
known that inhibition of CDK4/6 may lead to the development of resistance, for instance via CDK2-mediated 
S-phase entry. The Applicant was therefore asked to discuss the potential mechanism(s) behind the observed 
re-growth of tumours in the Jeko-1 cell xenograft model, as well as the clinical relevance of this finding. The 
Applicant acknowledged that acquired resistance to treatment may occur with CDK4/6 inhibitors. The exact 
mechanism behind the rapid tumour re-growth in the Jeko-1 xenograft model could however not be

EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 25/121 
  
  
 
 
 
 
determined, due to lack of molecular analysis of tumours at the time of the study. This important aspect of 
ribociclib treatment was further discussed in the clinical section (see the Clinical assessment report). 
Due to ribociclib’s mechanism of action, the myelosupressive effect observed in secondary pharmacology 
study is not unexpected (CDKs are key players in driving cell cycle progression). Similar findings were 
observed in repeat dose toxicity studies (see Toxicology). 
With regards to off target activity, binding to the apelin receptor is unlikely to be clinically relevant (only 53% 
inhibition at 10 µM). With regard to orexin-2, an IC50 value was extrapolated based on 70% inhibition at 10 
μM. This value, 4 μM, is approximately 4-fold above the clinical free Cmax at the therapeutic dose of ribociclib. 
Furthermore, brain penetration of ribociclib was low in rats. Regarding PDE4d, the Applicant acknowledged 
that nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea observed in the Phase III clinical trial with ribociclib could possibly be 
due to PDE4d binding, although direct effects of ribociclib on the intestinal mucosa are probably also 
involved. It is agreed that potential off-target binding to orexin-2 and PDE4d is not likely to be of major 
safety concern for humans. Off target binding of LEQ803 is also unlikely to be clinically relevant.  
The in vivo cardiac safety pharmacology studies with ribociclib in dogs demonstrated dose and concentration 
related QTc interval prolongation at an exposure that would be expected to be achieved in patients following 
the recommended dose of 600 mg. There is also potential to induce incidences of premature ventricular 
contractions (PVCs) at elevated exposures (approximately 5 fold the anticipated clinical Cmax). QTc interval 
prolongation has been observed in patients and is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. The 
proposed SmPC contains information and warnings concerning this risk in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8. From a 
non-clinical perspective, no further action is considered necessary.  
In a rat safety pharmacology study, a single oral dose of ribociclib at 200 mg/kg produced slightly decreased 
rectal temperature as well as reduced activity and rearing. Overall, it is agreed that the reduced body 
temperature is not of major safety concern for humans. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the distribution study in pigmented rats, melanin-containing structures like the eye (choroid, ciliary body), 
meninges and hair follicles had high exposure to radiolabeled material and a slow elimination (> 840 h in the 
eye). Given the lack of ocular adverse effects in the non-clinical toxicology studies or in the clinic, the binding 
of ribociclib to melanin does not appear to be associated with any obvious risk for ocular toxicity in patients.  
It is considered that brain penetration of ribociclib appears to be low in the rat.  
Ribociclib and its metabolites passed readily into the milk of lactating rats (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Formation of reactive intermediates in human, dog and rat hepatocytes was observed. It is noted in study 
report R0800264 (experiment with human microsomes and hepatocytes) that the observed levels of covalent 
drug-protein adduct formation in vitro could possibly be clinically relevant when given in a chronic regimen at 
doses > 50 mg. It is possible that the covalent protein adduct formation in the liver may be linked to liver 
toxicity in humans. Liver toxicity is adequately addressed in the SmPC (see section 4.8). 
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of ribociclib has been evaluated in agreement with recommendations in ICH S9. The 
rat and dog were the selected as main rodent and non-rodent species, respectively, based on their suitable 
pharmacokinetic profiles and representation of the major metabolism pathways in humans. Based on 
demonstration of target-related findings, both species are considered as pharmacologically relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 26/121 
  
  
The repeat-dose toxicity (treatment schedule of 3 weeks on/1 week off) of ribociclib after oral administration 
was investigated in studies up to 27 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs. In repeat-dose studies in rats, the 
AUC multiples at the highest dose levels compared to the clinical AUC were ~2-fold in male rats, while in 
female rats and in dogs, the AUC exposure was less than equal to the clinical exposure at steady-state at the 
highest recommended therapeutic dose of 600 mg/day.  
The hepatobiliary system (proliferative changes, cholestasis, sand-like gallbladder calculi, and inspissated 
bile) was revealed as the primary target organ of toxicity of ribociclib. Target organs associated with the 
pharmacological action of ribociclib in repeat dose studies include bone marrow (hypocellularity), lymphoid 
system (lymphoid depletion), intestinal mucosa (atrophy), skin (atrophy), bone (decreased bone formation), 
kidney (concurrent degeneration and regeneration of tubular epithelial cells) and testes (atrophy). Besides 
the atrophic changes seen in the testes, which showed a trend towards reversibility, all other changes were 
fully reversible after a 4 week treatment-free period (see SmPC section 5.3). Hepatobiliary toxicity has also 
been observed in patients and is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. The proposed SmPC 
contains information and warnings concerning this risk in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8. 
Potential additive or synergistic effects of ribociclib and two of its metabolites, LEQ803 or CCI284, with co-
exposure with letrozole was examined in in vitro studies in human hepatocytes. The studies indicate no 
increased sensitivity of human hepatocytes to combined exposure of ribociclib or its metabolites and 
letrozole. 
The toxicity in the bone marrow and lymphoid system is suggestive of a direct effect of ribociclib on 
hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis and likely related to the pharmacological action of ribociclib. Hematological 
toxicity has been observed in patients and neutropenia is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
The proposed SmPC contains information and warnings concerning this risk in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8.  
Effects in the kidney were observed in the 15- and 27-week rat toxicity studies, but not in dogs. A closely 
related CDK inhibitor (palbociclib) was shown to transiently arrest renal tubular cells in G0/G1, thereby 
reducing DNA damage and apoptosis following acute kidney injury in rats. Renal effects were also identified in 
patients and further discussed in Clinical Safety section. 
The effect noted in intestinal mucosa, skin, bone/ribs and potentially ovary in dogs are all considered likely 
related to the pharmacological anti-proliferative effects of ribociclib. No effect on bone or epidermis (atrophy) 
in humans has been observed. In clinical trials, rash (unrelated to epidermal atrophy) has been reported and 
was seen with a greater imbalance in ribociclib vs placebo treated patients, but was mild in nature and 
reversible. 
In rats and dogs, adverse effects in the testis were observed. A complete reversibility was not demonstrated. 
Based on the testis toxicity, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with ribociclib. As Kisqali is 
indicated for treatment of postmenopausal women, further risk minimisation measures are not suggested. In 
the case of future indications including men, further risk minimization measures should be considered for the 
male patient population. 
In dog studies providing up to 4 weeks of treatment, a QT interval prolongation was also reported. QTc 
interval prolongation has been observed in patients and is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
The proposed SmPC contains information and warnings concerning this risk in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8.  
Ribociclib was tested in a complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with ICH S2(R1) guidance. 
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with and 
Assessment report

without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a genotoxic potential of ribociclib (see SmPC 
section 5.3). 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed which in view of the applied indication is acceptable given the 
intended treatment of patients with advanced cancer. However, if ribociclib is to be used in other indications 
with a longer life expectancy, studies to address carcinogenicity could be warranted. 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies were not conducted with ribociclib in agreement with ICH 
S9. However, chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed atrophic changes of the testes after 
histopathological evaluation. These effects can be linked to a direct anti-proliferative effect on the testicular 
germ cells resulting in atrophy of the seminiferous tubules. 
Ribociclib and its metabolites passed readily into rat milk. The exposure to ribociclib was higher in milk than 
in plasma. 
Ribociclib showed foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses which did not show maternal toxicity in the rats or 
rabbits. In rats, reduced foetal weights accompanied by skeletal changes considered to be transitory and/or 
related to the lower foetal weights were noted. In rabbits, there were adverse effects on embryo-foetal 
development as evidenced by increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (malformations and external, 
visceral and skeletal variants) and foetal growth (lower foetal weights). These findings included 
reduced/small lung lobes and additional vessel on the aortic arch and diaphragmatic hernia, absent accessory 
lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes and reduced/small accessory lung lobe (30 and 60 mg/kg), 
extra/rudimentary thirteenth ribs and misshapen hyoid bone and reduced number of phalanges in the pollex. 
There was no evidence of embryo-foetal mortality (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Based on these finding in animals, ribociclib can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women 
(see sections 4.6 and  5.3). Pregnancy status should be verified prior to starting treatment with Kisqali. In 
the case of future indications including pre-menopausal women, further risk minimization measures may be 
considered.  
Based on the results of the phototoxicity test, ribociclib is considered to have a low phototoxic potential. 
One impurity was found above the reporting threshold of 0.05% in all batches produced to date, is 
considered adequately qualified on a mg/kg basis in the 15-week repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs. The 
control strategy for the genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities are considered as adequate. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicity are considered 
acceptable.  
Ribociclib is not a PBT substance. Considering the submitted data, ribociclib is not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ribociclib were investigated in patients with advanced cancer following oral daily 
doses of 50 mg to 1200 mg. Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 400 mg to 600 mg or 
repeated daily doses (8 days) at 400 mg (see Table 7).

In all studies in patients, except study X2107, ribociclib pharmacokinetics were determined during cycle one 
only. Preliminary PK data from a Phase 1b study of ribociclib in combination with everolimus and exemestane 
in breast cancer patients (Study X2106). There are no single-dose studies in patients.  
Furthermore, in vitro studies included investigation of ribociclib as a substrate for CYP450 enzymes, UGTs, 
FMO and clinically important transporters. The potential of ribociclib and the metabolites LEQ803 and CCI284 
to inhibit or induce CYP450 and to inhibit important transporters were also investigated in vitro. 
Absorption  
Ribociclib succinate is classified as a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) class IV compound. 
Ribociclib succinate exhibited high solubility in aqueous buffer at or below pH 4.5 and in bio-relevant media at 
pH 5.0 and pH 6.5, and lower solubility in aqueous buffer at pH 6.8 and pH 7.5.  
In vitro, the apparent passive permeability of ribociclib was determined to be moderate in Caco-2 cell 
monolayers and high in human hepatocytes.  
The absolute bioavailability of ribociclib in humans is not known. Based on an in vivo interaction study with a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, there is some degree of first-pass metabolism.   
The time to reach Cmax (Tmax) following ribociclib oral administration was between 1 and 4 hours. Ribociclib 
exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose range tested (50 
to 1200 mg). Following repeated once daily dosing, steady state was generally achieved after 8 days and 
ribociclib accumulated with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 2.51 (range: 0.97 to 6.40). 
Compared to the fasted state, oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ribociclib film-coated tablets 
(commercial tablet) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of 
ribociclib. When ribociclib was administered as the clinical trial capsule formulation, the geometric mean 
Cmax was lower (23% and 32% for ribociclib and LEQ803, respectively) in the fed state versus the fasted 
state and median Tmax was delayed, while food had no effect on AUC.  
Bioequivalence  
Ribociclib was initially developed as hard-gelatin capsule formulation. In most of the clinical studies including 
the registration trial (Study A2301), the capsule formulation at a strength of 200 mg was used. In parallel, a 
smaller tablet was developed for commercial use. In Study A2103, bioequivalence was shown between the 
capsule and the commercial tablet, with 90% confidence intervals within 0.80-1.25 for the geometric mean 
ratio of Cmax and AUC of the tablet vs. the capsule.  
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent volume of distribution for ribociclib at steady 
state (Vss/F) was 1090 L. 
Ribociclib is a substrate for Pgp in vitro, but based on mass-balance data inhibition of Pgp or BCRP is unlikely 
to affect ribociclib exposure at therapeutic doses. Ribociclib was not a substrate for hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT-1 in vitro (see SmPC section 5.2).  
In vitro, human plasma protein binding of ribociclib was moderate, about 70%, with no apparent 
concentration dependency (10 to 10000 ng/ml). The protein binding of the metabolites LEQ803 and CCI284 
was somewhat higher, 88% and 92%, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 32/121 
  
  
Ribociclib was equally distributed between red blood cells and plasma with a mean in vivo blood-to-plasma 
ratio of 1.04. 
Elimination 
Estimated mean half-life of ribociclib was 30-55 hr in studies in healthy volunteers. The highest value was 
observed in the mass-balance study, which had the longest sampling period (504 hr). The geometric mean 
apparent plasma terminal half-life (T1/2) of ribociclib ranged from 29.7 to 54.7 hours  and the geometric 
mean CL/F of ribociclib ranged from 39.9 to 77.5 l/hr at 600 mg across studies. 
The geometric mean plasma effective half-life (based on accumulation ratio) was 32.0 hours (63% CV) and 
the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 25.5 l/hr (66% CV) at steady-state at 600 mg in 
patients with advanced cancer. 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated ribociclib is eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism. Ribociclib and 
its metabolites are eliminated mainly via faeces, with a small contribution of the renal route.  
The metabolism of ribociclib appears to be mediated primarily by CYP3A4 (including formation of the major 
metabolite LEQ803) and to minor extent by FMO3 and (extra-hepatic) FMO1 (including formation of the 
major metabolite CCI284), but based on in vitro data there are also other enzymes involved, such as 
CYP1A2, CYP2J2 and phase II enzymes UGT2B7 and UGT1A1.  
Following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of [14C] ribociclib to humans, the primary metabolic 
pathways for ribociclib involved oxidation (dealkylation, C and/or N oxygenation, oxidation (-2H)) and 
combinations thereof. Phase II conjugates of ribociclib phase 1 metabolites involved N-acetylation, sulfation, 
cysteine conjugation, glycosylation and glucuronidation. 
Reactive metabolites are formed through CYP3A and FMO catalysed metabolism, with indications of covalent 
adduct formation in hepatocytes. Metabolite data from the human mass-balance study indicate that the 
reactive intermediates are rapidly converted via a detoxifying pathway into glutathione adducts. These are 
likely excreted via bile into faeces, where they are degraded to cysteine metabolites. 
Mass-balance  
A mass-balance study was performed in six healthy male subjects, who received a 600 mg single oral dose of 
[14C]-ribociclib as 200 mg capsules. Subjects were fasted.  
Based on the recovery in urine and of radiolabelled metabolites in faeces, absorption of ribociclib was 
estimated to be at least around 60%. Absolute bioavailability may be lower due to first-pass metabolism. 
Of the total administered radioactive dose, 91.7% was recovered within 22 days; faeces was the major route 
of excretion (69.1%), with 22.6% of the dose recovered in urine. Ribociclib was extensively metabolised with 
unchanged drug accounting for 17.3% and 12.1% of the dose in faeces and urine, respectively. Metabolite 
LEQ803 was a significant metabolite in excreta and represented approximately 13.9% and 3.74% of the 
administered dose in faeces and urine, respectively. Numerous other metabolites were detected in both 
faeces and urine in minor amounts (≤ 2.78% of the administered dose). CCI284 was not detected in excreta.   
Direct Phase II conjugates of the parent compound observed were sulfate conjugates and cysteine 
conjugates but these were minor, each representing ≤2.2% of the dose.  
Metabolites in plasma  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 33/121 
  
  
In the mass-balance study, parent ribociclib was the major circulating drug-derived entity in plasma 
accounting for 23% of the total radioactivity in plasma over 508 hour. The major circulating metabolites 
included metabolite M13 (CCI284, N-hydroxylation), M4 (LEQ803, N-demethylation), and M1 (secondary 
glucuronide). By metabolite profiling over 48 hr post-dose, these metabolites each represented an estimated 
9.39%, 8.60%, and 7.78% of total radioactivity, and 21.6%, 19.8%, and 17.9% of ribociclib exposure. Other 
metabolite peaks were only minor. In other single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, LEQ803 accounted for 
about 23-31% of the AUC of parent ribociclib.  
At steady state in cancer patients at the 600 mg dose level, LEQ803 generally accounted for <10% of the 
parent AUC. CCI284 accounted for 27% of the parent AUC at steady state. Metabolite M1 was not analysed in 
steady state studies.  
Metabolites LEQ803 and CCI284 are Phase I metabolites and were evaluated for inhibition of major CYPs (see 
Interactions below). M1 is a Phase II metabolite and was not evaluated for CYP inhibition potential.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Ribociclib displays dose- and time-dependent pharmacokinetics due to time-dependent auto-inhibition of 
CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.   
A power model was used to assess dose proportionality across the dose range of 50 mg to 1200 mg. After a 
single dose, the slope of ln (Cmax) or ln (AUC) versus ln (dose) was estimated to be 1.19 and 1.26, 
respectively, indicating a lack of dose proportionality. At steady state the slope was 1.37 and 1.42 for Cmax 
and AUC, respectively, indicating a greater non-linearity after multiple dosing. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic model, ribociclib clearance would be 19% lower at 1200 mg and 24% 
higher at 300 mg than at the reference dose (600 mg). At lower doses, the effect was more pronounced; CL 
would be 116% higher at 50 mg than at 600 mg. 
Evaluation of trough concentrations of ribociclib and LEQ803 showed that the steady state of ribociclib was 
generally reached in approximately 7 days. The calculated geometric mean accumulation ratio (Racc) based 
on AUC0-24h ranged from 1.35 to 2.75 across the 50 to 1200 mg dose groups. Data on metabolic ratio 
indicated that CYP3A4-mediated formation of LEQ803 is smaller at steady state than after a single dose.  
Being a CYP3A4 substrate, and subject to some degree of first-pass metabolism, ribociclib displays relatively 
large pharmacokinetic variability. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the inter-patient 
variability in CL/F is 51%. Intra-patient (inter-occasion) variability was not assessed.  
The exposure of ribociclib in healthy subjects in single dose studies was slightly lower compared to patients 
with cancer, but within the range of values observed in studies with patients with cancer. Following a single 
600 mg dose, the geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-24h in healthy subjects (different studies) ranged from 507 
to 792 ng/mL and 5910 to 9350 h•ng/mL, respectively. In comparison, the geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-
24h in patients with cancer was 992 ng/mL and 9700 h•ng/mL, respectively. 
At steady state, with the 400 mg dose, exposure to ribociclib was relatively similar in patients with advanced 
cancer and in healthy volunteers, with steady state AUC values of 12800 and 11100 ng*hr/ml, respectively. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 34/121 
  
  
No dedicated pharmacokinetic study in subjects with renal impairment was submitted.  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 77 patients with normal renal function (eGFR≥ 
90 ml/min/1.73 m2), 76 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 35 
patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal 
impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib. The effect of eGFR on CL/F was estimated to be 0.987 
(95% CI: 0.845, 1.135). The pharmacokinetics of ribociclib in patients with severe renal impairment have not 
been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect 
on the exposure of ribociclib. The mean exposure for ribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with 
moderate (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.50 for Cmax; 1.32 for AUCinf) and severe (GMR: 1.34 for Cmax; 
1.29 for AUCinf) hepatic impairment. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 
160 breast cancer patients with normal hepatic function and 47 patients with mild hepatic impairment, mild 
hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib, further supporting the findings from the 
dedicated hepatic impairment study (see section 4.2). 
Gender, weight and age 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no relevant effects of gender or age on the 
pharmacokinetics of ribociclib.  
Body weight had a statistically significant effect on CL, volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment 
(V2), and inter-compartmental clearance (Q).  Simulations suggested that a change of body weight from the 
reference value of 70 kg to 50 kg or 100 kg would cause up to a 22% change in steady-state 
pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on a cross-study comparison, the exposure of ribociclib in Japanese 
patients in Study X1101 was higher on average, but the individual values were within the range observed in 
Caucasian patients in Study X2101. Following multiple doses of ribociclib 600 mg, the geometric mean AUC0-
24h for ribociclib was 51600 hr•ng/mL in Japanese patients and 23800 hr•ng/mL in Stud X2101.  
No pharmacokinetic data in children were submitted.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis included 
patients ranging in the age from 23 to 82 years old. Age had no statistically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The simulated effect of age on CL/F was 1.018 (95%CI: 0.875, 1.324).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Ribociclib as a victim for drug-drug interactions 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) with a single 
400 mg dose of ribociclib increased ribociclib exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) in healthy 
subjects 3.2 and 1.7-fold, respectively, relative to a single 400 mg ribociclib dose given alone. Cmax and 
AUClast for LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of ribociclib accounting for less than 10% of parent exposure) 
decreased by 96% and 98%, respectively. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations were performed to model the effect of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor at steady state of ribociclib, and the effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. The key 
parameter in these simulations was fmCYP3A4 at multiple dose conditions. This parameter is dependent on fm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 35/121 
  
  
at single-dose conditions as well as the time dependent inhibition potency (KI) and inactivation rate (kinact). 
The parameters are correlated. 
The PBPK simulations suggested that at steady state, a dose reduction to 400 mg ribociclib with a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor will lead to a ribociclib exposure range that overlaps the exposure range at the 600 mg dose 
without a inhibitor.  
The PBPK simulations suggested that at a 600 mg dose of ribociclib, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(erythromycin) may increase ribociclib steady state Cmax and AUC 1.2 fold and 1.3 fold, respectively. For 
patients who had their ribociclib dose reduced to 400 mg once daily, the increase in steady-state Cmax and 
AUC was estimated to be 1.4 and 2.1-fold, respectively. The effect at the 200 mg qd dose was predicted to 
be a 1.7- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively.   
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 14 days) with a single 600 mg 
dose of ribociclib decreased the ribociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 89% and 81%, respectively, relative to a 
single 600 mg ribociclib dose given alone in healthy subjects. LEQ803 Cmax increased 1.7-fold and AUCinf 
decreased by 27%, respectively. 
Non-compartmental analysis of PK data from the pivotal efficacy/safety study indicated no effect of 
concomitant treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) on ribociclib exposure. Also population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no effect of PPIs on ribociclib bioavailability.  
Ribociclib as a perpetrator of drug-drug interactions 
In vitro 
In vitro, ribociclib was a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and a time-dependent inhibitor 
of CYP3A4/5, at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro evaluations indicated that Kisqali has no potential 
to inhibit the activities of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. It has no potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. 
In vitro evaluations indicated that Kisqali has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters PgP, 
BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Ribociclib did not inhibit OAT1, OAT3 or MRP2 at 
clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. 
The in vitro hepatocyte induction data were inconclusive as sufficiently high ribociclib concentrations could 
not be studied due to effects on cell viability. Induction of CYP1A2 could be excluded based on in vivo data. 
In a cell-free induction study, no agonist activity of ribociclib on the PXR at concentrations up to 100 µM (i.e. 
covering the 50*Cmax, u cutoff of 74 µM) were observed. CAR data were considered inconclusive.

In vivo 
In a clinical study with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 8 days of dosing at the 400 mg ribociclib 
dose to healthy volunteers led to a 3.8-fold increase (280%) in AUC of midazolam, indicating that the net 
effect (inhibition + possible induction) of ribociclib at steady state on CYP3A4 is inhibition, and that ribociclib 
at the 400 mg dose is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Results of a PBPK simulation suggested that ribociclib is 
a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor at the therapeutic dose of 600 mg (an estimated 5.2-fold increase in midazolam 
AUC). 
A study of the effect of 8 daily doses of 400 mg ribociclib on caffeine, a CYP1A2 substrate showed that 
ribociclib increased the caffeine exposure by 20% (1.20-fold) in healthy subjects, compared with 
administration of caffeine alone. At the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg, simulations using PBPK models 
predicted only weak inhibitory effects of ribociclib on CYP1A2 substrates (<2-fold increase in AUC). 
The potential effect of ribociclib on letrozole pharmacokinetics was evaluated by comparing letrozole PK data 
(2 hr and trough values only) between treatment arms in the phase III study A2301. Letrozole C 2hr and 
Ctrough values on Day 15 were similar between treatment arms. In addition, a cross study comparison of 
letrozole PK data from study X2107 (dose escalation in combination with letrozole) and historical data was 
performed. Letrozole exposure on Day 21 following multiple dose administration of ribociclib (600 mg) and 
letrozole (2.5 mg) was consistent with or numerically lower than data reported in historical studies with 
letrozole.  
The potential interaction between ribociclib and exemestane was evaluated by comparison of data from a 
phase 1 dose-finding study with ribociclib+exemestane with historical PK data for monotherapy ribociclib and 
exemestane, respectively. No interaction was observed.   
No pharmacokinetic data of ribociclib and anastrozole in combination were submitted.

No studies submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In the CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2, an analysis of PFS in subgroups defined by above or below median in 
cycle 1 day 15 Ctrough was provided, with fewer events in the higher exposure group (see also dose finding 
studies). Dose-exposure-PD relationships were investigated primarily in CLEE011X2101, utilizing skin and 
tumour biopsies assessed for IHC expression of RB and KI67. In doses above 600 mg, a larger decrease from 
baseline in the proportion of cells expressing KI67 was observed. 
Relationship between ribociclib exposure and neutrophil response 
An indirect, concentration dependent effect of ribociclib on absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was modeled. A 
low baseline neutrophil count was associated with a higher risk of neutropenia although the sensitivity to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 38/121 
  
  
 
drug exposure (slope) was independent of the baseline ANC level. Simulations showed that a lower ribociclib 
dose on average would lead to less ANC reduction. 
Relationship between ribociclib exposure and QT prolongation  
The risk of QT-prolongation associated with ribociclib was identified in non-clinical studies (see non-clinical 
section). A thorough QT/QTc study was not submitted. The relationship between ribociclib exposure and 
changes from baseline in QT corrected for heart rate using pooled data from studies in patients with cancer 
was evaluated. The pooled analysis in patients included a total of 267 patients with cancer treated with 
ribociclib at doses ranging from 50 to 1200 mg including 193 subjects treated with ribociclib 600 mg. The 
pooled analysis in healthy subjects included a total of 187 healthy subjects treated with ribociclib at doses of 
400 or 600 mg. 
Ribociclib was associated with concentration-dependent QT interval prolongation effect with a largest ΔQTcF 
reached at steady state (during cycle 1). The estimated mean ΔQTcF was 22.87 ms (90% CI: 21.6, 24.1) in 
patients at the mean Cmax at steady-state (2237 ng/mL) following a therapeutic dose of 600 mg daily for 3 
weeks on/ one week off therapy (i.e. the proposed regimen). A similar relationship was observed in healthy 
subjects (an estimated mean ΔQTcF of 13.59 ms [90% CI: 12.8, 14.4 ms] for subjects at the mean Cmax 
following a single dose of 600 mg (652 ng/mL).These results were consistent with data from the pivotal 
A2301 study where the largest mean ΔQTcF in the ribociclib-containing arm was observed at Cmax at steady-
state during Cycle 1 (19.6 ms; 95% CI 17.6, 21.5).  
With respect to supratherapeutic exposure, for example an approximate 50% increase in exposure from 2237 
ng/mL (the mean Cmax for 600 mg) to 3460 ng/mL would result in an estimated mean ΔQTcF of 28.13 ms 
(90% CI: 26.7, 29.5).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Given the data from the food effect studies indicating no relevant food effect on either the clinical study 
formulation or on the commercial formulation, Ribociclib should be taken orally once daily with or without 
food (see SmPC section 4.2). This was the recommendation also in the pivotal efficacy study. The tablets 
should be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing. No tablet should 
be ingested if it is broken, cracked or otherwise not intact. Patients should also be encouraged to take their 
dose at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If the patient vomits after taking 
the dose or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed dose should 
be taken at the usual time. 
Ribociclib succinate exhibits high solubility in aqueous buffer at or below pH 4.5 and in bio-relevant media (at 
pH 5.0 and 6.5) but lower solubility in aqueous buffer at pH 6.8 and pH 7.5. The effect of agents that alter 
gastric pH was not evaluated in a dedicated drug interaction study. However, non-compartmental analysis of 
PK data from the pivotal efficacy/safety study indicated no effect of concomitant treatment with proton-pump 
inhibitors (PPIs) on ribociclib exposure. Also population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no effect of PPIs 
on ribociclib bioavailability.  
The major part of the dose was recovered in faeces as parent and metabolites. It is not known whether the 
17% of the dose found in faeces as unchanged ribociclib is unabsorbed drug or excreted via biliary or 
gastrointestinal secretion (likely via Pgp or BCRP). Thus, biliary excretion may contribute to up to 17% of the 
elimination. The effect of inhibitors of biliary excretion on ribociclib exposure is expected to be minor. Twelve 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 39/121 
  
  
percent of the dose was recovered as unchanged ribociclib in urine. If absolute bioavailability is <50%, as 
suggested by the Applicant, renal excretion could contribute to 25% or more of the elimination.  
Ribociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose range of 
50 mg to 1200 mg following both single dose and repeated doses. This analysis is limited by the small sample 
sizes for most of the dose cohorts with a majority of the data coming from the 600 mg dose cohort. 
The excretion data together with the results of in vitro metabolism studies, data in mild-moderate renal 
impairment and the interaction study with ritonavir indicate that ribociclib is eliminated primarily via 
metabolism. The most important enzyme appears to be CYP3A4.  
With regards to special populations, no dedicated pharmacokinetic study in renal impairment was provided. If 
bioavailability is 0.5, with 12% of a single dose excreted unchanged in the urine, renal elimination may 
account for 25% of the elimination. Complete blocking of a pathway accounting for 25% of clearance would 
lead to about 30% increase in AUC. The effect of mild-moderate renal impairment would be expected to be 
limited, which was also confirmed by the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Severe renal impairment may, 
in addition to blocking the renal elimination pathway, affect also the hepatic elimination of ribociclib. 
However, the effect is not expected to be greater than it can be handled by the general monitoring for side 
effects recommended in the SmPC. Awaiting data from the ongoing pharmacokinetic study in severe renal 
impairment (see RMP measures), the warning proposed for the SmPC is considered sufficient. Caution should 
be used in patients with severe renal impairment with close monitoring of signs of toxicity as there is no 
experience with Kisqali in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). A pharmacokinetic study in hepatic 
impairment indicated no relevant effect of mild hepatic impairment on ribociclib exposure. The average 
increase in moderate and severe hepatic impairment was small (30%) and the ranges of individual AUC 
values in the hepatic impairment groups were largely overlapping the individual values in the normal hepatic 
function group. Given also the observed hepatotoxicity of ribociclib, it is agreed to take a cautious approach 
in this patient group. The SmPC states that, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh class A). Patients with moderate (Child Pugh class B) and severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh class C) can have increased (less than 2-fold) exposure to ribociclib and the starting dose of 400 
mg Kisqali once daily is recommended. Ribociclib has not been studied in breast cancer patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, body weight 
or gender on the systemic exposure of ribociclib that would require a dose adjustment. Data on differences in 
pharmacokinetics due to race are too limited to draw conclusions. No dose adjustment is required in patients 
over 65 years of age (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
The comparison between Caucasian and Japanese patients is limited due the small sample size. Based on 
tolerability, the recommended dose in Japanese patients was defined as 600 mg once daily on a 21-days 
on/7-days off schedule, i.e. the same as in Caucasian patients. 
As ribociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 enzyme activity 
may alter the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir increased the exposure to 
ribociclib by 3.2-fold, after administration of a single 400 mg dose of ribociclib. Ribociclib at the 600 mg dose 
is a strong time-dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor with auto-inhibition leading to time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics. The contribution of CYP3A4 to the overall elimination is likely smaller at steady state than 
after a single dose due to time-dependent auto-inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of ribociclib. 
Thus, in the ritonavir study the effect of ritonavir on ribociclib at steady state might have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 40/121 
  
  
overestimated. The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on ribociclib at steady state was therefore simulated 
using Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK). 
Although there are some remaining uncertainties with the PBPK simulations, the models for prediction of the 
effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors are considered sufficiently well justified for guiding recommendations in the SmPC.  
Given the effects on QTc interval, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not limited 
to the following must be avoided: clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil and voriconazole (see 
section 4.4). Alternative concomitant medicinal products with less potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be 
considered and patients should be monitored for ADRs (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).  
Based on these PBPK simulations, if patients must be given a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor concomitantly with 
ribociclib, the Kisqali dose should be reduced to 400 mg once daily (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.5). In 
patients who have had their dose reduced to 400 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose should be further reduced to 
200 mg. In patients who have had their dose reduced to 200 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, Kisqali treatment should be interrupted. 
Of particular importance is the fact that Cmax, which would be expected to be the most important 
pharmacokinetic parameter for potential QT prolongation, is not predicted to be increased at the 400 mg 
dose with inhibitor as compared with the 600 mg dose without inhibitor. 
Due to inter patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal in all patients, 
therefore close monitoring for ribociclib related AEs is recommended. In the event of ribociclib related 
toxicity, the dose should be modified or treatment should be interrupted until toxicity is resolved (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, and after at least 5 half lives of the CYP3A4 
inhibitor (refer to product information of the inhibitor in question) the Kisqali dose should be resumed at the 
dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). 
The PBPK-predicted increase in exposure was 1.3-fold when combining ribociclib 600 mg with moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. For patients who already had their dose reduced to 400 mg or 200 mg, the predicted 
effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor was predicted to be larger than at the 600 mg dose, a 2.1-fold and 2.8 
fold increase in AUC, respectively, i.e. > the 50% increase. Nevertheless, given some remaining uncertainty 
in these predictions and the expected variability in the effect of different inhibitors, it is agreed not to add a 
recommendation of a dose reduction at concomitant treatment with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Overall, no 
dose adjustments of ribociclib are required at initiation of treatment with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
However, monitoring of ribociclib related AEs is recommended. 
Patients should also be instructed to avoid pomegranates or pomegranate juice and grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice. These are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A4 enzymes and may increase the exposure to ribociclib 
(see SmPC section 4.5). 
The strong PXR inducer rifampicin had a large effect on ribociclib AUC, with the exposure only 11% of that 
observed after treatment of ribociclib alone. This may be due to induction of several elimination pathways for 
ribociclib, including CYP3A4, FMO, Pgp and UGTs. The effect at steady state of ribociclib is not known.  Such a 
large decrease cannot be compensated for by dose adjustments. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 
inducers was prohibited in the pivotal efficacy/safety study. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
may therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. The concomitant use 
of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, including, but not limited to, phenytoin, rifampicin, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 41/121 
  
  
carbamazepine and St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). An alternative concomitant medicinal product 
with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.  
The effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer on ribociclib exposure has not been studied. Physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (efavirenz) may decrease steady 
state ribociclib Cmax and AUC by 51% and 70%, respectively. The concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 
inducers may therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for impaired efficacy, in 
particular in patients treated with ribociclib at 400 mg or 200 mg once daily. 
Ribociclib was found to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, the latter enzyme both competitively and through time-
dependent inhibition. After 8 days of dosing with 400 mg ribociclib once daily, midazolam AUC increased 
about 3.8-fold, suggesting that ribociclib at the 400 mg dose is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Based on PBPK 
simulation, midazolam AUC is predicted to increase 5.2-fold at daily dosing with 600 mg ribociclib, suggesting 
that ribociclib at the 600 mg dose should be categorised as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
The SmPC reflects that Ribociclib is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor at the 600 mg dose and a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor at the 400 mg dose. Thus, ribociclib may interact with medicinal products which are metabolised via 
CYP3A4, which may lead to increased serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (see section 4.5). Caution 
is recommended in case of concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index 
and the SmPC of the other product should be consulted for the recommendations regarding co administration 
with CYP3A4 inhibitors. (see SmPC section 4.4). The dose of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate with a narrow 
therapeutic index, including but not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, everolimus, fentanyl, sirolimus and 
tacrolimus, may need to be reduced as ribociclib can increase their exposure (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of ribociclib at the 600 mg dose with the following CYP3A4 substrates should be 
avoided: alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, quetiapine, 
lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam. 
CYP2E1 was also inhibited by ribociclib but this signal is not further pursued as there are few clinically 
relevant CYP2E substrates.  
There was only a small 20% increase in caffeine AUC when administered with multiple 400 mg doses of 
ribociclib. Also a PBPK simulation indicated a small effect. Thus, the available in vivo data shows that the net 
effect on CYP1A2 is weak inhibition that is unlikely to be clinically relevant. There are no other important 
drug-metabolising enzymes regulated via the AhR receptor, and the AhR induction signal is therefore not 
further pursued. 
In vitro evaluations indicated that ribociclib has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters Pgp, 
BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. The in vivo relevant net effect may be Pgp and BCRP 
inhibition both at intestinal level and “systemic” level, OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibition, OCT1 and 2 inhibition, 
MATE1 and MATE2K inhibition and BSEP inhibition. Caution and monitoring for toxicity are advised during 
concomitant treatment with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit a narrow therapeutic 
index, including but not limited to digoxin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and metformin.   
In vitro data indicate that ribociclib has no potential to induce UGT enzymes or the CYP enzymes CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 via PXR. Therefore, Kisqali is unlikely to affect substrates of these enzymes. In vitro 
data are not sufficient to exclude a potential of ribociclib to induce CYP2B6 via CAR. 
Ribociclib was teratogenic in animal studies. A DDI study with an oral contraceptive is not considered 
necessary at present, given the proposed target population (postmenopausal women). The SmPC reflects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 42/121 
  
  
that it is currently unknown whether Kisqali may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal 
contraceptives.  
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer and population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no 
drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole following co-administration of these medicinal products. 
Letrozole exposure on Day 21 following multiple dose administration of ribociclib (600 mg) and letrozole 
(2.5 mg) was consistent with or numerically lower than data reported in historical studies with letrozole. The 
latter evaluation should be interpreted with caution, as it is based on comparison with historical data.  
No pharmacokinetic data of ribociclib and anastrozole in combination were submitted. Based on 
theoretical/mechanistic considerations, the risk for a clinically relevant interaction between the two drugs is 
expected to be low. 
The potential interaction of ribociclib on exemestane was evaluated by comparison of data from a phase 1 
dose-finding study with ribociclib+exemestane with historical PK data for monotherapy ribociclib and 
exemestane, respectively. No interaction was observed. The results should be interpreted with caution, as 
they are based on comparison with historical data. From a mechanistic point of view, an interaction risk 
appears to be low.  
Pharmacodynamic 
Genetic differences in PD response 
A molecular correlate of variable sensitivity has not been identified clinically and there is no compelling 
evidence of differential effects in subgroups defined by Cyclin D1, RB or P16 mRNA or protein expression in 
CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 (see clinical efficacy).  
The applicant has investigated mRNA expression levels for CCNA2, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2, 
CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, E2F1, E2F3, RB1, TFDP1, BCL6, FGF2, FGFR1, LMO2, 
MCL1, MET, PDGFA, PDGFRA, YY1 in relation to PFS without identifying potential biomarkers for differential 
efficacy (data not shown). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
There was a strong association between ΔQTcF and ribociclib plasma concentration. Co-administration of 
Kisqali with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT interval such as anti-arrhythmic 
medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and 
sotalol), and other medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited 
to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil, pimozide and 
intravenous ondansetron) should be avoided (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
No relationship was observed between ribociclib exposure parameters and efficacy, which may be due to 
limitations in the evaluation, such as lack of relevant exposure data.  
Overall, a 50% increase in exposure, e.g. due to an interaction, is considered manageable by monitoring for 
toxicity (except in patients with patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment, see above).

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study CLEE011X1101 
A phase I, multi-center, open-label dose-escalation study to estimate the MTD/RDE and to assess the dosing 
schedule as a single agent of LEE011, enrolling patients at two centres in Japan. LEE011 was administered 
orally once daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period (28-day cycle) in patients with solid tumours 
that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no further effective standard therapy is available. 
Approximately 30 patients were planned to be treated in the entire study (a minimum of 12 patients in the 
dose escalation part and at least 12 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who had not been 
treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the dose expansion part). The dose expansion part was not opened as no 
sign of antitumor activity was observed in the 9 ESCC patients; between 20 June 2103 and 17 December 
2014 4 patients were enrolled in the 400 mg dose group and 13 in the 600 mg group. The last patient last 
visit was 28 January 2015. 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
Four DLTs occurred in 4 patients: 1 patient each in the 400 mg and the 600 mg dose groups had grade 3 
febrile neutropenia, 2 patients in the 600 mg dose group had grade 3 electrocardiogram QT prolonged, 1 
patient in the 600 mg dose group had grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient in the 600 mg dose group had 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) 
Doses above 600 mg were not studied and MTD was not determined. The RDE was determined to be 600 mg 
QD on the 21-days on/7-days off schedule in Japanese patients with solid tumors. The Bayesian logistic 
regression model (BLRM) analysis predicted that 750 mg had the highest posterior probability of the true DLT 
rates falling in the target toxicity interval among the doses satisfying the escalation with overdose control 
(EWOC) principle. However, all investigators and the Sponsor agreed to declare the RDE as 600 mg without 
further dose-escalation based on the following reasons: (1) 600 mg satisfied MTD/RDE determination criteria 
specified in the protocol; (2) 600 mg fulfilled the EWOC principle; and (3) the observed DLT rate at 600 mg in 
this study was 23%. 
Efficacy 
None of the patients achieved confirmed CR or PR. A best overall response of SD was observed in 4 of 13 
patients in the 600 mg dose group. In 13 patients dosed at 600 mg, the median PFS per Investigator 
assessment was 2.0 months with 95% CI of 1.0-3.7 months.

Study CLEE011X2101 
A Phase 1 multicenter, open label, dose-escalation study of oral LEE011 in patients with advanced 
solid tumors or lymphomas 
This was a Phase I, multi-center, open-label dose-escalation study of ribociclib administered orally once daily 
for either 21 days followed by a 7 day rest period or continuous daily dosing (28-day cycle) in adult patients 
with solid tumors or lymphomas that have progressed despite standard therapy and for which no standard 
therapy was available. Enrollment was restricted to patients with tumors that have intact retinoblastoma 
protein (pRb). The study is ongoing. As of the data cut-off date (18-Sep-2015), 153 patients have been 
treated in this study. A total of 134 patients were treated on the once daily 3 weeks on/1 week off regimen. 
Dose-limiting toxicities 
As of the data cut-off date (18-Sep-2015), for patients treated in the once daily 3 weeks on/1 week off 
regimen, the incidence of DLTs was higher in patients who received >600 mg (17.9%) compared to those 
who received 600 mg (8.3%). The most common DLTs (≥ 1%) observed were thrombocytopenia (3.2%), 
neutropenia (2.4%), QT prolongation and febrile neutropenia (1.6% each). 
All other DLTs occurred in one patient each, with an incidence of 0.8% (platelet count decreased, stomatitis, 
herpes simplex, and pulmonary embolism). The stomatitis and herpes simplex DLTs occurred in the same 
patient. In this case, the event was initially thought to be drug related stomatitis. 
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) 
The MTD was declared at 900 mg. The dose and regimen of 600 mg once daily 3 weeks on/1 week off was 
declared as the RDE based on the emerging DLT data from the 64 patients in the dose determining set, 
Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) results along with the escalation with over-dose control (EWOC) 
principle, and the review of all available safety and PK data. At the time of RDE declaration, the MTD (900 
mg) had a risk of excessive toxicity of 1.2%, whereas the RDE (600 mg) had a risk of excessive toxicity of 
<0.1%. The decision to declare RDE below the MTD was driven primarily by the lower rate of QTcF 
prolongation observed at 600 mg/day compared with higher doses. 
Efficacy 
Across all dose levels, the ORR was 3.0% [90% CI: 1.0, 6.7], and the disease control rate was 38.1% [90% 
CI: 31.0, 45.5] for patients who were treated on the once daily 3 weeks on/1 week off regimen. 
Best overall response of CR was not observed, however, four patients (3.0%), all at the 600 mg dose level, 
achieved a PR. These patients included: one patient with melanoma, one patient with thymic carcinoma, one 
patient with ER+ breast cancer, and one patient with head and neck acinar carcinoma. Stable disease was 
observed in patients across all dose levels (n=47, 35.1%). 
Pharmacodynamics 
Reduction in Ki67 and phosphorylated pRb were observed in skin biopsies in all dose cohorts. Tumour 
biopsies did not show a consistent decrease in phosphorylated Rb but reductions in Ki67 were observed in the 
majority of samples treated at doses ≥ 600 mg.

Study CLEE011X2107 
A phase Ib/II, multicenter, study of the combination of LEE011 and BYL719 with letrozole in adult 
patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer 
This was a multi-center, open-label, dose finding Phase Ib study to estimate the MTD and/or RP2D for two 
double combinations: LEE011 with letrozole and BYL719 with letrozole followed by estimation of the MTD 
and/or RP2D of the triple combination of LEE011 + BYL719 with letrozole. 
The study was conducted in adult post-menopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2-
negative breast cancer. In the dose escalation part of the study, patients could have any number of prior 
lines of endocrine therapy with up to one prior cytotoxic regimen in the metastatic or locally advanced 
setting, whereas in the dose expansion patients should not have received prior systemic treatment for 
advanced disease (allowing < 1 month of letrozole).  
The dose escalation part was followed by a dose expansion in all three arms to further characterize the 
safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary clinical anti-tumor activity of the combinations. 
An interim analysis was submitted, where only the analysis related to the Arm 1 doublet (ribociclib with 
standard dose letrozole) dose escalation and dose expansion is reported. 
In Arm 1, LEE011 was administered orally, once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by a 7-day planned 
break (28-day cycle, 3 weeks on/1 week off). Letrozole was administered orally on all 28 days (2.5 mg oral 
once daily). 
Since 22 October 2013, 47 patients have been enrolled on Arm 1 of this study (19 patients in the dose 
escalation phase and 28 patients in the dose expansion phase of the study). All patients were dosed ribociclib 
600 mg plus letrozole 2.5 mg. 
Dose-limiting toxicities 
Two patients (10.5%) in the escalation phase experienced a dose limiting toxicity of grade 4 neutropenia, 
both grade 4 events started after 21 days on study (and lasted 4 and 10 days). 
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
The starting dose of ribociclib was 600 mg qd 3 weeks on 1 week off in combination with standard dose of 
letrozole. Based on the DLT data at the completion of the first cycle for the 19 patients evaluable for the 
dose-determining set at the time of MTD determination, one DLT was observed (grade 4 neutropenia). Based 
on the safety and PK data, and the recommendations of the Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM), 
ribociclib 600 mg/day (3 weeks on, 1 week off) and letrozole 2.5 mg/day (continuous) was RP2D for Arm 1 
expansion. 
Efficacy 
In the escalation phase, one patient (5.3%) had a partial response (PR); no patients had complete response 
(CR). In the expansion phase, one patient (3.6%) had a CR and 10 patients (35.7%) had a PR; overall 
response rate was 39.3%.  
As of the cut-off date of 30-Oct-2015, 15 PFS events has been observed in the dose escalation phase; the 
median PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI: 2.3, 8.0). A total of 8 PFS events were observed in the dose expansion 
phase and the median PFS was not estimable at the time of data cut-off.

Pharmacodynamics 
PD markers were available for a small number of paired samples, limiting usefulness. No patient had a 
mutation in the RB1 gene.

Note: The use of following corticosteroids was permitted: single doses of topical applications (e.g., for 
rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), and eye drops or local injections (e.g., 
intra-articular). 
Treatments 
Arm A: Ribociclib (600 mg once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) + letrozole (2.5 mg once daily, days 1-28 
of a 28-day cycle). 
Arm B: Placebo (once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) + letrozole (2.5 mg once daily days 1-28 of a 28-
day cycle continuously). 
The ribociclib/placebo dose could be reduced to 400 mg (first reduction) and 200 mg (second reduction), 
whereas no dose modification for letrozole was planned in the study. 
Patients received study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation 
from the study treatment for any other reason. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with ribociclib and 
letrozole to that of patients treated with placebo and letrozole, according to investigators’ review. 
Secondary objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 49/121 
  
  
 
 
The key secondary objective of the study was to compare the two treatment arms with respect to overall 
survival (OS). 
Other secondary objectives were: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
To evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to overall response rate (ORR) and clinical 
benefit rate (CBR). 
To evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to time to deterioration of Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with letrozole. 
To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PROs) for health-related quality of life (QoL) in the two 
treatment arms. 
Exploratory objectives 
Time to response, duration of response, exposure for ribociclib and letrozole, effects on estradiol suppression 
for combination vs. monotherapy, exposure-response relationship, hospital resource utilization, signaling 
pathway alterations, circulating DNA, mechanisms of resistance. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PFS was determined through investigators review of radiology data using RECIST version 1.1 criteria. Tumour 
assessments (CT with iv contrast or without iv contrast combined with MRI, visual assessment, photograpy) 
were made every 8 weeks during the first 18 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease 
progression and at end-of-treatment. 
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease 
progression or death due to any cause. Discontinuation for non-RECIST progression was not counted as a PFS 
event. If a patient started other anti-neoplastic therapy or had two or more missing tumour assessments, 
PFS was censored at the last adequate tumour assessment, regardless of subsequent events. 
A blinded independent review committee (BIRC) was utilized for review of radiology (and photography) data. 
At the start of the study, the BIRC consisted of a single radiology reader and an oncologist who would review 
all data for select patients where radiological progression could not be fully confirmed. The decision regarding 
patient management remained with the investigator. 
Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date 
of randomization to date of death due to any cause.  
Other secondary efficacy variables were ORR, CBR, and ECOG performance status. ORR was defined as the 
proportion of patients with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1, and CBR 
defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed CR or PR or stable disease 
(SD) lasting 24 weeks or longer, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) questionnaire along with the disease-specific breast 
cancer module (EORTC QLQ-BR23, version 1.0) and the EuroQoL 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L, Version 4.0) 
to explore impacts on health-related quality of life, functioning, disease symptoms, and treatment-related 
side effects.

Sample size 
It was initially planned to randomise 500 patients. Within a study protocol amendment (amendment 2, 25-
Nov-2014) the sample size of the study was increased to 650 in order to better characterize the effect of 
ribociclib and letrozole on overall survival.  
It was estimated that the median duration of PFS in the control group (placebo plus letrozole) would be 9.0 
months, and treatment with test treatment arm (ribociclib plus letrozole) would result in a 33% reduction in 
the hazard rate (corresponding to an increase in median PFS to 13.43 months). 
If the true hazard ratio was 0.67 (under alternative hypothesis), a total of 302 PFS events were required to 
have 93.5% power at a one-sided overall 2.5% level of significance to reject the null hypothesis (HR=1) 
using a log-rank test and a 2-look group sequential design with Haybittle-Peto to determine efficacy 
boundary for the interim analysis. Considering a recruitment period of approximately 16 months at a uniform 
rate of 37 patients/month 592 patients needed to be randomized to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. 
Assuming about 10% patients were to be lost to follow-up for PFS, a total of 650 patients needed to be 
randomized. Given the above assumptions, it was estimated that the 302th PFS event were to be observed at 
approximately 20 months from the date of first patient randomized in the study. 
The median OS in the letrozole only arm was expected to be around 34 months. It was hypothesized that test 
treatment arm (ribociclib plus letrozole) resulted in a 28% reduction in the hazard rate for overall survival 
(corresponding to an increase in median survival to 47.2 months). If the true hazard ratio was 0.72 (under 
alternative hypothesis), a total of 400 deaths needed to be observed to have 90% power at a one-sided 
overall 2.5% level of significance to reject the null hypotheses (HR=1) using a log-rank test and a 4-look 
group sequential design. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized using IRT system in a 1:1 ratio.  
Randomization was stratified by the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (yes versus no). 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
This was a superiority trial, powered to detect a difference (at least) corresponding to a median PFS of 13.43 
months (experimental arm) vs. 9 months (control arm), with 93.5% probability (HR 0.67, one-sided overall 
2.5% level of significance, log-rank test). This also involved a 2-look group sequential design with an interim 
analysis for superiority. The interim analysis was planned to be performed after approximately 211 events, 
requiring a p < 0.0000129 for conclusion of superiority, whereas the final analysis was planned after 302 
events, requiring a p-value of 0.02499 for statistical significance. 
Assuming a median OS of 47.2 months for the experimental arm vs. 34 for the control arm (HR of 0.72), 400 
events would be necessary for 90% power to detect a difference (one-sided overall 2.5% level of 
significance, log-rank test, 4-look group sequential design). The four OS analyses were planned to be 
performed after 76 (interim PFS analysis), 120 (final PFS analysis), 300 and 400 deaths.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 51/121 
  
  
Investigators and patients will remain blinded to study treatment and all patients will continue to be followed 
for OS until the final OS analysis (or earlier if OS reaches statistical significance at any of the interim 
analyses).  
A hierarchical testing strategy, where OS was to be statistically evaluated only if the primary efficacy 
endpoint PFS was statistically significant, was used to control the overall type-I error rate. 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which consisted of all randomised 
patients. According to the intent to treat principle, patient data were analysed according to the treatment and 
stratum they had been assigned to at randomisation. Efficacy analyses included all data observed in patients 
from FAS regardless whether it was observed on-treatment or after the study treatment discontinuation till 
the analysis cut-off date. 
As a supportive analysis, the primary PFS analysis was to be repeated using data from BIRC assessments 
using FAS and using the same conventions as for the primary analysis. 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned to assess the overall robustness of the primary efficacy results. 
These analyses included repeating the primary efficacy analysis using the Per Protocol Set, using an 
unstratified log-rank test and using different censoring rules.

Time to deterioration of ECOG PS 
Time to definitive deterioration of ECOG performance status was similar between two treatment arms, with 
an HR of 0.917 (95% CI: 0.640, 1.314) (one -sided p=0.319). 
Patient reported outcome 
The global health status/global QoL scale score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was the primary PRO variable of 
interest. Physical functioning, emotional functioning and social functioning sub-scale scores of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30, the breast cancer symptoms scale of the EORTC QLQ-BR23, and the VAS of the EQ-5D-5L were 
secondary PRO variables of interest. 
Overall compliance rates of patients completing the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires during the treatment 
period were high in both treatment arms with Baseline rates 97.0% and 97.9% in ribociclib plus letrozole arm 
and placebo plus letrozole arm, respectively. The compliance rate was above 90% at the first post-baseline 
assessment and throughout the first year of treatment. Overall compliance rates of patients completing the 
QLQ-BR23, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were also high for patients on study at the time of assessment for 
both treatment arms during the study treatment. 
Mean (SD) Baseline global health status/QOL scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 were well balanced between 
treatment arms (64.5 [20.25]) and 64 [21.07]) in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and in the placebo plus 
letrozole arm, respectively). Global health status/QoL scores were generally similar between the two 
treatment arms throughout the study; there was a slight improvement (i.e. increased) in scores for patients 
in both the treatment arms and the improvement was sustained over the study treatment period. 
A longitudinal analysis of changes from Baseline in the global health status data of EORTC QLQ-C30 was 
performed by fitting a linear mixed effect model with Baseline value, stratification factors, treatment, visit 
time and treatment by visit time interaction factors in the model. The results revealed no significant effect of 
treatment, time or treatment by time interactions. The estimated mean difference in the changes in global 
health status/QoL scale score between the two treatment arms was -1.50 with 95% CI: (-4.0, 1.0).

Time to definitive 10% deterioration of the global health status/QOL scale (EORTC QLQ - C30) score was 
similar between the two treatment arms, with an HR of 0.890 (95% CI: 0.670, 1.182) slightly favouring the 
ribociclib plus letrozole arm.

The overall concordance rate (considering the proportion of patients with same PFS outcome of PD, death or 
censor), between the Investigator assessment and BIRC was 80.5% in ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 
69.5% in placebo plus letrozole arm respectively. A similar proportion of locally assessed PDs were not 
confirmed by the BIRC: 54 out of 89 (60.7%) in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 90 out of 150 (60.0%) 
in the placebo plus letrozole arm.

The most frequent reason for PD according to investigator, subsequently not confirmed by BIRC, was new or 
worsening bone lesion. The concordance in investigator and BIRC PD, in patients with bone lesion(s) only at 
baseline was investigated, and found to be lower than the overall concordance rates; approximately 75% (12 
/ 16 investigator PDs with bone-only disease at baseline) and 78.1% (25 / 32 investigator PDs with bone-
only disease at baseline) of the PDs considered by local investigators were not subsequently confirmed by 
BIRC, in the ribociclib + letrozole and placebo + letrozole arms, respectively.  
Early and late discordance rates between investigator and BIRC were also calculated, according to Amit O. et 
al. 2011: 
Ribociclib + letrozole: 
Placebo + letrozole: 
Early discordance rate (EDR): 65% 
Early discordance rate (EDR): 60% 
Late discordance rate (LDR): 26% 
Late discordance rate (LDR): 27%

Effect on estradiol suppression 
The effect on estradiol (E2) suppression relative to baseline with or without co-administration with ribociclib 
was investigated. The proportion of values below the lower limit of quantitation were 11% in both arms at 
baseline and comparable – 98% and 94% in the ribociclib plus letrozole and letrozole arms, respectively – at 
day 15, cycle 1. 
H-scores (pRb and p16) and Ki67 
Total of 479 Baseline samples (241 in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 238 in the placebo plus letrozole 
arm) and 405 Baseline samples (208 in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 197 in the placebo plus letrozole 
arm) were evealuated for pRb and p16 by IHC (immunohistochemistry) respectively. The mean H-score for 
the total Rb was similar between the ribociclib plus letrozole and placebo plus letrozole arm (166 vs 167, 
respectively) and the mean H-score for total p16 was similar in both ribociclib plus letrozole and placebo plus 
letrozole arms (76.8 vs 82.4, respectively). Total of 463 Baseline samples (234 in the ribociclib plus letrozole 
arm and 229 in the placebo plus letrozole arm) were assessed for Ki67 by IHC. The mean percentage of cells 
positive for Ki67 from tissue was similar between the two treatment arms (20.1 vs 19.3, respectively). 
mRNA expression of CCND1 and CDKN2A 
Total of 410 Baseline samples (207 in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 203 in the placebo plus letrozole 
arm) were evaluated for levels of mRNA expression for CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and CDKN2A (p16) by Nanostring 
technology. The mean PCN count measuring the levels of mRNA expression for CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and 
CDKN2A (p16) in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and in the placebo plus letrozole arm were: 
- Cyclin D1: 3860 and 4250, respectively

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-response studies 
The ribociclib dose was escalated in studies CLEE011X1101 (400 mg and 600 mg) and CLEE011X2101 (50 
mg to 1200 mg). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ribociclib was 900 mg and the recommended dose 
was declared as 600 mg due to the acceptable safety profile, which included a lower risk for QTcF 
prolongation (as asymptomatic QTcF prolongation was seen more frequently at higher doses), adequate 
exposure, and preliminary evidence of clinical activity. In the expansion phase of Arm 1 of the CLEE011X2107 
study in which ribociclib was administered in the 600 mg dose, one patient (3.6%) had a CR and 10 patients 
(35.7%) had a PR; overall response rate was 39.3%. It supports efficacy in the target population, similar to 
that of the pivotal study CLEE011A2301. 
Main study 
Evidence supporting efficacy for ribociclib largely derives from the pivotal CLEE011A2301 trial. This was a 
randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of ribociclib (LEE011) in combination with 
letrozole intended for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-
negative, advanced breast cancer who received no prior therapy for advanced disease. Patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ribociclib (600 mg once daily, days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle) plus 
letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) OR placebo (once daily, days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle) plus letrozole (2.5 mg 
once daily). Randomisation was stratified by the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (yes versus no). 
The trial design is considered acceptable.  
Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients derive benefit mainly from systemic treatments. For 
the targeted population, endocrine therapies such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant and 
tamoxifen are used as 1st line options. The choice of an add-on therapy to letrozole is considered acceptable.  
In scientific advice provided in November 2014 (EMEA/H/SA/2912/1/2014/II), PFS was accepted as a primary 
outcome measure. It was assumed that patients would be followed not only for survival, but also for PFS2 in 
line with the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 82/121 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The scientific advice was however received too late to be implemented in Study A2301; PFS2 data are 
therefore unavailable. 
In the absence of PFS2 data, assessments of time to 1st and 2nd subsequent lines of anti-neoplastic therapy 
following treatment discontinuation were made, as well as time since treatment discontinuation to time to 
disease progression or death for patients discontinuing study treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression or death. This is considered acceptable. 
Within a study protocol amendment the sample size was increased from initially planned 500 patients to 650 
patients in order to better characterize the effect of ribociclib and letrozole on overall survival. The increased 
total sample size had an impact on the power and the timing of the analyses but there were no changes in 
any of the efficacy assumptions made. Statistical methods and planned analyses are overall acceptable.  
In terms of baseline data, there were small imbalances in baseline demographic data, disease characteristics 
and prior therapy but these are not considered likely to affect the overall study results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal CLEE011A2301 trial, the preplanned interim analysis for outstanding efficacy met the stopping 
boundary, with 243 (36%) investigator PFS events in 668 patients, a HR of 0.556, and a one-sided log-rank 
p-value of 0.00000329. The estimated placebo + letrozole median PFS was 14.7 months, whereas the 
median for ribociclib+letrozole was not reached (data cut off 29 Jan 2016).  
The blinded independent review committee identified considerably fewer progression events than the 
investigators. In about 60% of cases, PD by investigator was not confirmed in BIRC review, a tendency that 
was balanced between treatment arms (60% experimental arm, 61% control arm). There was no indication 
of bias between arms in the investigators’ review. This was further supported by the balanced early and late 
discordance rates. Also, the hazard ratio was unaffected despite considerably fewer PFS events; with 122 
(18%) BIRC PFS events in 668 patients, the HR was 0.592, and the one-sided log-rank p-value 0.002.  
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted, including a per protocol analysis, an ‘actual event analysis’ (date 
of progression was accepted even after two or more missing tumour assessments), a ‘backdating’ approach 
(date of next scheduled assessment was used as PFS event date whenever it occurred after missing tumour 
assessment), and a ’no censoring for antineoplastic therapy’ approach (patients were not censored if next 
line therapy had been initiated prior to progression). These variations had limited effects on the number of 
events vs. censorings, and hazard ratios were unaffected. 
In an updated PFS analysis, carried out at the time of the second interim analysis for overall survival (data 
cut-off of 02-Jan-2017), with an increase in PFS event rate to 42% (experimental arm) and 61% (control 
arm), there was no significant change in hazard ratio or medians (HR 0.57; median PFS placebo + letrozole 
16 months; median PFS ribociclib + letrozole 25 months).  
The previously very immature OS findings are still immature with 15% and 20% events in the experimental 
and control arms (data cut-off of 02-Jan-2017), with a trend towards benefit for the experimental arm (HR 
0.75; 0.52 – 1.1). Accordingly, there is no indication of a detrimental effect of adding ribociclib to letrozole in 
poor prognosis patients in the target population. The final CSR for CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 is expected 
by Q4 2021. 
Considering time to progression and prolongation of PFS for first-line endocrine options ranging from 5 - 15 
months, a 9 month increase in median PFS over letrozole is of important clinical relevance. This can be put in 
further perspective by comparing findings to those of the PALOMA-2 trial, targeting the same 1st line 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 83/121 
  
  
hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative patient population, utilizing a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Study PALOMA 2: 
investigator PFS median 24.8 months for palbociclib+letrozole vs 14.5 months for letrozole+placebo; HR 
0.567; see Ibrance EPAR). 
In subgroup analyses, there was no convincing difference in effect on PFS in relation to potential CDK-
signaling linked molecules (Cyclin D1, Rb, P16). Loss of Rb function and other perturbations of the cyclin-
CDK-RB-E2F pathway may however be more relevant for ER negative breast cancer cells.  
The applicant collected baseline (pre-treatment) FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tumor tissue and 
circulating tumor DNA, as well as end-of-treatment tumor biopsies (few; < 10) and ctDNA (about 70% 
collection rate) to find biomarkers predictive of ribociclib efficacy, and also to understand mechanisms of 
resistance. These data will be provided post-approval together with the CSR of study 
CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 (see RMP).  
A series of pre specified subgroup PFS analyses was performed based on prognostic factors and baseline 
characteristics to investigate the internal consistency of treatment effect. A reduction in the risk of disease 
progression or death in favour of the ribociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in all individual patient 
subgroups of age, race, prior adjuvant or neo adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapies, liver and/or 
lung involvement and bone only metastatic disease. This was evident for patients with liver and/or lung 
metastases (HR of 0.561 [95% CI: 0.424, 0.743], median progression free survival [mPFS] 24.8 months for 
ribociclib plus letrozole versus 13.4 months for letrozole alone), or without liver and/or lung metastases (HR 
of 0.597 [95% CI: 0.426, 0.837], mPFS 27.6 months versus 18.2 months) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The efficacy and safety of ribociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease (see SmPC 
section 4.4) 
The differential rate (ORR and CBR) between arms was consistent with a PFS gain. There was no difference in 
the analysis of time to definitive deterioration by ECOG performance status. 
Results of the SAP-specified QoL analyses of change from baseline and time to definitive 10% deterioration in 
the global health status score indicated a slight benefit for letrozole control arm during treatment, whereas 
deterioration was somewhat faster in this arm, likely reflecting disease progression.  Overall, the global 
health status/QoL data showed no relevant difference between the Kisqali plus letrozole arm and the placebo 
plus letrozole arm (see SmPC section 5.1). 
With regards to exploratory objectives, the observed slightly larger proportion of values with estradiol 
suppression below the LLOQ in the ribociclib plus letrozole is deemed a non-significant confounder of the PFS 
gain in ribociclib plus letrozole patients. 
At the time of (data) cut-off (29-Jan-2016) more patients were still on treatment in the ribociclib and 
letrozole arm, 195/334 (58.4%), compared to the placebo and letrozole arm, 154/334 (46.1%). The primary 
reason for “end of treatment” was progressive disease with more patients in the placebo arm discontinuing 
study treatment due to progression (Investigator decision). In the updated analysis (data cut-off 02-Jan-
2017), a higher proportion of patients discontinued treatment; in the ribociclib arm 60.8% (203/334) and in 
the placebo arm 72.5% (242/334). The proportions of patients discontinuing due to progression were very 
similar to the previous analysis and as such seemingly continue to support the efficacy of ribociclib on disease 
progression. 
In addition the Applicant was asked to present analyses (using Kaplan-Meier curves) of time to end of 
treatment per treatment group irrespective of reason and time to end of treatment per treatment group for 
reasons other than progressive disease and death. In the updated analysis (data cut-off 02-Jan-2017) there 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 84/121 
  
  
was a difference between treatments in favour of ribociclib in time to end of treatment irrespective of reason 
due to the difference in patients diagnosed with progressive disease being the main reason for treatment 
discontinuation.  Median time on treatment was 20.3 and 13.7 months in the ribociclib and placebo arm 
respectively. The median PFS in the updated analysis was 25.3 and 16.0 months in the ribociclib and placebo 
arm respectively. In considering treatment discontinuation (irrespective of reason) as treatment failure the 
true difference in treatment efficacy may hence be smaller. In the analysis of time to treatment 
discontinuation for reasons other than progressive disease or death, the difference was in favour of placebo 
and comparing the number of events corresponds to the difference in number of patents who discontinued 
due to an AE.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The size of the PFS benefit, as demonstrated for ribocilib in the CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 trial, is 
statistically significant and clinically relevant. The results appear robust as shown by the results from the 
BIRC data, and are supported by the sensitivity analyses as well as subgroup analyses. With a PFS event rate 
of 52%, the effect appears stable, and OS results are supportive with a 17% event rate. A trend towards OS 
benefit and analysis of time to 1st and 2nd subsequent lines of therapy give no indication of an accelerated 
disease course post progression in ribociclib-treated patients. 
The final CSR for CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 is expected by Q4 2021 to address long term use (see RMP). 
Biomarker results relevant for efficacy and mechanisms of resistance in CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 will 
also be provided. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In Study A2301, exposure to ribociclib + letrozole was considered to be appropriate to allow for an informed 
assessment of the safety profile of ribociclib + letrozole. The overall safety evaluation of ribociclib is based on 
data from 898 patients. A total of 568 subjects have been exposed to ribociclib at the proposed dose i.e. 600 
mg QD on Days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. This number includes the in total 381 patients that have received 
ribociclib in combination with letrozole at 2.5 mg QD in the pivotal study A2301 (n=334) and the open-label, 
Phase Ib/II, dose-finding study X2107 study (n=47). 
• In Study A2301, 334 patients received treatment with ribociclib + letrozole and 330 patients received 
placebo + letrozole. The median exposure to study treatment was 13.0 months in the ribociclib + letrozole 
group and 12.4 months in the placebo + letrozole group with the median exposure to ribociclib at 12.2 
months and placebo at 12.4 months. 
• In Study X2107, 47 were treated with ribociclib + letrozole and the overall median duration of exposure to 
ribociclib 600 mg was 7.3 months (3.6 months for the dose escalation phase and 8.3 months for the dose 
expansion phase). 
• Contributing further to the safety evaluation of ribociclib 600 mg is the monotherapy pool (N=187) with 
three single-agent studies (Study X2101, Study XUS03, and Study X1101). 
The median duration of exposure to ribociclib 600 mg was 1.6 months.

Table 34: Duration of exposure to study treatment - combination therapy (Safety set) 
The overall mean and median duration of exposure of the combination of ribociclib + letrozole and letrozole 
alone in the main study A2301 is similar, about 12 months. Patients still on treatment ≥12 months are 58.1 
% and 53.0 % in the experimental and control arm respectively. 
In study A2301, the mean and median relative dose intensity for ribociclib in the experimental arm was 81 % 
and 88 % respectively. About a third of the patients in the combination arm had a relative dose intensity of 
less than 70 % (34 % of the patients) and only 48 % achieved a relative dose intensity of > 90 %.  
The mean and median relative dose intensity for letrozole in the experimental arm were 99 % and 100 % 
respectively with 97 % of the patients achieving a relative dose intensity of > 90 %.

The SOC in which the most AEs were reported with the experimental arm in the A2301 study were ‘GI 
disorders’ (80 %) followed by ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ (68 %), ‘general disorders and 
administration site conditions’ (66 %); ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (61 %); ‘musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders’ (60 %); ‘investigations (57 %), and ‘infections and infestations (50 %).

Table 37: AEs irrespective of relationship to treatment occurring more commonly (by 5% or more) with 
ribociclib therapy by grade - Study A2301 (Safety Set) 
When comparing the proportion of AE reports between the two arms in Study A2301, the highest differences 
were found in the SOCs of  ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ (overall +57 % but essentially 
neutropenia); ‘investigations’ (overall +33 % with decreased neutrophil count 18 %, AST increased +11 %, 
ALT increased +12 %); ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (overall +24 % with alopecia 18 %); 
‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (overall +17 % with nausea +23 %, vomiting + 14 %, diarrhoea + 13 %) and 
‘eye disorders’ (overall +12 % with increased lacrimation +5 %).  
The proportion of pneumonitis was fairly similar between the experimental and control arm (4 patients [1.2 
%] and 2 patients [0.6 %] respectively).  
Febrile neutropenia and sepsis were reported in a low proportion in the experimental arm (5 cases [1.5 % 
with 3 cases of Grade 3 and one case of Grade 4] and 3 [0.9 % with one Grade 3 and two Grade 4]. There 
were no reports in the control arm.  
Pulmonary embolism was infrequently reported (4 cases [~1 % with 2 Grade 3 and one Grade 4). One Grade 
3 case was reported in the control arm. 
ECG QT prolonged reports were 15 (4.5 % with one Grade 3 and no Grade 4). Reports of syncope amounted 
to nine (2.7 % with six reports of Grade 3 and no Grade 4).

Adverse drug reactions 
Screening strategy for ADR selection 
The algorithm followed for study A2301 was: 
1. Any AE (MedDRA preferred term) with ≥ 2% incidence in the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment group 
2. Any AE (from standard MedDRA query [SMQ]) with >5% incidence in the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment 
group 
3. Any AE (MedDRA preferred term) with ≥ 2% difference in incidence between ribociclib plus letrozole and 
placebo plus letrozole treatment groups 
4. Any AE (from SMQ) with ≥ 5% difference in incidence between ribociclib plus letrozole and placebo plus 
letrozole treatment groups 
5. Any grade 3/4 AE with incidence ≥ 0.5% or > than the placebo plus letrozole group 
6. AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation with an occurrence of ≥ 0.5% 
In Study A2301, the most frequently reported drug-related ‘haematological’ AEs (with incidences of ≥ 20 %) 
in the experimental arm and consistent with AEs irrespective of causality, was neutropenia (60 %) whereas 
the drug-related ‘nonhaematological’ AEs were nausea (43 %), alopecia (28 %), fatigue (27.5%), and 
diarrhoea (22 %).  
The most common ADRs and the most common grade 3/4 ADRs (reported at a frequency ≥20% and ≥2%, 
respectively) for which the frequency for Kisqali plus letrozole exceeds the frequency for placebo plus 
letrozole were neutropenia, leukopenia, headache, back pain, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
constipation, alopecia and rash and neutropenia, leukopenia, abnormal liver function test, lymphopenia, 
hypophosphataemia, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and back pain, respectively.

Neutropenia 
In Study A2301, neutropenic events occurred in a substantially higher proportion of patients in the 
experimental arm compared to the control (74.3 % vs. 5.2 %, respectively). The majority of these events 
were Grade 3 (50 %) with Grade 4 about 10 %. A grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil counts (based on 
laboratory findings) was reported in 59.6% of patients receiving Kisqali and letrozole. 
Dose interruptions/adjustments were required for 52 % of the patients. Discontinuation due to neutropenic 
events occurred in less than 1 %.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 92/121 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Furthermore events of febrile neutropenia were reported in 1.5% of the patients (duration with a range of 1-
8 days). GCS-F was administered to 8 % of patients in the combination therapy arm versus 0.3% in the 
control arm. 
Among patients with grade ≥ 2 neutropenia (based upon laboratory findings) in the combination therapy pool, 
the median time-to-onset was 16 days in the combination arm. The median time to resolution i.e. to 
normalization or grade <2 (based on medians of patients with an event) was 32 days. The median time to 
resolution of grade ≥3 (to normalisation or grade <3) was 15 days in the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment 
group following treatment interruption and/or reduction and/or discontinuation.  
Febrile neutropenia was reported in about 1.5% of patients exposed to Kisqali in the phase III 
study. Anaemia 
In Study A2301, anaemia events occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the ribociclib + letrozole group 
(19 %), compared with the control (4.5%) with few Grade 3 /4 events (similar in both arms [1.2 %]). Few 
patients (1.2 %) required dose adjustments and there were no treatment discontinuations due to anaemia 
events. The event of anaemia in the ribociclib + letrozole group had a relative difference from the control arm 
of +14 %. In terms of erythropoietin requirements, a total of four patients received erythropoietin in studies 
A2301 and XUS03 whilst none in studies X2107, X2101, and X1101. 
Leukopenia 
As expected, also events of leukopenia occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the experimental arm 
(17 %) compared with the control (4 %) as did grade 3/4 AEs (~ 10 % and 0.6%, respectively). Dose 
adjustments/interruptions were required in 5 % of the patients in the experimental arm whilst none in the 
control arm. One patient had an SAE and one patient discontinued study treatment due to leukopenia. The 
relative difference was +13 between the two arms.  
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 % in the experimental arm compared whilst 0.6 % in the control arm. Two 
patients experienced grade 3/4 AEs and one patient had an SAE of thrombocytopenia in the combination 
arm. About 1 % required dose adjustments/interruptions. There were no treatment discontinuations. The 
only bleeding event (associated with Grade 3 or 4 post baseline platelet count decrease) was epistaxis (n=1 
event).  
Nausea, emesis 
Nausea/ emesis events were reported in 56 % of the patients in the experimental arm whereof 52 % events 
of nausea and 29 % of vomiting. A total of 5 % experienced a Grade 3 event mostly vomiting (4 %). SAEs 
were reported in 2.4 %. In the majority of nausea cases (91 %), no action was taken with the study drug. 
Ribociclib was temporarily interrupted in 10 % and discontinued in 1.7%. Similarly, for the majority of 
vomiting events (83 %), no action was taken with the study drug and ribociclib was temporarily interrupted 
in 20 % and discontinued in 8 %. No Grade 4 events of nausea or vomiting were reported. 
Infections 
A high proportion of infectious events were reported in the experimental arm (50 %) but also fairly high in 
the control arm (42 %). The similarity in terms of individual causes between the two arms is recognised save 
slightly more viral infections in the experimental arms (e.g. influenza, herpes). The vast majority were Grade 
1/2 with about 4 % Grade 3/4 in the experimental arm compared to 2.4 % in the control arm. SAEs were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 93/121 
  
  
reported in 3 % mainly due to pneumonia (1 %), sepsis (1 %) and urinary tract infections (0.6 %). Few led 
to discontinuation of study drug (< 1%) and about 5 % led to dose adjustments/ interruption.   
Figure 13: Histogram of infectious events by treatment and cycle 
In terms of the proportion and distribution of infectious events according to neutropenia, no increased risk for 
`all grade´ infections was observed with increasing severity of neutropenia. However, the severity of the 
infectious events increased with increasing grade of neutropenia (more Grade 3 or 4 events).  
Only one event in study A2301 was classified as being an opportunistic infection (pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia) in the experimental arm.  
Hepatobiliary toxicity 
In Study A2301, hepatobiliary toxicity events occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the experimental 
arm compared with the control arm (24.0 % vs. 13.6 %, respectively), with more grade 3/4 AEs reported in 
the patients treated with ribociclib plus letrozole (11.4 % vs. 3.6 %, respectively). The main cause was ALT 
and AST elevations.  
Increases in transaminases were observed; Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (10.2% versus 1.2%) and AST 
(6.9% versus 1.5%) were reported in the ribociclib and placebo arms respectively. Concurrent elevations in 
ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than two times the 
upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis occurred in 4 (1.2%) 
patients and all patients recovered to normal levels within 154 days after treatment with Kisqali was 
discontinued.  
Dose interruptions and/or adjustments due to hepatotobiliary toxicity events were reported in 8.4% of 
ribociclib plus letrozole-treated patients, primarily due to ALT increased (5.7%) and/or AST increased (4.5%). 
Discontinuation of treatment with Kisqali plus letrozole due to abnormal liver function tests or hepatotoxicity 
occurred in 3.0% and 0.6% of patients respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
In the combination therapy pool the majority (83.8 %; 31/37) of the grade 3/4 ALT and AST increases 
occurred during the first 6 months of treatment. The median time-to-onset of grade ≥ 3 ALT/AST elevation 
was 57 days and 62 days (based upon medians of patients with events) for the experimental and control arm 
respectively. The median time to resolution i.e. to normalization or grade ≤2 (again based upon medians of 
patients with events) was 24 days and 19 days respectively.

As of 29-Jan-2016, four cases of liver injury (Hy’s law cases with ALT or AST >3-times the upper limit of the 
normal range [ULN] and total bilirubin >2×ULN and alkaline phosphatase <2×ULN) were reported in patients 
treated with the experimental combination in Study A2301. Two of these four cases showed findings on 
biopsy suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. None of them was fatal or associated with hepatic failure with 
permanent disability. Liver function tests for all four patients recovered to normal levels 98-154 days 
following the discontinuation of therapy. A further three Hy’s law cases were reported in the broader 
development program. 
Events of hepatobiliary toxicity were reported most frequently in Cycles 2, 3, and 4, and overall were 
reported more frequently in the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment group than in the control arm.

In Study A2301, ‘QTc interval prolongation’ events (including ECG QT prolonged and syncope) occurred in 
7.5% of the patients in the experimental arm as compared to the control arm (2.4 %) with ECG QT prolonged 
being the most frequent AE  (4.5 %) reported followed by syncope (3 %). There were also single cases of 
loss of consciousness, sudden death and ventricular tachycardia reported. SAEs, discontinuations and dose 
adjustments/interruptions occurred in 4 %, 0.3 % and ~1 % respectively in the experimental arm.

Figure 15: Histogram of events of QTc prolongation by treatment and cycle 
Review of ECG data (average of triplicate) showed 1 patient (0.3%) had >500 msec post-baseline QTcF 
value, and 9 patients (2.7%) had a >60 msec increase from baseline in QTcF intervals. There were no 
reported cases of torsade de pointes. Dose interruptions/adjustments were reported in 0.9% of ribociclib plus 
letrozole-treated patients due to electrocardiogram QT prolonged and syncope. 
A central analysis of ECG data (average of triplicate) showed 11 patients (3.3%) and 1 patient (0.3%) with at 
least one >480 msec post-baseline QTcF for the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole 
arm respectively. Amongst the patients who had QTcF prolongation >480 msec, the median time to onset 
was 15 days and these changes were reversible with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. 
Pulmonary embolism (including all thromboembolic preferred terms) 
In Study A2301, thromboembolic events occurred in 9 patients (~3 %) in the combination arm compared 
with about 1 % in the control arm. All Grade 3/4 events (1 %) with ribociclib + letrozole pertained to 
pulmonary embolism. Dose adjustments/interruptions were required for 1 patient (0.3%) with pulmonary 
embolism in the ribociclib + letrozole arm. There were no treatment discontinuations.  
Renal toxicity 
Events of renal toxicity were reported in the main study in 28 patients [8 %] and 7 [2 %] in the experimental 
and control arm respectively. The main cause being elevated blood creatinine (7 %). The proportion of Grade 
3/4 was ~1 %, SAEs ~1% and the need of dose adjustments/interruptions ~1 %. None led to discontinuation 
in the experimental arm.  
Reproductive toxicity 
In Study A2301, mastitis and omphalitis occurred in one patient (0.3%) each in the ribociclib + letrozole 
group whereas four patients (1.2%) in the control arm experienced mastitis. There were no grade 3/4 AEs, 
dose adjustments/interruptions, SAEs, or discontinuations from ribociclib + letrozole due to reproductive 
toxicity events.  
Diarrhoea 
A slightly higher proportion of diarrhoea events were reported in the experimental arm as compared to the 
control arm (35 % and 22 % respectively). In 22 % in the experimental arm it was considered by the

investigator to be related to the study treatment. The vast majority were of Grade 1/2 with rather few Grade 
3/4 events (~1 %) and similar between the two arms.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Table 40: Overview of serious or clinically significant AEs - Studies A2301 and X2107 and the combination 
and monotherapy pools (Safety Set) 
In Study A2301, SAEs were reported in 21 % in the experimental arm compared to 12 % in the control arm. 
As regards Grade 3 and 4 events there were 13 % and 5 % in the former compared to 8 % and 0.6 % in the 
control arm.  
The SOCs in which SAEs were most frequently reported occurred (irrespective of causality and with an 
incidence of at least 1 %) were ‘GI disorders’ (5 %) followed by `blood disorders´(4 %) and  ‘infections’ (3 
% mainly pneumonia ~ 1%) in the experimental arm. The most frequently reported SAEs were the non-
haematological SAEs of abdominal pain and vomiting (each 1.5%), followed by constipation, dyspnoea, 
increased ALT, and nausea (each 1.2%), whereas the most frequently reported haematological SAEs were 
anaemia and febrile neutropenia (each 1.2%). In the control arm, pleural effusion (1.2%) was the most 
frequently reported SAE followed by nausea, spinal compression fracture, and vomiting (each 0.6%).

Table 41: Overview of deaths - Studies A2301 and X2107 and the combination and monotherapy pools 
(Safety Set) 
Overall deaths were reported for 23 patients (~ 7 %) in the experimental arm whereof 18 (~5 %) were 
attributed to underlying malignancy. Of the remaining five (1.5%) one was due to sudden death, cardiac 
arrest, acute respiratory failure, hepatic failure and death due to unknown reason.  
Three on-treatment deaths regardless of causality (≤ 30 days after last dose of study drug) were reported in 
the experimental arm (0.9 %) versus one in the control arm (0.3%). The Applicant has provided brief 
narratives for the three patients that died while on study. Causes of death on Kisqali plus letrozole included 
one case of each of the following: study indication, death (cause unknown) and sudden death (in the setting 
of grade 3 hypokalaemia and grade 2 QT prolongation).  
In the case of death due to unknown reason, ribociclib was permanently discontinued due to bone pain (D5). 
The patient died on D23 due to unknown reason and no autopsy was performed. This was deemed not 
attributable to the study treatment according to the investigator. The second case died due to sudden death 
on D39 of study treatment. This patient continued with methadone which was a prohibited concomitant 
medication due to potential of prolonging the QT interval. The last ECG was taken on D 29 that clearly 
showed a QT prolongation with worsening to Grade 2. No autopsy was performed. The investigator deemed it 
likely related to study drug. The third patient died due to progressive disease 11 days after last dose of study 
treatment (D177). 
A total of 19 patients (~ 6 %) in the control arm died with the vast majority due to disease progression (17 
patients [~ 5 %]).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 45: AEs leading to discontinuation by primary SOC and PT irrespective of causality (with an incidence of 
at least 1.0% in ‘All grades’ - combination therapy pool) - (Safety set) 
Dose reduction due to adverse events, regardless of causality, occurred in 44.6% of patients receiving Kisqali 
plus letrozole and in 3.0% of patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. Permanent discontinuation due to 
adverse events was reported in 7.5% of patients receiving Kisqali plus letrozole and 2.1% in patients 
receiving placebo plus letrozole. The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) leading to treatment 
discontinuation in patients receiving Kisqali plus letrozole were ALT increased (2.7%), AST increased (2.4%) 
and vomiting (1.5%) (see SmPC section 4.8). 
The AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported more frequently in the ribociclib plus letrozole 
group compared to the placebo plus letrozole group (15 % and 3 %, respectively [all grades]).  
The most commonly reported AEs in the experimental arm leading to discontinuation in the main study 
A2301 were ALT increased (4.5% with 2.7 % Grade 3 and 0.9 % Grade 4), AST increased (2.7% with 1.8 % 
Grade 3 and 0.3 % Grade 4), and vomiting (2.4% with 1.2 % Grade 3). 
Interruption, delays and dose reductions were frequently required in the experimental arm. The proportions 
of patients that did not require any of these measures amounted to 23 %, 43 % and 46 % respectively. Dose 
interruptions were mainly caused by neutropenia (39 %), decreased neutrophil count (12 %), vomiting (6 
%), nausea (5 %), increased ALT and increased AST (each 5 %). For dose reductions, most common cause 
was neutropenia (24 %) and decreased neutrophil count 8 %. 
Hospital resource utilization 
Overall, 113 patients were hospitalized during the course of study treatment: 64/334 (19.2%) patients in the 
ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 49/334 (14.7%) patients in the placebo plus letrozole arm; most of the 
hospitalizations were associated with utilization of the acute care facility (19.2% vs 14.4%, respectively). The 
median total duration of hospitalization stay was 6.0 days for both treatment arms.

Updated analysis of Study A2301 (data cut-off date of 22-Jun-2016) 
As of this new data cut-off date with an additional 5 months of follow up, the median duration of exposure in 
the ribociclib plus letrozole arm exceeded ~ 17 months, with 137 patients (41 %) exposed to combination 
therapy with ribociclib for ≥ 18 months. The median duration of exposure to ribociclib and letrozole increased 
from 12 and 13 months, respectively, in the original submission to 16 and ~ 17 months in this updated 
analysis.  
Disease progression remains the primary reason for treatment discontinuation from both treatment arms (33 
% in the the ribociclib plus letrozole arm as compared to 53 % in the control arm). Discontinuations 
attributable to AEs were 8 % and 2.4%, respectively, similar to those reported in the original submission (8 
% and 2 %).

AESIs in patients receiving treatment for >12 months 
Evaluation of the subgroup of patients who received treatment for a minimum of 12 months is based upon

treatment regimen (administered in combination with letrozole), and the 190 patients from the placebo plus 
letrozole control group.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety evaluation of Kisqali is based on data from 898 patients. Among these, a total of 568 
subjects had been exposed to ribociclib at the proposed dose i.e. 600 mg QD on Days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle 
(data cut-off date of 29 January 2016). 381 patients had received ribociclib in combination with letrozole at 
2.5 mg QD in the pivotal study A2301 (n=334) and the open-label, Phase Ib/II, dose-finding study X2107 
study (n=47). The safety data base is considered of an acceptable magnitude at least for identifying the 
safety profile of ribociclib in combination with letrozole in the short-term perspective.  
It is noted that about a third of the patients in the combination arm had a relative dose intensity for ribociclib 
of less than 70 % (34 % of the patients) and only 48 % achieved a relative dose intensity of > 90 %. The 
add-on of ribociclib to letrozole appears not to have a negative effect in upholding the dose intensity of the 
latter (mean and median of 99 % and 100 % respectively with 97 % of the patients achieving a relative dose 
intensity of > 90 %).  
Although the overall proportion of AE reports between the two arms in the A2301 study, was similar (99 % 
and 97 %) there were overall higher proportions of Grade 3 (66 %), Grade 4 (15 %), SAEs (21 %), AEs 
leading to discontinuation (15 %) and dose interruptions/ adjustments (73 %) reported in the ribociclib 
Assessment report

containing arm compared to the control arm (32 %; 1 %; 12 %; 3 %; 16 % respectively).  As expected the 
vast majority in the combination arm was suspected to be drug-related (96 %). The high rate of AEs that 
required dose interruptions and/or adjustments of ribociclib could be subject to concern but in comparison 
rather few patients discontinued study treatment due to AEs. Hence it is considered that the main tolerability 
issues are well managed with adequate monitoring and minimizing measures taken. Furthermore, a 
discontinuation rate of 15 % is considered acceptable as this is commonly observed in oncology studies.  
Management of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may require temporary dose 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Kisqali which are detailed in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The clinical 
judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual 
benefit/risk assessment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Overall deaths were similar between the two arms and the majority was due to progressive disease (23 
patients [~ 7 %] in the experimental arm whereof 18 (~5 %) were attributed to underlying malignancy 
versus 19 patients [~ 6 %] with 17 patients [~ 5 %] due to progressive disease).  
There was no major difference in hospitalizations between the two arms (19 % in the combination arm 
versus about 15 % in the control arm).  
Although neutropenic events occurred in a substantially higher proportion of patients in the experimental arm 
compared to the control (75 % vs. 5 %, respectively) including Grade 3/4 events with dose 
interruptions/adjustments required in more than 50 % of the patients, neutropenia appears to be well 
manageable with adequate monitoring and appropriate measures considering the low rate of discontinuations 
(0.9%), SAEs, and events of febrile neutropenia (1.5 %) into context. G-CSF was administered to 8 % of the 
patients in the ribociclib + letrozole arm (primarily filgrastim in 5 % patients) and 0.3% of patients in placebo 
+ letrozole group. Based on its severity, neutropenia was managed by laboratory monitoring, dose 
interruption and/or dose modification. The monitoring and risk minimisation measures (guidance on dose 
reduction/interruption/ discontinuation) as proposed in section 4.2 in the SmPC are considered adequate for a 
safe management of neutropenic events in the out-patient setting. Complete blood counts (CBC) should be 
performed before initiating treatment with Kisqali. After initiating treatment CBC should be monitored every 2 
weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each of the subsequent 4 cycles, then as clinically indicated. 
Patients should also be instructed to report any fever promptly (see SmPC section 4.4). Myelosuppression is 
also included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not considered to be of any major concern. Very few 
required erythropoetin treatment (four patients in total in studies A2301 and XUS03 whilst none in studies 
X2107, X2101, and X1101). Neither is there any concern in regard to the risk of bleeding associated with 
thrombocytopenia (one patient with epistaxis). Epistaxis is listed as an ADR in the SmPC. Review of data 
from the Clinical Database did not show an increased risk of hemorrhage (regardless of severity) secondary 
to thrombocytopenia in ribociclib-treated patients relative to the control arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 108/121 
  
  
The number of thromboembolic events as observed in the A2301 study may be considered within the 
expected range for a population of metastatic breast cancer already at risk and receiving concomitant 
endocrine therapy. Pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis including DVT are listed in section 4.8 of the 
letrozole SmPC. No conclusive link between ribociclib and thromboembolic events (VTE/PE) has been 
established and neither VTE nor PE is listed as ADRs. As these events are usually reported as serious, routine 
post marketing signal detection methods will be applied and any new signal will be followed up and 
subsequently reported in the PSURs.  
Rather limited proportion of events of renal toxicity was reported in the main study. The event of ‘blood 
creatinine increased’ has been identified as an ADR subsequently included in the SmPC, Section 4.8. There 
were however four reports of renal failure and three of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the combination arm as 
compared to one each of these items in the control arm. No evidence for a causal relationship with ribociclib 
could be established in regard to these cases according to the Applicant. Based on the available data on blood 
creatinine increases however, ‘renal toxicity’ is included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Safety and 
pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment has been included as missing information in the 
RMP. The Applicant will provide the results of study CLEE011A2116 which evaluates the pharmacokinetics 
and safety of ribociclib in patients with varying degrees of impaired renal function compared to matched 
healthy volunteers with normal renal function (see RMP). 
Diarrhoea appears to be manageable based on the fact that the vast majority were of Grade 1/2 with rather 
few Grade 3/4 events (~1 %) and similar rates were reported between the two arms. Moreover, the 
proportion of SAEs/ discontinuations/dose adjustment/interruptions due to diarrhoea does not evoke any 
major concern. There is no evidence of any cumulative toxicity.  
A high proportion of infectious events were reported in the experimental arm (50 %) but also fairly high in 
the control arm (42 %). The similarity in terms of individual causes between the two arms is recognised 
although slightly more viral infections in the experimental arms (e.g. influenza, herpes). This appears non-
problematic when considering that the vast majority were Grade 1/2, rather few SAEs and discontinuations. 
In regard to identified infectious ADRs, only urinary tract infections (UTI) are listed in Section 4.8. It is 
agreed that for specific individual reported infectious events other than UTI, the reported rates were too low 
to draw relevant conclusions as ADRs for ribociclib. Furthermore, only one event in study A2301 was 
classified as being an opportunistic infection (pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) in the experimental arm.  
Four cases of liver injury (Hy’s law cases) were reported in the experimental arm in the pivotal study albeit 
that none were fatal and liver function tests for all four patients recovered. Liver function tests should be 
performed before initiating treatment with Kisqali. After initiating treatment LFTs should be performed every 
2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each of the subsequent 4 cycles, then as clinically indicated. 
If grade ≥2 abnormalities are noted, more frequent monitoring is recommended (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.8). Based on the severity of the transaminase elevations, treatment with Kisqali may have to be 
interrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in the SmPC (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Recommendations 
for patients who have elevated AST/ALT grade ≥ 3 at baseline have not been established. Hepatobiliary 
toxicity is an important identified risk in the RMP. 
The risk QTc interval prolongation appeared to be highest primarily within the first cycle(s) of ribiciclib 
treatment to thereafter slowly subsiding. There is no evidence for cumulative toxicity. This could be 
interpreted as the risk minimisation measurements as proposed in the SmPC are adhered to by the treating 
physician and thus adequate. Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, treatment with 
Kisqali may have to be interrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in the SmPC (see sections 4.2, 4.8 
and 5.2).  QT interval is an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/506968/2017 
Page 109/121 
  
  
ECG should be assessed before initiating treatment. Treatment with Kisqali should be initiated only in 
patients with QTcF values less than 450 msec. ECG should be repeated at approximately day 14 of the first 
cycle and at the beginning of the second cycle, then as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
should be performed before initiating treatment, at the beginning of the first 6 cycles and then as clinically 
indicated. Any abnormality should be corrected before initiating treatment with Kisqali. The use of Kisqali 
should be avoided in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation. 
This includes patients: with long QT syndrome; with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including 
recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina and bradyarrhythmias;  with 
electrolyte abnormalities. 
The use of Kisqali with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors 
should be avoided as this may lead to clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTcF interval (see sections 
4.2, 4.5 and 5.1). If treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose should be reduced 
to 400 mg once daily (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). QT prolongation has been included as an important 
identified risk in the RMP. 
From the safety update with a data cut-off date of 26 June 2016 (i.e. an additional 5 months), the safety 
profile and tolerability of ribociclib appears to remain consistent with the previous profile identified. There 
was no evidence of any cumulative toxicity and no new concerns have been evoked in regard to 
discontinuation or fatal cases. Overall, no new safety concerns or tolerability issues have been raised based 
on this update. The ribociclib associated toxicity appears manageable with the proposed risk minimization as 
laid out in the proposed SmPC.   
In regard to gender and race, no conclusion can be drawn as only females were eligible in the A2301 study 
and the study population were in the vast majority Caucasian. Therefore, safety in male patients with breast 
cancer and safety in Japanese patients are included in the RMP as missing information. In terms of age 
groups, there was no major concern identified. Of interest is that there appears not to be any obvious 
differences in AE events by age group in terms of cardiac disorders, vascular disorders or infections/ 
infestations.  
There are limited long term data with the use of ribociclib. Therefore long-term use has been included as 
missing information in the RMP. The Applicant continues to follow all surviving patients in the ongoing 
CLEE011A2301 study and safety data is being collected on an ongoing basis (see RMP). In addition, there are 
currently two large pivotal studies ongoing (CLEE011E2301 [MONALEESA-7] and CLEE011F2301 
[MONALEESA-3]) which are still blinded. Patients are expected to be on-treatment on average for 13 months. 
In these studies ~ 1300 patients have been enrolled and randomized, with ~ 800 patients exposed to 
ribociclib; these study populations are similar to that of Study CLEE011A2301. Both phase 3 studies are 
expected to provide significant amount of safety data contributing to the safety profile of ribociclib (see RMP).  
Safety data from two other ongoing studies (study CLEE011XDE01 (RIBECCA) and Study CLEE011A2404 
(CompLEEment-1) will be provided as part of the PSURs. 
The safety and efficacy of Kisqali in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
There were no known cases of overdosage with ribociclib. In the event of an overdose, symptoms such as 
nausea and vomiting may occur. In addition, haematological (e.g. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) toxicity 
and possible QTc prolongation may occur. General supportive care should be initiated in all cases of 
overdosage as necessary (see SmPC section 4.9).

Kisqali may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be 
cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue during treatment with Kisqali (see 
section 4.8). 
Kisqali contains soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya should not take Kisqali (see 
SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.4).Kisqali is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to 
peanut, soya or any of the excipients listed in SmPC section 6.1. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The combination of ribociclib and letrozole is associated with a substantial increase in toxicity relative to 
letrozole, particularly in terms of myelosuppression (neutropenia). This is consistent with the safety profile of 
other products within the same class (e.g. palbociclib). 
Therefore, the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in considered acceptable and appears manageable with the 
proposed risk minimization activities as laid out in the proposed SmPC.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 13.03.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of ribociclib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ribociclib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kisqali (ribociclib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication is for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients derive benefit mainly from systemic treatments. For 
the targeted population, a variety of endocrine therapies such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, 
fulvestrant and tamoxifen are valid 1st line options. TTP/PFS in the range of 5- 15 (20) months is typical in 
endocrine therapy trials in the postmenopausal population (Kümler ESMO Open 2016). Prolonging overall 
survival is an unmet need in the targeted population. The first in class CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib was 
recently approved for an indication including that presently sought for ribociclib (EPAR Ibrance). 
According to treatment guidelines, chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease 
or proven endocrine resistance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal trial CLEE011A2301 was an international, multi-centre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled Phase III study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ribociclib (600 mg once 
daily, days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle) plus letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) or placebo (once daily, days 1-21 in a 
28-day cycle) plus letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Randomization was stratified by the presence of liver and/or 
lung metastases (yes versus no). Patients received study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason. Treatment crossover from 
placebo to ribociclib was not permitted in this study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal trial CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 showed a PFS benefit of combined ribociclib and letrozole 
compared to letrozole of 9 months where the median PFS for the ribociclib and letrozole combination was 25 
months whereas, the median PFS for letrozole was 16 months with a HR 0.568 (0.457 – 0.704). OS data was 
immature with 17 % events revealed a trend towards benefit for ribociclib. The median for the experimental 
arm was not reached, the median for the control arm was 33 months, and the HR 0.746 (0.517 – 1.078). 
ORR was 42.5 % and 28.7 % in the combination arm and letrozole arm respectively. 
A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in favour of the ribociclib plus letrozole arm was also 
observed in all individual patient subgroups of age, race, prior adjuvant or neo adjuvant chemotherapy or 
hormonal therapies, liver and/or lung involvement and bone only metastatic disease. For patients with liver 
and/or lung metastases median progression free survival [mPFS] was 24.8 months for ribociclib plus letrozole 
versus 13.4 months for letrozole alone (HR of 0.561 [95% CI: 0.424, 0.743]). For patients without liver 
and/or lung metastases mPFS was 27.6 months versus 18.2 months respectively (HR of 0.597 [95% CI: 
0.426, 0.837].

Preclinical data indicate heterogeneity in sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 
there was no compelling evidence of differential effects in subgroups defined by Cyclin D1, RB or P16 mRNA 
or protein expression. As the investigated biomarkers may be more relevant for ER negative breast cancer 
cells, the possibility that there is a group of patients with distinct molecular signature and tumour 
characteristics that would benefit the most from this therapy should be further investigated. The results from 
the biomarker assessment in study CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2 will be submitted together with the CSR 
(see RMP). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy and safety of ribociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There were overall higher proportions of Grade 3 (66 %), Grade 4 (15 %), SAEs (21 %), AEs leading to 
discontinuation (15 %) and dose interruptions/ adjustments (73 %) reported in the ribociclib containing arm 
compared to the control arm (corresponding rates: 32 %; 1 %; 12 %; 3 %; 16 % respectively). The 
discontinuations due to AEs (at least within the range often observed and accepted in oncology studies [15 
%]) and likewise, the proportion of deaths (7 %, primarily due to progressive disease and not AE related) in 
the combination arm in study A2301 were fairly low. In addition, there was no major difference in 
hospitalizations (due to any cause) between the two arms (19 % in the combination arm versus about 15 % 
in the control arm).  
The most common adverse reactions for ribociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, headache, back pain, 
nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia. The most common grade 3/4 ADRs were rash 
and neutropenia, leukopenia, abnormal liver function test, lymphopenia, hypophosphataemia, vomiting, 
nausea, fatigue and back pain. 
In terms of anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, reproductive toxicity and pulmonary embolism none of 
them appears be of major concern.  Although, neutropenia is frequently reported, it appears manageable 
with adequate monitoring and appropriate minimisation measures (febrile neutropenia and sepsis were 
reported in a low proportion [1.5 % and ~ 1 % respectively]). In addition, in regard to nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea and infections it is believed that also these risks can be appropriately handled in clinical practice.  
It appears that renal toxicity was reported in the pivotal study (mainly ‘blood creatinine increased’ which has 
been identified as an ADR and subsequently included in the SmPC, Section 4.8). There were however four 
reports of renal failure and three of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the combination arm as compared to one 
each of these items in the control arm. Thus, renal toxicity is included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP.  
Hepatobiliary toxicity is supported by non-clinical observations. The precise aetiology has not been elucidated 
but available evidence suggests an underlying immune mechanism triggering the hepatic effects (possibly 
through the formation of protein adducts). Thus, hepatobiliary toxicity is included as an important identified 
risk in the RMP. 
In Study A2301, ‘QTc interval prolongation’ events occurred more frequently in the combination arm 
compared to the letrozole arm with ECG QT prolonged being the most frequent AE  (4.5 %) reported followed 
by syncope (3 %). It is recognised that the risk QTc interval prolongation appear to be highest primarily

within the first cycle(s) of ribociclib treatment to thereafter slowly subsiding. This could be a consequence of 
better patient management and implementation of the risk minimisation measurements as proposed in the 
SmPC by the treating physician as a function of time spent on treatment. Thus, QT prolongation is included 
as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data is lacking but is addressed in the safety specification as missing information. Studies 
CLEE011A2301,CLEE011E2301 [MONALEESA-7] and CLEE011F2301 [MONALEESA-3]) will provide significant 
amount of safety data contributing to the safety profile of ribociclib (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The current guidelines recommend endocrine therapy as a first choice of therapy in HR positive, HER2 
negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. TTP/PFS in the range of 5- 15 (20) months is typical in 
endocrine therapy trials in the postmenopausal population (Kümler ESMO Open 2016). The apparent 
acceptance for using combination therapy instead of endocrine-therapy in monotherapy is understood as a 
consequence of the benign tolerability profile of CDK 4/6 inhibitors, further underscored by the clinical 
acceptance of palbociclib as add-on to an aromatase inhibitor in ER positive/HER-2 negative advanced breast 
cancer (Cardoso Ann Oncol 2016). The efficacy presented in the pivotal trial showed a PFS gain of 9 months

for the combination therapy of ribociclib with letrozole compared to letrozole alone. This magnitude of the 
effect is considered clinically relevant.  A delay in disease progression is further supported by a trend towards 
OS benefit and postponement of 1st and 2nd subsequent lines of therapy. 
The combination of ribociclib to letrozole is associated with an increase in toxicity relative to letrozole alone. 
The most common ADR is myelosuppression (neutropenia). This is however not regarded as a major concern 
since it is manageable with the measures proposed in the SmPC. The safety risks observed in the pivotal trial 
are similar to those that are expected from the class of CDK4/6 inhibitors. There is also no evidence of any 
cumulative toxicity. Therefore, the safety of ribociclib appears acceptable and manageable with the proposed 
risk minimization as laid out in the proposed SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant effect in PFS has been demonstrated for the combination therapy of ribociclib with 
letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine based 
therapy. The OS findings are still immature with 15% and 20% events in the experimental and control arms, 
but with a reassuring trend towards benefit for the ribociclib arm. Accordingly, there is no evidence of an 
accelerated resistance or progression in ribociclib-treated patients that have received subsequent therapies; 
neither does time to 1st and 2nd subsequent line of therapy indicate such an effect.  
The safety of ribociclib in the short term is considered acceptable and fairly well characterised. The additional 
5 months of safety update not revealed no new safety concerns or tolerability issues. The ribociclib 
associated toxicity appears manageable and the measures and risk minimizations as proposed in Section 4.2 
of the SmPC are considered appropriate. 
Based on the above the benefit/risk balance of ribociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine based therapy is 
considered positive. 
The indication has included the class of “aromatase inhibitors” instead of “letrozole” since it is reasonable to 
extrapolate from letrozole to aromatase inhibitors based on the similarity of the mechanism of action of 
aromatase inhibitors in general, where inhibiting the aromatase enzyme will block the conversion of 
androgens to oestrogens. There are no DDI/PK issues between exemestane or anastrozole and ribociclib that 
preclude the extrapolation (See PK section). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal 
women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine based therapy is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Kisqali is favourable in the following indication: 
Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine based therapy.

1.  Introduction 
On Feb 18th, 2020 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Alprolix (Eftrenonacog alfa/ 
BIIB029) in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUP) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study 998HB303 (PUPs B) “An  Open-Label,  Multicenter  Evaluation  of  the 
Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Coagulation Factor IX Fc Fusion Protein (rFIXFc; BIIB029) in the 
Prevention and Treatment of Bleeding in Previously Untreated Patients With Severe Hemophilia B” is 
are part of a clinical development program.  
As per the “Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor IX 
products” (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 Rev. 1; currently under revision), a minimum of 20 
previously untreated patients (PUPs) need to be evaluated for efficacy and safety during at least 50 
exposure days connected with a post-approval commitment to follow-up at least 20-40 PUPs (20 from 
efficacy/safety trial and 20 new) for a minimum of 100 ED. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) is a long-acting, fully recombinant coagulation factor 
IX Fc fusion protein consisting of human coagulation factor IX (FIX) covalently linked to the Fc domain 
of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The rFIXFc molecule is heterodimeric with a FIXFc single chain 
(FIXFc-sc, 641 amino acids) and an Fc single chain (Fc-sc, 226 amino acids) bound together through 2 
disulfide bonds in the hinge region of Fc. rFIXFc requires the FIXFc-sc and Fc-sc protein subunits to 
assemble within a transfected cell line to form the final protein product. The molecular weight of rFIXFc 
is approximately 98 kDa. 
The fusion of Fc to human FIX utilized a proven approach for increasing the elimination half-life of 
therapeutic proteins, including several approved drugs [Jazayeri and Carroll 2012; Wu and Sun 2014]. 
While the FIX moiety of rFIXFc retains FIX coagulation activity, the Fc component of rFIXFc binds with 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is expressed on many adult cell types. The Fc domain is responsible 
for the long circulating elimination half-life of IgG1 through interaction with the FcRn [Roopenian and 
Akilesh 2007]. The same naturally occurring pathway similarly delays lysosomal degradation of 
immunoglobulins by recycling the protein back into circulation, and is responsible for their long plasma 
half-life. rFIXFc was developed to have a longer half-life while maintaining the activity profile of FIX as 
a treatment for hemophilia B.  
rFIXFc was approved in the EU on 12 May, 2016, for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
subjects with hemophilia B. The product is also approved in e.g. the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and 
Switzerland.  
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 3/37 
 
  
 
 
 
The original marketing authorization application for rFIXFc was based on 1 phase 1/2a dose-escalation 
study (SYN-FIXFc-07-001) and 2 pivotal phase 3 studies (9HB02PED and 998HB102). Additional 
studies have been performed (see “Annex - Line Listings” at the end of this report). 
Two different formulations of rFIXFc drug product (DP) were used in clinical studies. A frozen liquid 
formulation was used in the Phase 1/2a study (SYN-FIXFc-07-001), and a lyophilized formulation was 
used in all subsequent clinical studies including the present study 998HB303. 
In Study 998HB303 rFIXFc was supplied in a kit that contained several components: a vial of 
lyophilized drug, a prefilled diluent syringe, a vial adapter, and a winged infusion set. The lyophilized 
powder was in a clear glass vial containing 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 IU of rFIXFc (nominal strengths). 
The drug product was reconstituted with a prefilled diluent syringe containing 5 mL of 0.325% sodium 
chloride. The formulation of the lyophilized drug product contained rFIXFc, L-histidine, sucrose, 
mannitol, polysorbate 20, and sodium chloride. The formulation was the same for all 4 strengths (250, 
500, 1000, or 2000 IU of rFIXFc).

Description 
Study 998HB303 was a phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of rFIXFc in male pediatric PUPs with severe hemophilia B, when used according to local 
standard of care for implementation of a prophylaxis regimen, including an optional preceding episodic 
(on-demand) treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of 
rFIXFc in PUPs with severe hemophilia B. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of 
rFIXFc in the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs, as well as to evaluate rFIXFc 
consumption for prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs.

Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the safety of rFIXFc in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe hemophilia B. 
Secondary Objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs. 
To evaluate rFIXFc consumption for prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs. 
Exploratory Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of rFIXFc on patient-reported health outcomes. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of rFIXFc in 
pediatric PUPs with severe hemophilia B when used according to local standard of care. For the 
purpose of this study, a PUP was defined as a subject who had not had prior exposure to FIX 
concentrates, except for up to 3 injections of commercially available rFIXFc before the confirmation of 
eligibility and less than 28 days prior to the first Screening Visit. Following the confirmation of 
eligibility, administration of commercially available rFIXFc was no longer allowed and only rFIXFc 
labelled for study use was to be administered. 
Subjects with a documented plasma FIX activity of ≤2% could be enrolled on the basis of local 
laboratory results and could receive study drug after samples for FIX activity level and inhibitors had 
been obtained for testing at the central laboratory. However, any such subject was to be withdrawn if 
the central laboratory screening results indicated FIX activity level >2% or a positive inhibitor. 
Baseline incremental recovery (IR) assessments were to be performed as soon as practicable once all 
eligibility criteria had been met and the subject was enrolled. The Baseline IR Visit activities could be 
completed on the same day as Screening, or they could be completed as a part of a separate visit or 
at an unscheduled visit. 
Following the confirmation of eligibility, the Investigator had the option to treat eligible subjects 
episodically (on-demand) prior to initiating a prophylactic regimen. The duration of episodic 
treatment was at the Investigator’s discretion, in accordance with local standard of care. At least 20 
PUPs were planned to complete the study after reaching at least 50 EDs with rFIXFc. One ED was 
defined as a 24-hour period in which a subject received 1 or more doses of rFIXFc, with the time of 
the first injection of rFIXFc defined as the start of the ED. 
Surgery was allowed during the study. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rFIXFc was allowed during the study for those subjects 
developing, after exposure to rFIXFc study drug, a positive low titer inhibitor (≥0.60 and <5.00 
Bethesda unit [BU]/mL) with bleeding episodes that could not be adequately treated with rFIXFc, or a 
positive high titer inhibitor (≥5.00 BU/mL).

Because of the risk of allergic reactions with FIX concentrates, the first administration of rFIXFc 
(commercially available rFIXFc and/or study drug) was performed under medical observation where 
proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. The first injection of rFIXFc study drug 
after the Screening Visit was administered by the Investigator or a qualified delegate. Thereafter, 
study drug could be administered by a parent/caregiver, a qualified medical professional under the 
direction of the Investigator, self-administered by older children, or given at the clinic. Study 
treatment could also be injected in the hospital, for example, during surgery or during hospitalization 
due to major bleeding. 
Figure 1: Study design 
Study population/ Sample size 
Because the size of the hemophilia population is limited, the sample size is based on clinical rather 
than statistical considerations. Taking into account the CHMP Guideline and in an effort to enrol a 
sufficient number of subjects to assess the efficacy and safety of rFIXFc in this population of primarily 
very young children, approximately 30 subjects enrolled to achieve at least 20 subjects with no less 
than 50 EDs by the completion of the study. 
Inclusion Criteria:  
To be eligible to participate in this study, candidates were required to meet the following eligibility 
criteria at the time of Screening or at the timepoint specified in the individual eligibility criterion 
listed:  
•  Ability of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative (e.g. their parent or 
legal guardian) to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated 
informed consent and authorization to use confidential health information, and/or to provide 
assent, in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations. 
•  Male, age <18 years at the time of informed consent. 
•  Weight ≥3.5 kg. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 6/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  Severe hemophilia B defined as ≤2 IU/dL (≤2%) endogenous FIX documented in the medical 
record or as tested during the Screening Period. Enrolled subjects whose central laboratory 
screening results indicated a baseline FIX activity level >2% of normal were withdrawn. 
Exclusion Criteria:  
Candidates were excluded from study entry if any of the following exclusion criteria existed at 
Screening or at the timepoint specified in the individual criterion listed. 
•  History  of  positive  inhibitor  testing.  A  prior  history  of  inhibitors  was  defined  based  on  a 
patient’s  historical  positive  inhibitor  test  using  the  local  laboratory  Bethesda  value  for  a 
positive inhibitor test (i.e. equal to or above lower level of detection). 
•  History of hypersensitivity reactions associated with any rFIXFc administration. 
•  Exposure to blood components or injection with a FIX concentrate (including plasma 
derived) other than rFIXFc. 
• 
Injection with commercially available rFIXFc more than 28 days prior to Screening. 
•  More than 3 injections of commercially available rFIXFc prior to confirmation of eligibility. 
•  Other coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia B. 
•  Any concurrent clinically significant major disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would have made the subject unsuitable for enrollment (e.g. HIV infection with cluster of 
differentiation 4 [CD4] lymphocyte count <200 cells/μL or a viral load >200 particles/μL, or 
any other known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency). 
•  Current systemic treatment with chemotherapy and/or other immunosuppressant drugs. Use 
of steroids for treatment of asthma or management of acute allergic episodes or otherwise 
life-threatening episodes was allowed. Treatment in these circumstances should not have 
exceeded a 14-day duration. 
•  Participation within the past 30 days in any other clinical study involving investigational 
treatment. 
•  Current enrollment in any other clinical study involving investigational treatment. 
• 
Inability to comply with study requirements. 
•  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Bioverativ, would have 
made the subject unsuitable for enrollment. 
Treatments 
Dose selection: 
The recommended starting prophylactic dose of rFIXFc in this study, approximately 50 IU/kg weekly, 
was based on the data from the Phase 1/2a and Phase 3 studies (including pediatric PK data from 
subjects <12 years of age) and knowledge of increased clearance of factor concentrates in children. 
This dose was predicted to maintain trough levels >1% in 99% of pediatric subjects. Adjustments to 
the dose and interval of rFIXFc could have been made in this study based on available PK data, 
subsequent FIX activity levels, level of physical activity, and bleeding pattern, in accordance with local 
standards of care for a prophylactic regimen. The dose for treatment of bleeding episodes targeted 
peak plasma FIX activity of approximately 30% to 100%, in accordance local standards and taking into 
account lower rFIXFc recoveries observed in young children. If a subject required surgery while 
participating in this study, the subject could be treated with the dose and regimen of rFIXFc deemed 
appropriate for the type of surgery. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 7/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Dosing procedure: 
For the Baseline incremental recovery (IR) measurement, a dose of 50 IU/kg was given in the clinic as 
an IV injection. The actual potency (= true potency of the vial as measured by a validated potency 
assay; between approx. 80% and 125% of nominal strength) of rFIXFc was used to calculate the units 
and volume of rFIXFc infused for the Baseline IR Visit dose. 
rFIXFc was delivered via a slow push IV injection over several minutes at a rate of administration 
determined by the subject’s comfort level. Any missed doses were taken as soon as possible or 
according to the instructions of the Investigator. 
Episodic (optional) and prophylactic treatment regimens: 
Following confirmation of eligibility and enrolment, the Investigator had the option to treat the subject 
with an episodic regimen for a period of time before initiating a prophylaxis regimen. 
The duration of the episodic period was at the Investigator’s discretion, in accordance with local 
standard of care. However, given global standards of care, it was expected that the prophylactic 
regimen would be initiated prior to or immediately following a third episode of hemarthrosis. 
Subjects generally began a prophylactic regimen after confirmation of eligibility, prior to or 
immediately following the occurrence of a third hemarthrosis (joint bleed). The recommended initial 
prophylactic regimen is 50 IU/kg weekly. Adjustments to the dose and dosing interval could be made 
based upon available incremental recovery data, subsequent FIX activity levels, level of physical 
activity, and bleeding pattern, in accordance with local standards of care for a prophylactic regimen. 
The subject’s parents/caregivers were instructed to treat at the first sign of a bleeding episode 
with a single dose of rFIXFc. The dose of rFIXFc to treat the bleeding episode will be based on the 
subject’s clinical condition, known PK information, type and severity of the bleeding event and input 
from the Medical Monitor, if necessary. 
Duration of Treatment and Follow-Up: 
Treatment Period: The study consisted of screening, treatment, and follow-up periods. The duration of 
individual subject study participation was approximately 6 months to 3 years, including screening and 
follow-up. Each subject was considered to have completed their treatment period once they reached at 
least 50 EDs to the study treatment, unless withdrawal from the study occurred, or the end of study 
(EOS) was declared. The EOS occurred after at least 20 subjects reached at least 50 EDs with rFIXFc. 
Once this milestone had been achieved, all ongoing study subjects were to return to the study center 
for the ET/EOS Visit assessments. 
Follow-Up Period: Subjects underwent the assessments of the Early Termination (ET)/End of Study 
(EOS) Visit after at least 50 EDs to rFIXFc had been achieved, if they had withdrawn from the study, or 
the end of study was declared. A Final Safety Follow-up Visit/Telephone Call was conducted 14 (+7) 
days after the last dose of rFIXFc to assess the subject’s status for AEs, SAEs, and concomitant 
treatments and procedures. It was at the discretion of the Investigator to conduct the Final Safety 
Follow-up Visit by telephone or in person.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of inhibitor development. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints of the study were: 
•  The annualized number of bleeding episodes1) (spontaneous and traumatic) per subject. 
•  The annualized number of spontaneous joint bleeding episodes per subject. 
•  Assessments of response to treatment with rFIXFc for bleeding episodes, using the 4-point 
bleeding response scale2) (Investigator assessment for bleeding episodes treated in the 
clinic; parent or caregiver assessment for all other bleeding episodes). 
•  The total number of EDs per subject per year. 
•  Total annualized rFIXFc consumption per subject for the prevention and treatment of 
bleeding episodes. 
•  The number of injections and dose per injection of rFIXFc required to resolve a bleeding 
episode. 
• 
rFIXFc incremental recovery. 
1) In this study, a bleeding episode was defined as follows: A bleeding episode started from the first 
sign of a bleeding episode and ended no more than 72 hours after the last injection to treat the 
bleeding episode, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, injections less than or 
equal to 72 hours apart, were considered the same bleeding episode. Any injection to treat the 
bleeding episode, taken more than 72 hours after the preceding one, was considered the first 
injection to treat a new bleeding episode in the same location. Any bleeding at a different location 
was considered a separate bleeding episode, regardless of the time from the last injection. 
Bleeding episodes were classified as spontaneous if a parent/caregiver recorded a bleeding event when 
there was no known contributing factor such as a definite trauma or antecedent “strenuous” activity. 
The determination of “strenuous” was at the discretion of the Investigator, and the 
parent/caregiver/subject needed to be instructed by the Investigator. 
Bleeding episodes were classified as traumatic if the parent/caregiver recorded a bleeding episode 
even when there was a known or believed reason for the bleed. For example, when a subject 
exercised strenuously and then had a bleeding episode in the absence of any obvious injury, the 
bleeding episode was still recorded as traumatic. Target joint bleeding episodes were considered 
traumatic if a known action led to bleeding into the joint. The Investigator considered whether events 
resulting in a traumatic bleeding episode qualified as AEs and should be reported as such. 
2) Each subject or their parent/caregiver will rate the treatment response to any bleeding episode, 
using the following 4-point scale (excellent, good, moderate, or none). This assessment is to be made 
approximately 8 to 12 hours from the time the injection was given to treat the bleeding episode and 
prior to any additional doses of rFIXFc given for the same bleeding episode. 
•  Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 
hours after the initial injection 
•  Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 
hours after an injection, but possibly requiring more than 1 injection after 24 to 48 hours for 
complete resolution 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 9/37 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Moderate: probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the initial 
injection and requires more than 1 injection 
•  None: no improvement, or condition worsens within approximately 8 hours after the initial 
injection 
Investigators recorded assessments of each subject’s response to their assigned rFIXFc regimen using 
the following 4-point scale: 
•  Excellent: bleeding episodes responded to ≤ the usual number of injections or ≤ the usual 
dose of rFIXFc, or the rate of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis was ≤ that usually 
observed. 
•  Effective: most bleeding episodes responded to the same number of injections and dose, 
but some required more injections or higher doses, or there was a minor increase in the 
rate of breakthrough bleeding. 
•  Partially Effective: bleeding episodes most often required more injections and/or higher 
doses than expected, or adequate breakthrough bleeding prevention during prophylaxis 
required more frequent injections and/or higher doses. 
• 
Ineffective: routine failure to control hemostasis or hemostatic control required additional 
agents. 
Investigators considered the following, when available, while making the assessment: 
•  Frequency of rFIXFc injections. 
•  Response to rFIXFc injection. 
• 
Information reported in the EPD by the subject’s parent/caregiver. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
The exploratory endpoints included, but were not limited to, health outcomes as captured via a patient 
reported questionnaire. This questionnaire asked about the impact of hemophilia and treatment on 
work, school, and caregiver. 
Questions were asked at 24-week intervals and the categories questioned were as follows: 
•  How many times the child’s injection was administered by different persons 
•  Was work missed due to the child’s hemophilia 
•  Was school missed by the child due to his hemophilia 
•  Was the caregiver’s social/leisure time disrupted due to the child’s hemophilia 
•  Was household/domestic routine disrupted due to the child’s hemophilia 
Assessments of patient-reported health outcomes related to hemophilia included the following: 
•  Number of hemophilia-related hospitalizations, excluding planned hospitalizations 
documented at Screening 
•  Number of hemophilia-related hospitalization days 
•  Number of hemophilia-related emergency room visits 
•  Number of hemophilia-related physician visits excluding study visits 
•  Number of days off school or day care (kindergarten) 
•  Number of days off work for parent/legal guardian or caregiver (demographic data for 
caregivers could be collected at the Screening Visit) 
•  Primary method of administering rFIXFc

Clinical Safety Assessments 
• 
Physical examination 
•  Medical and surgical history 
•  Height 
•  Weight 
•  Vital signs measurements (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) 
•  Concomitant therapy and procedures recording, including concomitant medications taken by 
the mother of any subject who was receiving breast milk, unless the breast milk was derived 
from a source other than the mother or the mother did not consent. 
•  AE and SAE recording 
Laboratory Safety Assessments 
•  Hematology: white blood cell (WBC) count and differential, red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, and platelet count 
•  Blood chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, total protein, total bilirubin, gamma glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and glucose 
•  Urinalysis 
•  Anti-rFIXFc antibodies (detection, titer, and specificity) 
•  Neutralizing antibody development (inhibitor) measured by Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay 
(see below) 
Subjects were tested for inhibitor and anti-rFIXFc antibody formation at each clinic visit. Samples for 
anti-rFIXFc antibody testing were collected at the same timepoint when any samples were collected for 
inhibitor testing, including confirmatory and unscheduled inhibitor tests, tests for suspected inhibitor 
development, and as required before and after surgery. Washout prior to sample collection for inhibitor 
testing was at least 72 hours.  
If inhibitor development was suspected at any time during the study (eg, the expected plasma FIX 
activity levels were not attained or if bleeding was not controlled with an expected dose), the subject 
was tested for inhibitors by the central laboratory. 
A positive inhibitor test result is defined as an inhibitor test result of ≥0.60 BU/mL that is 
confirmed by a second test result of ≥0.60 BU/mL from a separate sample, drawn 2 to 4 weeks 
following the original sample. Both tests were performed by the central laboratory using the 
Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay. 
A low titer inhibitor is defined as a positive inhibitor test with a result of ≥0.60 and <5.00 BU/mL. A 
high titer inhibitor is defined as ≥5.00 BU/mL. Subjects with discrepant inhibitor test results (initial low 
titer result followed by high titer result or initial high titer result followed by low titer result) had repeat 
inhibitor testing performed by the central laboratory from a separate sample, drawn 2 to 4 weeks 
following the previous sample. If 2 of 3 test results were <5.00 BU/mL, the inhibitor was considered 
low titer. If 2 of 3 test results were ≥5.00 BU/mL, the inhibitor was considered high titer.

Statistical Methods 
This is an open-label single arm study so there is no blinding or randomization. 
Continuous variables are summarized and presented by number, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum, and, where appropriate, with the 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical 
variables are summarized by the number and percentage in each category.  
There is no statistical hypothesis for this study as all but the primary endpoint (inhibitor development) 
will be analysed descriptively only. Any patient who develops an inhibitor following the initial rFIXFc 
administration will be included in the numerator. All patients who have received at least 1 dose of 
rFIXFc will be included in the denominator. An exact 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
patients with a positive inhibitor will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method for a binomial 
proportion. 
Analysis populations: 
The All-Enrolled Analysis Set (n=33) was defined as all subjects who were enrolled in the study, 
whether dosed with rFIXFc or not. 
The Full Analysis Set, FAS (n=33) was defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of study rFIXFc. All analyses and summaries of efficacy and exploratory endpoints were based on the 
FAS, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Analysis Set (n=33) was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
rFIXFc. All analyses and summaries of safety, demographic, and baseline characteristics were based on 
the Safety Analysis Set, unless otherwise specified. 
The Surgery Subgroup was defined as all subjects who underwent major surgery after first dose of 
study drug. 
Subjects who developed a positive inhibitor after exposure to rFIXFc were included in the Inhibitor 
Subgroup. 
The ITI Subgroup was defined as all patients who consented to and initiated the ITI treatment 
regimen.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 38 subjects were screened for eligibility, 5 subjects were screen failure and a total of 33 
male subjects were enrolled and received study treatment at 24 investigational sites in 11 countries 
worldwide.  
The highest-enrolling countries were the US (11 subjects), the UK (5 subjects), Ireland, Poland, and 
France (3 subjects, each). Italy and Sweden enrolled 2 subjects each; Australia, Denmark, 
Netherlands, and New Zealand enrolled 1 subject each. The sites with the highest enrolment were 
site 906 in the UK (3 subjects), sites 122 and 301 in the US (2 subjects) each. 
The All-Enrolled Analysis Set had a total of 33 subjects and the Safety Analysis Set (subjects 
who had received at least 1 dose of study treatment as of the data cutoff date) had a total of 33 
subjects: 22 subjects began study participation on the episodic treatment regimen and 11 subjects 
began study participation on the prophylactic treatment regimen. Of the 22 subjects who began the 
study on the episodic treatment regimen, 17 subjects switched from episodic to prophylactic 
treatment, for a total of 28 subjects who were ever on the prophylactic treatment regimen. 
Figure 2: disposition of subjects 
Twenty seven of the 33 enrolled subjects (81.8%) had completed study participation, 6 subjects 
(18.2%) had terminated study participation early. 
•  2 subjects enrolled under minimum eligibility criteria but did not meet the full eligibility 
criteria due to excluded prior medication or disqualifying laboratory result ( Baseline FIX 
activity level ≥2%). 
•  2 subjects terminated early as they withdrew consent. 
•  1 subject withdrew from the study due to TESAEs of hypersensitivity and Factor IX inhibition 
that were considered related to the study treatment. 
•  1 subject terminated early due to “physician decision” to close the site.

The last prescribed dosing frequency for each subject was twice weekly (1 subject), every 5 days (1 
subject), every 7 days (23 subjects), every 14 days (2 subjects) and on-demand (1 subject). 
One subject in the prophylactic group (3.0%) developed inhibitor overall. This subject developed low-
titer inhibitor C/M. 
Key visits were those in which inhibitor tests were performed. Most subjects completed the Week 12 
visit (31, 93.9%), Week 24 visit (29, 87.9%), Week 36 visit (29, 87.9%), Week 48 visit (28, 84.8%), 
Week 60 visit (24, 72.7%), Week 72 visit (19, 57.6%), and approximately half of all subjects (16, 
48.5%) achieved Week 84 visit. Approximately half of the subjects (17, 51.5%) completed the 10-ED 
inhibitor test visit, 15 subjects (45.5%) completed the 20-ED inhibitor test visit, and 14 subjects 
(42.4%) completed the 50-ED inhibitor test visit. 
Table 2: disposition by treatment regimen 
Baseline data 
All subjects who received treatment with rFIXFc had been determined to have severe hemophilia B 
defined as ≤2 IU/dL (≤2%) endogenous FIX. The summary of medical and surgical history by 
treatment regimen was typical for this population. All subjects were male, with an overall median age 
of 0.60 (range 0.08 years to 2 years of age). Most subjects (26, 78.8%) were <1 year of age. Median 
height was 71.60 cm (range 55 to 91 cm), and median weight was 9 kg (range 4.6 to 17 kg).

Of the 33 subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, 22 (66.7%) were White, 1 
subject (3.0%) each were Asian and Black or African-American. There were 5 subjects (15.2%) who 
did not have their race reported due to confidentiality regulations. 4 subjects (12.1%) were noted as 
“other” race. The ethnicity of most subjects was not Hispanic or Latino (26, 78.8%). The ethnicity of 5 
subjects (15.2%) was not reported due to local regulations. By geographic region, enrolment was 
highest in Europe (20, 60.6%), followed by North America (11, 33.3%), and “other” (i.e. Australia, and 
New Zealand) (2, 6.1%).

Hemophilia History: 
Bleeding history in the 3 months prior to study entry was estimated by the Investigator. Overall, 21 
subjects (63.6%) had 0 bleeding episodes in the 3 months prior to study entry. The median number 
of bleeding episodes in the prior 3 months was 0.0, with an overall range of 0 to 5. 
The median estimated number of spontaneous bleeding episodes in the prior 3 months was 0.0 with 
a range of 0 to 3. Similarly, the median estimated number of traumatic bleeding episodes was 0.0 
(range 0 to 5).

Efficacy results 
All efficacy endpoints were considered secondary endpoints in this study.  
Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) by treatment regimen 
The median ABR by treatment regimen was 0.21 (range 0.0 to 6.8) and 1.24 (range 0.0 to 5.4) for 
subjects on the episodic (n=22) and prophylactic (n=28) regimens, respectively. The total number of 
subject-years followed was 14.02 years for episodic treatment and 38.97 years for prophylactic 
treatment. The number and percentage of subjects who experienced 0 bleeding episodes was 11 
(50.0 %) for the episodic treatment and 8 (28.6 %) for the prophylactic treatment. Five (22.7%) 
subjects had an ABR of >5-10 on episodic treatment, whereas 2 (7.1%) subjects on prophylactic 
treatment fell into this category. No subject had an ABR of >10 on either episodic or prophylactic 
treatment.

Number of Injections for Resolution of a Bleeding Episode by Treatment Regimen 
Analysis of the number of injections required for resolution of a bleeding episode by treatment regimen 
resulted  in  a  median  number  of  injections  of  1  (range  1  to  31)  and  1  (range  1  to  4)  for  the  episodic 
and  prophylactic  regimens,  respectively,  with  only  a  single  injection  required  to  resolve  a  bleeding 
episode:  23  episodes  (85.2%)  and  51  episodes  (87.9%)  for  the  episodic  and  prophylactic  regimens, 
respectively.  Bleeding  episodes  that  were  treated  with  non-study  medication  were  included  in  the 
determination of the number of injections required to resolve the bleeding episode but not in either the 
average dose per injection or the total dose required. 
The  number  of  bleeding  episodes  that  required  ≤2  injections  for  resolution  was  24  (88.9%)  and  56 
(96.6%) for the episodic and prophylactic regimens, respectively. 
Overall,  3  subjects  experienced  bleeding  episodes  requiring  >3  injections  for  resolution  these  2 
subjects  were  on  episodic  treatment  regimen  and  1  subject  switched  from  episodic  to  prophylactic 
treatment regimen. 
Summary of Dose for resolution of Bleeding Episodes 
Analysis of the dose of rFIXFc that was required for resolution of bleeding episodes by treatment 
regimen resulted in a median average dose per injection of 88.50 and 71.92 IU/kg for bleeding 
episodes in the episodic and prophylactic regimens, respectively. Further details are provided in the 
table below.

Subjects’ Assessments of Response to rFIXFc Injections for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
by Treatment Regimen 
Subject’s assessment of response to each injection of rFIXFc for each bleeding episode was analyzed 
by treatment regimen and is summarized in the table below. 
Table 8: Summary of subject’s assessment pf responses to rFIXFc injections for the 
treatment of bleeding episodes by treatment regimen 
Investigator’s Global Assessment of the Response to rFIXFc 
This assessment was performed every 12 weeks during the study. The majority of Investigators’ 
global assessments of response were “excellent” or “effective” at all timepoints. Of the total number of 
responses, 33 responses (100.0%) were excellent for subjects on the episodic regimen, 152 
responses (95.6%) were excellent for subjects on the prophylactic regimen, and overall 185 responses 
(96.4%) were excellent. Combining “excellent” and “effective,” the global assessments of response 
was 33 responses (100.0%) for subjects on the episodic regimen, 159 responses (100.0%) for 
subjects on the prophylactic regimen, and overall 192 responses (100.0%).

Total Annualized rFIXFc Consumption 
The median annualized rFIXFc consumption by treatment regimen was 203.2 IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 
IU/kg) and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 IU/kg) on the episodic and prophylactic treatment 
regimens, respectively. The overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 2673.3 IU/kg (range 0 
to 10507 IU/kg). 
Table 9: summary of annualised rFIXFc consumption (IU/kg) by treatment regimen 
Incremental Recovery (IR) 
The one-stage clotting (aPTT) assay was used for this analysis. The IR values observed overall were 
consistent in the episodic and prophylactic treatment groups. The IR for the baseline PK profile of 
subjects on the episodic regimen of 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg (0.63 to 0.78 IU/dL per IU/kg [median (25th 
– 75th)]) was same in comparison to the prophylactic regimen, 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg (0.68 to 0.77 
IU/dL per IU/kg). IR remained stable throughout the study, with both regimens exhibiting similar IR 
values for the duration (through Week 120). 
Health outcomes (exploratory endpoint) 
Throughout all study visits, there was a very small number of subjects who completed Questions 
2, 3, 4, and 5 (refers to questions listed in section “Methods, exploratory endpoints”) of the health 
outcomes questionnaires. Thus, the responses to these questions are not suitable for summarizing 
meaningful observations. 
Question 1 (How many times the child’s injection was administered by different persons?) had larger 
numbers of responses, particularly for subjects in the prophylactic regimen at Follow-Up Weeks 24, 
48, and 72. Subjects received various numbers of infusions by caregivers or visiting home nurses or 
at clinic. For those who went to the clinic to get their infusions, varying proportions of subject families 
had difficulty in getting to the clinic. No consistent result patterns emerged across the different 
follow-up visits. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 20/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Other results 
No subjects were eligible for ITI and therefore no response was assessed. 
No subject had undergone major surgery during the study and so no Investigator’s assessment, no 
blood loss, no rFIXFc consumption or no injection was required. 
There were minor surgeries performed in 16 subjects. The most common surgery performed was for 
port placement. 
Safety results 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of rFIXFc in previously untreated 
subjects with severe hemophilia B. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of inhibitor development. 
The Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay was performed by the central laboratory to detect neutralizing 
inhibitors to rFIXFc. A positive inhibitor was defined as an inhibitor test result of ≥0.60 BU/mL that was 
confirmed by a second test result of ≥0.60 BU/mL from a separate sample, drawn 2 to 4 weeks after 
the date when the original sample was drawn. The date of the inhibitor was the date of the sample 
with the first positive test result, which was subsequently confirmed. 
The total subject-years followed on the study was 57.51 years with a total of 2233 EDs. Overall, the 
number of subjects with at least 50 EDs was 21 (63.6%), at least 75 EDs was 18 (54.5%), and at least 
100 EDs was 11 (33.3%). Overall, the median number of EDs was 76 days (range 1 to 137 days). 
Key safety result  
Of 33 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set with at least 1 subsequent inhibitor test result or who had an 
inhibitor, 1 subject (3.03% [95% CI: 0.08%, 15.76%]) developed a low-titer inhibitor to rFIXFc during 
the study. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA Version 20.1. Subjects who experienced multiple 
events in a SOC (system organ class) or PT (preferred term) were counted only once in the incidence 
of that SOC or PT. The term TEAE is used to refer to those AEs that appeared or worsened after Day 1 
in Study 998HB303, excluding AEs that emerged during major surgical/ rehabilitation periods. The 
term AE is used to describe non-TEAEs or a combination of TEAEs and non-TEAEs. The same principle 
is applied to TESAEs.  
The total number of TEAEs reported was 387 from 57.51 total patient-years followed and 2233 
total EDs. Of the 33 subjects who received at least 1 dose of rFIXFc during the study, 30 
(90.9%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE and 2 (6.1%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE that was 
assessed as related to rFIXFc treatment by the Investigator. Of the 33 subjects treated with at 
least 1 dose of rFIXFc, 1 (3.0%) subject discontinued treatment and/or the study due to an AE.  
During episodic treatment, 14 of 22 (63.6%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE; however no subject had 
TEAE that was assessed as related to rFIXFc treatment by the Investigator. During prophylactic 
treatment, 27 of 28 (96.4%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE and 2 (7.1%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE 
that was assessed as related to rFIXFc treatment by the Investigator.

Overall, the majority of TEAEs were categorized as mild (326 events), with 48 TEAEs assessed as 
moderate, and 13 assessed as severe. Of the 33 subjects treated with rFIXFc, 9 (27.3%) subjects had 
at least 1 TEAE classified a severe and mild, each, and 12 (36.4%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE 
classified as moderate. 
•  Episodic: Severe in 5 (22.7%) subjects, moderate in 1 (4.5%) subjects, and mild in 8 (36.4%) 
subjects

Of the 13 TEAEs reported as severe, 1 TEAE was assessed as related to rFIXFc treatment by the 
Investigator (1 report of Factor IX inhibition was reported in one Subject). 
Adverse events evaluated as treatment-related by the investigator 
Overall, of the 387 reported TEAEs, a total of 5 TEAEs reported in 2 (6.1%) subjects were assessed by 
the Investigator as related to treatment with rFIXFc:  
•  Events of injection site erythema resolved and were assessed as related to the study 
treatment. 
• 
Inhibitor development, hypersensitivity. 
Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 58 TESAEs was reported in 33 subjects, with 23 (69.7%) subjects experiencing at least 1 
TESAE and 1 (3.0%) subject experiencing at least 1 TESAE that was assessed as related to rFIXFc 
treatment by the Investigator (see table 29 below). During episodic treatment, 9 of 22 (40.9%) 
subjects experienced a total of 24 TESAEs; and during prophylactic treatment, 14 of 28 (50.0%) 
subjects experienced a total of 27 TESAEs. The SOCs with the highest incidence of TESAEs were 
surgical and medical procedures (9 [27.3%] subjects), infections and infestations (8 [24.2%] 
subjects), injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (7 [21.2%] subjects), blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (3 [9.1%] subjects]), and nervous system disorders (3 [9.1%] subjects). A higher 
incidence of TESAEs in the injury, poisoning, and procedural complications SOC were reported in 
subjects on episodic treatment (4 [18.2%] subjects) compared with prophylactic treatment (2 [7.1%] 
subjects). 
The incidence of individual TESAEs reported by at least 2 subjects were central venous catheterization 
(9 [27.3%] subjects), fall (5 [15.2%] subjects), head injury (3 [9.1%] subjects), and poor venous 
access (3 [9.1%] subjects). The remaining TESAEs occurred in 1 (3.0%) subject each. 
Of the 58 TESAEs, 56 were assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to rFIXFc and 2 were assessed 
by the Investigator as related to rFIXFc (1 TESAE each of Factor IX inhibition and hypersensitivity for 
one Subject), which resulted in withdrawal of study treatment. None of the TESAEs was associated 
with a fatal outcome.

Vascular Thrombotic Events 
No subject reported vascular thrombotic events during the study in both the treatment groups. 
Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions 
One subject experienced a TESAE of hypersensitivity during the study which was assessed as serious 
and related tor the study treatment by the Investigator. 
Fifteen AEs in 10 patients (e.g. rash, eczema, erythema) were medically reviewed for possible allergic 
events and considered as not related to treatment. 
Overdose 
There was one overdose event reported for 1 subject during the study without clinical consequence. 
Clinical Laboratory Results 
Clinical laboratory evaluations included hematology (WBC count and differential, RBC, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, and platelet count) and blood chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, total protein, total 
bilirubin, GGT, ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, serum creatinine, and glucose). 
According to the MAH no clinically meaningful patterns or trends were observed in abnormalities of 
hematology. 
According to the MAH no clinically meaningful patterns or trends were observed in abnormalities of 
blood chemistry. 
Anti-rFIXFc Binding Antibody 
Of the 33 subjects, no subject, including inhibitor subjects, were positive for anti-rFIXFc antibodies 
prior to treatment with rFIXFc. Of the 33 subjects evaluated, 32 (97.0%) subjects were negative at all 
post-dose assessments. Of the 33 subjects evaluated, 1 (3.0%) subject was positive for anti-rFIXFc 
antibodies at any time after rFIXFc treatment (see key safety result). 
Vital signs & physical examination 
In summary, there was no apparent clinically meaningful pattern or consistent trend in vital signs 
observed, including increase in blood pressure or temperature. 
The abnormal physical examination findings were typical of what is expected for the general 
hemophilia population with findings reported in the extremities/joints, musculoskeletal, and skin body 
systems. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One of 33 subjects (3.0%) treated with rFIXFc discontinued due to 2 TEAEs of hypersensitivity and 
Factor IX inhibition, both assessed as serious.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted the final Clinical Study Report of the ALPROLIX Study 998HB303 (PUPs B) 
performed in paediatric, previously untreated patients (PUPs). This submission is done to meet the 
requirement of Art. 46 to submit paediatric data within 6 months from End of Study. During the 
assessment of this P46 procedure, the MAH submitted a type II variation in order to update the 
Product Information, based on the same study results.  
In Study 998HB303 safety and efficacy of rFIXFc (Alprolix) were investigated in PUPs with severe 
hemophilia B defined as ≤2 IU/dL (≤2 %).  
The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development.  
Secondary endpoints included annualized bleeding rates, assessments of responses to treatment with 
Alprolix for bleeding episodes, and the number of injections and dose needed to resolve bleeding 
episodes, the total number of EDs per subject per year, Alprolix consumption, and incremental 
recovery. 
All subjects were male, with an overall median age of 0.60 (range 0.08 to 2). Most subjects (78.8%) 
were <1 year of age.  
Overall, exposure over the period of at least 50 exposure days (EDs) for a minimum of 20 subjects was 
reached and hence, the requirements of the “Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and 
human plasma-derived factor IX products” (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009) are met for deleting the 
statement in section 4.2 of the SmPC on the lack of data in PUPs. Of note, this guideline is currently 
under revision. The draft guideline does not foresee the requirement for formal PUP studies anymore. 
Initially, it was planned that the study will end when at least 40 subjects have reached at least 100 
EDs with Alprolix. This was changed to 20 subjects with at least 50 EDs through an amendment and in 
order to align with the revised EU paediatric investigational plan. 
Prophylactic and episodic treatment regimens were assessed in a total of 33 patients (full and safety 
analysis set). Six patients discontinued, resulting in 27 patients who completed the study (of which 20 
had an exposure of at least 50 EDs). 
Of  the  33  subjects  in  the  analysis  set,  11  subjects  were  started  in  the  prophylaxis  arm,  22  in  the 
episodic treatment arm. At the investigator’s discretion 17/22 patients were switched from the episodic 
to  the  prophylactic  treatment  arm.  The  last  prescribed  dosing  frequency  for  each  subject  was  twice 
weekly (1 subject), every 5 days (1 subject), every 7 days (23 subjects), every 14 days (2 subjects) 
and  on-demand  (1  subject).  Throughout  the  study  report,  results  are  presented  for  the  episodic  and 
prophylactic  treatment  arm,  however,  at  the  end  of  the  study  the  majority  of  patients  were  in  the 
prophylactic  treatment  arm  (n=  28  at  EOS).  The  rationale  behind  switching  from  episodic  to 
prophylactic  treatment  is  fully  understood,  however,  the  results  from  the  episodic  arm  need  to  be 
interpreted cautiously due to short duration for the majority of the subjects and the limited number of 
subjects at the end of study in this treatment arm. 
The study population, overall study design and the number of study participants are considered 
acceptable.  
Safety: 
Inhibitor development occurred in 1/33 subjects. Treatment-related hypersensitivity was reported in 
the same subject, a coincidence commonly seen with Factor IX therapy. From a total of 58 TESAEs 
reported in 23/33 subjects (70 %), these two TESAEs were the only two assessed as related to 
treatment by the Investigator.  
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 27/37 
 
  
 
 
Inhibitor development against FIX products with related hypersensitivity is a known risk in 
haemophilia B treatment. This is also reflected in the current version of the SmPC of Alprolix by 
general statements in accordance with the FIX Core SmPC.  The MAH agreed to add the occurrence of 
inhibitor with related hypersensitivity during the PUP study to the tabulated list of adverse reactions in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. The respective type II variation procedure is currently under evaluation 
(Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004142/II/0029). 
From the subject disposition the following data initially gave rise to concern that detection of inhibitors 
was hampered by the low completion of study visits: Key visits were those in which inhibitor tests were 
performed. Most subjects completed the Week 12 visit (31, 93.9%), Week 24 visit (29, 87.9%), Week 
36 visit (29, 87.9%), Week 48 visit (28, 84.8%), Week 60 visit (24, 72.7%), Week 72 visit (19, 
57.6%), and approximately half of all subjects (16, 48.5%) achieved Week 84 visit. Approximately half 
of the subjects (17, 51.5%) completed the 10-ED inhibitor test visit, 15 subjects (45.5%) completed 
the 20-ED inhibitor test visit, and 14 subjects (42.4%) completed the 50-ED inhibitor test visit. The 
MAH clarified that while a considerable high number of subjects did not complete the 20 and 50 ED 
milestone visits for inhibitor testing, all subjects reaching 20 EDs (n=26) and 50 EDs (n=21) were 
tested for inhibitor at least once after the milestone. Therefore, the detection of potential inhibitor 
development was possible. 
Due to the low number of patients the precision of the incidence is low (3.03% [95% CI: 0.08%, 
15.76%]) and therefore no firm conclusions on the inhibitor frequency can be drawn. However, as 
inhibitor development is a known risk and can be expected in PUPs, no concerns arise from the study 
results in this regard.   
The total number of TEAEs reported was 387 from 57.51 total patient-years followed and 2233 total 
EDs. The most common TEAEs observed (incidence ≥ 10%) were, in descending order of incidence, 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, central venous catheterization, fall, upper respiratory tract infection, head 
injury, cough, rhinorrhea, teething, diarrhea, vomiting, ear infection, otitis media, pharyngitis, 
varicella, viral infection, and dermatitis diaper. Apart from 3 episodes of injection site erythema in a 
single subject and the two events described above (inhibitor development, hypersensitivity) none of 
the TEAEs were related to treatment by the Investigator. Overall, the number and nature of (related) 
TEAEs does not give rise to concern. The MAH agreed to add injection site erythema to the tabulated 
list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC (currently under evaluation as part of a type II 
variation request). 
No vascular thrombotic events, anaphylaxis, or anti-drug-antibodies were reported. Overdose in a 
single subject was not of clinical consequence. No clinically meaningful patterns in abnormalities of 
hematology (e.g. WBC/ RBC/ platelet count, haematocrit, haemoglobin) and blood chemistry (e.g. 
ALT, AST, glucose, sodium, potassium could be identified. Likewise, vital signs including increase in 
blood pressure or temperature were normal. No deaths occurred. 
Efficacy: 
Bleeding rates were low with a mean ABR of 1.58 (range 0.0 to 5.4) in the prophylactic treatment arm 
and 2.13 (range 0.0 to 6.8) in the episodic treatment arm. Only descriptive statistics were used which 
is considered acceptable for this kind of study where the primary objective was investigation of safety. 
The majority of bleeding episodes was resolved by a single injection. However, two patients 
experienced bleeding episodes.  In light of the prolonged duration of those two bleeding episodes 
(approx. 1-1.5 months) the apparently high numbers of injections required for resolution appear 
justified. Of note, duration of a bleeding episode was defined as starting from the first sign of a bleed, 
and ending no more than 72 hours after the last injection to treat the bleed, within which any 
symptoms of bleeding at the same location, injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, are 
considered the same bleeding episode.  
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 28/37 
 
  
 
 
The median dose per bleeding episodes was higher than that observed in the previously submitted 
studies in PTPs. Although this might be explained by the increased clearance in younger patients the 
MAH agreed to add these results in section 5.1 of the SmPC (currently under evaluation as part of a 
type II variation request). 
Consumption data do not give rise to concern: The median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 203.2 
IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 IU/kg) in the episodic treatment arm and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 
IU/kg) in the prophylaxis treatment arm. The overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 
reported as 2673.3 IU/kg (range 0 to 10507 IU/kg). The used 4-point scale for the patient´s 
(caregiver/parents) assessment of haemostatic response was the same as used during the pivotal 
studies submitted for MAA and is therefore considered acceptable. For all injections of rFIXFc with an 
evaluation, 22 injections (100%) in the episodic treatment arm and 50 injections (87.7%) in the 
prophylaxis treatment arm, respectively, were assessed as excellent or good. For all injections, a 
response of excellent or good was reported for 22 (27.5%) and 50 injections (67.6%). For a high 
number of injections no response was provided: 58 (72.5%) in the episodic treatment arm and 17 
(23.0%) in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively. This was explained by initial difficulties in 
data collection via an electronic patient diary and the fact that a single subject (998HB303-818-901; 
see above) accounted for more than half of the responses not given in the episodic treatment arm. 
While this strongly limits the interpretation of the result, the investigator’s assessment of response did 
not indicate concerns regarding haemostatic efficacy. The latter has been demonstrated as part of the 
marketing authorisation procedure. Moreover, safety/immunogenicity was the primary objective of this 
paediatric study under assessment, thus no further issue is made on the reliability of patient’s 
response data. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Safety and tolerability of Alprolix in PUPs seem to be largely comparable with the data generated in 
previously treated patients. The MAH agreed to update section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to 
include inhibitor development, hypersensitivity and injection site erythema as well as information on 
dose per bleeding episode. These changes are dealt with as part of a separate type II variation request 
which was submitted on 03 April 2020 while this P46 report was under assessment (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004142/II/0029).  
The MAH was asked to clarify several issues related to uncertainties on safety and efficacy which have 
been resolved sufficiently.  
Overall, the data presented do not indicate any new safety or efficacy aspects which may alter the 
benefit risk profile.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1. 
The MAH is asked to provide any follow-up data in one patient who discontinued the study due to 
inhibitor development, if available.  
2. 
The MAH is asked for clarification why a considerable high number of subjects did not complete 
the visits for inhibitor testing. Furthermore, a discussion is awaited whether detection of any 
inhibitors potentially occurring during the study was possible in light of the poor adherence to 
study visits. 
3. 
The MAH is asked to discuss the following two bleeding episodes in two subjects in more detail 
and to explain the high number of injections needed for resolution: 
•  Case 1: spontaneous subdural hematoma  
•  Case 2: spontaneous internal bleeding  
4. 
The MAH should commit to submit a variation to update the Product Information: 
•  The occurrence of an inhibitor with related hypersensitivity during the PUP study should be 
added in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
•  Injection site erythema should be added in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
•  Information on dose per bleeding episode might be added in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
5. 
The median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 203.2 IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 IU/kg) in the 
episodic treatment arm and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 IU/kg) in the prophylaxis 
treatment arm. The overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was reported as 2673.3 
IU/kg (range 0 to 10507 IU/kg). Clarification is needed regarding discrepancies in ranges (shown 
as min and max values) of the overall median annualized consumption. 
6. 
No patient response was provided for a high number of injections: 58 (72.5%) in the episodic 
treatment arm and 17 (23.0%) in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively. The MAH is 
asked to clarify why no reports were received for such a high number of bleeding episodes and 
to discuss the interpretability of results. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1: 
The MAH is asked to provide any follow-up data in one patient who discontinued the study due to 
inhibitor development, if available. 
MAH responses: 
The MAH provided a full description of the case narrative. 
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAH provides a brief narrative on the request for follow-up data of one patient who discontinued 
the study due to inhibitor development against FIX. 
Issue resolved.  
Question 2: 
The MAH is asked for clarification why a considerable high number of subjects did not complete the 
visits for inhibitor testing. Furthermore, a discussion is awaited whether detection of any inhibitors 
potentially occurring during the study was possible in light of the poor adherence to study visits. 
MAH responses: 
Please note that the percentages for ED Milestone Visits presented in CSR Section 10.1 are based on 
the total number of subjects in the Safety analysis set, rather than on the number of subjects reaching 
each milestone. 
To optimize detection of any inhibitor development during the study, subjects were routinely tested for 
inhibitor and anti-rFIXFc antibody formation at each clinic visit (see CSR Section 9.5.4.3.1 Inhibitor 
testing). Tests and assessments performed at Screening and Baseline Incremental Recovery visit are 
presented in CSR Table 3, and assessments at Interim study visits every 12 (±2) weeks are shown in 
CSR Table 4. Inhibitor test results for all subjects are provided in CSR Listing 16.2.8.8, and subjects 
who developed inhibitors in CSR Listing 16.2.8.10. 
In addition, testing for inhibitors was also conducted at the time of ED milestones (CSR Section 
9.5.4.3.1). If these did not align with a scheduled study visit, an additional ED Milestone Visit was 
scheduled to complete this testing. Additional unscheduled testing could also be performed as needed 
if clinically indicated. The assessments performed at ED milestone visits are presented in CSR Table 5. 
A summary of patients attending key study visits (e.g. ED milestone visits) is presented in CSR Table 
16.2.1.2. 
Of the 28 subjects that reached 10 EDs (CSR Table 16), 27 were tested for inhibitor at least once after 
the milestone (derived from CSR Table 24). All subjects reaching 20 EDs (n=26) and 50 EDs (n=21) 
were tested for inhibitor at least once after the milestone. 
Therefore, based on the rigorous protocol schedule of inhibitor testing and the opportunity to perform 
inhibitor testing at any time during the study based on clinical status, the MAH believes that these 
measures allowed for accurate detection of inhibitor development during the study. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 31/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAH reiterates that inhibitor testing was performed adequately throughout the study in order to 
detect potential inhibitor development. Measurements were performed at screening, baseline, 
scheduled visits (every 12 ±2 weeks) and unscheduled visits (if clinically indicated). Although only 15 
subjects (45.5%) completed the 20-ED inhibitor test visit, and 14 subjects (42.4%) completed the 50-
ED inhibitor test visit, the MAH states that all subjects reaching 20 and 50 ED were tested at least 
once after the milestone. This is considered adequate in terms of inhibitor monitoring over time/ 
exposure.  
Issue resolved. 
Question 3: 
The MAH is asked to discuss the following two bleeding episodes in two subjects in more detail and to 
explain the high number of injections needed for resolution: 
•  Case 1: spontaneous subdural hematoma  
•  Case 2: spontaneous internal bleeding  
MAH responses: 
According to the study protocol Section 10.2.3.1, a bleeding episode starts from the first sign of a 
bleed, and ends no more than 72 hours after the last injection to treat the bleed, within which any 
symptoms of bleeding at the same location, injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, are 
considered the same bleeding episode. 
The study protocol, Section 5.3 and Appendix A, specified the rFIXFc dosing guidelines to be followed 
in the event of CNS bleeding episodes. Injection dose and frequency was to be individually selected in 
order to maintain the necessary 60%–100% peak plasma Factor IX activity levels, and taking into 
account lower rFIXFc recoveries observed in young children. This requirement resulted in a relatively 
high number of injections needed for resolution in the two subjects referenced above, compared with 
the overall rates observed in the study. The clinical details are summarized below. 
Case 1: spontaneous subdural hematoma  
Case 2: spontaneous internal bleeding  
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAH explains that a bleeding episode “starts from the first sign of a bleed, and ends no more than 
72 hours after the last injection to treat the bleed, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same 
location, injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, are considered the same bleeding episode”. 
Dosage and intervals aimed at maintaining adequate (in case of CNS manifestations 60%–100%) peak 
plasma Factor IX activity levels. In case of the two serious events in two different subjects of 
spontaneous subdural hematoma (26 injections required for resolution) and spontaneous internal 
bleeding (31 injections required for resolution) it is acknowledged that these events lasted for about 
1.5 and 1 months, respectively, thus explaining the high number of injections needed. 
Issue resolved.

Question 4: 
The MAH should commit to submit a variation to update the Product Information: 
•  The occurrence of an inhibitor with related hypersensitivity during the PUP study should be 
added in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
•  Injection site erythema should be added in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
•  Information on dose per bleeding episode might be added in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
MAH responses: 
A variation to update SmPC and PIL texts based on the study results was submitted by the MAH on 8 
April 2020. The proposed changes include: 
•  Addition of factor IX inhibition, hypersensitivity and injection site erythema to the tabulated list 
of adverse reactions in SmPC section 4.8. 
• 
Information on dose per bleeding episode in SmPC section 5.1. 
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAHs agrees to update the SmPC (and corresponding PIL sections) to adequately reflect the 
events of factor IX inhibition, hypersensitivity, injection site erythema (tabulated list of AEs in section 
4.8) and information on dose per bleeding episode (section 5.1). 
As meanwhile the MAH has requested a type II variation, further comments on proposed SmPC 
changes are dealt with in the corresponding assessment report (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004142/II/0029) 
Therefore, as part of this P46 procedure, no further comments are made. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 5: 
The median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 203.2 IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 IU/kg) in the episodic 
treatment arm and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 IU/kg) in the prophylaxis treatment arm. The 
overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was reported as 2673.3 IU/kg (range 0 to 10507 
IU/kg). Clarification is needed regarding discrepancies in ranges (shown as min and max values) of the 
overall median annualized consumption. 
MAH responses: 
The annualized rFIXFc consumption is calculated based on rFIXFc consumption and the duration of 
each regimen/period. The calculation is detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan Section 6.6.1.4. 
It should be noted that for each patient, the Overall period covers the combined time on episodic and 
prophylactic regimens. The annualized consumption for a patient in the episodic regimen would usually 
be expected to be lower than the annualized consumption in the prophylactic regimen, unless the 
patient is experiencing frequent bleeding episodes. The overall annualized consumption is then 
expected to fall between the annualized consumption for the episodic and prophylactic regimens, 
respectively. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 33/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The minimum annualized consumption could thus be lower for episodic than the overall and likewise 
maximum consumption for prophylactic could indeed be higher than maximum annualized consumption 
combined. Also, a patient with an annualized consumption 0 on episodic regimen and who is not 
transitioning to a prophylactic regimen, would have an overall annualized consumption of 0. There are 
thus no discrepancies in the ranges of overall annualized consumption. 
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAH clarified how annualized consumption data were calculated and that there are no 
discrepancies in the ranges of overall annualized consumption. This explanation can be followed. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 6: 
No patient response was provided for a high number of injections: 58 (72.5%) in the episodic 
treatment arm and 17 (23.0%) in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively. The MAH is asked to 
clarify why no reports were received for such a high number of bleeding episodes and to discuss the 
interpretability of results. 
MAH responses: 
For individual bleeding episodes treated at the study site, the assessment of response to bleeding 
episodes were to be done by the Investigator in the eCRF. For other episodes, the assessments were to 
be done by the subject in the electronic patient diary (EPD). 
Subjects (or caregivers) were instructed to enter data about the injection as soon as possible after an 
injection while the treatment response to a bleeding episode were to be assessed approximately 8 to 
12 hours after an injection. At the start of the study, the EPD did not allow users who had already 
entered data about the injection to return at a later timepoint to rate the treatment response. This was 
inconvenient for users and led to missing data. The system was updated in late 2017 to allow entry of 
the patient’s assessment of treatment response at a later time point. 
The lack of data entry for individual bleeding episodes has an impact on the response frequency, 
especially for the episodic regimen. It is most clearly seen for subject 818-901 where no assessment 
was entered during the bleeding episode that is further described in the response to Question 3 (CSR 
Listing 16.2.7.2). This single bleeding episode with 31 injections thus accounts for more than half of 
the 58 (72.5%) “Response not provided” in the episodic regimen shown in CSR Table 21. 
The main reason for “No response given” was a lack of data entry from individual subjects due to the 
inherent difficulties in collecting patient assessments in this type of study. Despite these limitations, 
the MAH believes the available data is representative for the study population and allows for adequate 
interpretation and assessment. 
Assessor’s comments: 
The MAH explains that the lack of subjects’ response to a high number of injections (72.5% in the 
episodic treatment arm and 23.0% in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively) is due issues in 
data collection via the electronic patient diary (EPD). Many patients did not provide treatment 
responses to a bleeding episode, as the assessment window of 8 to 12 hours after injection was 
inconvenient at the start of the study. This was amended to allow data entry at a later time point. 
EMA/562337/2020  
Page 34/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
While this is acknowledged, it is unclear from the MAH’s response what exactly is meant with “a later 
time point” and in how far later data entry impacted on the accuracy of responses given. The MAH 
further outlines that lack of data entry in a single subject (requiring 31 injections to treat a bleeding 
episode) accounted for more than half of the 72.5% “responses not provided” in the episodic arm. It is 
noted, that the quality of data collection limits meaningful conclusions on patients responses to rFIXFc 
injections. However, given that i) the investigator’s assessment of response did not indicate concerns 
regarding haemostatic efficacy, ii) the latter has been demonstrated as part of the marketing 
authorisation procedure and iii) safety/immunogenicity was the primary objective of this paediatric 
study under assessment, no further issue is made on the reliability of patients’ response data. 
Issue resolved.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an 
epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. 
The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology associated with 
CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the primary 
cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF.  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of lung, 
pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into adulthood.  
The CFTR phenotype differs considerably among patients, even among patients with the same genotype. The 
CFTR genotype primarily determines the degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, sweat chloride 
concentration and malformation of the male reproductive tract. However, factors independent of CFTR are 
responsible for variation in lung disease, the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. In lung disease, 
environmental factors, socio-economic factors and also the presence of modifier genes play an important 
role. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
The 2020 Annual Report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR)1 shows that there 
were 52,246 patients registered in 39 countries (including patients from non-EU countries).  The incidence 
and prevalence of CF vary between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian 
populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. Despite advances in 
treatment, the current median age of death in a patient with CF was approximately 32 years in 20201, and 
the predicted median age of survival in the UK is approximately 45.1years2

The most common disease-causing mutation in the CFTR gene is F508del: approximately 81.0% of 
individuals in the ECFSPR 2020 Annual Report have at least one F508del allele. The F508del mutation causes 
severe defects in processing and trafficking that result in little-to-no F508del-CFTR protein at the epithelial 
cell surface. 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (Cl-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene have been 
identified.  
•  CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. 
Class I or Stop codon mutations: production of a truncated non-functional CFTR,  
•  Class II mutations: production of aberrantly folded CFTR protein (degraded by the cell quality control 
system) 
•  Class III mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein.  
These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency.  
•  Class IV mutations: lead to defective chloride conductance  
•  Class V mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise 
normal CFTR.  
These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at 
position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR), which is considered a Class II mutation: it prevents most of 
the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The decrease in 
the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in the processing and trafficking of the 
F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has 
defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with 
F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form 
of CF disease. 
More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Most of these mutations are not associated 
with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database (an online resource that provides clinical and 
nonclinical data about CF-associated CFTR mutations) contains information on 412 of these identified 
mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 346 mutations as disease-causing. 
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport caused 
by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is referred to as “minimal 
function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as “residual 
function” of CFTR.

2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across epithelia in various tissues, 
including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased CFTR quantity 
or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality. The clinical 
manifestations are those of progressive airway obstruction and bronchiectasis, with periods of worsening 
pulmonary symptoms associated with a decline in pulmonary function and increased bacterial density in 
airway secretions (pulmonary exacerbations). Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a 
chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role 
in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. In addition, poor growth 
and nutritional status have historically been common in patients with CF owing to a number of factors, 
including pancreatic insufficiency-related fat malabsorption, increased energy expenditure attributable to 
progressive lung disease, appetite suppression attributable to chronic infection, and CF-related diabetes. 
These signs and symptoms are the typical manifestations of CF, and generally occur in advanced form in 
older paediatric and adult CF patients. However, less severe form of the above-mentioned manifestations of 
the disease can be observed in early childhood or – in patients with severe genotypes (with gating mutations 
such as G551D) – in infancy or even in utero. In CF patients with gating mutations pancreatic destruction 
leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement, manifested by pulmonary 
inflammation and infection, begins shortly after birth. 
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are among the most significant clinical 
manifestations of CF in infants with severe genotypes. These factors often lead to poor growth with 
subsequent growth delay, poorer cognitive development, and are associated with other clinical comorbidities 
such as decreased lung function and decreased survival. Malnourishment is associated with worsening lung 
function in children with CF and is an independent predictor of mortality in this population. In one study, fat 
malabsorption was present in 79% of infants tested at 6 months and 92% of infants by 12 months of age. 
Additionally, increased energy expenditure and appetite suppression due to lung disease contribute to poor 
somatic growth and poor nutritional status in young patients with CF. 
Since the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients with CF 
are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first year of life. 
Approximately 65% of patients in the ECFSPR 2020 Annual Report are diagnosed by 1 year of age, with a 
median (min., max.) age at diagnosis of 0.30 (0.00, 82.57) years. Data in the literature suggest that early 
therapeutic intervention is beneficial to children with CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as 
improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by 
newborn screening. Therefore, it is expected that the initiation of treatment with CFTR modulators targeting 
the functional defects of the mutated CFTR protein could postpone or even prevent the onset of clinical 
manifestations of cystic fibrosis such as lung disease and impaired exocrine pancreatic function.  
In Europe, the median age of all CF patients was 18.5 years (with the youngest patient being diagnosed just 
after birth and the oldest patients being 88.4 years of age) in 2017. Despite advances in treatment, the 
current median age of death in a patient with CF is approximately 31 years. In 2018, the median predicted 
survival age of those born in 2018 was 47.4 years (95% CI: 44.2–50.3 years)1. Such a prediction assumes 
no further improvement in mortality rate and thus does not consider the potential impact of CFTR modulators 
and other improvements in clinical care. 
CF is diagnosed when both of the following criteria are met: 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 14/87 
 
 
 
•  Clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system (CLASSIC), or positive newborn 
screening or genetic testing for siblings of patients with CF 
AND 
• 
Evidence of CFTR dysfunction (any of the following): 
o  Elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L (CLASSIC) 
o  Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, one from each parental allele 
o  Abnormal nasal potential difference 
Around 2 % of patients lack one or more of the “CLASSIC” features. They may have milder clinical symptoms 
and/or normal to intermediate sweat chloride results. These patients can still be diagnosed with CF if they 
meet genetic or functional criteria. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Existing treatments for CF can be broadly classified into 2 groups: (1) therapies that manage the symptoms, 
complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic enzyme replacement 
therapy) and (2) CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) which target the defective CFTR protein 
by facilitating its trafficking to the cell surface and increasing the expression on the cell surface (potentiators) 
or recovering the ion channel activity of the defective protein (correctors). Concomitant administrations of 
these two groups are recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and 
exacerbations, and improve quality of life.  
(1)  CF therapies currently available, including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, target 
the downstream consequences and symptoms of the disease. These therapies are predominantly 
generic medicines authorized at a national level, apart from agents for the management of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
(2)  CFTR modulators are small molecules that were developed in specific subsets of CF patients, grouped 
by specific CFTR mutations and genotypes that were responsive to each of the modulators. Correctors 
(tezacaftor, lumacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to 
increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators (ivacaftor) increase the channel open 
probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance 
chloride transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator should result in sufficient levels of 
CFTR at the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating function. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), 
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA), and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) are CFTR 
modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations. 
It is believed that if a CFTR modulator regimen had a large enough effect on F508del-CFTR, then the 
presence of a single F508del allele alone would be sufficient to derive significant clinical benefit. That single 
regimen would be effective in all patients with at least one F508del allele, regardless of the mutation on the 
second allele. If the second allele is also responsive, any benefit derived from that allele would be in addition 
to the substantial benefit derived from the robust effect on F508del-CFTR. Importantly, for patients who have 
one F508del allele and are currently being treated with CFTR modulators (i.e. F/G and F/RF patients), their 
F508del allele seems not being fully leveraged because approved regimens primarily target the gating (IVA)

or RF (IVA and TEZ/IVA) allele with limited modulation of the single F508del allele; these patients too would 
benefit from additional, highly effective modulation of their F508del.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The scope of the line extension is to introduce a new strength presented as granules in sachet containing 59.5 
mg of ivacaftor as active substance. This is to be added to the existing Kalydeco 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg 
granules in sachet, and Kalydeco 75 mg and 150 mg film-coated tablets. 
Other ingredients are: colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate succinate, 
lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sucralose and sodium laurilsulfate (E487). 
The product is available in Biaxially Oriented Polyethylene Terephthalate/Polyethylene/Foil/ Polyethylene 
(BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
In addition to the introduction of Kalydeco 59.5 mg granules in sachet, the MAH has applied for an extension 
of the shelf-life from 36 months to 48 months for the authorised 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg granules and the 
newly applied 59.5 mg granules based on available stability data included in this submission. During the review, 
it  was  noticed  that  the  MAH  had  included  in  Module  3  several  changes  not  being  applied  as  part  of  this 
Assessment report

procedure. Those have not been assessed within this procedure. The MAH was requested to submit a variation 
to apply for those. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The ivacaftor active substance is provided as an amorphous spray dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate in all 
Kalydeco dosage forms and strengths. No new information on the ivacaftor active substance or the ivacaftor 
SDD intermediate has been provided in this line extension application. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The new strength introduced with this line extension application is Kalydeco 59.5 mg immediate release 
granules in sachet for oral administration. The 59.5 mg ivacaftor granules differ from the approved Kalydeco 
granules strengths of 25, 50, and 75 mg, only with respect to the amount of granules that are filled into the 
sachets. 
The granules have a diameter of 2.0 mm, a target thickness of 2.1 mm and a target weight of 6.87 mg. 
Individual ivacaftor granules do not exceed the maximum bead size of 2.4 mm). Each granule contains a 
target of 1.92 mg of ivacaftor. The granules are filled by count into the primary container closure (sachet) to 
achieve the targeted strength. 
The new strength is introduced to support the use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2.   
As indicated above, ivacaftor active substance used to produce ivacaftor granules is provided as an 
amorphous spray dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate. 
The active substance and SDD used in the ivacaftor granules 25 mg, 50 mg, 59.5 mg and 75 mg and the 
ivacaftor tablet 150 mg are identical. 
Excipients are listed specifying their common name, the quantity present, their function and a reference to a 
relevant standard. The excipients are the same as those used for the already authorised granule strengths. All 
excipients are  well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality  is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Most of the pharmaceutical development relevant for Kalydeco 59.5 mg granules was performed for Kalydeco 
150 mg film-coated tablets, Kalydeco 25 mg 50 mg and 75 mg granules. 
The dissolution medium and the dissolution conditions are the same for all Kalydeco granule strengths. The 
dissolution profiles and rates are shown to be independent of the granule strength.  
As previously shown for the 50 mg and 75 mg strengths, the dissolution method is able to discriminate against 
granule  formulations  with  different  bioavailability  (prototype  and  Phase  3  granules),  different  degree  of 
ivacaftor crystallinity, compression pressure and spray-dried dispersion bulk density. 
Product and manufacturing process development was conducted under a Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm 
which ensures that the desired product performance in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy is achieved. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 18/87 
 
 
 
CQAs are: appearance, identification, assay, degradation products, uniformity of dosage units, physical form, 
dissolution, water content and microbial attributes. These are the same as for authorised granules strengths 
and are considered adequate and the justification sufficient. 
The  primary  packaging  is  Biaxially  Oriented  Polyethylene  Terephthalate/Polyethylene/Foil/Polyethylene 
(BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet. The material complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Kalydeco 59.5 mg granules is identical to the manufacturing process of Kalydeco 
25 mg granules, Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules, with the exception of the filling step (the number of 
granules per sachet is different in each strength).   
Briefly,  the  manufacturing  of  ivacaftor  SDD  consists  of  3  steps:  mixture  preparation,  spray  drying  and 
secondary  drying.  The  ivacaftor  granules  are  manufactured  by  direct  compression,  using  three  main  steps: 
blending,  compression  and  filling  into  sachets.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process.  
Critical process parameters, design space limits (DSL) and normal operating ranges (NORs) have been defined. 
Design spaces have been proposed for all steps of the manufacturing process of Kalydeco granules (same for 
all strengths), except filling. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis 
data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual inspection), identification (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), , physical form (XRPD), water content (Karl Fischer), microbial limits (TAYMC, 
TYMC, E.coli) (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification for Kalydeco 59.5 mg granules is the same as for the authorised Kalydeco 25 mg, 50 mg and 
75 mg granules. The specification is considered acceptable.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk assessment considered 
the potential contributions from the ivacaftor active substance and SDD (including solvents, reagents, 
excipients, and equipment), water, granule excipients, and manufacturing equipment to determine the 
overall contribution of elemental impurities to the ivacaftor granules. Batch analysis data from representative 
batches including three commercial scale batches of active substance and SDD from each manufacturer using 
a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 19/87 
 
 
 
can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that the  
risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product is low, and the product 
will consistently meet the nitrosamine impurities requirement. Therefore, no specific control measures on 
nitrosamines are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
No information on reference standards has been provided. This is acceptable since the same standards used 
for the active substance is used for the ivacaftor granules. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for all approved ivacaftor granules strengths and the newly applied 59.5 mg strength 
is 48 months.  
The shelf life is supported by the following: 
• 48 months of long term (25 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5% RH; 30 ± 2 °C, 75 ± 5% RH) and 6 months of accelerated 
(40 ± 2 °C, 75 ± 5% RH) stability data for three primary stability lots of the 25 mg and 100 mg strengths 
manufactured and packaged in the commercial configuration. 
• 48 months of long term (25 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5% RH; 30 ± 2 °C, 75 ± 5% RH) and 6 months of accelerated 
(40 ± 2 °C, 75 ± 5% RH) data for 3 primary stability lots of the 25 mg strength manufactured and packaged 
in the commercial configuration. 
• 12 months of long term (25 ± 2°C, 60 ± 5% RH; 30 ± 2°C, 75 ± 5% RH) and 6 months of accelerated (40 
± 2 °C, 75 ± 5% RH stability data for two primary stability lots and 24 months of long term and 6 months of 
accelerated stability data for one primary stability lot of the lowest bracketing strength (5.7 mg) 
manufactured and packaged in the commercial configuration. 
The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. Since all strengths are packaged from bulk granules of the same 
composition and have the same packaging configuration, the proposed bracketing  
from the approved Kalydeco granules strengths (25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg) and the additional 5.7 mg and 
100 mg strengths (not proposed for marketing). Therefore, the stability conclusions from the 5.7 mg, 25 mg, 
and 100 mg granule strengths are applicable to the new strength 59.5 mg granules. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, physical form 
and microbial limits. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 20/87 
 
 
 
All batches met commercial specifications at all time points at 25 °C/ 60% RH and 6 months at 40 °C/ 75% 
RH. The data provided demonstrate that the finished product is stable when packaged in sachets under all 
storage conditions and is supportive of a 48 month shelf life for all granules strengths. 
The post-approval stability protocol and the stability commitment are considered acceptable. 
Photostability testing was performed on one batch of ivacaftor granules after direct exposure of the granules 
to 1 x ICH visible and 3.7 x ICH UV light according to ICH Q1B (option 2). The results show that the granules 
are not  sensitive to light. 
As reported for the authorised granule strengths, an in-use stability study in food was also conducted in 
support of the SmPC instructions to administer the granules with mixed with 5 mL of age appropriate soft 
food or liquid. Samples were tested for assay, degradation products, dissolution, and physical form. 25 mg 
and 100 mg strength sachets were stored through 48 months at 30 °C/7 5% RH and then mixed with foods 
(applesauce, infant formula, non fat-yogurt, carrot puree and water) and tested after 1-hour contact time at 
room temperature. All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years for all granule strengths as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.  
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Kalydeco  59.5  mg  granules  in  sachet  is  a  line  extension  of  approved  Kalydeco  25  mg,  50  mg  and  75 mg 
granules in sachet. The new 59.5 mg ivacaftor granules differ from the approved Kalydeco granules strengths 
of 25, 50, and 75 mg, only with respect to the amount of granules that are filled into the sachets. Therefore, 
manufacturing  and  stability  conclusions  for  the  59.5  mg  ivacaftor  granules  are  bracketed  by  the  approved 
Kalydeco granules strengths. Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the 
finished product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the  finished product. The design spaces  have  been adequately verified. The results of tests 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
In  addition,  stability  data  provided  support  the  claimed  extension  of  the  shelf-life  to  48  months  for  the 
authorised 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg granules and the newly applied 59.5 mg granules.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
Assessment report

the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
n/a 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies supporting the new indication in the paediatric population 
but referred to previously submitted data. The previously conducted juvenile data were submitted again in 
this procedure upon request from CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Summary of previous data submitted related to juvenile and PK studies 
Two non-GLP dose range finding (DRF) studies and a PK study focussing on brain distribution with tezacaftor, 
and a pivotal GLP juvenile toxicity study with tezacaftor and ivacaftor were submitted in previous variation 
procedure and in the renewal procedure for Symkevi.  
In summary, the pivotal study in rats dosed from post-natal day (PND) 21-49 did not show toxicity at the 
highest dose, approximately two times the intended human exposure. However, in one of the DRFs it was 
observed that the dose directly above the NOAEL with a 4-fold exposure margin to human resulted in 
lethality of the pups. A PK distribution study showed that lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity 
in younger rats was associated with higher brain concentrations of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. Although not 
relevant for the human population of 6 years and older, relevance of this finding cannot be excluded for the 
younger population 2 years and older.  
2.5.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been conducted for ivacaftor in accordance with Article 8(3) 
(ca) and (g) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
The prevalence data are used in the Phase I studies to determine the exposure for each active substance 
included the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in all patients, irrespective of age. It is considered that with the 
extension of indication in children from 2 to less than 6 years of age will have minimal impact on the previous 
conclusions. Therefore, there will be no increase in environmental exposure to ivacaftor [VX-770] from the 
administration to this age group. The MAH’s justification of referring to the previously provided ERA is 
considered to be acceptable.

Ivacaftor is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Study VX-661-TX-038 was considered to be very relevant in the X/114 procedure, since dosing in the 
juvenile rat studies was from the post-natal day (PND) 21 or earlier, which corresponds to a human age of 
around 2 years.  
A discussion on the safety of Kaftrio in a juvenile population from 2 years of age was required by CHMP 
including the findings from pivotal and DRF studies, where lethality was seen in animals dosed from PND21 
with only a 4-fold exposure margin, P-pg expression maturation differences between humans and rats, 
substrate affinity differences between P-gp for both species, and brain exposure to tezacaftor and M1-TEZ 
The MAH provided findings from the DRF and TK profiling studies and concluded that neurotoxicity of 
tezacaftor in juvenile animals is related to P-gP expression levels in rats. Consequently, the timing and dosing 
were adjusted towards the P-gP expression maturation in rats. It can be agreed that it is very likely that 
juvenile toxicity of tezacaftor is related to the functionality of P-gP in rats and that this might also be the case 
in humans. It should be noted that the maturation of expression and functionality of animal transporters 
cannot be translated to humans. The MAH, based on a study from Lam et al. (2015) on the expression levels 
of P-gP in humans, concludes that expression levels are mature within 3-6 months after birth. Consequently, 
the MAH argues that the effects observed in rats are not relevant for children aged 2-6 years old. However, 
Nicolas and de Lange* (2019) was critical on the methods and design of the study conducted by Lam et al. 
Furthermore, they refer to some clinical (functional) data on experience with P-gP substrates suggesting that 
expression is not necessarily equally translated to the functionality of P-gP. Also, data on the functionality of 
P-gP in rhesus monkeys suggest maturation around 9 months, which would correlate to 1-2 years old infants. 
Therefore, the argument of the MAH that P-gP is at mature levels in infants 3-6 months old was not endorsed 
by CHMP.  
Finally, ivacaftor is not PBT substances. Considering the above data, ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.5.5.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH was asked to provide and discuss the juvenile toxicity data obtained from Study VX-661-TX-038 
with special regard to the conclusions on the toxicity of ivacaftor in juvenile rats and the relevance of these 
findings.  Since only one group of SD rats of 21-49 PND received tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in 
Study VX-661-TX-038 and considering the knowledge that CF patients older than 6 months have P-gp 
already fully developed, the above-mentioned juvenile toxicity study has been considered as of limited 
relevance to the line extension procedure X/114.  
There is uncertainty regarding the relevance of the effects observed in juvenile rats, particularly convulsions 
and lethality seen at doses of 4-fold human exposure. 
Ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The SmPC section 5.3 adequately reflects the non-clinical data supporting the extension of indication in 
children 2 to less than 6 years of age for Kalydeco granules. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A pivotal study, Study 111, a Phase 3, open-label, 2 part (Parts A and B), multicentre study was conducted in 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age. Part A evaluated the PK, safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
administered for 15 days to confirm a dose for Part B. Part B evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and 
efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA administered for 24 weeks.  
Additionally, a BA study, Study 012, was conducted in healthy adult subjects to support the use of granules 
in Study 111 in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. The ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/IVA 75-mg FDC tablet 
used in Study 012 is the same formulation approved for use in patients ≥12 years of age and patients ≥6 
years of age who weigh ≥30 kg.  
Additionally, a sensory study, Study 013, was conducted in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the sensory 
attributes of the oral granules. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 111 Part A  evaluated the PK of IVA (in combination with TEZ and ELX) in subjects 2 through 5 years 
of age as a primary objective. PK was a secondary objective in Study 111 Part B to assess whether target 
exposures previously shown to be safe and efficacious in older children and adults were achieved with the 
dosing regimens evaluated. To minimize the amount of blood collected in the paediatric subjects, sparse PK

sampling was used during Study 111, and a popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of 
the three drugs in children aged 2-5 years. Previously developed popPK models that described the PK of ELX, 
M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ and IVA in CF adults, adolescents, 6-11y subjects were updated with the final data 
from Study 111 and used to describe the exposures in children 2-5 years of age.  
Body weight was the only covariate found to have a clinically meaningful impact on IVA disposition in subject 
2 through 5 years of age. Overall, the final models demonstrated suitability for the simulations.  
The simulations results demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, the 
exposures were within the 5th to 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of 
age for both weight groups, although the median of the ELX exposures was below of the median seen in 
adults, (see Figure 1 below). M23-ELX exposures in some subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weighed 
≥14 kg were outside the 5th to 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age 
from Studies 102 and 103. These exposures are below the maximum steady-state AUC of 332 μg∙h/mL 
observed from Study 104 (ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h), and thus are within the adult 
exposure range previously shown to be safe and efficacious.  
The majority of TEZ exposures were within the 5th and 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for 
subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group. The individual M1-TEZ exposures for subjects 2 through 5 
years of age were higher than the M1-TEZ exposures in subjects ≥18 years of age but lower on a mean level 
than the M1-TEZ exposures in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing ≥30 kg who received the adult 
dose (see Table 1). The range of M1-TEZ exposures for subjects 2 through 5 years of age is also generally 
below the maximum steady-state AUC observed from previous clinical studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA (Studies 102, 
103, 104, and 106).  
Overall, it can be concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures were within the exposure range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.

Table 1 Summary of Steady-State Exposures in different age groups. 
Bioequivalence 
Study 012 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study to evaluate relative 
BA of an ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC granule formulation compared to a reference ELX 100 
mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC tablet formulation.  
Exposures of ELX were approximately 18% to 19% lower after administration of the FDC granules relative to 
the reference FDC tablet in study 012. However, the 90% CIs fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 
1.43, and the difference was deemed not clinically relevant. 
As compared with the already marketed tablet formulation, exposures of IVA were unchanged when 
administered as the FDC granules. TEZ AUC was unchanged, while TEZ Cmax was approximately 13% lower 
following administration of the FDC granules relative to the reference FDC tablet, but the respective 90% CI 
fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 1.43; therefore, the difference was deemed not clinically 
relevant. 
Bioavailability and food effect of the new ivacaftor dose strength 
Ivacaftor 
A new dose strength, i.e., ivacaftor 59.5 mg granules is proposed to dose children aged 2-5 years and 
weighing at least 10 kg. The comparative bioavailability and food effect have been investigated with the 150 
mg dose (2x75 mg) in studies VX12-770-012 and VX12-770-015 (assessed in EMEA/H/C/002494/X/0034/G). 
The conclusions regarding bioavailability and food effect for the 150 mg dose can be extrapolated to the 59.5 
mg strength because  formulations are qualitatively identical, quantitatively proportional, the same 
manufacturing method is used, and linearity of ivacaftor PK was shown for ivacaftor in the dose range 
between 25 and 250 mg.  
These investigations were conducted with the highest strengths/doses (worst case scenario) as required in 
the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence and the guideline on interactions. As the magnitude of 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 28/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
food effect for the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 150-mg tablet when administered with a 
high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions, the proposed dosage and administration recommendations for the 
granule formulation are the same as for the film-coated tablets, i.e., they are to be administered with fat-
containing food.  
Ivacaftor in combination with triple therapy  
Study VX20-445-012 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study to 
evaluate relative BA of an ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC granule formulation compared to a 
reference ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC tablet formulation.  
Exposures of ELX were approximately 18% to 19% lower after administration of the FDC granules relative to 
the reference FDC tablet in study VX20-445-012. However, the 90% CIs fell within the pre-specified bounds 
of 0.7 and 1.43, and the difference was deemed not clinically relevant. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Ivacaftor pharmacokinetics was shown to be dose proportional in the dose range between 25 mg to 250 mg.  
The dose proportionality of ELX/TEZ/IVA exposure between ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/ IVA 75-mg and ELX 80-
mg/TEZ 40-mg/IVA 60-mg FDC granules is expected based on the same formulation compositions and PK 
linearity of all 3 active substances. 
 Indeed, linear pharmacokinetics of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been demonstrated within the applied dose range. 
Concomitant use with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
Exposures of ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in CF patients aged 2 through 5 years of age receiving 
moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose modifications are similar to exposures in 
children aged 2 through 5 years of age or adults not receiving any CYP3A inhibitors, except from the 
exposure of M1-TEZ in children receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose adjustment in both 
weight groups. The Applicant stated that these exposures, which are approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th 
percentile of the exposure range for adults, still fall within the range of prior clinical experience. Newly 
submitted data, as requested, confirmed that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and adults 
seems to be similar. 
Intrinsic factors 
Special populations 
Hepatic Impairment 
CF-related liver disease has been observed in patients with CF as young as 2 years of age. Although 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment is relatively rare in patients 2 through 5 years of age with CF, liver 
disease of this severity was seen in a prospective study. The proposed dose regimen for CF patients 2 
through 5 years of age with hepatic impairment is based on the same approach used for older subjects.  
Variability of the steady-state AUC for ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of 
age is similar to or lower than the variability observed in subjects 6 years of age and older. In addition, based 
on the provided simulations, the exposure to ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ is similar between subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment, with the proposed dose reduction, and between subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Exposure to M1-TEZ and IVA is slightly lower with the proposed dose regimen in subjects with moderate

hepatic function as compared to subjects without hepatic impairment, however, it is still within the 5th to 
95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age for both weight groups.

No dose adjustment is recommended for CF patients 2 through 5 years of age with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. This is the same as was recommended for CF patients ≥6 years of age (ELX/TEZ/IVA Marketing 
Caution is recommended in CF patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. 
Effects of Sex 
IVA exposures for females were comparable to males. Effects of CF Disease Status 
There are no known clinically meaningful drug-disease interactions with ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 
through 5 years of age. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Drug-drug Interactions 
Effect of Co-administered Drugs on ELX/TEZ/IVA 
IVA (and also TEZ and ELX) are all extensively metabolized by CYP3A. Therefore, their exposures are 
expected to be reduced by concomitant use of CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant use of moderate 
to strong CYP3A inhibitors. 
Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors 
To account for the increase in exposures of IVA, (and also TEZ and ELX) a reduction in the dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA is recommended during co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
When co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil), or strong 
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin), 
the dose should be adjusted. 
CYP3A Inducers 
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, and St. John’s wort) with IVA or with ELX/TEZ/IVA is not recommended as they may decrease 
ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures and limit the effectiveness of the combination. This recommendation is 
consistent with the recommendation for IVA in CF patients of 4 months and older as well as ELX/TEZ/IVA in 
CF patients ≥6 years of age. 
Other Extrinsic Factors 
Doses of ELX/TEZ/IVA and IVA should be administered with fat-containing food.  
Clinical studies evaluating the effects of smoke exposure on the PK of IVA or ELX/TEZ/IVA have not been 
conducted. It is not expected, however, that smoke exposure will impact the PK of IVA (and ELX, and TEZ), 
since all of them are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A, which is not influenced by smoke exposure. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no new pharmacodynamic studies submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023

Mechanism of action 
Kalydeco contains the CFTR modulator ivacaftor. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator enhances the channel 
gating activity of the CFTR that is delivered to the cell surface. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated primary or secondary pharmacology studies in children 2 through 5 years of age are submitted. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
After administration of the FDC granules, exposures of IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-∞ and Cmax. 
As compared with the already marketed tablet formulation, exposures of IVA were unchanged when 
administered as the FDC granules. TEZ AUC was unchanged, while TEZ Cmax was approximately 13% lower 
following administration of the FDC granules relative to the reference FDC tablet, but the respective 90% CI 
fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 1.43;The MAH assumed a coefficient of variation of 35%, 
based on which 90% CI were widened to 0.7 and 1.4. This is not entirely in line with the bioequivalence 
guideline. However, the MAH has clarified that the granules formulation is not intended for the older age 
group, ie. >6 years old; therefore, the interchangeability issue is not relevant. In this respect, there is no 
need to pursue further the question of meeting bioequivalence criteria or widening the acceptance range.  
A popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of ivacaftor when used in combination with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Kaftrio) in children aged 2-5 years due to sparse blood sampling performed in study 111.  
The simulations demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, it can be 
concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of IVA exposures were within the exposure 
range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.  
The dose proportionality of ELX/TEZ/IVA exposure between ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/ IVA 75-mg and ELX 80-
mg/TEZ 40-mg/IVA 60-mg FDC granules is expected based on the same formulation compositions and PK 
linearity of all 3 active substances. Upon CHMP request, the MAH provided data which demonstrated the 
linear pharmacokinetics of ELX/TEZ/IVA within the applied dose range. 
Co-Administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
The MAH was asked to report the simulated exposures to ELX, TEZ, and IVA with the proposed dose 
reduction for concomitant use with strong and moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitors in children aged 2-5 years. The 
provided simulations show that exposures of ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in CF patients aged 2 
through 5 years of age receiving moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose modifications is 
similar to exposures in children aged 2 through 5 years of age or adults not receiving any CYP3A inhibitors, 
except from the exposure of M1-TEZ in children receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose 
adjustment in both weight groups. These exposures, which are approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th 
percentile of the exposure range for adults, still fall within the range of prior clinical experience. Newly 
submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and 
adults seems to be similar. 
Patients with hepatic impairment

CF-related liver disease has been observed in patients with CF as young as 2 years of age. Although 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment is relatively rare in patients 2 through 5 years of age with CF, liver 
disease of this severity was seen in a prospective study. The proposed dose regimen for CF patients 2 
through 5 years of age with hepatic impairment is based on the same approach used for older subjects.  
Variability of the steady-state AUC for ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of 
age is similar to or lower than the variability observed in subjects 6 years of age and older. In addition, based 
on the provided simulations, the exposure to ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ is similar between subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment, with the proposed dose reduction, and between subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Exposure to M1-TEZ and IVA is slightly lower with the proposed dose regimen in subjects with moderate 
hepatic function as compared to subjects without hepatic impairment, however, it is still within the 5th to 
95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age for both weight groups. 
Treatment of patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is 
not recommended. For patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of 
Kaftrio should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose. 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the 
exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients 
with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio. 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). 
Dosing recommendations 
For patients 2 through 5 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA is proposed to be administered with fat-containing food 
as follows (consistent with the dosing regimen evaluated in Study 111 Part B): 
• 
Patients weighing ≥14 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h (i.e. there is an evening 
dose of 75 mg of Kalydeco granules) 
• 
Patients weighing <14 kg: ELX 80 mg qd/TEZ 40 mg qd/IVA 60 mg qAM and 59.5 mg qPM (i.e. there 
is an evening dose of 59.5 mg of Kalydeco granules)  
The lowest weight CF patients 2 through 5 years of age were expected to be approximately 9 kg34 by the 
MAH. Exposures in patients of this weight are expected to be similar to CF patients weighing 10 to 14 kg 
(who were considered in the popPK modeling). Therefore, no minimum weight was specified in the proposed 
dose regimen by the MAH. 
The proposed dosing recommendations were not in line with the dosing recommendations used in the clinical 
study, as in the clinical study, patients were included with weight ≥ 10 kg, therefore the safety in children 
with a weight < 10 kg is unknown.  
Using an approach similar to that used to select the dosing regimen for subjects 6 through 11 years of age, 
popPK analyses describing the data from Study 111 demonstrated that this proposed dose regimen resulted 
in exposures of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age that are within the range of 
exposures that achieved efficacy in subjects ≥18 years of age. The simulation results also demonstrated that

the exposures of metabolites M23-ELX and M1-TEZ with the proposed dosing regimens are generally within 
the range of exposures in previous clinical studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA . Additional simulations 
showed that this proposed dosing regimen is optimal for patients 2 through 5 years of age. Exposure to M1-
TEZ in children aged 2-5 years receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose adjustment in both 
weight groups is approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th percentile of the exposure range for adults. Newly 
submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and 
adults seems to be similar. 
Although US CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of children 2 
through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, it is uncertain whether it also applies to the European 
population. Based on the 2021 Annual Report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry 
(ECFSPR) it can be assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less 
than 10 kg. Simulations were needed to anticipate whether adjusted dosing recommendations may be 
needed for children weighing 7 kg. simulations were requested to anticipate whether adjusted dosing 
recommendations may be needed for children with lower body weight. An increase for all analytes is 
observed, expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) for 
subjects weighing 7 kg than the simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight 
limit of 10 kg is proposed in the dosing recommendations for patients aged 2 to less than 6 years. This was 
adequately implemented by the MAH in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of IVA exposures were within the exposure range observed 
for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.  
After administration of the FDC granules, exposures of IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-∞ and Cmax.  
Exposure to M1-TEZ in children aged 2-5 years receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose 
adjustment in both weight groups is approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th percentile of the exposure range 
for adults. Newly submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-
5 years old, and adults seems to be similar. 
An increase for all analytes is observed, expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being 
approximately 35% greater) for subjects weighing 7 kg than the simulated exposures for children weighing 
10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed in the dosing recommendations for patients aged 
2 to less than 6 years. This was adequately implemented by the MAH in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

subject was free of infection with such organisms: 
• 
The subject did not have a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms within the 12 months 
before the date of informed consent.  
• 
The subject had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such organisms within the 12 
months before the date of informed consent, with the first and last of these separated by at least 3 
months, and the most recent one within the 6 months before the date of informed consent.

Prior and concomitant medications 
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, and 
herbal and naturopathic remedies, will be collected from each subject’s source documentation for medications 
taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation. 
For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled, details of prior medication will be 
documented only in the subject’s source documents. 
•  Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day 1 
Visit through completion of study participation. A stable treatment regimen is defined as the current 
treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before the Day 1 
Visit. Subjects should not initiate long-term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the

Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF 
are as follows: 
o  Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should 
remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o  Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of the study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be 
synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle 
of the inhaled antibiotic. 
o  Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same 
cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of the study drug on the Day 1 
Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first 
day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
•  Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically or up to 60 
mg daily for up to 5 days.  
•  Subjects who are using a bronchodilator should have their Multiple-breath Washout (MBW) 
assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in the protocol. 
Dose Modification for Toxicity 
Modifications of the study drug dose were prohibited. Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, individual 
subjects were withdrawn from the study, and dosing ceased. 
Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules 
In subjects who interrupted the study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator resumed study 
drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for the interruption.  
Liver Function Tests 
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin >2 
× ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 
to 72 hours and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a 
subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the 
following criteria are met: 
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criteria are met: 
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and 
no convincing alternative aetiology is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to 
Assessment report

Page 40/87 
 
 
 
baseline or are ≤ 2 x ULN, whichever is higher. Upon resumption of the study drug, transaminases and 
bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption 
threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation 
by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed aetiology. 
Rash 
Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a 
rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator may consider resumption of study 
drug if considered clinically appropriate.

Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis), standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmologic examinations, and physical 
examinations (PEs) 
Other Assessments 
Part B 
- 
Faecal samples for faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and calprotectin to assess exocrine pancreatic function 
and gastrointestinal inflammation, respectively.  
-  Blood samples for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to assess exocrine pancreatic function. 
-  Modified Facial Hedonic Scale to assess drug acceptability and palatability. 
Sample size 
Part A 
Approximately 14 subjects were planned to be enrolled in Part A. Sample size calculations were determined 
based on ELX and M23-445 estimates of clearance. Assuming that the variability in this age group was the 
same as the variability observed in adults, data from 14 subjects would allow at least 80% power to target a 
95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of clearance for ELX and M23-445. 
Part B 
A total of 75 subjects enrolled and were administered ELX/TEZ/IVA for up to 24 weeks, which was chosen to 
provide an adequate assessment of safety. 
No formal power calculation was performed. 
Assuming a dropout rate of 10% or 20%, approximately 63 or 56 subjects, respectively, were expected to 
complete Part B.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Randomization was not required because all subjects were treated identically. 
An interactive web response system was used to dispense dosage based on subject weight. 
Subjects and their legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) were not 
informed of their study-related LCI, sweat chloride (SwCl), faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), calprotectin, and 
immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) results during the Treatment Period (Part B only), regardless of whether 
the subject permanently discontinued treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses Sets  
The following analysis sets were defined separately for Part A and Part B. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 42/87 
 
 
 
The All Subjects Set included all subjects who were enrolled (defined as subjects having data in the clinical 
database for this study) or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set was used for all individual 
subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set was used for 
all safety analyses. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who were enrolled and carry the intended CFTR allele 
mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS was used to summarize subject demographics 
and baseline characteristics, and for analyses of all efficacy and PD endpoints, unless otherwise specified. 
Analyses methods  
Analysis methods for PD and efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 6. All P values are considered 
nominal.

The MMRM was used to estimate the within-group mean absolute change in SwCl through Week 24. The 
model included absolute change from baseline in SwCl (including all measurements up to and including Week 
24) as the dependent variable and visit as the fixed effect, with baseline SwCl value and genotype group (F/F 
vs F/MF) as covariates. The model was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees 
of freedom for the F-test of fixed effects were estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. An 
unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors. If the model estimation did 
not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure was used instead. Conditional on the observed 
data and covariates, missing data were assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of 
missing data was performed. 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed and finalized before the database lock. 
Sensitivity Analysis 
Not applicable because the primary endpoints were safety and tolerability assessments. 
Subgroup Analysis 
The absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 was analysed for the subgroup according to 
genotype group (F/F, F/MF).  
The same MMRM model was conducted for each subgroup, with the genotype group removed from 
covariates.  
Results 
Participant flow  
Part A 
A total of 18 subjects were enrolled in Part A. No subjects discontinued treatment or withdrew from the 
study.  
Part B 
The efficacy analyses in Part B were based on the FAS, which included 75 subjects. Overall, 74 (98.7%) 
subjects completed treatment and the study. One (1.3%) subject discontinued due to an AE.  
Recruitment 
Subjects were enrolled at 22 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. 
Study initiation: 19 July 2021 (the date the first eligible subject signed the informed consent form). 
Study completion: 03 June 2022 (the date the last subject completed the last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The global study protocol was amended twice; country-specific amendments were prepared for 1 country.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023

Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol dated 19 Jun 2020 was amended twice (Jun 2021 and Oct 2021). Changes mostly 
pertained clarifications and updates in definitions or measurements, i.e. ophthalmologic examinations were 
removed as part of the safety endpoint. Furthermore, the study population in Part B was expanded to include 
subjects who have at least 1 F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or an ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive CFTR 
mutation.  
Country-specific amendments were prepared for 1 country.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was amended once to create the SAP Version 2.0, dated 02 May 2022 to 
incorporated updates in Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) Version 3.0 and added planned analysis for Part B. 
Important protocol deviation (IPD) 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) was defined as any protocol deviation that may have significantly 
affected the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may have significantly affected a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. 
Part A 
One subject had an IPD in Part A related to eligibility criteria. The screening haemoglobin sample was 
haemolyzed upon receipt at the laboratory and was inadvertently not redrawn; therefore, exclusion criterion 
3 (haemoglobin <10 g/dL) could not be determined. Day 1 pre-dose laboratory results showed that 
haemoglobin was >10 g/dL. 
Part B 
No subjects had IPDs in Part B 
Baseline data 
Part B 
The mean population age was 4.1 years, and over half (54.7%) of the subjects were female. The majority of 
subjects (90.7%) were White, and 8.0% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 23 (30.7%) subjects had an F/F 
genotype, 52 (69.3%) subjects had F/MF genotypes (with 30 distinct F/MF genotypes represented), and no 
subjects had other ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive genotypes. At baseline, the mean SwCl was 100.7 mmol/L and 
the mean LCI2.5 was 8.41. The most common concomitant medications were those typically used for the 
management of CF.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The results of Study VX20-445-111 (Study 111) are submitted to support an extension of indication of IVA in 
combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA to include CF patients 2 through 5 years of age. Study 111 is a phase 3, 
multicentre study conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation.  
Principle of Extrapolation 
The extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years of age is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients and has been accepted for the extension of 
indication of Kaftrio to CF patients 6 through 11 years of age (EMEA/H/C//005269/X/0008) and Symkevi 
(TEZ/IVA) (EMEA/H/C/004682/X/0015). 
Consistent with the principles described in ICH E-16, extrapolation of efficacy from adults to a younger 
population based on comparable PK exposures and safety is acceptable, because the disease process in CF 
patients of all age groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. The defect of the defective chloride channels is already present at birth. Because ELX/TEZ/IVA 
targets the dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy is expected to be comparable in younger age groups 
compared to adults to be shown with a similar reduction in the pharmacodynamic parameter sweat chloride.   
Extrapolation of efficacy is also supported by previously demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies of CF 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age treated with other CFTR modulators (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA), which was 
comparable to the effect observed in adults.  
This is also outlined in the EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines 
for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) that describes the requirements of the application of the (partial) 
extrapolation, i.e., confirmation of the dose by PK study in children and bridging of safety and efficacy data in 
children. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In part B, subjects were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks according to the following schedule: 
• 
subjects <14 kg and ≥10 kg: ELX/TEZ/IVA 80 mg/40 mg/60 mg qAM granules and IVA 59.5 mg qPM 
granules 
• 
subjects ≥14 kg: ELX/TEZ/IVA 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg FDC granules and IVA 75 mg granules 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study drug 
could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (if they met the eligibility criteria for that study). 
Similar modification, interruption and discontinuation rules and prohibited medication rules are applied as for 
the adults in the marketing application studies and are acceptable. 
The study's primary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (part A) and the safety and tolerability 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA through Week 24 (Part B). Efficacy was a secondary objective and was only measured in Part 
B.  
Endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 56/87 
 
 
 
As safety is the primary objective in Study 111 Part B, efficacy parameters were defined as secondary 
outcome measures. This approach is acceptable.   
Sweat chloride, as a pharmacodynamic parameter, is an important parameter for measuring the effect of a 
modulator. In CF, sweat chloride is increased due to a defect in the CFTR modulator. This defect is assumed 
to be similar in the adult and paediatric populations. A decrease in SwCL can be considered as an effect on 
the underlying pathology.  
Pulmonary function test, i.e. multiple breath wash-out (MBW) for calculating LCI2.5 is considered important 
to measure an effect on the lungs, one of the most important affected organs in CF. The LCI2.5 can measure 
changes in the small airways. In CF, the small airways are affected earlier than the large airways. Therefore, 
the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the more preserved lung function in 
children than in adults. Changes in BMI z-score and height z-score inform over the nutritional status, while 
FE-1, faecal calprotectin and IRT inform over the pancreatic function. Thus all parameters inform about a 
different aspect of CF and are considered valuable.  
Statistics 
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Considering that acceptance of an extension of the indication could be based on similar exposure, 
safety, and efficacy as in adults and adolescents, a within-group change from baseline is considered 
acceptable to provide evidence of comparable efficacy with adults and adolescents.  
Each continuous efficacy and PD endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
that included visit as the fixed effect, with a baseline value of the efficacy variable and genotype group (F/F 
or F/MF) as covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy variable up to Week 24 
(inclusive).  
Study 111 was in line with the paediatric investigational plan (PIP). 
Currently, the granules are only asked to be indicated for children up to 5 years of age, while an unmet need 
in children older than 5 years of age and adults who cannot use tablets may exist for a formulation other 
than tablets. The CHMP considers unfortunate that the MAH does not further explore the possibility of making 
the granules available to other age groups, as there might be a need for patients who have difficulties 
swallowing tablets because of a concomitant disorder.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 75 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of the study drug, and 74 (98.7%) subjects 
completed treatment and the study. One subject discontinued due to an AE.  
The mean population age was 4.1 years, and over half (54.7%) of the subjects were female. The majority of 
subjects (90.7%) were White, and 8.0% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 23 (30.7%) subjects had an F/F 
genotype, 52 (69.3%) subjects had F/MF genotypes, with 30 distinct F/MF genotypes represented, and no 
subjects had other ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive genotypes. This population is considered representative of the 
intended population as established in the adult population.  
Of the studied population, 86.7% of the subjects did not use a modulator before. For patients with a specific 
gating mutation, modulator therapy is currently authorised for this age group. Therefore, the studied 
populations consisted of modulator-experienced and modulator naïve subjects.

Outcomes and estimation  
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, the outcomes of the efficacy parameters were results compared 
to baseline.  
Treatment with IVA in combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from 
baseline through Week 24 of -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6; P<0.0001). The CHMP has accepted a 
reduction of -10 mol/L in SwCl as clinically relevant. Therefore, the reduction in SwCl can be considered 
clinically relevant. This reduction is comparable with results observed in children aged 6 through 11 years of 
age and in the adult and adolescent populations.  
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease from 
baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -0.83 (95% CI: -1.01, 
-0.66; P<0.0001. The improvement (reduction) from baseline is smaller than the reduction observed in 
children 6-11 years (-1.71 (95% CI: -2.11, -1.30)). However, lung function in young children is better 
preserved than in children 6 through 11 years of age. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit is not unexpected. Of 
note, a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is not established for this population. 
Therefore, an effect larger than the natural variability might be regarded as clinically relevant. The 
improvement in the LCI2.5 over time will therefore indicate the efficacy of the drug in this young but still 
severely affected population. Results of the study have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Results of growth parameters were considered supportive of a benefit as they were stable or showed an 
improvement supporting the benefit of treatment. Also, markers of pancreatic function and inflammation 
were considered supportive as improvements in FE-1 level, Faecal calprotectin and serum IRT were observed.  
Subgroup analyses for different patient groups showed that the results in SwCl were somewhat better in the 
F/F patients, while the results of LCI2.5 were similar in the two subgroups. The results of both populations 
are generally in line with the overall group. In both groups, the observed improvements were considered 
clinically relevant demonstrating an effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Dosing regimen 
The investigated dosing regimen used in study 111 was different than the proposed recommended dose in 
the SmPC as in the SmPC no lower limit of weight was proposed. Therefore, the safety in children with a 
weight < 10 kg is unknown. CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of 
the children 2 through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, while it will still be close to the investigated 
10 kg. However, it needs to be justified that the lower weight cut-off applies to the European population. 
Based on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR), it can be 
assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less than 10 kg. As 
exposure data show that the % increase for all the analytes at weight at 9.5 kg was approximately 4%, the 
expected increase in AUCtau would be 24% in a child weighing 7 kg. The applicant argued that the weight of 
7 kg is not representative of this age group based on EU registry data. Instead, the applicant refers to 2021 
ECFSPR Annual Report, in which for CF patients 2 to 5 years of age the median BMI z-score range of 
approximately -1.5 to 0.75. Further calculations were then based on BMI z-score for age and weight for age 
chart. These would prove that no children would have a weight under 10 kg. However, the use of the range 
(across the countries) of median BMI is not considered. This means that 25% of patients could have a BMI 
below -1.5 and thus a weight below the argued corresponding weight of 10 kg. Moreover, the calculations of 
the applicant are based on the assumption that weight will follow the same percentile as BMI, which can be 
questioned because in CF growth is generally affected. As these calculations are based on questionable 
assumptions, it is uncertain whether the weight of 2-year-old children with CF is adequately identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 58/87 
 
 
 
Provided simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg demonstrated that the percent increase for all analytes is 
expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) than the 
simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed by 
CHMP in the dosing recommendation of section 4.2 of the SmPC similarly to the studied subjects included in 
Part B of Study 111. This was accepted by the MAH. 
It remains unclear as to the optimal age in F-heterozygotes to start Kaftrio considering that the indication of 
Kaftrio is broad including patients with severe CF as well as patients with less severe CF. In that light a post-
approval efficacy study for children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with 
Kaftrio was considered necessary. Such a study is less relevant in F/F homozygotes given that a PAES with 
another CFTR modulator Orkambi is already ongoing in the young patient population albeit that this will be 
with LUM/IVA and not ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
The MAH argued that 1) the benefits of early initiation with CFTR modulators have been demonstrated across 
multiple modulators, age groups, and genotypes through clinical studies, 2) CFTR modulators, including 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, treat the underlying mechanism of CF, and the treatment effect should be the same regardless 
of genotype. Furthermore, the MAH considered that the benefits of early initiation of CFTR modulators in 
patients with severe CF as well as patients with less severe CF are sufficiently supported by real-world data 
from the Kalydeco PAES (Study VX15-770-125) and the Orkambi PAES (Study VX18-809-128). 
However, in the CHMP view, the ongoing post-authorisation efficacy studies for Kalydeco and Orkambi in 
children 2 through 5 years will only provide further insight for children with a gating mutation (Class III) and 
children who are homozygous for F508del (Class II), respectively. These mutations are traditionally 
considered to cause severe CF. No further data will become available for subjects with residual function (F/RF 
mutations) with generally less burden of CF and a better prognosis through the ongoing PAES studies. 
Additionally, no longitudinal data will become available for subjects with F/MF mutations, although there is 
less question for these subjects with severe CF than those with less severe CF regarding the optimal age to 
start treatment. Therefore, a PAES study is considered relevant to provide further efficacy information 
especially in the less severe population such as the F/RF population. 
A future PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) receiving treatment with Kalydeco in 
combination with Kaftrio will provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the 
real world that is not already gathered through other studies.  
2.6.7.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of IVA in combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA in children from 2 to 5 years of age was a secondary 
objective of Study 111 Part B. The observed results in study 111 further supported the benefit of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
The CHMP agreed that partial extrapolation concepts can be applied for the assessment of the clinical data in 
this young age population.  
This is based on : 
1)the similarity of the underlying pathophysiology of CF adults and paediatric patients, 
2) the fact that PK exposures in patients from 2 to 5 years of age were within or generally within the range 
observed in subjects ≥18 years of age,  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 59/87 
 
 
 
 3) the effect in the SwCl being similar to the older ages group, efficacy in patients from 2 to 5 years of age 
can be partially extrapolated from data from the Phase 3 studies in CF subjects ≥6 years of age.  
Consistent with the efficacy demonstrated in subjects ≥6 years of age, a clinically improvement in SwCl, was 
observed. Other clinical parameters were supportive of efficacy. Collectively, these efficacy data support the 
benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
Provided simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg demonstrated that the percent increase for all analytes is 
expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) than the 
simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, upon CHMP’s request, a lower weight limit of 10 
kg was added in the dosing recommendation of section 4.2 of the SmPC similarly to the studied subjects 
included in Part B of Study 111. 
However, as the efficacy data remain limited in certain mutations in particular for less severe patients with 
F/RF mutations and the unanswered question of the optimal age to start Kalydeco in combination with 
Kaftrio, the CHMP requested the MAH to perform a PAES study (please refer to Kaftrio application) and collect 
efficacy data post-approval for children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment 
with Kaftrio.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs of rash.  
Part A 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Three (16.7%) subjects had nonserious elevated transaminase events, all of which were assessed by the 
investigator as moderate in severity, and none of which led to study drug interruption or discontinuation.  
Rash Events 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 64/87 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Four (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events. All events were assessed by the investigator 
as mild in severity. None of the events was serious or led to study drug interruption or discontinuation. All 
rash events had an outcome of being resolved.  
Part B 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Eight (10.7%) subjects had elevated transaminase events. 
All of the events were mild or moderate in severity. None of the events was serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation. Elevated transaminase events led to treatment interruption in 1 (1.3%) subject. The 
elevated transaminase events had a mean (SD) duration of 24.8 (24.8) days, and the mean (SD) time-to-
onset of the first event was 50.0 (52.0) days. 
Rash Events 
Fifteen (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity; none 
were serious. Twelve of the 15 subjects had rash events that were assessed by the investigator as not 
related or unlikely related to the study drug or were confounded by concurrent viral symptoms. Two subjects 
had rash events that led to treatment interruption, both of whom resumed the study drug without recurrence 
of the rash. There were no study drug discontinuations due to rash events. 
By sex, 4 (9.8%) female subjects and 11 (32.4%) male subjects had a rash. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Part A or Part B.  
Serious adverse events  
Part A 
No subjects had SAEs. 
Part B 
Two (2.7%) subjects had SAEs: 
•  One subject had concurrent SAEs of anal incontinence (mild in severity), urinary incontinence 
(moderate in severity), and abnormal behaviour (moderate in severity). On Study Day 66, the 
subject had behavioural changes (hyperactivity and aggression) with increased urinary urgency and 
enuresis. From Study Days 80 to 113, the study drug was interrupted and resumed twice, with 
reported improvement of symptoms within 1 to 2 days upon study drug interruption and return of 
symptoms within 1 to 2 days upon resumption. The study drug was discontinued on Study Day 127. 
The investigator did not consider the subject’s behavioural changes outside of what is typically seen 
in the subject's age group but assessed these events as possibly related to the study drug.

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events that led to Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Part A 
No subjects had AEs that led to discontinuation of the study drug. 
Part B 
One (1.3%) subject had an SAE of abnormal behaviour that led to discontinuation of the study drug. 
The event was moderate in severity and assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug. 
The study drug was withdrawn, and the events resolved in a few days. 
Adverse Events that led to Interruption of Study Drug 
Part A 
One (5.6%) subject had AEs of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia of that led to treatment interruption. 
The AEs were mild in severity and assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug. The AEs 
resolved, the subject resumed ELX/TEZ/IVA, and completed dosing.  
Part B 
Five (6.7%) subjects interrupted their study drug due to AEs. 
• 
Two subjects interrupted the study drug due to AEs of rash. Both rash events were moderate in 
severity; one was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug, and the other as 
unlikely related to the study drug. The events resolved, and both subjects resumed the study drug 
with no recurrence of the rash.  
•  One subject interrupted study drug due to concurrent SAEs of anal incontinence and urinary 
incontinence. The SAE of anal incontinence was mild in severity and the SAE of urinary incontinence 
was moderate in severity. Both SAEs were assessed by the investigator as possibly related. The 
events resolved, and the study drug was resumed. 
•  One subject interrupted the study drug due to an AE of aggression, which was moderate in severity 
and assessed by the investigator as possibly related. The event was resolved, and the study drug was 
resumed with no recurrence of the event. 
•  One subject interrupted the study drug due to AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT increased, which were all 
mild in severity and assessed by the investigator as not related. The subject enrolled in an open-label 
extension study on study drug interruption.

2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
As of 23 January 2022, 8,728 patients were exposed to IVA worldwide since the authorisation for a total of 
29,122.3 PY: 5,046 patients in the US, 1,228 patients in the EEA, 1,201 patients in the UK, 280 patients in 
Australia, 192 patients in Canada, 27 patients in Israel, 14 patients in Switzerland, 18 patients in Brazil, and 
36 patients in New Zealand. Globally, 573 patients received Kalydeco in various managed access programs. 
As of 20 July 2022, it is estimated that 57,577 patients (representing 70,506 person-years) have been 
exposed to ELX/TEZ/IVA worldwide through commercial access or compassionate use programs. Of these 
57,577 patients, 25,687 were from US commercial use. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set to support the application in children aged 2 through 5 years of age is provided by the 
single-arm, open-label study VX20-445-111, where 18 (Part A) and 75 (Part B) patients were treated for 2 
weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. The mean exposure was 23.8 weeks (part B). As the provided safety data 
set is limited to support chronic use, extrapolation of the safety results obtained in children 6 through 11 
years of age and the data obtained in adults and adolescents are also supporting this application.  
IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA were generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as 
shown by the reported low number of serious adverse events (0% in part A, 2.7 % in Part B), treatment 
interruptions (5.6% in Part A, 6.7% in Part B) and treatment discontinuations due to AE (0% in Part A, 1.3% 
in Part B). Overall, these findings are in line with the findings in children 6 through 11 years of age and the 
data obtained in adults and adolescents.  
Adverse events, related adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
In Part A, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening AEs. Five 
subjects (27.8%) had a related AE. In Part B, seventy-four (98.7%) subjects had at least 1 AE. All AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening AEs.  
The most common AEs (≥10% incidence overall) by PT were cough, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, vomiting, COVID-
19, nasal congestion, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, ALT increased, and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF. The AEs were mostly likely connected with manifestations or 
complications of CF, common illness in subjects 2 through 5 years of age or with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
In Part A, one (5.6%) subject had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug, 
and 4 (22.2%) subjects had AEs that the investigator assessed as possibly related.  
In Part B, no subjects had a related AEs and 32 (42.7%) subjects had AEs that were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related. The number of treatment-related adverse events (related and possibly 
related) is consistent with the parent study 102 (47.6%) and study 106 Part B in children 6 through 11 years 
of age (50%). In part B, the related AEs were mostly consistent with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Related AEs were dominated by cough (10.7%), ALT increased (9.3%), rash (5.3%) and AST (4.0%). Next, 
AEs in SOC Psychiatric disorder were frequently observed, i.e., the PTs aggression, irritability and 
psychomotor hyperactivity, each 4%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 72/87 
 
 
 
 
In children 6 through 11 years of age, behavioural AEs were also observed; these were aggression, anxiety 
and depressed mood, each 1 event (1.5%). Aggression and irritability occur more often in children of 2-5 
years compared to 6-11 years. Because of the relatively low number of patients in the studies, the low 
incidence of the AEs and the absence of a placebo arm, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion. However, 
the numbers are higher than in the adult/adolescent population (abnormal dreams, anger and libido 
decreased, each 0.5%).  
There are no analyses of de-challenge or positive rechallenge of the identified cases. Overall, based on the 
low number of cases and absence of de-challenge or rechallenge cases, it is agreed with the MAH not to 
include new psychiatric-related AEs in the product information of the granule formulation. Currently, there 
are three post-authorisation studies in the pharmacovigilance plan for the safety concern “use in children 
aged 2 to 11 years”, the ongoing PASS (final report 2025), study 107 with the final report in February 2023 
and the open-label extension study (study 112), which will be finalised in June 2025. In addition to these 
already planned activities, the MAH has confirmed to monitor and analyse psychiatric-related AEs in the 
PSURs for all -patients groups in the 3 age categories.  
Only in Part B, 2 (2.7%) SAEs were observed, one subject with concurrent SAEs of anal incontinence, urinary 
incontinence, and abnormal behaviour. The investigator did not consider the subject’s behavioural changes 
outside of what is typically seen in the subject's age group but assessed these events as possibly related to 
the study drug. Another subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF that was assessed by the investigator as 
moderate in severity and not related to study drug. Overall, the number of SAEs is low, consistent with the 
finding in children 6 through 11 years of age and lower than in adults and adolescents and therefore 
supportive for safety.  
There were no deaths in study 111. 
Adverse events of specific interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs of rash. 
In Part A, three (16.7%) subjects had nonserious elevated transaminase events, all moderate in severity, 
none of which led to studying drug interruption or discontinuation. In Part B, eight (10.7%) subjects had 
elevated transaminase events, specifically, 8 (10.7%) subjects had ALT increased, and 4 (5.3%) subjects 
AST increased. None of the events was serious or led to treatment discontinuation, while in 1 (1.3%) subject 
led to treatment interruption. To be included in part B of Study 111, subjects must have had no elevated 
serum ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN at screening and in the previous year; the latter was 
not an exclusion criterion in the other studies. This may have led to the inclusion of healthier subjects. 
Despite the more stringent exclusion criteria, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST elevations were quite 
similar, while threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events. Nevertheless, this is not considered 
worrisome because elevation of ALT and AST are more common in children compared to adults. Therefore, no 
further action is required as section 4.4 the SmPC currently recommends monitoring of transaminases (ALT 
and AST) and total bilirubin prior to initiating treatment every 3 months during the first year of treatment 
and annually thereafter for all patients. 
The number of ALT increased is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 (10.6%)) and 
to the number in adults and adolescents (20 (9.9.%)) in study 102. However, as the frequency is higher in 
children 2 through 5 years of age and in children 6 through 11 years of age, the table in section 4.8 has been 
updated to frequency very common (> 1/10) for ALT increased.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 73/87 
 
 
 
 
Regarding rash, 4 (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events in Part A, while 15 (20.0%) 
subjects in Part B. This is generally similar to the subjects 6 through 11 years of age and higher than in the 
adults and adolescents. However, rash occurs frequently in young children as symptoms of a common viral 
disease of the youth.  All above ADRs are described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Discontinuations and disruptions of medication 
Only in Part B 1 subject discontinued due to an SAE of abnormal behaviour.  
Regarding disruption of medication, in Part A 1 (5.6%) subject interrupted medication because of unrelated 
AEs of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. In Part B, 5 (6.7%) subjects interrupted the study drug due to 
AEs i.e., 2 subjects with rash, 1 subject with anal and urinary incontinence, 1 subject because of aggression, 
and 1 subject because of elevation of AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT. 
The event of hyperamylasaemia and hyperlipasaemia considered unrelated to study drug indicates 
involvement of the pancreas, one of the earliest- and most commonly- affected organs in patients with cystic 
fibrosis. Therefore, the events can be considered a complication of CF.  
The event of anal and urinary incontinence, assessed by the investigator as possibly related, occurred in the 
same subject as the aggression. The events resolved, and the study drug was resumed without reoccurring 
events. Behavioural changes, including incontinence in young children, are difficult to interpret. No further 
conclusions can be drawn from this one case. No further action is required for these cases. Increases in liver 
enzymes and rash are known effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA and have already been adequately addressed in the 
SmPC section 4.8.   
Liver Function Tests 
The findings are generally in line with the results found in the study in children 6 through 11 years of age and 
the studies in adults and adolescents, and there were 4 (22.2%) subjects in Part A and 6 subjects (8.0%) 
with ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 3 (16.7%) subjects of whom in Part A and 2 (2.7%) in Part B had ALT or AST >5 
× ULN, and 1 (5.6%) of whom in Part A and 1 (1.3%) in Part B had ALT or AST >8 × ULN. No subjects had 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN. One patient had AST > 20 x ULN. Overall, the findings are in line with the known 
profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
A total of 5 subjects had QRS duration >89 msec on the ECG. For three of the five subjects, the prolongation 
of the QRS duration remained stable at subsequent visits, for the other two subjects QRS was prolonged on 
only one occasion, with all prior and subsequent ECG measurements in the normal range. Therefore, it can be 
concluded that for these subjects, the observed QRS prolongation was not related to Kaftrio. 
One subject had an AE of lenticular opacity. In the other investigations, i.e., vital signs, pulse oximetry, 
physical examinations, no trends were observed, and no subjects had AEs related to any of the 
investigations. 
2.6.10.  Conclusion on clinical safety 
The safety in subjects 2 through 5 years of age is based on the safety data set provided by the single-arm, 
open-label study VX20-445-111 and the extrapolation of safety data obtained in children 6 through 11 years 
of age and the data obtained in adults and adolescents. 
IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA were generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as 
shown by the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment discontinuations and interruptions.

The safety findings in subjects are generally in line with the known safety profile of IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA and 
are similar to the findings in children 6 through 11 years of age and to adults and adolescents.  
Nevertheless, safety data remain limited for this patient population. Safety data will also be collected and 
provide further safety information post approval. The OLE extension study is included in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
RMP.

2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The modification 
introduced is minimal compared to the existing PI. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for is: Kalydeco granules are indicated in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less 
than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in 
the CFTR gene that result in the absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface, which is 
responsible for the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride 
transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF.  
The aim of the therapy is to improve CFTR through the cell an at the cell surface resulting in an improvement 
in the target organs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 77/87 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
CFTR modulators such as ELX/TEZ/IVA are currently important therapies as they have the potency to modify 
the progress of the disease by maintaining or improving the lung function, reducing the risk of exacerbations 
and improving quality of life. A second type of therapy is symptomatic therapy, which targets specific disease 
symptoms, such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics. 
Within the modulators, correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexacaftor) and potentiators (such as ivacaftor) 
are distinguished. While the correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of mutant CFTR to 
increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, potentiators enhance the CFTR's channel gating 
activity, which is delivered to the cell surface. Modulator therapy improves chloride transport at the cell 
surface. 
Kalydeco granules are currently indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infants aged at least 4 
months, toddlers and children weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H 
CFTR mutation or one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, 
G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Kalydeco granules are proposed to be indicated in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less 
than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) and Kaftrio (elexacaftor/ tezacaftor/ivacaftor ) 
are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations. Of these modulators for use in CF 
patients 2 through 5 years of age, Kalydeco is indicated for a specific gating mutation or R117H mutation and 
Orkambi in subjects with F/F mutation.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is study 111, a phase 3, open-label, 2-part (Parts A and B), 
multicenter study in subjects 2 through 5 years of age. Study 111 is conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B) in 
CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation 
(F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype). A total of 18 (Part A) and 75 (Part B) subjects 
were treated for 2 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. 
The results of BA Study 012 in healthy adult subjects to support the use of granules in Study 111,  
simulations and the updated popPK models, which included PK data from adults and adolescents, were used 
to select a dosing regimen for study 111 Part B. 
The recommended total daily dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA for patients 2 through 5 years of age was evaluated, i.e.  
• 
• 
Patients weighing ≥14 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients weighing ≥10 kg to <14 kg: ELX 80 mg qd/TEZ 40 mg qd/IVA 60 mg qAM, 59.5 mg qPM 
The primary objective was safety; efficacy was the secondary objective.  
The secondary endpoints included Lung Clearance Index (LCI2.5), sweat chloride (SwCl). Other endpoints 
included growth parameters, including z-scores.  
The extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients. Consistent with the principles described in 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 78/87 
 
 
 
ICH E11 and EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for 
paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018), extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger paediatric patients may be 
possible when 1) a medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric patients for the same indication as 
those studied in older paediatric patients, 2) the disease process is similar, and 3) the outcome of therapy is 
likely to be comparable. In CF, the disease process in all age groups stems from a common aetiology of 
dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA and because ELX/TEZ/IVA targets the 
dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy in younger age group is expected to be comparable to adults.  
A popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of the three drugs in children aged 2-5 
years due to sparse blood sampling performed in study 111.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PopPK simulations results demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, 
the exposures of all compounds, including their metabolites, were within the 5th to 95th percentile of the 
observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age for both weight groups; although the median of the 
ELX exposures was below the median seen in adults.  
Treatment with IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through 
Week 24 of -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6; P<0.0001). This reduction is generally comparable to the 
observed reduction in the children aged 6 through 11 years of age (LS mean difference from baseline -60.9 
mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2) as well as in the adult and adolescent population (LS mean difference from 
baseline - 41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3) and -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1) in patients with 
F/MF mutations and with F/F mutations, respectively). Treatment with IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an 
improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5; the LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from 
baseline through Week 24 was -0.83 (95% CI: -1.01, -0.66; P<0.0001 and the yearly event rate for Pex was 
0.32. 
Subgroup analyses for different patient groups (F/F or F/MF) showed that the results in SwCl were somewhat 
better in the F/F patients.  
Growth parameters normalised for age were stable or showed an improvement; LS mean absolute changes 
from baseline at Week 24 were for weight z-score: 0.02 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.09), for height z-score: -0.06 
(95% CI: -0.11, 0.00) and BMI z-score: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.20).  
Also, improvements were observed for the markers of pancreatic function and inflammation.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The number of patients is limited, but all but 1 patient finalized the treatment.  
Only subjects with the F/MF genotype and F/F genotype were enrolled, while the indication allows for a 
broader population. However, studies that included adults and adolescents have proved that the effects 
observed in the population with the F/MF genotype or F/F genotype are similar to other genotypes that have 
at least one F508del mutation. Therefore, the study has external validity for the proposed indication. 
The safety in children with a weight < 10 kg is unknown because the study investigated subjects with a 
weight ≥ 10 kg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 79/87 
 
 
 
Although US CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of children 2 
through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, it is uncertain whether it also applies to the European 
population. Based on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry 
(ECFSPR) it can be assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less 
than 10 kg. Therefore, simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg were performed that demonstrated an 
approximately 30% increase of the analytes (and with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater). Therefore, 
a lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed for the dosing recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Therefore, only a within-group change from baseline is available.  
The improvement (reduction) from baseline in LCI2.5 is smaller than the reduction observed in children 6 
through 11 years (-1.71 (95% CI: -2.11, -1.30)). The treatment effect is also smaller than accepted before 
as clinically relevant. The results of LCI2.5 were similar in the two subgroups.  
The approved Kalyedco indication in combination with Kaftrio in terms of genotype is broad. The optimal age 
to start treatment in relation to F heterozygotes is still uncertain. This is particularly relevant for F-
heterozygotes with less severe CF, for whom no data will become available through ongoing studies. 
Furthermore, no longitudinal data will become available for subjects with F/MF mutations, although there is 
less uncertainty for the subjects with severe CF than with less severe regarding the optimal age to start 
treatment. Consequently, the CHMP requested the MAH to perform a PAES in all children who are F 
heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio. It will 
provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the real world that is not already 
gathered through other studies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following safety findings are observed in Part B unless otherwise indicated. 
IVA in combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 
24 weeks. The safety findings 2 through 5 years of age are generally similar to the findings in children 6 
through 11 years of age and to adults and adolescents. 
The most common AEs (≥10% incidence overall) by PT were cough, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, vomiting, COVID-
19, nasal congestion, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, ALT increased, and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF.  
SAEs: One SAE of anal and urinary incontinence and abnormal behaviour was possibly related. The other SAE 
was a not related infective PEx of CF. Overall, the number of SAEs is low, consistent with the finding in 
children 6 through 11 years of age and lower than in adults and adolescents. There were no deaths.  
Related/possibly related AEs and SAEs: The number of related/possibly related AEs and SAEs was 42.7% and 
2.7%, respectively. Overall, the related AEs were mostly consistent with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the related AEs aggression, irritability and psychomotor hyperactivity, each 4%, in 
SOC Psychiatric disorder were observed. This is in line with observation in the population of children 6 
through 11 years of age, in which aggression, anxiety and depressed mood, each 1 event (1.5%) were 
observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 80/87 
 
 
 
 
 
AESI Elevated transaminase events: 8 (10.7%) subjects had elevated transaminase events, of which 1 
(1.3%) led to treatment interruption. Specifically, 8 (10.7%) subjects had ALT increased, and 4 (5.3%) 
subjects AST increased.  The number is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 
(10.6%)) and to the number in adults and adolescents (22 (10.9%)) in study 102.  
The number of ALT increased is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 (10.6%)) and 
to the number in adults and adolescents (20 (9.9.%)) in study 102. The frequency is higher in children 2 
through 5 years of age and in children 6 through 11 years of age, therefore, the section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
amended to reflect the frequency as very common (> 1/10) for ALT increased.  
AESI Rash events: in Part A 4 (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events, while 15 (20.0%) 
subjects in Part B. This is generally similar to the subjects 6 through 11 years of age and higher than in the 
adults and adolescents. However, rash occurs frequently in young children as a symptoms of a common viral 
disease of the youth.  
Discontinuations and disruptions of medication: One subject discontinued due to an SAE of abnormal 
behaviour. Disruptions occurred in 1 (5.6%) subject in Part A because of unrelated AEs of hyperamylasemia 
and hyperlipasemia and in 5 (6.7%) subjects in Part B because of the following AEs: 2 subjects with rash, 1 
subject with anal and urinary incontinence, 1 subject because of aggression, and 1 subject because of 
elevation of AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT.  
Liver Function Tests: the findings of elevations of liver function test (AST, ALT, bilirubin) are generally in line 
with the results found in the study in children 6 through 11 years of age and the studies in adults and 
adolescents. No subjects had total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
To be included in part B of Study 111, subjects must have had no elevated serum ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN or 
total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN at screening and in the previous year; the latter was not an exclusion criterion in the 
studies in adults or children 6 through 11 years of age. This may have led to the inclusion of healthier 
subjects. Despite the more stringent exclusion criteria, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST elevations were 
quite similar, while threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events.  
AEs in the SOC Psychiatric disorder (aggression, irritability and psychomotor hyperactivity) appear to be 
higher in the population of children 2 through 5 years of age, 6 through 11 years of age or compared to 
adults. Because of the relatively low number of patients in the studies, low incidence of the AEs and the 
absence of a placebo arm, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion.  
Overall, there is uncertainty on long term safety in children 2 to less than 6 years of age. The open label 
extension study and PASS planned studies will address this uncertainty. In addition to the two planned PASS 
studies as aPhV activities in the Kaftrio RMP, monitoring and analysis of the psychiatric-related AEs in the 
PSURs for all age groups will be presented in 3 age categories for the 2 products.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects  
Previously developed popPK models that described the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in CF adults, adolescents, 6-
11y subjects were used to establish the exposure of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in children aged 2-5 years. Overall, it 
can be concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures were 
within the exposure range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group. 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline through Week 24 in SwCl is well above the CHMP accepted 
minimal improvement of approximately 10 mmol/l to be considered as clinically relevant.  
The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 of -0.83 is small and doubtfully 
clinically relevant as it is just below the natural variability.  
Strength of the evidence 
In CF, sweat chloride is increased, and a decrease can be considered as an effect on the underlying 
pathology. Therefore, the observed reduction in sweat chloride is an important parameter for measuring the 
pharmacodynamic effect. Besides the decline of lung function, pulmonary exacerbations impact survival in 
cystic fibrosis and reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions in

the rate of pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The observed 
reductions of SwCl and LCI are supported by all exploratory parameters, i.e. growth parameters and markers 
of pancreatic function and inflammation.  
Observed improvements in ppFEV1 and SwCl in children 2 to 5 years of age were consistent with previous 
results in children 6 through 11 years old and in adults and adolescent populations.  
Impact of the uncertainties 
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Therefore, only a within-group change from baseline is available.  
Based on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) it can be 
assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less than 10 
kg.  Therefore, a lower weight limit for children weighting less than 10 kgs was implemented in the dosing 
recommendations. 
The LCI2.5 can measure changes in the small airways. In CF, the small airways are affected earlier than the 
large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the more 
preserved lung function in children than in adults. The improvement (reduction) from baseline In LCI2.5 is 
smaller than the reduction observed in children 6 through 11 years and below the accepted limit as being 
clinically relevant. However, lung function in young children is better preserved than in children 6 through 11 
years of age. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit is not unexpected. Therefore, the results are doubtfully 
clinically relevant. 
Safety 
There is uncertainty regarding the relevance of the effects observed in juvenile rats, particularly convulsions 
and lethality seen at doses of 4-fold human exposure.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as shown by 
the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment interruptions and treatment discontinuations 
due to AE. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
To be included in part B of Study 111, the exclusion criteria for the hepatic function test were stricter, which 
may have led to the inclusion of healthier subjects. Nevertheless, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST 
elevations were quite similar, but the threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events. However, this is not 
considered worrisome because elevations of ALT and AST are more common in children compared to adults.  
The relevance of the observation of the related AEs in SOC Psychiatric disorder is unclear. This frequency is in 
line with observation in children 6 through 11 years of age but higher compared to the adults and 
adolescents population. As the limited clinical data do not allow for a firm conclusion, psychiatric disorders 
will be monitored post-marketing.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In this procedure, the extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years old is based on the principle of 
partial extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients. The extension must be supported by 
comparable PK exposures, acceptable safety, and a similar PD/efficacy effect.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443706/2023 
Page 83/87 
 
 
 
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations of clinical 
data from subjects 2 through 5 years of age, subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults 
confirmed that from a clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 14 kg weight cut-off 
for the applied dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
In study 111 in CF patients 2 through 5 years of age, efficacy was a secondary objective. Clinically relevant 
improvements were found in the changes from baseline for the SwCl. These improvements were consistent 
with previous results in subjects 6 through 11 years of age adults and adolescent populations, confirming the 
justification of partial extrapolation. Other endpoints were supportive of the finding in SwCl.  
IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA were generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as 
shown by the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment interruptions and treatment 
discontinuations due to AE. No new important risks were identified. Hepatotoxicity is already identified as an 
important potential risk. 
The earlier introduction of modulator therapy in younger patients from 2 years of age might be beneficial, as 
this modulator therapy has the potential to prevent the detrimental effects of CF. Considering these 
paediatric patients are treated in specialized clinics and frequently monitored, some more severe safety 
concerns, such as hepatotoxicity, are considered acceptable and manageable in clinical practice. In addition, 
the safety will be further substantiated in the follow-up extension study.  
The optimal age to start Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio in relation to certain F heterozygotes is still 
uncertain. In that light, the collection of efficacy data post-approval for children that are F heterozygotes 
(aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with Kaftrio needs to be further explored post approval. 
Consequently, the CHMP requested the MAH to perform a PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 
2-5 years) who will receive treatment with Kaftrio. It will provide further valuable information regarding the 
magnitude of effect in the real world that is not already gathered through other studies.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Kalydeco is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Symkevi, Kaftrio and TOBI Podhaler 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Kalydeco new strength is favourable in the following indication: 
In a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in 
paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.

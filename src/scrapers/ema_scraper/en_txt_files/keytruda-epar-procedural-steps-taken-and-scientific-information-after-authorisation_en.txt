in the population with PD-L1 positive tumours (secondary

(using AJCC 7th edition). These results were consistent 
when reclassified in a post-hoc analysis according to the

months of treatment initiation followed by a long-term 
survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy compared to chemotherapy (see section 5.1). 
No specific factor(s) associated with early deaths could be 
identified. Physicians should consider the delayed onset of 
pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in patients 
with urothelial carcinoma who are considered eligible for 
carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. 
Results of KEYNOTE 361 for pembrolizumab in combination 
with chemotherapy did not show statistically significant 
improvement in PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1 
(HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; p=0.0033), and OS (HR

chemotherapy alone. Per the pre specified hierarchical 
testing order no formal tests for statistical significance of 
pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy could be performed. 
The key efficacy results of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
patients for whom carboplatin rather than cisplatin was 
selected by the investigator as the better choice of 
chemotherapy were consistent with KEYNOTE 052 results. 
Efficacy results in patients whose tumours express PD L1 
with CPS ≥ 10 were similar to the overall population for 
whom carboplatin was selected as the choice of 
chemotherapy.

In KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients were 
based on interim results from study KEYNOTE-051; 
this is an ongoing Phase I/II, single-arm study to 
evaluate the PK, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, safety, 
and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in 
paediatric participants (Measure 2 of PIP01). 
Additionally, the results of study Study PD018 / PA-
0064; evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and 
PD-L2 in archival paediatric tumour tissues, were 
submitted (Measure 1 of PIP01).

administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
Pembrolizumab concentrations in these patients were 
comparable to those of adults at the same dose. 
Participants were enrolled across 28 tumour types by 
primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by 
histology were Hodgkin lymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma 
multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma 
(6.5%) and melanoma (5.2%). In patients with solid 
tumours and other lymphomas, the ORR was 5.9%, no 
patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had 
a partial response. In the Hodgkin lymphoma population, 
the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete 
response and 7 patients (38.9%) had a partial response. 
The safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally 
similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. 
The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 
20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), vomiting

Pembrolizumab doses of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg

(1.4%) patients, respectively. The median time to onset of 
severe skin reactions was 2.4 months (range 4 days to 
21.5 months). The median duration was 1.2 months (range 
3 days to 17.8+ months). Severe skin reactions led to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 5 (0.2%) patients. 
Severe skin reactions resolved in 36 patients. Patients 
should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions 
and other causes should be excluded. Based on the severity 
of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld 
or permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be 
administered. 
Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with fatal outcome, have 
been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab. For 
signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, pembrolizumab should 
be withheld and the patient should be referred to a 
specialised unit for assessment and treatment. If SJS or 
TEN is confirmed, pembrolizumab should be permanently 
discontinued.  
Caution should be used when considering the use of

The new data and analyses confirm the previous

immunogenicity, PK and exposure-response results for 
P006v01. Further, the ADR Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
and PL 
pembrolizumab. The new PK parameter estimates are very 
has been added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to revise 
the text referring to fatal cases of pneumonitis in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC, to implement minor 
editorial changes in the annexes, to align the SmPC, 
Annex II, labelling and Package Leaflet with the 
latest QRD template version 9.1, and to update the 
contact details of the local representative in 
Luxemburg in the Package Leaflet.  A revised RMP 
version 2.0 was provided as part of the application. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
similar to those previously calculated. Immunogenicity is 
confirmed to be very low, with an observed incidence of 
treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects of 0.3% (1 
out of 376). Exposure-response analysis confirmed the lack 
of a significant exposure-response relationship.  
Available efficacy results of Study P006 show a clinically 
meaningful advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab 
in IPI-naive patients with unresectable advanced 
melanoma. Regarding efficacy results in subgroups, it is 
acknowledged that the study was not sufficiently powered. 
Efficacy data of study P006 are already included in the 
Keytruda SmPC.  
Based on comparative safety data from study P006, no 
differences between pembrolizumab and ipilimumab treated 
patients in the rate of Grade ≥3 AEs (36.7% vs 35.5%), 
but a lower rate of Grade ≥3 drug-related AEs (11.7% vs 
19.9%), SAEs (25.2% vs 30.1%) and serious drug-related 
AEs (8.8% vs 17.6%) was reported with pembrolizumab. In 
addition, fewer patients in the pembrolizumab group 
discontinued treatment due to AEs (9% vs 13.3%). Since 
the exposure to pembrolizumab was three-fold longer than 
to IPI, comparison of arms during active treatment (i.e. 
week 0 - week 12) were provided showing a lower rate of 
drug-related AEs, including Grade ≥3 drug-related AEs and 
serious drug-related AEs,  in patients treated with 
pembrolizumab. The safety profile of the 2 drugs was 
slightly different from a quantitative point of view, with a 
Page 53/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher incidence of colitis with IPI and more commonly 
reported thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism, 
hypothyroidism) and pneumonitis with pembrolizumab. In 
addition, the time to Grade ≥3 AEs onset was shorter in the 
IPI arm and treatment interruption or discontinuation was 
required in a lower number of patients in the 
pembrolizumab arms. 
A new safety concern was identified based on data from 
study P006. At the cut-off date for safety analysis (3 Sep 
2014), 1 case of Grade 4 Guillan-Barré syndrome was 
reported in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. 
Subsequently, one case of acute motor axonal neuropathy, 
a form of Guillan-Barré syndrome (Grade 2) was diagnosed 
in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm and remained 
ongoing at the time of the interim analysis 2. Based on 
these events, the Guillan-Barré syndrome is now 
considered as an Important Identified Risk. In addition, 
new AEs reported in the study, such as optic neuritis 
(Grade 2), scleritis (Grade 2), Sjogren’s syndrome (Grade 
1), ankylosing spondylitis (Grade 1), rheumatoid arthritis 
(Grade 2) and Systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(1 Grade 1, 1 Grade 2 and 1 grade 3) are added to the 
SmPC.

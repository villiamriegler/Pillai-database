2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion on the orphan medicinal product designation was based on the following grounds: 
For the purpose of orphan designation, the Committee for Orphan Me dicinal Products (COMP) 
considered that the active substance should be renamed as “phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted 
to apolipoprotein C-III”. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotide targeted to apolipoprotein C-III was considered justified based on preclinical and 
preliminary clinical data in treated patients affected by the condition who responded to treatment 
with reduction of triglyceride levels; 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent episodes of acute 
pancreatitis which may lead to pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption, failure to thrive 
and diabetes mellitus;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although a satisfactory method of treatment of the condition has been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted to apolipoprotein C-III may be of 
significant benefit to those affected by the condition. This was based on preclinical and preliminary 
clinical data showing that the product has an alternative mechanism of action, which is expected to be 
effective in a broader population affected by the condition than the authorised product. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1)  (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted to 
apolipoprotein C-III, as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article  3(1)(a) of Regulation  (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose,  prev ent or treat a life- threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not m ore than fiv e in 10 thousand people in the Com m unity when the 
application  is m ade

Condition 
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with loss of function mutations 
of lipoprotein lipase resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and accumulation of chylomicrons in plasma, 
often leading to acute pancreatitis (Williams et al, J Clin Lipidol. 2018 Apr 27).  
The proposed therapeutic indication: 
“Waylivra is indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically  confirmed  familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS)  and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and 
triglyceride  lowering therapy has been inadequate”  
falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan indication: 
 “Treatment of familial  chylomicronemia  syndrome”. 
Intention  to diagnose,  prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition is considered justified.  
Chronically debilitating  and/or life-threatening  nature 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in seriousness since designation. 
It is acknowledged that the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent 
episodes of acute pancreatitis which may lead to pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption, 
failure to thrive and diabetes mellitus (Williams et al, J Clin Lipidol. 2018 Apr 27). 
Number  of people affected  or at risk 
The applicant refers to the initial designation and to the Orphanet Rare Disease collection (Orphanet 
Prevalence and incidence of rare diseases: Bibliographic data. June 2017. 
http://www.orpha.net/orphacom/cahiers/docs/GB/Prevalence_of_rare_diseases_by_alphabetical_list.p
df [Accessed October 2017) which currently estimates a prevalence for FCS of 1 per 100,000 of the 
European population.  
Based on that data, an approximately 0.1 per 10,000 figure was considered acceptable for this 
maintenance procedure. The COMP endorsed the proposal. 
Article  3(1)(b) of Regulation  (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory m ethods of diagnosis  prev ention or treatm ent of the condition 
in question, or, if such m ethods exist,  the m edicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected  by the condition. 
Existing  methods 
Currently, there are no approved products specifically indicated for the treatment of FCS. Dietary 
management is of paramount importance, with limitation of fat to less than 15 to 20 g per day, focus 
on complex carbohydrate foods, and supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and 
medium-chain triglyceride oil, as needed. (Williams et al, J Clin Lipidol. 2018 Apr 27). 
Also of note, that alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera) was an LPL gene therapy that has in the past been 
granted orphan designation for the treatment of homozygous LPL deficiency encompassing also a 
subset of FCS patients. However, the marketing authorisation expired in October 2017.

It was therefore considered by the COMP that no satisfactory treatments are authorised in the EU at 
the time of the review.

5.  COMP position adopted on 8 March 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.1 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent episodes of 
pancreatitis which may lead to pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption, failure to thrive 
and diabetes mellitus; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Waylivra, phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotide targeted to apolipoprotein C-III, volanesorsen, EU/3/14/1249 for treatment of familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

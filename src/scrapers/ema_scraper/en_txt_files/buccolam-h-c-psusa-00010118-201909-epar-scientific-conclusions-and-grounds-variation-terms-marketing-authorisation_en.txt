Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for midazolam (oromucosal solution, 
treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on events of oedema/swelling from spontaneous reports with use of Buccolam 
including some cases with a close temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, 
the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between midazolam (oromucosal solution, treatment of 
prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures) and angioedema is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing midazolam (oromucosal solution, treatment 
of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures) should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for midazolam (oromucosal solution, treatment of prolonged, 
acute, convulsive seizures) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal 
product(s) containing midazolam (oromucosal solution, treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive 
seizures) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
In adult women 
• 
• 
• 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to 
treatment with clomiphene citrate. 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian 
transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. 
GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the 
stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. 
In adult men 
• 
GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
The injection site should be alternated daily.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
The following table states the volume to be administered to deliver the prescribed dose:

Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the 
patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. 
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive 
days. 
Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
Solvent containing benzyl alcohol 
Following reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl 
alcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS 
may occur (see section 4.4). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both 
resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild 
inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
The following table states the volume to be administered to deliver the prescribed dose:

Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the 
patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. 
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive 
days. 
Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
Solvent containing benzyl alcohol 
Following reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl 
alcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS 
may occur (see section 4.4). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both 
resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild 
inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
In adult women 
• 
• 
• 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to 
treatment with clomiphene citrate. 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian

acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to 
use the proper injection techniques. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear 
instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for 
use”.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
GONAL-f 300 IU/0.48 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
2.

Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear 
instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian 
transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. 
GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the 
stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. 
In adult men 
• 
GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to 
use the proper injection techniques. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear 
instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to 
use the proper injection techniques.

Posology 
The dose recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment 
of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring 
procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal 
products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with GONAL-f compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of GONAL-f than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in 
order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation. See section 5.1. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and 
the multidose presentation of GONAL-f. 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, 
and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by 
the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the 
first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising 
hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the 
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of 
daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low 
endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in 
elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear 
instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and 
should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their 
management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to 
recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will 
minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with 
GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome,  higher  doses  of  exogenous  gonadotropins,  high  absolute  or  rapidly  rising  serum  estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared 
with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, 
especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number 
of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response 
cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, 
clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist 
or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an 
adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been 
reported during GONAL-f therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of 
follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
GONAL-f. 
Breast-feeding 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and 
a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a 
higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information  
How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use GONAL-f 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously).  
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the 
end of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor 
who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f.

HOW TO PREPARE AND USE THE GONAL-f POWDER AND SOLVENT 
• 
• 
• 
This section tells you how to prepare and use your GONAL-f powder and solvent. 
Before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first. 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 
1.  Wash your hands and find a clean area 
• 
• 
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. 
A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface. 
2. 
Get together everything you need and lay them out: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1 pre-filled syringe containing the solvent (the clear liquid) 
1 vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder)  
1 needle for preparation  
1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin 
Not provided in the pack: 
• 
• 
2 alcohol swabs 
1 sharps container 
3. 
Preparing the solution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the protective caps from the powder vial and from the pre-filled syringe. 
Attach the needle for preparation to the pre-filled syringe, insert it into the powder vial and 
slowly inject all the solvent. Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do not shake. 
Check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles. 
Turn the vial upside down and gently draw the solution back into the syringe by pulling the 
plunger. 
Remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully. Do not touch the needle and do not 
allow the needle to touch any surface. 
(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into 
another powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution. If 
you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines 
as an alternative to injecting each product separately. After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw 
the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f. Once the powder 
has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if 
the solution is not clear. Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 mL of solvent.) 
133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
Getting ready the syringe for injection 
• 
• 
Change the needle for the fine bore needle. 
Remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle 
pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top. Push the 
plunger until the air bubbles are gone. 
5. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Injecting the dose 
Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to 
inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site 
each day. 
Clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion. 
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like 
motion. 
Inject under the skin by pushing gently the plunger, as you were taught. Do not inject directly 
into a vein. Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution. 
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular 
motion.  
6. 
After the injection 
Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and 
empty glass containers safely preferably in the sharps container. Any unused solution must be 
discarded.

How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders.

Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
When prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 
75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The 
prepared solution can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the 
end of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes 
provided in the pack. 
If you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct 
amount for injection in mL from the following table:

Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor 
who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f. 
Other side effects in women 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
•

• 
• 
• 
This section tells you how to prepare and use your GONAL-f powder and solvent. 
Before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first. 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 
1.  Wash your hands and find a clean area 
• 
• 
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. 
A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface. 
2. 
Get together everything you need and lay them out: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
2 alcohol swabs 
The pre-filled syringe containing the solvent (the clear liquid) 
The vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder) 
An empty syringe for injection (see illustration below)  
3. 
Preparing the solution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the protective caps from the powder vial and from the pre-filled syringe. 
Take your pre-filled syringe, insert the needle into the powder vial and slowly inject all the 
solvent into the vial containing the powder. 
Remove the syringe from the vial and throw it away (put the protective cap to avoid injuries). 
This vial contains several doses of GONAL-f. You will have to keep it several days and only 
draw the prescribed dose every day.  
4. 
Getting ready the syringe for injection  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Swirl gently the vial of GONAL-f prepared in step 3, do not shake. Check that the solution is

Contents of the pack and other information  
How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
When prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 
75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The 
prepared solution can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the 
end of this leaflet called “How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes 
provided in the pack. 
If you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct 
amount for injection in mL from the following table: 
Dose to be injected (IU)

Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor 
who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f.

• 
• 
• 
This section tells you how to prepare and use your GONAL-f powder and solvent. 
Before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first. 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 
1.  Wash your hands and find a clean area 
• 
• 
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. 
A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface. 
2. 
Get together everything you need and lay them out: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
2 alcohol swabs 
The pre-filled syringe containing the solvent (the clear liquid) 
The vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder) 
An empty syringe for injection (see illustration below)  
3. 
Preparing the solution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the protective caps from the powder vial and from the pre-filled syringe. 
Take your pre-filled syringe, insert the needle into the powder vial and slowly inject all the 
solvent into the vial containing the powder. 
Remove the syringe from the vial and throw it away (put the protective cap to avoid injuries). 
This vial contains several doses of GONAL-f. You will have to keep it several days and only 
draw the prescribed dose every day.  
4. 
Getting ready the syringe for injection

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-
filled pen can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
use”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. 
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach 
room temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm 
up the pen.  
1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table 
or countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4). 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them 
well (Figure 5). 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
from the pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration 
date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say 
GONAL-f. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, 
colourless and does not 
contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the 
medicine is discolored or cloudy, 
as this can cause an infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback 
Window is set to “0” (Figure 
8). 
165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites 
to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise 
skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new 
needle for each injection. Re-using needles can 
cause infection. 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” 
needles supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not 
damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer 
needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that 
expiration date has not passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired 
or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is 
damaged or loose. Using expired needles or 
needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer 
needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away 
in a sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded 
tip of the GONAL-f pre-filled pen until you 
feel a light resistance (Figure 12).  
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle 
could be difficult to remove after the injection.  
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it 
gently (Figure 13). 
3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).  
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will 
prevent needle stick injury and infection when 
detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.  
3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the 
needle pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10 Carefully remove and discard the green 
inner needle shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner 
needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury 
and infection.  
3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for 
tiny droplet(s) of liquid.

If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 
17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet of 
liquid, proceed to Step 4 
Dial your dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for 
a droplet of liquid. Proceed 
directly to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
167 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
Note: The pen contains 150 IU follitropin alfa. The 150 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 
150 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments 
of 12.5 IU. 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150” IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
• 
Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up 
(Figure 22). 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2.  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained 
to do by your healthcare provider. 
5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin 
entirely (Figure 24).  
5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose 
setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob 
down as far as it will go and hold it to 
complete the full injection (Figure 25).  
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will 
take to inject. 
5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum 
of 5 seconds before you remove the needle 
from your skin (Figure 26). 
• 
The dose number shown in the Dose 
Feedback Window will turn back to 
“0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull 
the needle out of the skin while 
keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, 
release the dose setting knob. 
168 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove 
the needle from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface.  
6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured 
by the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle. 
Step 7 After the injection 
7.1 Check you have given a complete injection: 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window 
shows “0” (Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you 
have completed your dose.  
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number 
higher than “0”, the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is 
empty. You have not received your full 
prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 
below.  
7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when 
needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will 
indicate the missing amount you need to 
inject using a new pen. In the example 
shown, the missing amount is “50” IU 
(Figure 33). 
To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
169 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid 
infection (Figure 34). 
8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package 
Leaflet. 
8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare 
provider how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury.  
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

Instructions for use 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
171 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use GONAL-f 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-
filled pen can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
use”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. 
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach 
room temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm 
up the pen.  
1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table 
or countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4). 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them 
well (Figure 5). 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
from the pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration 
date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say 
GONAL-f. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, 
colourless and does not 
contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the 
medicine is discolored or cloudy, 
as this can cause an infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback 
Window is set to “0” (Figure 
8). 
181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites 
to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise 
skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new 
needle for each injection. Re-using needles can 
cause infection. 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” 
needles supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not 
damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer 
needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that 
expiration date has not passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired 
or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is 
damaged or loose. Using expired needles or 
needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer 
needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away 
in a sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded 
tip of the GONAL-f pre-filled pen until you 
feel a light resistance (Figure 12).  
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle 
could be difficult to remove after the injection.  
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it 
gently (Figure 13). 
3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).  
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will 
prevent needle stick injury and infection when 
detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.  
3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the 
needle pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10 Carefully remove and discard the green 
inner needle shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner 
needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury 
and infection.  
3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for 
tiny droplet(s) of liquid.

If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 
17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet of 
liquid, proceed to Step 4 
Dial your dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for 
a droplet of liquid. Proceed 
directly to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”.

6. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
Note: The pen contains 300 IU follitropin alfa. The 300 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 
300 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments 
of 12.5 IU. 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150” IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
• 
Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up 
(Figure 22). 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2.  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained 
to do by your healthcare provider. 
5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin 
entirely (Figure 24).  
5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose 
setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob 
down as far as it will go and hold it to 
complete the full injection (Figure 25).  
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will 
take to inject. 
5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum 
of 5 seconds before you remove the needle 
from your skin (Figure 26). 
• 
The dose number shown in the Dose 
Feedback Window will turn back to 
“0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull 
the needle out of the skin while 
keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, 
release the dose setting knob. 
184 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove 
the needle from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface.  
6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured 
by the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle. 
Step 7 After the injection 
7.1 Check you have given a complete injection: 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window 
shows “0” (Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you 
have completed your dose.  
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number 
higher than “0”, the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is 
empty. You have not received your full 
prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 
below.  
7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when 
needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will 
indicate the missing amount you need to 
inject using a new pen. In the example 
shown, the missing amount is “50” IU 
(Figure 33). 
To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
185 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid 
infection (Figure 34). 
8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package 
Leaflet. 
8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare 
provider how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury.  
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
187 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use GONAL-f 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
189 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-
filled pen can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
use”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
190 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. 
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

Always follow all directions in this Instructions for Use and training provided by your 
healthcare provider as they may differ from your past experience. This information will allow to 
prevent incorrect treatment or infection by needle stick or broken glass injury. 
The GONAL-f pre-filled pen is for subcutaneous injection only. 
Only use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if your healthcare provider trains you on how to use it 
correctly. 
Your healthcare provider will tell you how many GONAL-f pre-filled pens you need to 
complete your treatment. 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 
The numbers in the Dose Feedback Window represent the number of International Units, or 
IUs, and show the dose of follitropin alfa. Your healthcare provider will tell you how many IUs 
of follitropin alfa to inject each day. 
The numbers displayed in the Dose Feedback Window help you to: 
a.   Dial your prescribed dose (Figure 1). 
b.   Verify a complete injection (Figure 2). 
c.  
Read the dose remaining to be injected 
with a second pen (Figure 3). 
• 
Remove the needle from the pen immediately after each injection. 
Do not reuse needles. 
Do not share the pen and/or needles with another person.

Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged as 
this can cause injury. 
How to use your GONAL-f pre-filled pen treatment diary 
A treatment diary is included on the last page. Use the treatment diary to record the amount injected. 
Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
• 
Record the treatment day number (column 1), date (column 2), time of your injection (column 
3), and volume of your pen (column 4). 
Record your prescribed dose (column 5). 
Check you dial the right dose before injecting (column 6). 
After injection, read the number shown in the Dose Feedback Window. 
Confirm you receive a complete injection (column 7) or record the number shown in the Dose 
Feedback Window if other than “0” (column 8). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  When needed, inject yourself using a second pen, dialing your remaining dose written in the 
“Amount to Be Set for a Second Injection” section (column 8). 
Record this remaining dose in the “Amount Set to Inject” section (column 6) in the next row. 
• 
Using your treatment diary to record your daily injection(s) allows you to verify every day that you 
received the full prescribed dose.

Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach 
room temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm 
up the pen.  
1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table 
or countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4). 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them 
well (Figure 5). 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
from the pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration 
date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say 
GONAL-f. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, 
colourless and does not 
contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the 
medicine is discolored or cloudy, 
as this can cause an infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback 
Window is set to “0” (Figure 
8). 
197 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites 
to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise 
skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new 
needle for each injection. Re-using needles can 
cause infection. 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” 
needles supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not 
damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer 
needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that 
expiration date has not passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired 
or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is 
damaged or loose. Using expired needles or 
needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer 
needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away 
in a sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded 
tip of the GONAL-f pre-filled pen until you 
feel a light resistance (Figure 12).  
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle 
could be difficult to remove after the injection.  
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it 
gently (Figure 13). 
3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).  
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will 
prevent needle stick injury and infection when 
detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.  
3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the 
needle pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10 Carefully remove and discard the green 
inner needle shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner 
needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury 
and infection.  
3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for 
tiny droplet(s) of liquid.

If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 
17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet of 
liquid, proceed to Step 4 
Dial your dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for 
a droplet of liquid. Proceed 
directly to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
199 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
Note: The pen contains 450 IU follitropin alfa. The 450 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 
450 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments 
of 12.5 IU. 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150” IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
• 
Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up 
(Figure 22). 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2.  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained 
to do by your healthcare provider. 
5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin 
entirely (Figure 24).  
5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose 
setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob 
down as far as it will go and hold it to 
complete the full injection (Figure 25).  
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will 
take to inject. 
5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum 
of 5 seconds before you remove the needle 
from your skin (Figure 26). 
• 
The dose number shown in the Dose 
Feedback Window will turn back to 
“0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull 
the needle out of the skin while 
keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, 
release the dose setting knob. 
200 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove 
the needle from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface.  
6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured 
by the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle. 
Step 7 After the injection 
7.1 Check you have given a complete injection: 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window 
shows “0” (Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you 
have completed your dose.  
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number 
higher than “0”, the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is 
empty. You have not received your full 
prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 
below.  
7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when 
needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will 
indicate the missing amount you need to 
inject using a new pen. In the example 
shown, the missing amount is “50” IU 
(Figure 33). 
To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
201 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid 
infection (Figure 34). 
8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package 
Leaflet. 
8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare 
provider how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury.  
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use 
1.  What GONAL-f is and what it is used for 
What GONAL-f is 
GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropin alfa is a type of “follicle 
stimulating hormone” (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What GONAL-f is used for 
In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. 
2.  What you need to know before you use GONAL-f 
You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
203 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use GONAL-f 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
204 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. 
If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and GONAL-f 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
GONAL-f contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use GONAL-f 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The pre-
filled pen can be used for several injections. 
The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
use”. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
GONAL-f is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
206 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  
GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. 
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more GONAL-f than you should 
The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use GONAL-f 
If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
Serious side effects in men and women 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor 
who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f.

Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach 
room temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm 
up the pen.  
1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table 
or countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4). 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them 
well (Figure 5). 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
from the pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration 
date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say 
GONAL-f. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, 
colourless and does not 
contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the 
medicine is discolored or cloudy, 
as this can cause an infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback 
Window is set to “0” (Figure 
8). 
213 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites 
to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise 
skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new 
needle for each injection. Re-using needles can 
cause infection. 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” 
needles supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not 
damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer 
needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that 
expiration date has not passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired 
or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is 
damaged or loose. Using expired needles or 
needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer 
needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away 
in a sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded 
tip of the GONAL-f pre-filled pen until you 
feel a light resistance (Figure 12).  
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle 
could be difficult to remove after the injection.  
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it 
gently (Figure 13). 
3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).  
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will 
prevent needle stick injury and infection when 
detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.  
3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the 
needle pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10 Carefully remove and discard the green 
inner needle shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner 
needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury 
and infection.  
3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for 
tiny droplet(s) of liquid.

If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 
17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet of 
liquid, proceed to Step 4 
Dial your dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for 
a droplet of liquid. Proceed 
directly to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
Note: The pen contains 900 IU follitropin alfa. The 900 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 
450 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments 
of 12.5 IU. 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150” IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
• 
Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up 
(Figure 22). 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2.  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained 
to do by your healthcare provider. 
5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin 
entirely (Figure 24).  
5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose 
setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob 
down as far as it will go and hold it to 
complete the full injection (Figure 25).  
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will 
take to inject. 
5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum 
of 5 seconds before you remove the needle 
from your skin (Figure 26). 
• 
The dose number shown in the Dose 
Feedback Window will turn back to 
“0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull 
the needle out of the skin while 
keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, 
release the dose setting knob. 
216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove 
the needle from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface.  
6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured 
by the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle. 
Step 7 After the injection 
7.1 Check you have given a complete injection: 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window 
shows “0” (Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you 
have completed your dose.  
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number 
higher than “0”, the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is 
empty. You have not received your full 
prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 
below.  
7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when 
needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will 
indicate the missing amount you need to 
inject using a new pen. In the example 
shown, the missing amount is “50” IU 
(Figure 33). 
To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
217 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen 
8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid 
infection (Figure 34). 
8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package 
Leaflet. 
8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare 
provider how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury.  
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

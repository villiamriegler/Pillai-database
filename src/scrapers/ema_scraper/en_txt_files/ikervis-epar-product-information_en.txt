PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Eye drops, emulsion. 
Milky white emulsion. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indication 
Treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite 
treatment with tear substitutes (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment must be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional qualified in 
ophthalmology. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one drop once daily to be applied to the affected eye(s) at bedtime. 
Response to treatment should be reassessed at least every 6 months. 
If a dose is missed, treatment should be continued on the next day as normal. Patients should be 
advised not to instil more than one drop in the affected eye(s). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
The elderly population has been studied in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is required. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
The effect of ciclosporin has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, 
no special considerations are needed in these populations.

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of ciclosporin in children and adolescents aged below 18 in the treatment of 
severe keratitis in patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite treatment with tear 
substitutes. 
Method of administration 
Ocular use. 
Precautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product 
Patients should be instructed to first wash their hands. 
Prior to administration, the single-dose container should be gently shaken. 
For single use only. Each single-dose container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused emulsion 
should be discarded immediately. 
Patients should be instructed to use nasolacrimal occlusion and to close the eyelids for 2 minutes after 
instillation, to reduce the systemic absorption. This may result in a decrease in systemic undesirable 
effects and an increase in local activity.  
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be 
administered at least 15 minutes apart. IKERVIS should be administered last (see section 4.4). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Ocular or peri-ocular malignancies or premalignant conditions. 
Active or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
IKERVIS has not been studied in patients with a history of ocular herpes and should therefore be used 
with caution in such patients. 
Contact lenses 
Patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied. Careful monitoring of patients with severe 
keratitis is recommended. Contact lenses should be removed before instillation of the eye drops at 
bedtime and may be reinserted at wake-up time. 
Concomitant therapy 
There is limited experience with ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with glaucoma. Regular 
clinical monitoring should be exercised when treating these patients concomitantly with IKERVIS, 
especially with beta-blockers which are known to decrease tear secretion. 
Effects on the immune system 
Ophthalmic medicinal products, which affect the immune system, including ciclosporin, may affect 
host defences against local infections and malignancies. Therefore, regular examination of the eye(s) is 
recommended, e.g. at least every 6 months, when IKERVIS is used for years. 
Cetalkonium chloride content 
IKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to application and 
may be reinserted at wake-up time. Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. Patients should be 
monitored in case of prolonged use.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with IKERVIS. 
Combination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system 
Co-administration of IKERVIS with eye drops containing corticosteroids could potentiate the effects 
of ciclosporin on the immune system (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
IKERVIS is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.  
Pregnancy 
There is no data from the use of IKERVIS in pregnant women.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration of ciclosporin 
at exposure considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little 
relevance to the clinical use of IKERVIS. 
IKERVIS is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Following oral administration, ciclosporin is excreted in breast milk. There is insufficient information 
on the effects of ciclosporin in newborns/infants. However, at therapeutic doses of ciclosporin in eye 
drops, it is unlikely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from IKERVIS therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
There is no data on the effects of IKERVIS on human fertility.  
No impairment of fertility has been reported in animals receiving intravenous ciclosporin (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IKERVIS has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
This medicinal product may induce temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances which may 
affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or 
use machines until their vision has cleared.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Eye pain 
A frequently reported local adverse reaction associated with the use of IKERVIS during clinical trials. 
It is likely to be attributable to ciclosporin. 
Generalised and localised infections 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies, including ciclosporin, are at increased risk of 
infections. Both generalised and localised infections can occur. Pre-existing infections may also be 
aggravated (see section 4.3). Cases of infections have been reported uncommonly in association with 
the use of IKERVIS. 
As precautionary measure, action should be taken to reduce the systemic absorption (see section 4.2). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
A topical overdose is not likely to occur after ocular administration. If overdose with IKERVIS occurs, 
treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA18. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Ciclosporin (also known as ciclosporin A) is a cyclic polypeptide immunomodulator with 
immunosuppressant properties. It has been shown to prolong survival of allogeneic transplants in 
animals and significantly improved graft survival in all types of solid organ transplantation in man. 
Ciclosporin has also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Studies in animals suggest that 
ciclosporin inhibits the development of cell-mediated reactions. Ciclosporin has been shown to inhibit 
the production and/or release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2) or T-cell 
growth factor (TCGF). It is also known to up-regulate the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. 
Ciclosporin appears to block the resting lymphocytes in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle. All 
available evidence suggests that ciclosporin acts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes and does 
not depress haematopoiesis or has any effect on the function of phagocytic cells. 
In patients with dry eye disease, a condition that may be considered to have an inflammatory 
immunological mechanism, following ocular administration, ciclosporin is passively absorbed into T-
lymphocyte infiltrates in the cornea and conjunctiva and inactivates calcineurin phosphatase. 
Ciclosporin-induced inactivation of calcineurin inhibits the dephosphorylation of the transcription 
factor NF-AT and prevents NF-AT translocation into the nucleus, thus blocking the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of IKERVIS were evaluated in two randomised, double-masked, vehicle-
controlled clinical studies in adult patients with dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) who met 
the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) criteria. 
In the 12 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, pivotal clinical trial (SANSIKA study), 246 Dry 
Eye Disease (DED) patients with severe keratitis (defined as a corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) 
score of 4 on the modified Oxford scale) were randomised to one drop of IKERVIS or vehicle daily at 
bedtime for 6 months. Patients randomised to the vehicle group were switched to IKERVIS after 
6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving by month 6 at least a two-
grade improvement in keratitis (CFS) and a 30% improvement in symptoms, measured with the 
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). The proportion of responders in the IKERVIS group was 
28.6%, compared to 23.1% in the vehicle group. The difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.326). 
The severity of keratitis, assessed using CFS, improved significantly from baseline at month 6 with 
IKERVIS compared to vehicle (mean change from baseline was -1.764 with IKERVIS vs. -1.418 with 
vehicle, p=0.037). The proportion of IKERVIS-treated patients with a 3-grade improvement in CFS 
score at month 6 (from 4 to 1) was 28.8%, compared to 9.6% of vehicle-treated subjects, but this was a 
post-hoc analysis, which limits the robustness of this outcome. The beneficial effect on keratitis was 
maintained in the open phase of the study, from month  6 and up to month 12. 
The mean change from baseline in the 100-point OSDI score was -13.6 with IKERVIS and -14.1 with 
vehicle at month 6 (p=0.858). In addition, no improvement was observed for IKERVIS compared to 
vehicle at month 6 for other secondary endpoints, including ocular discomfort score, Schirmer test, use 
of concomitant artificial tears, investigator’s global evaluation of efficacy, tear break-up time, 
lissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear osmolarity. 
A reduction in the ocular surface inflammation assessed with Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-
DR) expression (an exploratory endpoint), was observed at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS (p=0.021). 
In the 6 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, supportive clinical trial (SICCANOVE study), 
492 DED patients with moderate to severe keratitis (defined as a CFS score of 2 to 4) were also 
randomised to IKERVIS or vehicle daily at bedtime for 6 months. The co-primary endpoints were the 
change in CFS score, and the change in global score of ocular discomfort unrelated to study 
medication instillation, both measured at month 6. A small but statistically significant difference in 
CFS improvement was observed between the treatment groups at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS 
(mean change from baseline in CFS -1.05 with IKERVIS and -0.82 with vehicle, p=0.009).  
The mean change from baseline in ocular discomfort score (assessed using a Visual Analogic Scale) 
was -12.82 with IKERVIS and -11.21 with vehicle (p=0.808). 
In both studies, no significant improvement of symptoms was observed for IKERVIS compared to 
vehicle after 6 months of treatment, whether using a visual analogue scale or the OSDI.  
In both studies one third of the patients in average had Sjögren’s syndrome; as for the overall 
population, a statistically significant improvement in CFS in favour of IKERVIS was observed in this 
subgroup of patients. 
At completion of the SANSIKA study (12 month study), patients were asked to enter the Post 
SANSIKA study. This study was an open-label, non-randomised, one-arm, 24-month study extension 
of the Sansika Study. In Post SANSIKA study patients alternatively received IKERVIS treatment or 
no treatment depending on CFS score (patients received IKERVIS when there was a worsening of 
keratitis). 
This study was designed to monitor the long-term efficacy and relapse rates in patients who have 
previously received IKERVIS. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the duration of the improvement following IKERVIS 
treatment discontinuation once the patient was improved with respect to the baseline of the SANSIKA 
study (i.e. at least 2 grade improvement on the modified Oxford scale). 
67 patients were enrolled (37.9% of the 177 patients having ended Sansika). After the 24-month 
period, 61.3% of 62 patients included in the primary efficacy population did not experience a relapse 
based on CFS scores. Percentage of patients who experienced a severe keratitis recurrence was 35% 
and 48% in patients treated 12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS respectively in the SANSIKA 
study. 
Based on the first quartile (the median could not be estimated due to the small number of relapses), 
time to relapse (back to CFS grade 4) was ≤224 days and ≤175 days in patients previously treated 
12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS, respectively. Patients spent more time on CFS grade 2 
(Median 12.7 weeks/year) and grade 1 (Median 6.6 weeks/year) than CFS grade 3 (Median 2.4 
weeks/year), CFS grades 4 and 5 (Median time 0 week/year).  
Assessment of DED symptoms by VAS showed a worsening of patient’s discomfort from the time 
treatment was first stopped to the time it was restarted except pain which remained relatively low and 
stable. The median global VAS score increased from the time treatment was first stopped (23.3%) to 
the time treatment was restarted (45.1%). 
No significant changes have been observed in the other secondary endpoints (TBUT, lissamine green 
staining and Schirmer test, NEI-VFQ and EQ-5D) over the course of the extension study. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IKERVIS in all subsets of the paediatric population in dry eye disease (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Formal pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in humans with IKERVIS. 
Blood concentrations of IKERVIS were measured using a specific high-pressure liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In 374 patients from the two efficacy studies, plasma 
concentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 6 months (SICCANOVE 
study and SANSIKA study) and 12 months of treatment (SANSIKA study). After 6 months of ocular 
instillation of IKERVIS once per day, 327 patients had values below the lower limit of detection 
(0.050 ng/mL) and 35 patients were below the lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL). 
Measurable values not exceeding 0.206 ng/mL were measured in eight patients, values considered to 
be negligible. Three patients had values above the upper limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) however 
they were already taking oral ciclosporin at a stable dose, which was allowed by the studies’ protocol. 
After 12 months of treatment, values were below the low limit of detection for 56 patients and below 
the low limit of quantification in 19 patients. Seven patients had measurable values (from 0.105 to 
1.27 ng/mL), all considered to be negligible values. Two patients had values above the upper limit of 
quantification, however they were also on oral ciclosporin at a stable dose since their inclusion in the 
study. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, phototoxicity and photoallergy, genotoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only with systemic administration or at exposures 
considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to 
clinical use.

Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Ciclosporin (also known as ciclosporin A) is a cyclic polypeptide immunomodulator with 
immunosuppressant properties. It has been shown to prolong survival of allogeneic transplants in 
animals and significantly improved graft survival in all types of solid organ transplantation in man. 
Ciclosporin has also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Studies in animals suggest that 
ciclosporin inhibits the development of cell-mediated reactions. Ciclosporin has been shown to inhibit 
the production and/or release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2) or T-cell 
growth factor (TCGF). It is also known to up-regulate the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. 
Ciclosporin appears to block the resting lymphocytes in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle. All 
available evidence suggests that ciclosporin acts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes and does 
not depress haematopoiesis or has any effect on the function of phagocytic cells. 
In patients with dry eye disease, a condition that may be considered to have an inflammatory 
immunological mechanism, following ocular administration, ciclosporin is passively absorbed into T-
lymphocyte infiltrates in the cornea and conjunctiva and inactivates calcineurin phosphatase. 
Ciclosporin-induced inactivation of calcineurin inhibits the dephosphorylation of the transcription 
factor NF-AT and prevents NF-AT translocation into the nucleus, thus blocking the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of IKERVIS were evaluated in two randomised, double-masked, vehicle-
controlled clinical studies in adult patients with dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) who met 
the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) criteria. 
In the 12 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, pivotal clinical trial (SANSIKA study), 246 Dry 
Eye Disease (DED) patients with severe keratitis (defined as a corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) 
score of 4 on the modified Oxford scale) were randomised to one drop of IKERVIS or vehicle daily at 
bedtime for 6 months. Patients randomised to the vehicle group were switched to IKERVIS after 
6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving by month 6 at least a two-
grade improvement in keratitis (CFS) and a 30% improvement in symptoms, measured with the 
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). The proportion of responders in the IKERVIS group was 
28.6%, compared to 23.1% in the vehicle group. The difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.326). 
The severity of keratitis, assessed using CFS, improved significantly from baseline at month 6 with 
IKERVIS compared to vehicle (mean change from baseline was -1.764 with IKERVIS vs. -1.418 with 
vehicle, p=0.037). The proportion of IKERVIS-treated patients with a 3-grade improvement in CFS 
score at month 6 (from 4 to 1) was 28.8%, compared to 9.6% of vehicle-treated subjects, but this was a 
post-hoc analysis, which limits the robustness of this outcome. The beneficial effect on keratitis was 
maintained in the open phase of the study, from month  6 and up to month 12. 
The mean change from baseline in the 100-point OSDI score was -13.6 with IKERVIS and -14.1 with 
vehicle at month 6 (p=0.858). In addition, no improvement was observed for IKERVIS compared to 
vehicle at month 6 for other secondary endpoints, including ocular discomfort score, Schirmer test, use 
of concomitant artificial tears, investigator’s global evaluation of efficacy, tear break-up time, 
lissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear osmolarity. 
A reduction in the ocular surface inflammation assessed with Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-
DR) expression (an exploratory endpoint), was observed at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS (p=0.021). 
In the 6 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, supportive clinical trial (SICCANOVE study), 
492 DED patients with moderate to severe keratitis (defined as a CFS score of 2 to 4) were also 
randomised to IKERVIS or vehicle daily at bedtime for 6 months. The co-primary endpoints were the 
change in CFS score, and the change in global score of ocular discomfort unrelated to study 
medication instillation, both measured at month 6. A small but statistically significant difference in 
CFS improvement was observed between the treatment groups at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS 
(mean change from baseline in CFS -1.05 with IKERVIS and -0.82 with vehicle, p=0.009).  
The mean change from baseline in ocular discomfort score (assessed using a Visual Analogic Scale) 
was -12.82 with IKERVIS and -11.21 with vehicle (p=0.808). 
In both studies, no significant improvement of symptoms was observed for IKERVIS compared to 
vehicle after 6 months of treatment, whether using a visual analogue scale or the OSDI.  
In both studies one third of the patients in average had Sjögren’s syndrome; as for the overall 
population, a statistically significant improvement in CFS in favour of IKERVIS was observed in this 
subgroup of patients. 
At completion of the SANSIKA study (12 month study), patients were asked to enter the Post 
SANSIKA study. This study was an open-label, non-randomised, one-arm, 24-month study extension 
of the Sansika Study. In Post SANSIKA study patients alternatively received IKERVIS treatment or 
no treatment depending on CFS score (patients received IKERVIS when there was a worsening of 
keratitis). 
This study was designed to monitor the long-term efficacy and relapse rates in patients who have 
previously received IKERVIS. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the duration of the improvement following IKERVIS 
treatment discontinuation once the patient was improved with respect to the baseline of the SANSIKA 
study (i.e. at least 2 grade improvement on the modified Oxford scale). 
67 patients were enrolled (37.9% of the 177 patients having ended Sansika). After the 24-month 
period, 61.3% of 62 patients included in the primary efficacy population did not experience a relapse 
based on CFS scores. Percentage of patients who experienced a severe keratitis recurrence was 35% 
and 48% in patients treated 12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS respectively in the SANSIKA 
study. 
Based on the first quartile (the median could not be estimated due to the small number of relapses), 
time to relapse (back to CFS grade 4) was ≤224 days and ≤175 days in patients previously treated 
12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS, respectively. Patients spent more time on CFS grade 2 
(Median 12.7 weeks/year) and grade 1 (Median 6.6 weeks/year) than CFS grade 3 (Median 2.4 
weeks/year), CFS grades 4 and 5 (Median time 0 week/year).  
Assessment of DED symptoms by VAS showed a worsening of patient’s discomfort from the time 
treatment was first stopped to the time it was restarted except pain which remained relatively low and 
stable. The median global VAS score increased from the time treatment was first stopped (23.3%) to 
the time treatment was restarted (45.1%). 
No significant changes have been observed in the other secondary endpoints (TBUT, lissamine green 
staining and Schirmer test, NEI-VFQ and EQ-5D) over the course of the extension study. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IKERVIS in all subsets of the paediatric population in dry eye disease (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Formal pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in humans with IKERVIS. 
Blood concentrations of IKERVIS were measured using a specific high-pressure liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In 374 patients from the two efficacy studies, plasma 
concentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 6 months (SICCANOVE 
study and SANSIKA study) and 12 months of treatment (SANSIKA study). After 6 months of ocular 
instillation of IKERVIS once per day, 327 patients had values below the lower limit of detection 
(0.050 ng/mL) and 35 patients were below the lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL). 
Measurable values not exceeding 0.206 ng/mL were measured in eight patients, values considered to 
be negligible. Three patients had values above the upper limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) however 
they were already taking oral ciclosporin at a stable dose, which was allowed by the studies’ protocol. 
After 12 months of treatment, values were below the low limit of detection for 56 patients and below 
the low limit of quantification in 19 patients. Seven patients had measurable values (from 0.105 to 
1.27 ng/mL), all considered to be negligible values. Two patients had values above the upper limit of 
quantification, however they were also on oral ciclosporin at a stable dose since their inclusion in the 
study. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, phototoxicity and photoallergy, genotoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only with systemic administration or at exposures 
considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to 
clinical use.

Instructions for use 
Before administration of the eye drops: 
  Wash your hands before opening the bottle. 
 
Do not use this medicine if you notice that the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken 
before you first use it. 
  When using the bottle for the very first time, before delivering a drop to the eye, you should 
practise using the bottle by squeezing it slowly to deliver one drop away from the eye. 
  When you are confident that you can deliver one drop at a time, choose the position that you 
find most comfortable for the instillation of the drops (you can sit down, lie on your back, or 
stand in front of a mirror).  
Every time when opening a new bottle, drop one drop to waste to activate the bottle. 
 
Administration: 
1. 
Gently shake the bottle. Hold the bottle directly below the cap and turn the cap to open the 
bottle. Do not touch anything with the tip of the bottle to avoid contamination of the emulsion. 
2. 
3. 
Tilt your head backwards and hold the bottle above your eye. 
Pull the lower eyelid down and look up. Squeeze the bottle gently in the middle and let a drop 
fall into your eye. Please note that there might be a few seconds delay between squeezing and 
the drop coming out. Do not squeeze too hard. 
4. 
Close your eye and press the inner corner of the eye with your finger for about two minutes. 
This helps to stop the medicine from getting into the rest of the body.

5. 
6. 
Repeat instructions 2 – 4 to deliver a drop into the other eye, if your doctor has instructed you 
to do this. Sometimes only one eye needs to be treated and your doctor will advise if this 
applies to you and which eye needs treatment. 
After each use and prior to recapping, the bottle should be shaken once in a downwards 
direction, without touching the dropper tip, in order to remove any residual emulsion from the 
tip. This is necessary in order to ensure delivery of subsequent drops. 
7. 
Wipe off any excess emulsion from the skin around the eye. 
At the end of the in-use shelf life of the medicine, there could be some emulsion left in the bottle. Do 
not attempt to use the excess medicine remaining in the bottle after you have completed the course of 
treatment.

1.  What IKERVIS is and what it is used for 
IKERVIS contains the active substance, ciclosporin. Ciclosporin belongs to a group of medicines 
known as immunosuppressive agents that are used to reduce inflammation. 
IKERVIS is used to treat adults with severe keratitis (inflammation of the cornea, the transparent layer 
in the front part of the eye). It is used in those patients who have dry eye disease, which has not 
improved despite treatment with tear substitutes (artificial tears). 
Talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse. 
You should visit your doctor at least every 6 months to assess the effect of IKERVIS. 
2.  What you need to know before you use IKERVIS 
Do NOT use IKERVIS 
- 
if you are allergic to ciclosporin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. 
if you have an eye infection. 
Warnings and precautions 
Only use IKERVIS for dropping in your eye(s). 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using IKERVIS 
- 
if you have previously had an eye infection by the herpes virus that might have damaged the 
transparent front part of the eye (cornea). 
if you are taking any medicines containing steroids. 
if you are taking any medicines to treat glaucoma. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact lenses can further damage the transparent front part of the eye (cornea). Therefore, you should 
remove your contact lenses at bedtime before using IKERVIS; you can reinsert them when you wake 
up. 
Children and adolescents 
IKERVIS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and IKERVIS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids with IKERVIS as these might 
increase the risk of side effects. 
IKERVIS eye drops should be used at least 15 minutes after any other eye drops are used. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
IKERVIS should not be used if you are pregnant. 
If you could become pregnant you must use contraception while using this medicine. 
IKERVIS is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be blurred immediately after using IKERVIS eye drops. If this happens, wait until 
your vision clears before you drive or use machines. 
IKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride in 1 mL. You should remove contact lenses 
before using this medicine and you can reinsert them when you wake up. Cetalkonium chloride may 
cause eye irritation. If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this 
medicine, talk to your doctor. 
3.

  Twist off the cap (picture 1). 
  Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2). 
  Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling. 
  Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure you do not touch your eye 
with the tip of the single-dose container. 
  Blink a few times so that the medicine covers your eye. 
  After using IKERVIS, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose and close gently 
the eyelids for 2 minutes (picture 3). This helps to stop IKERVIS getting into the rest of the 
body. 
If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. 
 
  Discard the single dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some 
medicine left in it. 
  The remaining single-dose containers should be kept in the aluminium pouch. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
If you use more IKERVIS than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more drops 
until it is time for your next regular dose. 
If you forget to use IKERVIS, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop each day in the affected eye(s). 
If you stop using IKERVIS without speaking to your doctor, the inflammation of the transparent 
front part of your eye (known as keratitis) will not be controlled and could lead to impaired vision. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What IKERVIS is and what it is used for 
IKERVIS contains the active substance, ciclosporin. Ciclosporin belongs to a group of medicines 
known as immunosuppressive agents that are used to reduce inflammation. 
IKERVIS is used to treat adults with severe keratitis (inflammation of the cornea, the transparent layer 
in the front part of the eye). It is used in those patients who have dry eye disease, which has not 
improved despite treatment with tear substitutes (artificial tears). 
Talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse. 
You should visit your doctor at least every 6 months to assess the effect of IKERVIS. 
2.  What you need to know before you use IKERVIS 
Do NOT use IKERVIS 
- 
if you are allergic to ciclosporin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. 
if you have an eye infection. 
Warnings and precautions 
Only use IKERVIS for dropping in your eye(s). 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using IKERVIS 
- 
if you have previously had an eye infection by the herpes virus that might have damaged the 
transparent front part of the eye (cornea). 
if you are taking any medicines containing steroids. 
if you are taking any medicines to treat glaucoma. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact lenses can further damage the transparent front part of the eye (cornea). Therefore, you should 
remove your contact lenses at bedtime before using IKERVIS; you can reinsert them when you wake 
up. 
Children and adolescents 
IKERVIS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and IKERVIS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids with IKERVIS as these might 
increase the risk of side effects. 
IKERVIS eye drops should be used at least 15 minutes after any other eye drops are used. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
IKERVIS should not be used if you are pregnant. 
If you could become pregnant you must use contraception while using this medicine. 
IKERVIS is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be blurred immediately after using IKERVIS eye drops. If this happens, wait until 
your vision clears before you drive or use machines. 
IKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride in 1 mL. You should remove contact lenses 
before using this medicine and you can reinsert them when you wake up. Cetalkonium chloride may 
cause eye irritation. If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this 
medicine, talk to your doctor. 
3. 
How to use IKERVIS 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
The recommended dose is one drop in each affected eye, once daily at bedtime. 
Instructions for use 
Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not 
understand. 
Before administration of the eye drops: 
  Wash your hands before opening the bottle. 
 
Do not use this medicine if you notice that the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken 
before you first use it. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  When using the bottle for the very first time, before delivering a drop to the eye, you should 
practise using the bottle by squeezing it slowly to deliver one drop away from the eye. 
  When you are confident that you can deliver one drop at a time, choose the position that you 
find most comfortable for the instillation of the drops (you can sit down, lie on your back, or 
stand in front of a mirror).  
Every time when opening a new bottle, place one drop in the waste to activate the bottle. 
 
Administration: 
1. 
Gently shake the bottle. Hold the bottle directly below the cap and turn the cap to open the 
bottle. Do not touch anything with the tip of the bottle to avoid contamination.  
2. 
3. 
Tilt your head backwards and hold the bottle above your eye. 
Pull the lower eyelid down and look up. Squeeze the bottle gently in the middle and let a drop 
fall into your eye. Please note that there might be a few seconds delay between squeezing and 
the drop coming out. Do not squeeze too hard. 
4. 
Close your eye and press the inner corner of the eye with your finger for about two minutes. 
This helps to stop the medicine from getting into the rest of the body. 
5. 
Repeat instructions 2 – 4 to deliver a drop into the other eye, if your doctor has instructed you 
to do this. Sometimes only one eye needs to be treated and your doctor will advise if this 
applies to you and which eye needs treatment. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. 
After each use and prior to recapping, the bottle should be shaken once in a downwards 
direction, without touching the dropper tip, in order to remove any residual emulsion from the 
tip. This is necessary to ensure good delivery of the next drop. 
7. 
8. 
Wipe off any excess emulsion from the skin around the eye. 
At the end of the in-use shelf life of the medicine, there will be some emulsion left in the 
bottle. Do not attempt to use the excess medicine remaining in the bottle after you have 
completed the course of treatment. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
If you use more IKERVIS than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more drops 
until it is time for your next regular dose. 
If you forget to use IKERVIS, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop each day in the affected eye(s). 
If you stop using IKERVIS without speaking to your doctor, the inflammation of the transparent 
front part of your eye (known as keratitis) will not be controlled and could lead to impaired vision. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

contraindicated. In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers with 
mild hepatic impairment taking a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor or 
a strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of 84 
mg eliglustat once daily should be considered. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and

results from the primary analysis periods and extension 
periods of two pivotal Phase 3 studies (ENGAGE and 
ENCORE), one 8-year, long term Phase 2 study (Study 
304), and one supporting Phase 3b study (EDGE). In these 
four studies a total of 393 patients between the ages of 16 
- 75 years  received eliglustat for a median duration of 3.5 
years (up to 9.3 years).   
The majority of adverse reactions are mild and transient. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction with 
Cerdelga is dyspepsia, in approximately 6% of the patients. 
About 2% of patients receiving Cerdelga in clinical trials 
permanently discontinued treatment due to any adverse 
reaction. 
The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction in 
clinical studies was syncope (0.8%). All events were 
associated with predisposing risk factors and appeared to 
be vasovagal in nature. None of these events led to 
discontinuation from the study.

GZGD00304 including efficacy and safety data up to 8 
years. During the initial evaluation the data up to 4 years 
of treatment was assessed. This data showed that under 
continued eliglustat treatment patients showed 
improvement for haemoglobin, platelets, spleen volume, 
and liver volume.  The 4 years data was already included in 
product information section 5.1. With this final study report 
the data showed that under continued eliglustat treatment 
patients remained stable or further improved up to month 
96 for haemoglobin, platelets, spleen volume, and liver

as part of the MAA and the results are reflected in the 
product information. This variation aimed at updating the 
product information with efficacy long-term data (up to 4.5 
years) with Cerdelga from the final reports of the ENGAGE 
study. The EDGE study was designed to evaluate once (QD) 
versus twice daily (BID) dosing of eliglustat in patients with 
Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). Results showed that a QD 
regimen does not favour over a BID regimen, and no dose 
recommendation should be included in the SmPC. No new 
safety issue were identified from both studies.  
Results from the ENGAGE study showed that during the 
open-label long term treatment period with Cerdelga 
(extension phase), all patients with complete data who 
continued to receive Cerdelga showed further 
improvements throughout the extension phase. Results 
(change from baseline) after 18 months, 30 months and 
4.5 years of exposure to Cerdelga on the following 
endpoints were: absolute change in haemoglobin level (1.1 
g/dL [n=39], 1.4 g/dL [n=35] and 1.4 g/dL [n=12]), mean 
increase in  platelet count (mm3; 58.5 % [n=39], 74.6% 
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[n=35] and 86.8% [n=12]) , mean reduction in spleen 
volume (MN; 46.5% [n=38], 54.2% [n=32] and 65.6% 
[n=13]) and mean reduction in liver volume (MN; 13.7% 
[n=39], 18.5% [n=32] and 23.4% [n=13]).  
After 9 months of treatment, bone marrow infiltration by 
Gaucher cells, as determined by the total Bone Marrow 
Burden (BMB) score (assessed by MRI in lumbar spine and 
femur) decreased by a mean of 1.1 points in Cerdelga 
treated patients (n=19) compared to no change in patients 
randomised to placebo (p=0.0021). Five Cerdelga-treated 
patients (26%) achieved a reduction of at least 2 points in 
the BMB score after 9 months compared to none in the 
placebo treated patients.  
After 18 and 30 months of treatment, BMD score had 
decreased by a mean 2.2 points (n=18) and 2.7 (n=15), 
respectively for the patients originally randomised to 
Cerdelga, compared to a mean decrease of 1 point (n=20) 
and 0.8 (n=16) in those originally randomised to placebo. 
After 18 months of Cerdelga treatment in the open-label 
extension phase, the mean (SD) lumbar spine Bone Mineral 
Density T-score increased from -1.14 (1.0118) at Baseline 
(n=34) to -0.918 (1.1601) (n=33) in the normal range. 
After 30 months and 4.5 years of treatment, the T-score 
further increased to -0.722 (1.1250) (n=27) and -0.533 
(0.8031) (n=9), respectively.

new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

(extension phase) of a study of Cerdelga in GD1 patients 
switching from ERT– Study 02607 (ENCORE), the 
percentage of patients with complete data meeting the 
composite stability endpoint was maintained at 84.6% 
(n=136) after 2 years, 84.4% (n=109) after 3 years and 
91.1% (n=45) after 4 years. The majority of extension 
phase discontinuations were due to transition to 
commercial product from year 3 onwards. Individual 
disease parameters of spleen volume, liver volume, 
haemoglobin levels and platelet count remained stable 
through 4 years. For more information, including the 
changes from Month 12 (primary analysis period) to Month 
48 in patients with GD1 in the Long Term Treatment Period

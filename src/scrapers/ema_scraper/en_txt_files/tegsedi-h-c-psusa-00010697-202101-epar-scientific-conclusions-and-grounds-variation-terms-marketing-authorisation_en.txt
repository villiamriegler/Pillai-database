Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for inotersen, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on liver transplant rejection from spontaneous reports, including in some 
cases a close temporal relationship, and the literature, the PRAC Rapporteur considers that monitoring 
of liver function tests in patients with a liver transplant should be at monthly intervals. The PRAC 
Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing inotersen should be 
amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for inotersen the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing inotersen is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

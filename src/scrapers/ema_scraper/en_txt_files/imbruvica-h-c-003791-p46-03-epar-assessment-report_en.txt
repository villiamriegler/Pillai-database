The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
54179060LYM3003 (LYM 3003), SPARKLE  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
54179060LYM3003, SPARKLE 
Hereafter referred to as LYM3003.  
Description 
Study LYM3003 was a phase 3, 2-part, multicenter open-label study in paediatric and young adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  
A safety and PK run-in part (Part 1) was conducted before the randomized part (Part 2) of the study. 
All eligible subjects in Part 1 received ibrutinib in combination with CIT (investigator choice of RICE or 
RVICI). Enrolment began with children in the 2 older age groups (6-11, 12-17 years) to assess PK and 
safety data before allowing enrolment of children in the youngest age group (1-5 years).  
In Part 2, subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ibrutinib in combination with CIT 
(investigator choice of RICE or RVICI) or CIT alone.

Methods 
Study participants 
The study population consisted of subjects with relapsed/refractory BL, BLL, Burkitt Leukaemia (B-AL), 
DLBCL, DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) or other 
paediatric mature B-cell NHL. Subjects were required to have relapsed (and received only 1 prior line 
of therapy for Part 2 only) or have had disease that was primarily refractory to conventional therapy. 
Subjects in Part 1 were 1 to <18 years old. Subjects in Part 2 were 1 to 30 years old, inclusive, who 
had an initial diagnosis of mature B-cell NHL at <18 years of age. 
Subjects were required to have at least 1 site of measurable disease defined as >1 cm in the longest 
diameter and >1 cm in the shortest diameter by radiological imaging, bone marrow (BM) 
involvement, or CSF with blasts present. Subjects were to have a Lansky-Karnofsky score of≥50. 
Subjects were excluded, if they  had an ongoing treatment with anticoagulants, had inherited or 
acquired bleeding disorders, prior exposure to ibrutinib; a diagnosis of post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD); or an allogeneic bone marrow transplant within 6 months of start 
of treatment. 
Treatments 
Ibrutinib capsules (140 mg and 70 mg) and ibrutinib suspension (70 mg/mL single-dose and 
multi-dose) were used to meet the different dosing regimens and needs across the age groups in 
Study LYM3003. 
Ibrutinib was dosed based on BSA:  
Part 1: Ibrutinib up to a maximum dose of 329 mg/m2 per day (equivalent to the maximum fixed 
dose of 560 mg per day in adults) was evaluated as add-on therapy to RICE or RVICI. The first 2 
subjects enrolled in each age group (1-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years) were treated at a 
lower starting dose of 240 mg/m2 (not to exceed 420 mg per day) for the first cycle (older children 
[6-17 years] were enrolled first before enrolling younger children [1-5 years]), followed by dose 
escalation to 329 mg/m2 (not to exceed 560 mg per day) at the start of Cycle 2 as long as  the 
exposure was within the target range and there were no safety concerns for the 2 subjects and for all 
subsequently enrolled subjects in that age group. If exposure in the 2 subjects was lower than or 
exceeded the target range, the dose for these subjects and for all other subjects in that age group 
was adjusted based on available exposure data. 
Subjects were instructed to take ibrutinib orally once daily, starting at Cycle 1 Day 1. Subjects  were 
recommended to take ibrutinib within 2 hours after a meal. 
Part 2: Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Treatment group A (daily dose of ibrutinib 329 
mg/m2 or 440 mg/m2 [dose selected from Part 1]) by age groups, and RICE or RVICI

background therapy) or Treatment group B (RICE or RVICI background therapy only). Study 
treatment administration started on Cycle 1 Day 1 and ended on the last day of Cycle 3, unless the 
subject experienced unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cycles were 28 days long; however, 
if count recovery occurred quickly, cycles could be truncated to 21 days. As long as there was no 
disease progression after Cycle 1 or 2, a second and third cycle of therapy were given, respectively. 
Upon completion of 3 cycles of combination therapy, subjects randomized to ibrutinib +CIT with a 
response of PR or better could continue on ibrutinib monotherapy at the same daily dose for (1) up 
to three 28-day cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or (2) up until initiating 
subsequent anti lymphoma therapy or a conditioning regimen for stem cell transplantation, whichever 
came first. 
Subjects received ibrutinib in either a capsule (70 mg or 140 mg) or suspension formulation to be self-
administered at home on each day of the cycle. 
RICE or RVICI 
Part 1 and Part 2: Subjects received ibrutinib in combination with background intravenous CIT 
(investigator choice of RICE or RVICI) for 3 treatment cycles. The RICE regimen was composed 
of rituximab 750 mg/m2, ifosfamide 9 g/m2, carboplatin 635 mg/m2, etoposide 300 mg/m2, and 
dexamethasone 100 mg/m2. The RVICI regimen was composed of rituximab 750 mg/m2, vincristine 
1.6mg/m2, idarubicin 20 mg/m2, carboplatin 800 mg/m2, ifosfamide 10 g/m2, and dexamethasone 
100 mg/m2 (all doses represented as cumulative administered in 1 cycle). For both regimens, triple 
intrathecal therapy consisting of methotrexate, corticosteroid, and cytarabine was administered 
for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in age-appropriate dosing. Subjects with CNS disease 
at study entry received additional doses of triple intrathecal therapy until CSF was clear of disease. 
Cycles were 28 days long but could be shortened to 21 days based on investigator’s discretion.  
Study treatment continued for 3 cycles, unless the subject experienced unacceptable toxicity or 
disease progression.

Sample size 
Since Part 1 was to confirm that the PK profile of ibrutinib plus CIT in paediatric subjects was 
consistent with adults, no formal sample size calculations were performed. The required number of 
subjects in Part 1 was based on PK results and clinical judgment. 
The sample size calculation for the randomized part (Part 2) was based on the assumption of 100% 
improvement (HR=0.5) in median EFS in subjects receiving ibrutinib plus CIT (RICE or RVICI) 
compared with CIT (RICE or RVICI) (10 months versus 5 months). Utilizing a 2:1 randomization, this 
study was to enrol approximately 72 subjects (approximately 48 subjects treated with ibrutinib [and 
RICE or RVICI background therapy]) during Part 2. Based on a total of 60 events, this study had at 
least 80% power, given a 1-sided alpha of 0.05. An accrual rate of 1.44 subjects per month would 
have resulted in a study duration of approximately 4.2 years. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomization was not applicable for Part 1 of the study.  
Central randomization was implemented in Part 2 of this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 
of 2 treatment groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule. The randomization 
was balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and was stratified by histology and background 
therapy, then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Treatment group A (ibrutinib and RICE or RVICI 
background therapy) or Treatment group B (RICE or RVICI background therapy only). 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics and subject listings were used to summarize the data. For continuous 
variables, the number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges were used. 
For discrete variables, frequency was provided. For time-to-event variables, Kaplan-Meier

estimates were provided. Comparisons between the 2 treatment groups in Part 2 was performed as 
follows: for the continuous variables representing change from baseline to a particular postbaseline 
timepoint, analysis of variance was used. For discrete variables, Chi-square test was  used. For 
time-to-event variables, non-stratified log-rank test and non-stratified Cox proportion hazard model 
was used unless specified otherwise. 
The primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) (events determined by IRC) was compared between 
treatment groups using a non-stratified log-rank test. The estimated median EFS along with its 90% CI 
for each treatment group are presented. The EFS curve is presented using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The estimate of the HR between the 2 treatment groups and its associated 90% CI were computed 
using a non-stratified Cox proportional hazards model.  
The secondary endpoints were OS, overall response rate (ORR), tumour volume reduction, time to 
response, DOR, and proportion of subjects who proceeded to stem cell transplantation. Overall survival 
was analysed using a non-stratified log-rank test. Survival time of living subjects was censored on the 
last date a subject was known to be alive or lost to follow-up. The survival curve, the median OS, and 
its 90% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The HR of ibrutinib+CIT 
relative to CIT alone and its associated 90% CI were calculated using a non-stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model. Overall response rate was computed as the proportion of IRC confirmed responders 
(best overall response of PR or better) for each treatment group and was compared between treatment 
group using a 2-sided chi-square test at the 10% level of significance. The relative risk of being a 
responder (ibrutinib+CIT versus CIT) was reported along with the associated 90% CI. The mean 
tumour volume reduction from baseline to Day 14 was compared between treatment groups using a 
2-sided t-test at the 10% level of significance. The mean difference and its associated 90% CI were 
provided. Time to response was summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. 
Duration of response and median time survival were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit 
method. The proportion of subjects who proceeded to stem cell transplantation was presented for each 
treatment group and compared between treatment groups using a 2-sided chi-square test at the 10% 
level of significance. Logistic regression analysis was also used to estimate the odds ratio of proceeding 
to transplant in ibrutinib +CIT versus CIT along with its 90% CI. 
During Part 2, an external IDMC was used for periodic safety reviews. The pre-planned IA was 
conducted when 31 EFS events were reached. An external IDMC were to determine the 
appropriateness for early stopping using the nonbinding stopping rules as well as other  efficacy and 
safety endpoints. The 1-sided p-value required for early stopping for futility was ≥0.367 and 
efficacy was ≤0.006 if there were 30 EFS events at the IA. This design employed the sequential 
testing approach as described by O’Brien and Fleming (O'Brien 1979) to preserve the Type-I error 
rate. 
Results 
Recruitment 
The pre-planned IA of part 2 was conducted when 31 EFS events were reached. The IDMC 
recommended stopping enrolment as the futility boundary for early stopping was reached (1-sided p-
value ≥0.341 based on observed 31 of 60 EFS events). Consequently, subject enrolment ceased. The 
study was closed after all remaining subjects had reached 1 year follow-up.

quantifiable plasma concentration of ibrutinib. 
Efficacy Analysis Set: The intent-to-treat (ITT) Population consisted of all randomized subjects; 
subjects were analysed based on randomization, regardless of study agent received. The ITT 
population was used for all efficacy analyses, subject disposition and biomarker analyses. The primary 
efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population for data collected in the Part 2. For Part 1, efficacy 
was provided as a secondary endpoint.

Twelve of 21 (57.1%) subjects completed treatment with ibrutinib. Treatment cycles were 28 days 
long, but could be shortened to 21 days, if count recovery occurs quickly and the investigator deems a 
subject ready to proceed with the next cycle of therapy. Most of the subjects (61.9%) received ≥3 
cycles of ibrutinib including ibrutinib monotherapy after completion of CIT. The median treatment 
duration was 2.33 months (range: 0.2 to 5.7 months). A relative dose intensity of ≥90% was observed 
in 20 (95.2%) subjects. 
All 21 subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE of Grade 3 or higher, of which TEAEs in 17 (81.0%) 
subjects considered to be related to ibrutinib by the investigator. 
In the ibrutinib+RVICI group, the most common (≥30% of subjects) reported TEAEs by PT were 
anemia (90%); thrombocytopenia (80%); neutropenia (70%); diarrhea, hypokalemia (60% each); 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, hypoalbuminemia (50% each); sepsis, mucosal 
inflammation, hypertension (40% each); pyrexia, constipation, decreased appetite, hypocalcemia, and 
hypotension (30% each). 
In the ibrutinib+RICE group, the most common (≥30% of subjects) reported TEAEs by PT were 
anemia, febrile neutropenia (72.7% each); nausea (63.6%); thrombocytopenia, neutropenia (54.5% 
each); vomiting, platelet count decreased, AST increased (45.5% each), diarrhea, and ALT increased 
(36.4% each). 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs mainly occurred in the blood and lymphatic system disorders system organ class 
(100% of subjects each in the ibrutinib+RVICI and ibrutinib+RICE groups) and gastrointestinal 
disorders (ibrutinib+RVICI group: 90% and ibrutinib+RICE group: 90.9%). 
Thirteen (61.9%) subjects died during the study (8 [38.1%] subjects died due to disease progression 
and 5 [23.8%] experienced TEAEs leading to death). All the TEAEs leading to death were considered as 
not related or doubtfully related to ibrutinib by the investigator. 
Nineteen (90.5%) subjects experienced ≥Grade 3 treatment-emergent SAEs. The most common 
(≥30%) SAE observed across both treatment groups was febrile neutropenia. In the ibrutinib+RVICI 
group, the most common (≥30% of subjects) treatment-emergent SAEs were sepsis (4 of 10 [40%] 
subjects) and febrile neutropenia (3 of 10 [30%] subjects). In the ibrutinib+RICE group, the most 
common (≥30% of subjects) treatment-emergent SAE was febrile neutropenia, reported in 4 of 11 
(36.4%) subjects. Seven (33.3%) subjects experienced treatment-emergent SAEs that were 
considered related to ibrutinib by the investigator. 
No subject had a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation of ibrutinib. One subject had ibrutinib 
dose-reductions due to TEAEs of ALT increased (Grade 3) and AST increased (Grade 2) in the 
ibrutinib+RICE group. These AEs were resolved after dose reduction of ibrutinib. 
Seven subjects experienced TEAEs of major  haemorrhage, all of which were Grade 3 or 4. Four major  
haemorrhage events occurred in 3 subjects (intestinal  haemorrhage and melena [1 subject], epistaxis 
[1 subject], intracranial  haemorrhage [1 subject]) were considered possibly related to ibrutinib by the 
investigator. All the 4 major  haemorrhage events were reported in the ibrutinib+RVICI group. 
Subarachnoid  haemorrhage was considered doubtfully related to ibrutinib by the investigator in the 
ibrutinib+RVICI group. The majority of the observed bleeds were confounded by other contributory risk 
factors including thrombocytopenia, CNS disease involvement, BK virus infection, sacral fracture, 
lumbar puncture and hypertension, which were assessed as not related to ibrutinib. 
Eleven (52.4%) subjects experienced TEAEs of bleeding events (ibrutinib+RVICI group: 6 [60.0%] 
subjects and ibrutinib+RICE group: 5 [45.5%] subjects). In the ibrutinib+RVICI group, bleeding

events included epistaxis, hematemesis, haemorrhage intracranial, intestinal haemorrhage, melena, 
mouth haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, spinal cord hematoma, and subarachnoid haemorrhage (1 
subject each). All the bleeding events were Grade 3 or 4 except Grade 1 or 2 bleeding events of mouth 
haemorrhage and rectal haemorrhage. In the ibrutinib+RICE group, bleeding events included epistaxis 
(2 subjects), melena, cystitis haemorrhagic, ecchymosis, and traumatic hematoma (1 subject each). 
All the bleeding events were Grade 1 or 2 except the bleeding events of Grade 3 or 4 melena and 
cystitis haemorrhagic.

Of the 51 subjects, 41 subjects received RICE and 9 received RVICI as CIT. 
Summaries of AEs and other safety data are based on 50 subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
treatment (35 subjects received ibrutinib+CIT [RICE, RVICI] and 15 subjects received CIT [RICE, 
RVICI]). Nineteen of 35 (54.3%) subjects completed treatment with ibrutinib and 28 of 51 (54.9%) 
completed CIT treatment. Eighteen (51.4%) subjects received ≥3 cycles of ibrutinib including ibrutinib 
monotherapy after completion of CIT. The median treatment duration was 2.23 months (range: 0.4 to 
7.3 months). A relative dose intensity of ≥90% was observed in 35 (100%) subjects. 
Adverse Events 
All subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE of Grade 3 or higher in the ibrutinib+CIT and CIT groups. 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in 29 (82.9%) subjects in ibrutinib+CIT group were considered to be related

headache (45.7%); neutropenia, pyrexia (40% each); abdominal pain, platelet count decreased 
(37.1%); hypokalaemia (34.3%); and neutrophil count decreased (34.3%). 
In the CIT group, the most common (>30% of subjects) reported TEAEs by PT were anaemia (93.3%); 
neutrophil count decreased (60%); platelet count decreased (53.3%); febrile neutropenia, 
hypokalaemia (46.7% each); thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, ALT 
increased, pyrexia (40% each); aspartate aminotransferase increased, and hypomagnesemia (33.3%

Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Twenty-nine (58.0%) subjects died during the study (ibrutinib+CIT group: 19 [54.3%]) subjects and 
CIT group: 10 [66.7%] subjects). Of the 29 subjects, 20 subjects died due to disease progression 
(ibrutinib+CIT group: 12 [34.3%] subjects and CIT group: 8 [53.3%] subjects), 6 subjects died due to 
AEs (ibrutinib+CIT group: 4 [11.4%] subjects and CIT group: 2 [13.3%] subjects), and 2 (5.7%) 
subjects died due to "other reasons" and 1 (2.9%) subject died due to an unknown reason in the 
ibrutinib+CIT group. Four subjects died due to TEAEs in the ibrutinib+CIT group (1 subject each with 
TEAEs of septic shock, pulmonary  haemorrhage, pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome) and 2 subjects in the CIT group (1 subject each due to a TEAE of device related infection 
and sepsis). 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were experienced by similar number of subjects (71.4% subjects in the 
ibrutinib+CIT group and 73.3% subjects in the CIT group) and all SAEs were ≥Grade 3. The most 
common (≥30%) SAE observed across both treatment groups was febrile neutropenia (ibrutinib+CIT 
group: 60.0% and CIT group: 40.4%). Eighteen (51.4%) subjects in the ibrutinib+CIT group 
experienced treatment-emergent SAEs that were considered related to ibrutinib by the investigator. 
Four (11.4%) subjects had TEAEs leading to CIT discontinuation in the ibrutinib+CIT group, and in 1 of 
these 4 subjects, treatment with ibrutinib was discontinued due to SAE of Grade 4 febrile neutropenia. 
The other 3 subjects had discontinued CIT treatment due to Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, Grade 2 acute 
kidney injury, and Grade 2 methaemoglobinemia. 
In the ibrutinib+CIT group, the TEAEs of thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 in 2 subjects), lower 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Grade 4 in 1 subject), headache, febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 in 
1 subject each), and weight decreased (Grade 2 in 1 subject) led to dose reductions for ibrutinib. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
In the ibrutinib+CIT group, 6 (17.1%) subjects experienced TEAEs of major haemorrhage. 
Five (14.3%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of major  haemorrhage and 1 subject had fatal 
(Grade 5) TEAE of pulmonary haemorrhage. One subject had 4 major haemorrhagic events of lower 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage, menorrhagia, pulmonary haemorrhage, and upper gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage. All the TEAEs of major haemorrhagic events in the subject were considered as possibly 
related to ibrutinib by the investigator except 2 of the 3 events of lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
and 2 events of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which were considered as doubtfully related to 
ibrutinib by investigator. The other 5 subjects had major haemorrhagic events, which were considered 
as doubtfully related or not related to ibrutinib by the investigator except subdural haematoma and 
subdural haemorrhage, which were considered as possibly related to ibrutinib by the investigator. 
In the CIT group, 1 (6.7%) subject experienced a TEAE of Grade 4 lower gastrointestinal  
haemorrhage. The TEAE was considered as very likely related to carboplatin and not related to other 
CIT by the investigator 
In the ibrutinib+CIT group, 21 (60.0%) subjects experienced TEAEs of bleeding. Five (14.3%) subjects 
had Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of bleeding events and 1 subject had fatal (Grade 5) TEAE of bleeding event. 
The most common (≥10% subjects) bleeding events were epistaxis (8 [22.9%] subjects) and 
haematuria (6 [17.1%]) In the CIT group, 2 (13.3%) subjects experienced TEAEs of bleeding. One 
subject had epistaxis and lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage and 1 subject had ecchymosis.

Laboratory and Other Safety Observations 
No new safety signals were revealed from clinical laboratory and other safety observation data 
(physical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography/ MUGA scan). Three subjects met 
laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law in the ibrutinib+CIT group. All 3 subjects met the criteria in the context 
of septic shock or multiple organ failure and were not considered to be due to drug induced liver 
toxicity. 
SmPC information 
Currently, the Imbruvica SmPC states the following regarding paediatric use:  
Section 4.2:  
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Section 5.1: 
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IMBRUVICA in all subsets of the paediatric population in MCL, CLL and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 
(LPL) (for information on paediatric use, see section 4.2). 
MAH Conclusion  
The results of Part 1 supported the addition of ibrutinib to CIT and proceeding to Part 2 of the study. 
The study stopped enrolment in Part 2 due to futility as the 1-sided p-value for the primary endpoint, 
EFS, crossed the prespecified stopping boundary. There were no trends for differences for any 
subgroups in efficacy relative to the overall population. The primary endpoint of EFS superiority was 
not met and there was no additional benefit observed in EFS from adding ibrutinib to background CIT. 
The observed AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of the individual agents and CIT, in 
addition to those expected in patients with the underlying disease of relapsed or refractory mature 
B-cell NHL. No additional safety concerns were identified in this study during treatment with 
combinations of ibrutinib and CIT (RICE, RVICI). Based on the results of this study, the overall safety 
profile of ibrutinib+RVICI and ibrutinib+RICE is consistent with the known individual safety profiles of 
ibrutinib in adults, RVICI, and RICE. 
2.3.3.  Clinical pharmacology 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the PK analysis was to compare the exposure to ibrutinib in the paediatric 
population to the exposure observed in adults, corresponding to a median area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of 509 ng.h/mL for a 560 mg daily dose. 
Data 
Subjects were sampled at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose for multiple times over the course 
of the therapy, resulting in 1 to 3 rich PK (sub-)profiles for each individual. These sub-profiles were to

be taken at 4 possible occasions: Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 7, Cycle 1 Day 14, and Day 1 of 
subsequent cycles (Cycle 2 or Cycle 3). This resulted in 1 to 3 rich PK profiles per subject. The relevant 
covariates in the PK dataset are summarized in Table 2. 
Table 2 Demographic characteristics of the subjects involved in the pharmacokinetic assessment 
The pharmacokinetic analysis dataset consisted of 771 quantifiable ibrutinib plasma concentrations, 
observed across 52 subjects. All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing 
data were labeled as such in the concentration database. The PK results of Study LYM3003 were 
pooled for Part 1 and Part 2. The observed plasma concentrations in children are overlayed the 
analysed adult PK data in Figure 1.

Methods 
The PopPK analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling in NONMEM. A PopPK 
model was developed using a PopPK model developed for adults, as a starting point. The adult PopPK 
model was a linear two-compartment model with an absorption lagtime. 
A two-step approach was used to evaluate exposure in peadiatric subjects compared to adults. First, 
the paediatric PopPK model was fitted to the observed PK data for each subject, to obtain individual 
parameter estimates. Second, the individual parameters were used to derive (a) the AUC during each 
day with rich PK profiles (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 7, Cycle 1 Day 14 and Cycle>1 Day 1) and (b) 
the AUC at steady-state (AUCss) calculated as

The target exposure in adults corresponded to a median AUC of 509 ng.h/mL, following an adult dose 
of 560 mg. The acceptable range for the median AUC in the paediatric population was set between 250 
and 1500 ng.h/mL.  
Model diagnostic methods were based on graphical evaluation of various goodness-of-fit plots. The 
relevant covariates weight, age, BSA and occasion were graphically evaluated by comparing individual 
parameters vs these covariates (η-plots). 
Results 
The developed paediatric PopPK model had the same structure as the adult model. Limited 
modifications compared to the adult PK model were applied. This included addition of inter-occasion 
variability (IOV) in relative bioavailability and an occasion-specific relative bioavailability of 0.496 for 
Cycle 1 Day 7 (the typical relative bioavailability was 1 at other occasions). Given the transient nature 
of the Day 7 covariate, no physiological cause for this deviation was explored.  
No significant relation was found between variability individual PK parameters and the covariates 
weight, age and BSA in the paediatric population (which was based on graphical inspection of η vs 
covariate plots).  
The presented data indicate that dosing regimens of 329 mg/m2 for children 12 years or older and 440 
mg/m2/day for children below 12 years appear to result in overall comparable exposure to adults. The 
median individual AUCss values for 1-5 year olds assigned to 440 mg/m2, 6-11 year olds assigned to 
440 mg/m2 and 12-17 year olds assigned to 329 mg/m2 were all within the acceptance limits of 250-
1500 ng.h/mL (Table 3). Of note, predictions from Cycle 1 Day 7 were not included when calculating 
the median values in Table 3.

SmPC information 
Currently, the Imbruvica SmPC states the following regarding paediatric use:  
Section 5.2: 
Paediatric population  
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with IMBRUVICA in patients under 18 years of age. 
MAH conclusion 
Based on the results of the pooled analysis (Part 1 and Part 2), the dosing regimens of 329 mg/m2 for 
children 12 years or older and 440 mg/m2/day for children below 12 years can be expected to provide 
comparable exposure as seen in adults.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In Study LYM300, ibrutinib in combination with RICE or RVICI demonstrated no additional efficacy in a 
two part Phase 3 including a PK-run in phase and a RCT in paediatric subjects with and young adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). At the interim 
analysis the IDMC recommended stopping enrolment as the futility boundary for early stopping was 
reached.  
Clinical pharmacology 
The MAH concludes that regimens of 329 mg/m2 for children 12 years or older and 440 mg/m2/day for 
children below 12 years can be expected to provide comparable exposure as seen in adults. Overall, 
the agency agrees that the presented PopPK analysis indicates this. However, limitations have been 
identified and relevant information is missing which would be needed to support the conclusion by the 
MAH. 
Overall, the database is considered appropriate to allow support that exposures are comparable 
between children and adults, at the proposed ibrutinib dosing regimens. Of note, the youngest subject 
included in the study appears to be 3 years old (i.e. no 1 to 2 year old subjects were included). The 
PopPK analysis appears to be overall reasonable, however, not all relevant information was available 
upon the assessment to conclude the validity of the analysis. For instance, how body size was 
incorporated in the (e.g. using allometric scaling with fixed or estimated coefficients) is currently not 
clear. The report for the adult PopPK model from 2015 (report number EDMS-ERI-112451527) and the 
final model output for the final paediatric PopPK model were not found.  
No relevant model misspecifications were evident based on the model diagnostics provided in 
Attachment PK model summary, diagnostics and extended results in Clinical Study report 
54179060LYM3003. The individual plots (included in PK model summary, diagnostics and extended 
results in Clinical Study report 54179060LYM3003) is considered relevant, however, the typical model 
predictions (sometimes referred to as PRED within NONMEM) which can be considered an important 
part of this type of diagnostic plots, were not included. In addition, no visual predictive check (VPC) 
was provided, which is considered an important diagnostic plot for the analysis.  
Comparing exposure based on individually predicted parameters (such as AUCss) is considered an 
acceptable approach. A clear justification for why the acceptance limits were set to 250-1500 ng.h/mL 
was not identified by the assessor. Summary of the relevant individual parameters and stratified on 
age groups were provided as part of PK model summary, diagnostics and extended results in Clinical 
Study report 54179060LYM3003. 
In conclusion, the PopPK analysis and exposure comparison to adults appears to be overall reasonable. 
However, important aspects (final model output, adult PopPK report [report number EDMS-ERI-
112451527], lines for typical model predictions [PRED] in the individual plots and VPCs) are missing 
from the provided documentation. 
Efficacy and safety 
In total 35 patients were randomised to ibrutinib + RICE/RVICI and 16 to RICE/RVICI. 22 (62.9%) 
subjects were reported with an EFS event in the ibrutinib + RICE/RVICI group compared to 12 (75.0%) 
subjects in the RICE/RVICI rendering a HR of 0.902 (90% CI 0.499, 1.629, p (1-sided) 0.3869). There 
was also no difference in ORR, DoR, OS or proportion of patients proceeding to SCT.

The safety results of Study LYM3003 were consistent with the known safety profile of ibrutinib and 
RICE/RVICI. Common TEAEs reported for patients treated with ibrutinib + RICE/RVICI were anaemia, 
vomiting, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, neutropenia, pyrexia, abdominal pain, 
platelet count decreased, hypokalaemia and neutrophil count decreased. Four patients in the ibrutinib 
+ RICE/RVICI group died due to AEs. 1 subject each with TEAEs of septic shock, pulmonary 
haemorrhage, pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 
The safety data from the study does not give raise to new safety concerns. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding ibrutinib in combination with RICE or RVICI in paediatric 
patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma the MAH should either 
submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a 
justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days 
after the receipt of these conclusions. 
•  Section 4.2 should be updated by replacing the text ‘No data are available’ with a reference to 
section 5.1 
•  Section 5.1 of the SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of MS100070-
0306 (number of patients, the diagnoses and that no responses were seen) 
•  Section 5.2 subsection ‘Paediatric population’ should be updated with information on 
comparability in PK exposure between children and adults. Note that additional information 
related to the PopPK analysis is required to support the MAH conclusion of comparable PK 
exposure in children vs adults, and this should be included in case a variation is submitted.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegvaliase, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on dyspnoea from clinical trials and spontaneous reports and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pegvaliase and 
dyspnoea is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of 
products containing pegvaliase should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegvaliase the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegvaliase is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

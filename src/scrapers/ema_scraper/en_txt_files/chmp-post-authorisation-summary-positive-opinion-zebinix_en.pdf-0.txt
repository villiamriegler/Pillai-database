On 13 October 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending changes to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Zebinix. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bial - Portela & Cª, S.A. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
"Zebinix is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, 
with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation". 
In addition, Zebinix will be available as an oral suspension (50 mg/ml). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
According to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 12 December 2006, the Company hereby submits the clinical study report HPV-071, Month 36 data, 
entitled: “ A Phase IIIb observer-blind, randomized, multicentre primary immunization study to 
evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and 
Merck's Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Recombinant Vaccine, when 
administered intramuscularly according to alternative 2-dose schedules in 9-14 year old healthy 
females. 
Study reports for Month 7, dated 23 May 2014, and Month 12, dated 11 February 2015, were 
previously submitted under Article 46 of the regulation 1901/2006 on 12 March 2015 (as part of the 
variation II/67, eCTD sequence 0192). The Annex study report for Month 18 & Month 24, dated 13 
August 2015, was previously submitted under Article 46 of the regulation 1901/2006 on 07 September 
2015 (eCTD sequence 0207). 
Non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was 
demonstrated at Month 18 and Month 24 when Cervarix was administered according to a 2-dose 
schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Gardasil administered according to a 2-dose 
schedule at 0, 6 months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.  
Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose 
schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years. However, more SAEs were reported in the 2-dose Cervarix 
group over the entire study period up until Month 24, as well as in the period between Month 18 and 
Month 24, compared to the Gardasil groups, regardless of the number of Gardasil doses.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 091 
The MAH submitted a report at Month 36 for Study 115411 (HPV-071 PRI), a Phase IIIb observer-
blind, randomized, multicentre (Sweden, Hong Kong, France and Singapore) primary immunization 
study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix (bivalent HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04-
adjuvanted) and Gardasil (quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 aluminium-adjuvanted), when administered 
intramuscularly according to alternative 2-dose schedules in 9-14 year old healthy females.

2.1.1.  Clinical study 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
Immunogenicity 
• 
The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as 
determined by ELISA) of Cervarix was non-inferior/superior to that of Gardasil after 
administration according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old females, one 
month after the last dose (Month 7).  
If non-inferiority at Month 7 was shown, non-inferiority/superiority analysis by comparison of 
the immune response to both vaccine antigens between the Cervarix 2-dose group and the 
Gardasil 2-dose group at Months 12, 18, 24 and 36 will be performed (first secondary 
objective). 
Secondary objective 
Immunogenicity 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially 
if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule is non-
inferior/superior to that of a 2-dose Gardasil schedule, both administered at 0, 6 months, at 
Months 12, 18, 24 and 36. 
If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially 
if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule at 0, 6 
months is non-inferior/superior to that of a 3-dose Gardasil schedule at 0, 2, 6 months at 
Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36. 
To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by ELISA at Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 
18, 24 and 36 in all subjects. 
To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by PBNA in a subset of subjects at 
Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36. 
To assess cell-mediated immunity (CMI), i.e., T-cell-mediated and memory B-cell immune 
responses specific to HPV-16 and HPV-18 in a sub-cohort of subjects at Day 0, Months 7, 12, 
24 and 36.

Statistical Methods 
Comparison between groups 
• 
Primary between-group comparisons to assess the non-inferiority at Month 7 were performed 
in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative by ELISA at Day 0 for the 
antigen under analysis. Subjects seropositive for only one antigen were eliminated for the 
analysis of that antigen but were still evaluable for the analysis of the other antigen. In 
addition, non-inferiority assessment was also performed in the TVC on all subjects (regardless 
of serostatus at Day 0). 
•  Between-group comparisons to assess superiority were performed in the TVC on all subjects 
(regardless of serostatus at Day 0). In addition, superiority assessment was also performed in 
the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative at Day 0 for the antigen under 
analysis.  
Criteria for non-inferiority 
•  Non-inferiority with respect to seroconversion rates was shown if, one month after the last 
dose, for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the 
difference (Gardasil minus Cervarix) was below 5%. 
•  Non-inferiority with respect to GMT for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was 
shown if, one month after the last dose, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio 
(Gardasil divided by Cervarix) was below 2. 
Criteria for superiority 
• 
If non-inferiority was reached, and if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of 
GMTs Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity, the following criteria for superiority were to be assessed sequentially in the 
TVC: 
o  First, superiority for HPV-18 was assessed. Superiority was shown if the lower limit of 
the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for anti-HPV-18 antibodies (Cervarix divided by 
Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated p-value.  
o  Second, if superiority for HPV-18 is shown, superiority for HPV-16 was assessed. 
Superiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for anti-
HPV-16 antibodies (Cervarix divided by Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated p-
value. 
Demographic characteristics 
• 
• 
In the ATP cohort, the age at vaccination was comparable between the different groups (11.5 ± 
1.62 years in Cervarix group, 11.5 ± 1.55 years in Gardasil 2-dose group and 11.6 ± 1.63 years 
in Gardasil 3-dose group).  
The three groups had a comparable ethnical/racial distribution, with an approximate 50% of 
the subjects in each group of East Asian heritage and an approximate 25% of Caucasian

Results 
Efficacy results 
HPV-16/18 serostatus at baseline 
The majority of subjects was initially seronegative for both HPV-16 and HPV-18, i.e., 96% in all groups 
(Table 4).

At the Month 36 time point:  
Non-inferiority in terms of both seroconversion and GMT ratio was met since:  
• 
• 
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates (HPV-6/11/16/18 (0, 
6) schedule minus HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 
antibodies was below 5% in the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-6/11/16/18 (0, 6) schedule divided by 
HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was below 2 in 
the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
Superiority analysis on primary objective (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2-dose, M36) 
Because non-inferiority was reached, and the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs 
Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, a 
superiority analysis was performed. 
Rapporteur’s  
EMA/100669/2017  
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the Month 36 time point:  
Superiority in terms of GMT ratio was met as:  
• 
the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule divided by HPV- 
6/11/16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-18 and anti-HPV-16 antibodies was above 1, in 
the Month 36 Total Vaccinated cohort.  
Assessor’s comment 
The primary objective of the study was met.  
After Cervarix vaccination as compared to Gardasil vaccination, both administered according to a 2-
dose schedule in females aged 9-14 years of age, study HPV-071 demonstrated at Month 36. 
-  Non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates; and 
-  Superiority in terms of GMT ratio in the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
Non-inferiority analysis on secondary objective (Cervarix 2D vs Gardasil 3D, M36) 
The secondary objective, i.e. to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) 
of Cervarix administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months was non-inferior/superior to 
that of Gardasil vaccine administered according to the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 2, 6 months) at 
Month 36, was also met for this study.

At the Month 36 time point:  
Non-inferiority in terms of both seroconversion and GMT ratio was met since:  
• 
• 
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates (HPV-6/11/16/18 [0, 2, 
6] schedule minus HPV-16/18 [0, 6] schedule for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies 
was below 5% in the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-6/11/16/18 [0, 2, 6] schedule divided by 
HPV-16/18 [0, 6] schedule) for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was below 2 in 
the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity  
Superiority analysis on secondary objective (Cervarix 2D vs Gardasil 3D, M36) 
Because non-inferiority was reached, and the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs 
Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, a 
superiority analysis was performed.

EMA/100669/2017  
Page 13/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the Month 36 time point:  
Superiority in terms of GMT ratio was met as:  
• 
the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-16/18 [0,6] schedule divided by HPV- 
6/11/16/18 [0, 2, 6] schedule) for both anti-HPV-18 and anti-HPV-16 antibodies was above 1, 
in the Month 36 Total Vaccinated cohort.  
Assessor’s comment 
After a 2-dose Cervarix vaccination as compared to a 3-dose Gardasil vaccination in females aged 
9-14 years of age, study HPV-071 demonstrated at Month 36 
-  Non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates; and 
-  Superiority in terms of GMT ratio in the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
In the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in the HPV_2D 
group, and at least 99.3% of subjects in the Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-
HPV-16 antibodies when measured by ELISA. All initially seronegative subjects in the HPV_2D group, 
and at least 86.1% of subjects in the Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 
antibodies, when measured by ELISA.  
Persistence of HPV antibody titres (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2-dose or 3-dose) 
GMT levels for neutralising antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak 
response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 36 in all three groups. This is in line with 
previous observations.

Page 14/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 24  
Pseudovirion-based neutralization assays (PBNA) for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 was performed on a 
subset of 100 randomly selected subjects for each study group. 
• 
In the month 24 ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in HPV_2D and 
Gard_2D groups, and 98.9% of subjects in the Gard_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 
neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. 
•  All initially seronegative subjects in HPV_2D group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 
neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. In Gard_2D group, 90.4% of subjects and in 
Gard_3D group, 96.7% of subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies 
when measured by PBNA at M24. 
•  GMT levels for neutralizing antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a 
peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 24 in all three groups. 
Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 36 
Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol except that the Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization 
Assay (PBNA) analysis was not performed at the Month 24 time point but well at M36. In the Month 36 
ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in the HPV_2D, Gard_2D Gard_3D 
groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. All initially 
seronegative subjects in HPV_2D group, 86.2% of subjects in Gard_2D group and 94.5% of subjects in 
Gard_3D group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. 
GMT levels for neutralising antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had 
reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 36 in all 
three groups. 
T-cell-mediated immune responses 
•  CD4+ T cell response 
At Month 36, overall CD4+ T cell response (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigenspecific 
CD4+ T cells per million CD4+ T cells expressing at least two different immune markers [all doubles]) 
was1012.0, 685.0 and 842.5 cells per million CD4+ T cells in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, 
respectively for HPV-16. HPV-18 specific CD4+ T cell response was 682.0, 350.0 and 516.0 cells per 
million CD4+ T cells in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively. Figure 4. CD4+ all

•  CD8+ T cell response 
As observed in the previous time points, HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD8+ T cells response was 
undetectable (up to 4.0 cells per million CD8+ T cells) in all three groups at Month 36. 
Memory B-cell-mediated immune responses 
At Month 36, B cell response (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigen-specific memory B 
cells per million memory B cells in subjects with detectable B cells) was 353.0, 390.0 and 246.0 cells 
per million memory B cells in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively, for HPV-16. The 
HPV-18 specific memory B cell response was 116.0 cells, 25.0 and 69.5 cells per million memory B 
cells in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively.

Serious adverse events: 
•  A SAE with a fatal outcome due to committed suicide was reported for subject  (Gard_3D 
group) at Month 36. The investigator considered that there was no causal relationship between 
the subject’s suicide and the vaccine administered. 
•  Up to the end of the study (Month 36), a total of 46 subjects (21 subjects in the HPV_2D group, 
11 subjects in the Gard_2D group and 14 subjects in the Gard_3D group) reported at least one 
SAE. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship to vaccination.  
•  All SAEs resolved without sequelae except for the SAEs - colitis ulcerative, anaphylactic 
reaction (food dependant exercise induced anaphylaxis), tension headache and juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis which were ongoing at the time of the data lock point of this study for the 
Month 36 time point. 
Medically significant conditions: 
•  Up to Month 36, a total of 219 subjects reported at least one MSC (77 subjects in HPV_2D 
group,79 subjects in Gard_2D group and 63 subjects in Gard_3D group) in the TVC. 
Potential Immune-Mediated Dissorders (pIMDs) up to Month 12: 
•  A total of six subjects in the TVC (three subjects each in the HPV_2D and Gard_2D groups) 
reported at least one pIMD up to Month 12. One pIMD (arthritis reactive) was considered 
by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: 
•  Subject  (Gard_3D group) was withdrawn as a result of a fatal SAE (completed suicide). There 
were no other withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events from Month 24 to 
Month 36. 
Concomitant medications /vaccinations: 
•  Up to Month 36, in the Total Vaccinated cohort, any concomitant medication was received by 
47.6%, 43.9% and 45.0% of subjects in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively. 
Any antipyretic medication was received by 30.6%, 28.5% and 26.5% of subjects in HPV_2D, 
Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively. Prophylactic antipyretic medication was received 
by 1.4%, 0.6% and 0.6% of subjects in HPV_2D, Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively. 
Any antibiotic medication was received by 13.4%, 11.7% and 14.0% of subjects in HPV_2D, 
Gard_2D and Gard_3D groups, respectively. 
Pregnancies: 
• 
There was one report of a pregnancy (Gard_3D group) up to Month 36, which was electively 
terminated with no apparent congenital anomaly. 
More SAEs were reported for Cervarix over the entire study period up until Month 36, as well as in the 
period between Month 18 and Month 24, but not between M24 and M36 as shown in Tables 8 and 9 
below.

Table 9. Global Summary of SAEs from Month 24 – Month 36 (Month 24 Total Vaccinated cohort) 
None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to 
vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae except for the SAEs - colitis ulcerative, anaphylactic 
reaction and juvenile idiopathic arthritis which were resolving at the time of the data lock point of this 
study. 
2.1.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Immunogenicity results 
Non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was 
demonstrated at Month 36 when Cervarix was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 
months in 9-14 year old females versus Gardasil administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 
months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.  
Safety results 
Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose 
schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years. However, more SAEs were reported in the 2-dose Cervarix 
group over the entire study period up until Month 36 regardless of the number of Gardasil doses. 
Up to the end of the study (Month 36), a total of 46 subjects (21 subjects in the HPV_2D group, 11 
subjects in the Gard_2D group and 14 subjects in the Gard_3D group) reported at least one SAE. The 
occurrence of the SAEs after Cervarix were reported the first 18 months. According to the CSR, none of 
the SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
In conclusion, non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 
antigens was demonstrated up to Month 36 by the Applicant when HPV-16/18 vaccine was 
administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Merck's 
HPV-6/11/16/18 L1 VLP recombinant vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 
months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.  
The safety profile of HPV-16/18 vaccine was in line with the known safety profile of the vaccine, and 
that of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was in line with the Prescribing Information. Both vaccines were 
generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose schedule in subjects aged 
9-14 years.  
The HPV-071 PRI study results are in line with the approved PI. No changes to the SmPC are needed. 
The Article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is needed. 
The provided data do not cause concern regarding efficacy or safety of Cervarix. 
The benefit/risk balance of Cervarix remains positive. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

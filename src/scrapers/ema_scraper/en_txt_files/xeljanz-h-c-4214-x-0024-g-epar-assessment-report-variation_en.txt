2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for tofacitinib oral IR tablet and oral solution 5mg BID is for the treatment of active 
pJIA in subjects 2 years of age and older.   
JIA is an umbrella-term describing a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by chronic arthritis.   
Polyarticular JIA is defined as arthritis affecting 5 or more joints during the first 6-month period and includes 
RF+ polyarthritis and, RF-polyarthritis according to ILAR classification.  Subjects with other subtypes of JIA 
who later develop arthritis in multiple joints can also have polyarticular disease e.g. extended polyarthritis, 
however they are excluded from the ILAR polyarticular JIA. 
Table 1.  Subtypes of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
Subtype 
RF+ Polyarthritis 
RF- Polyarthritis 
Oligoarthritis 
Brief description 
Symmetric polyarthritis that affects 5 or more joints during the first 
6 months of disease.  Primarily involves small joints of the hands and feet.  
Large joints may also be involved.  Includes presence of IgM RF on at 
least 2 occasions.  Severe extra-articular manifestations are rare. 
Asymmetric polyarthritis that affects 5 or more joints during the first 6 
months of disease.  The most heterogenous subtype and is characterized by 
the absence of IgM RF.  It has 3 distinct subsets that have different 
manifestations and overall prognoses.   
Asymmetric arthritis primarily affecting the legs with knee joints most 
affected followed by ankles.  Is usually accompanied by anti-nuclear 
antibody (ANA) positivity and anterior uveitis. 
Oligoarthritis, persistenta 
Affects no more than 4 joints at any time 
Oligoarthritis, extendeda 
Affects 5 or more joints after the first 6 months of disease 
Systemic arthritis 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Arthritis with or preceded by fever and 1 or more of the following:  non-
fixed erythematosus rash, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, generalized 
lymphoadenopathy, or serositis. 
Simultaneous presence of arthritis and typical psoriatic rash or family 
history of psoriasis, dactylitis, or nail pitting.  Frequently at risk for 
iridocyclitis and can be ANA positive. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Undefined 
Enthesitis and peripheral arthritis.  May also involve the sacroiliac and 
spinal joints.  Most subjects are HLA-B27 positive. 
Arthritis that does not fulfil any of the above categories or that fulfils more 
than one category

2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
JIA  is  the  most  common  rheumatologic  condition  of  childhood  with  an  annual  incidence  in  developed 
countries of 2 to 20 per 100,000  and a prevalence of 16 to  150 per 100,000. 
Afflicted children have recurrent periods of disease flares which often persist into adulthood leading to long-
term morbidity, physical disability and decreased quality of life. 
Children with  polyarticular JIA tend to  have a more refractory course compared to those with  fewer 
involved joints.  Due to a prolonged course of active disease, the  children are at increased risk for joint 
damage, resulting in  poorer functional outcomes and decreased quality of life. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  pathogenesis  of  JIA  is  not  well  characterized but  seems to  include  both  genetic  and  environmental 
components. 
Genetics are thought  to contribute  up to  a third  of the risk of developing JIA and  HLA genes are the most 
important with  several identified HLA alleles being associated with  different pJIA subtypes. 
Polyarticular and oligoarticular JIA are autoimmune diseases involving the adaptive immune system with T 
lymphocytes playing a central role, releasing proinflammatory cytokines in response to a self-antigen.  Soon 
after the initial  autoreactive response, almost the entire immune system (innate and adaptive) is involved 
in the  immune response (Prakken et al, 2011).   Similar to RA and other autoimmune diseases, there is an 
imbalance in the immune system in pJIA which leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines 
such  as  IL-17,  IL-6,  IL-1,  and  TNF-  alpha  (Hahn  et  al,  2010).    Modulation  of  these  cytokines  results  in 
improvement of clinical outcomes which  suggests that these cytokines play an important  role in pJIA. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Polyarticular JIA diagnosis is based upon clinical observations and examinations requiring exclusion of other 
known conditions.  No laboratory test  can confirm the diagnosis. 
Chronic  pain,  joint  tenderness  and  swelling,  stiffness,  decreased  range  of  motion,  decreased  muscle 
strength,  poor cardiovascular endurance, increased fatigue  and headaches are often reported by children 
and adolescents with  pJIA.  
Long-term  physical  consequences  of  pJIA  include:  1)  Local  Growth  Disturbances  and  Limb-length 
Discrepancy; 2)  Generalized Growth  Disturbance;  3)  Osteopenia;  4)  Functional  disability  and  decreased 
quality of life.  
Children with  pJIA experience functional impairment due to joint and back pain, heel pain, swelling of joints 
and morning stiffness, contractures, pain, and anterior uveitis leading to blindness.  Functional impairment 
often  continues  into  adulthood,  with  subjects  having  continued  disease  activity,  medication-associated 
morbidity, and life-long disability and risk for emotional and social dysfunction. 
Children with pJIA have lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared to normative data. They are 
less  physically  active  and  participate  less  often  in  competitive  sports  and  spend  more  time  sedentary 
compared with their peers without pJIA. This aspect may lead to less ability to make friends, social isolation, 
depression, and physical deconditioning  (Norgaard and Herlin, 2019;  Milatz et  al, 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 10/118 
  
  
2.1.5.  Management 
Conventional  treatment  options  for  pJIA  include  local  glucocorticoid  injections,  systemic glucocorticoids, 
non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  and  conventional  synthetic  disease-modifying  anti-
rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (Schiappapietra et al, 2015; Ringold et al, 2014). 
csDMARDs  are  first-line  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  pJIA  due  to  their  proven  ability  to  minimize  joint 
damage and improve symptoms.  Methotrexate (MTX) is the  most widely used csDMARD; side effects such 
as gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity  are often associated with  its use (Ringold et al,  2019; Falvey et al, 
2017).   
Biological DMARDS (bDMARDs) have revolutionized the  treatment  of pJIA,  especially in  those  who  fail  to 
respond  to  csDMARDs (Hodge  et  al,  2016;  Ringold  et  al,  2019).    Tumor necrosis  factor (TNF)  inhibitors 
were the  first  bDMARD approved for  the  treatment  of pJIA,  are the  most widely  used class of  bDMARDs, 
and have been shown to  lead to significant  improvement in  the  reduction of signs and symptoms of pJIA.  
Since  their  approval, several  other  classes  of  bDMARDs  have  also  been  approved for  use  in  pJIA  (IL-1 
inhibitors, IL-6  inhibitors, selective T cell costimulation modulator) (Sterba and Ilowite, 2016).    
Despite the  many benefits  of  bDMARDs, there  are still  downsides  to  their  use  in  children  with  pJIA such 
route of administration (parenteral) and the potential development of anti-drug antibodies which can result 
in loss of efficacy over time. 
Early pharmacological and  non-pharmacological treatment  of the  disease is imperative for the  prevention 
of irreversible soft tissue and joint damage (Hashkes, 2011; HaywardandWallace, 2009).  Most treatments 
can  be used  to  control  and  delay the  progression of  symptoms of  pJIA, as  well  as prevent  joint  damage 
over  the  long  term  (Hashkes,  2011;  Beukelmann  et  al,  2011).    Consequently,  the  current  treatment 
approach  has  shifted  from  a  pyramidal  approach  to  more  aggressive  therapy  with  earlier  initiation  of 
bDMARDs. 
Although  treatments  are available to  control  and  delay the  progression of  symptoms  of  pJIA,  as well  as 
prevent  joint  damage over  the  long  term,  however,  additional  therapy  options  are  still  needed  as  up  to 
30% of children with  pJIA continue  to have active disease despite treatment with  MTX or biological agents 
(Lovell,  2006;  Otten  et  al,  2013).    For  children  who  have failed  currently  available bDMARDs, additional 
therapies with  novel mechanisms may be required to control their disease. 
Moreover,  the  effective  treatment  of  many  rheumatic  diseases  requires  parenteral  administration  of 
medications. There are significant barriers to injections with most children having a fear of injection needles; 
oral route is the preferred and considered the most appropriate route of administration to pediatric subjects.  
Repeated injections required for children with  JIA may result in long-term consequences such as increased 
stress  and  decreased quality  of  life  (Jacobse  et  al,  2019).    In  addition,  the  use  of  injectables  for  the 
treatment of JIA can pose a significant burden for subjects and parents due to the need to either administer 
them at home or require additional doctor visits for administration (Klein et al, 2012).    
Oral agents are welcome to reduce the stress of parenteral administration on children with pJIA and their 
families.  Unmet  medical need remains for new effective oral systemic therapies that could provide a 
favourable benefit-risk assessment. 
About the product 
Mode of action 
Tofacitinib  is a potent,  selective inhibitor  of the  JAK family. In enzymatic assays, tofacitinib  inhibits  JAK1, 
JAK2,  JAK3,  and to  a lesser extent  TyK2.  In  contrast,  tofacitinib  has  a  high  degree of  selectivity against 
other  kinases  in  the  human  genome.  In  human  cells,  tofacitinib  preferentially  inhibits  signalling  by 
Assessment report

heterodimeric  cytokine  receptors  that  associate  with  JAK3  and/or  JAK1  with  functional  selectivity  over 
cytokine  receptors  that  signal  via  pairs  of  JAK2.Inhibition  of  JAK1  and  JAK3  by  tofacitinib  attenuates 
signalling of interleukins (IL-2, -4, -6, -7,  -9, -15, -21)  and type I and type II interferons, which  will result 
in modulation of the immune and inflammatory response. 
Pharmacological classification 
Tofacitinib belongs to the therapeutic group of Immunosuppressants (L04)  and its therapeutic subgroup is 
L04AA29. 
The  new  proposed extension  of  indication  as  initially  claimed  by  the  MAH  is  for  the  treatment  of  active 
polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in patients 2  years of age and older. 
The recommended dose of tofacitinib  is 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily or tofacitinib  oral solution 
weight-based equivalent twice daily, which  should not be exceeded (Table 2).

solution)  for  XELJANZ  (tofacitinib)  for  the  treatment  of  active  polyarticular  course  juvenile  idiopathic 
arthritis (pJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older as initially applied by the MAH, in accordance with Article 
2(3)  and 2(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008  (‘the Variations Regulation’). This application 
concerns Xeljanz 5 mg IR tablet formulation and a new oral solution formulation at 1 mg/mL.   
The tofacitinib clinical development programme for JIA was designed to  evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice  daily or tofacitinib oral solution weight-based equivalent twice 
daily for patients aged 2 years to < 18 years. This application in pJIA was supported by 4 clinical studies 
– Studies A3921103,  A3921104,  A3921145 (interim  analysis – data cutoff date of 04  June 2019), and 
A3921354.    
The 2 tablet formulations used in  the pJIA programme (Phase 3 tablet  and commercial tablet)  were shown 
to be bioequivalent in  Study A3921075.  The proposed commercial oral solution  formulation includes minor 
composition differences compared to the clinical oral solution formulation used in the pJIA program, and an 
in vivo study for bridging the commercial oral solution is not considered necessary. The clinical oral solution 
formulation  was bridged to  the  commercial tablet  formulation  used in  the  pJIA program in healthy  adults

(A3921354).  Therefore, a 5 mg dose of the oral solution (5  mL of the  1 mg/mL oral solution)  can be used 
interchangeably with  a 5 mg IR tablet  for treatment of JIA. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Xeljanz 5 and 10 mg film coated tablets and Xeljanz 11 mg prolonged release tablets are already 
authorised medicinal products in the  EU (EU/1/17/1178/001-014).  This is a line extension to register a 
new pharmaceutical form (oral solution).  The finished product is presented as oral solution containing 
tofacitinib  citrate, equivalent to  1 mg tofacitinib as active substance. 
Other ingredients are grape flavour [containing  propylene glycol (E1520),  glycerin (E422),  and natural 
flavour], hydrochloric acid, lactic acid (E270),  purified water, sodium benzoate (E211), sucralose (E955), 
and xylitol (E967) 
The product is available in white coloured HDPE bottles  with a child resistant, polypropylene cap with  PP 
liner sealed by aluminium-foil  heat-induction seal and a 5 mL  oral dosing syringe with  3.2 mL,  4 mL, and 
5 mL gradations. The container closure system also includes a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) press-in 
bottle adapter (PIBA) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to  manufacture the new pharmaceutical form is the same as that  used in  the 
manufacture of the currently authorised Xeljanz 5 and 10 mg film coated tablets  and 11 mg prolonged 
release tablets (EU/1/17/1178/001-014). 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical development 
Tofacitinib oral solution, 1 mg/mL, will  be provided as a multi-use, clear, colourless solution. 
The oral solution,  1 mg/mL, has been developed for the treatment  of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 
is intended for use in paediatric patients  that have difficulty swallowing  tablets. Patients who are later able 
to swallow tablets are expected to transition from the oral solution to the commercial 5 mg tablets. 
Other  than  the  active substance properties described in  the  previously approved marketing authorisation 
application,  the  solubility  of  the  active  substance,  compatibility  with  the  oral  solution  excipients,  and 
compatibility with  the manufacturing  materials are of relevance for the new  oral solution.  The same active 
substance specification is used for the  oral solution product than  the already authorised tablet. 
All excipients are well  known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality  is compliant  with Ph. Eur 
standards except the flavour grape which  complies with  “in house” specifications. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list  of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1  of this report. The components of the grape flavour comply with applicable 
food flavouring regulations, are approved by the  FDA under CFR 21 and/or are considered GRAS 
(Generally Recognized As Safe), comply with  the IOFI (International Organization of the Flavour Industry) 
Code of Practice and meet the criteria of EC regulation No 1334/2008.The  tofacitinib  formulation

concentration of 1 mg/mL was chosen to provide appropriate dose flexibility in the target population.  The 
proposed dosage volume is 3.2  to 5 mL administered twice daily, with the  dosing prescribed based on 
patient weight  and optimised background therapy. The nominated concentration, 1 mg/mL, 
accommodates the delivery of the  highest and lowest proposed dosages using practical administration 
volumes utilizing  the dosing device (dose-marked oral syringe).  
The proposed commercial manufacturing process was established based on prior knowledge and experience 
with  other  oral liquid  products,  as well  as the  experience gained from manufacturing  clinical  and primary 
stability  batches  of  the  finished  product.  During  compounding,  the  time  to  dissolve the active substance 
and  in-process pH  control are  the  critical  process parameters. During packaging,  insertion  of  the  bottles 
into the  secondary packaging is the  critical processing parameter.  
The  primary packaging  is HDPE  bottles  with  a  child  resistant,  polypropylene cap with  PP  liner  sealed by 
aluminium-foil heat-induction  seal and a 5 mL CE marked oral dosing syringe with 3.2 mL, 4 mL, and 5 mL 
gradations. The  container closure system  also includes a  low-density  polyethylene (LDPE) press-in  bottle 
adapter  (PIBA).  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container 
closure system has  been validated by  stability  data and  is  adequate for the  intended  use of  the  product. 
The  suitability  of  the  graduation  of the  syringe was not  shown  at  the  time  of  submission. Therefore, the 
CHMP raised a major objection requesting that the precision and accuracy of dosing of the finished product 
with  the  syringe  should  be  shown  and  this  precision and  accuracy of  dosing  should  be  guaranteed  from 
release throughout  storage  until  the  end  of  shelf  life.  The  MAH  demonstrated  precision and  accuracy of 
dispensing the  finished  product using  the  commercial oral syringe. The effect of  ageing on  dose accuracy 
and the potential printing ink fading during storage and use were studied using representative oral syringes, 
identical to the  commercial oral syringe in every way except that  the representative syringes have generic 
dose markings instead of custom prescribed dose markings. This was considered satisfactory 
Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: compounding, filtration,  filling and packaging using 
conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment. The process is considered to  be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended 
quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The  finished product  release and shelf-life  specifications include  appropriate tests  for this  kind of  dosage 
form:  appearance (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay (UPLC),  impurities  (UPLC),  sodium  benzoate 
content (UPLC),  pH (Ph. Eur.),  and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.)  
The specifications in  the  finished product  are set in  line  with  stability  studies  and current  guidelines. This 
was considered satisfactory. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with  the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities Based on the risk assessment and 
the presented batch data it can be concluded that  it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity 
controls. 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 14/118 
  
  
 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the finished product has been 
performed (as requested as Major Objection) considering all suspected and actual root causes in  line with 
the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP  Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  referral on nitrosamine impurities in  human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC 
(No) 726/2004-  Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified  on the  possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with  the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing  has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 22 pilot and commercial scale batches confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to  24 months at the long 
term storage conditions of 25°C/40%  RH (testing  started at 12 months) and 30°C/35%  RH and 6 months 
at the accelerated storage conditions  of 40°C/20 % RH according to  the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in  the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were  tested  for  appearance, assay,  degradation products,  as  well  as  preservative efficacy  (pH, 
sodium benzoate content,  antimicrobial effectiveness), microbiological quality and weight  loss.  
Under  long term  and  accelerated conditions,  the observed changes in  the  tested  parameters were small, 
and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when  used according to the 
directions in the SmPC. 
Photostability  studies  were carried out  on  all  three  batches  of the  finished  product  according to  the  ICH 
Guideline Q1B on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were 
observed in any of the parameters measured for the confirmatory photostability study for samples packaged 
in the proposed commercial packaging HDPE bottle  in a paperboard individual folding carton (IFC)). 
Forced degradation experiments were performed to establish the extent and nature of potential degradation 
pathways  and  to  confirm  the  suitability  of  the  assay  and  purity  method.  The  stress  conditions  included 
thermal,  photolysis, acid/base, peroxide, free radical initiator  and  metals. The  studies  conducted showed 
an  increase  of  degradation  was  induced  under  thermal,  photolysis  and  free  radical  oxidation  stress 
conditions.  Under  these  conditions,  one  specified  degradant  increased to  a  in  the  free radical  oxidation 
stress condition  and another  specified degradant increased in  the  thermal stress condition.  These studies 
confirm that the assay/purity method is selective and stability  indicating. 
The finished product  is a multidose product.  In-use stability  studies have been performed. One batch was 
analysed at 3 and 12 months at 30°C/ 35% RH (upright orientation). Additionally, in-use was evaluated for 
another  batch  at  24  months  and  a  third  batch  was  evaluated  at  36  months  at  25°C/  40%  RH  (upright 
orientation)  and  30°C/  35%  RH  (upright  orientation).    Based on the  in-use  stability  data  an  in-use label 
restriction of 90 days is warranted. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and store in the original bottle  and 
package in order to protect from light as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. It should be 
discarded after 60 days of first opening.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out  indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that  the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Two issues were raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO).  The first MO  requesting the  demonstration of 
precision and accuracy of dosing of the finished product with  the syringe to  be guaranteed from release 
throughout  storage until  the end of shelf life and the second MO  requesting the risk evaluation concerning 
the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the finished product. Responses to both issues were provided by 
the applicant and considered to be satisfactory by CHMP.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not  applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
With  this application, the MAH  proposes the use of tofacitinib  IR tablet or oral solution in the  treatment of 
pJIA in children aged 2 to 18 years. Administration of tofacitinib is by weight-based IR tablet BID at 5  mg 
or weight-based oral solution BID at  1 mg/mL. Comparable exposure is expected between tablet and oral 
solution administration.   Hence, the nonclinical assessment of the  IR tablet  and oral solution formulation 
of tofacitinib for pJIA is supported by the previous nonclinical assessment of the IR tablet  formulation of 
tofacitinib  for rheumatoid arthritis. 
Assessment of the oral solution  formulation impurities has been performed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The MAH has not submitted  new pharmacology results, which  is acceptable to CHMP  since the nonclinical 
assessment for pJIA is supported by the  previous nonclinical assessment of the  IR tablet formulation of 
tofacitinib  for rheumatoid arthritis.   
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 16/118 
  
  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH has not submitted  new pharmacokinetics results, which is acceptable to CHMP  since the 
nonclinical assessment for pJIA is supported by the  previous nonclinical assessment of the  IR tablet 
formulation of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The MAH has only submitted toxicology results on impurities of the oral forumlation, which is acceptable 
to CHMP  since the  nonclinical assessment for pJIA is supported by the previous nonclinical assessment of 
the IR tablet formulation of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis.   
Bone toxicity  
During  the last  modification  of the  Xeljanz JIA  PIP (EMEA-000576-PIP01-09-M12),  a review of  the  safety 
information was provided by the applicant, with  regard to the potential risk for bone and joint development. 
This  in  light  of  the  potential  effects seen in  a  juvenile rats study  with  another JAK  inhibitor  compound of 
the same class.  
Juvenile toxicity studies in  rats and cynomolgus monkeys (studies GR307 and 09GR248,  respectively) the 
age of which  were selected to support human age of ≥2 years, were conducted.  
Since bone and joint were not identified as target organs in adult animals, these tissues were not examined 
microscopically in juveniles. 
In the  juvenile rat toxicity  and rat fertility  studies,  no tofacitinib-related  clinical observation suggestive of 
bone  or  joint  abnormalities  (change  in  limb  and/or  paw  use  and  positioning,  gait  abnormalities  or 
macroscopic changes  in  bent  bones and  fractures) were noted  in  macroscopic examinations at  necropsy. 
Similar results were seen in  the  monkey, moreover no  effects on bone growth  assessed by  differences in 
the rate of radius or tibia lengthening  (as per ICH S11) were seen.   
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
Study CP-703058  (Hydrolysis Product) 
The  proposed control  limit  for CP-703058  is 1.0%  in  the  oral solution.  CP-703058  was classified  as non-
mutagenic  (class  5)  based  on  the  in-silico  assessment  in  DEREK  and  SARAH, structural  similarity to  the 
Ames  negative  drug  substance,  negative  Ames  data  on  a  large  number  of  relevant structures  (internal 
data),  and expert review of the  in-silico  predictions. CP-703058  has been evaluated in  nonclinical toxicity 
studies,  including  a  6-week  oral  rat  study  at  up  to  100  mg/kg/day  (Study  01-2063-06)  and  a  39-week 
juvenile oral  monkey study  at  up  to  10  mg/kg/day (Study  2501-010).  The highest  dose administered of 
100  mg/kg/day in the  6-week rat study resulted in effects consistent with  the  intended inhibition  of Janus 
kinase [JAK]  pharmacology. The  no  observed adverse effect  level  (NOAEL)  in  the  39-week  oral  juvenile 
monkey toxicity study was 2 mg/kg/day, and adverse findings at 10 mg/kg/day (lowest observed adverse 
effect level [LOAEL]) were considered related to the  exaggerated pharmacology of tofacitinib. The findings 
in both the rat and juvenile monkey studies were attributed to the pharmacological properties of tofacitinib. 
CP-703058  was  present at  0.10%  in  Lot  43798-2-1H  used in  the  6-week rat  study  and at  0.11%  in  Lot 
E01001098 used in the 39-week juvenile monkey study. Therefore, the dose of CP-703058 that corresponds 
to  the high  dose in  the 6-week rat study  was 100 μg/kg/day, and 2.2  μg/kg/day and 11  μg/kg/day in  the 
39-week  juvenile monkey study  at  the  NOAEL  and LOAEL  doses,  respectively. The  LOAEL  in  the  juvenile 
monkey study  is  used to  qualify the  CP-703058  impurity  as  all  the  effects observed  in  the  study  at  that 
Assessment report

dose can  be attributed  to  the  pharmacology of  tofacitinib  and  were completely reversible. The  maximum 
anticipated dose of CP-703058  at 1.0%  of the API in humans is 8 μg/kg/day for 2 mg tofacitinib 
administered BID to  a 5  kg child.  Therefore, CP-703058  is  considered qualified  as an impurity  in  the  oral 
formulation of tofacitinib up to  1.0%. 
Study PF-04471928  (Oxidation  Product; Rat,  Monkey,  Human  Metabolite  M9) 
The  proposed control  limit  for  PF-04471928  is  1.0%  in  the  oral  solution.  PF-04471928  was  classified  as 
non-mutagenic (class 5)  based on the  in-silico assessment in  DEREK and SARAH and expert review of the 
in silico predictions and training set structures. 
PF-04471928  is  present  as  a  metabolite  in  mass  balance  studies  in  rats,  monkeys,  and  humans,  and 
exposures have been estimated for the chronic repeat dose toxicity studies as well as the  human exposure 
following repeat dosing. Calculated exposures at the highest dose in the chronic rat study (in which changes 
observed were  consistent  with  the  intended  inhibition  of  JAK  pharmacology) exceeds those  of  the  most 
conservative human exposure projections, and the additional exposure in humans by contribution  from PF-
04471928  as an impurity is approximately 5% of the total  exposure to the metabolite. 
2.3.5.  Body burden in the monkey 9-month chronic toxicity study at the 
LOAEL was generally less than the estimated human body burden. The in-
silico data and body burden data support the control limit of 1% for PF-
04471928. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In this  line  extension to  add an  oral paediatric formulation,  the  impurities have been adequately qualified 
(study reports CP-703058 and PF-04471928)  in the oral formulation of tofacitinib up to 1.0%. With regards

to bone toxicity after review of the  safety information,  it is agreed with  the  PDCO that  current non-clinical 
and clinical data did not suggest an increased risk for lesions of bone tissue or effects on joints.    
To better evaluate potential tofacitinib effects on bone and joint development and growth, a further juvenile 
rat  toxicity  study  is  currently  planned  post-approval.  The  non-clinical  study  report  is  expected  to  be 
available in November 2021.   
Juvenile animal toxicity studies were conducted, and results have been assessed in the initial  marketing 
authorisation application. Section 5.3 of the SmPC is updated with  these results. 
ERA 
Tofacitinib has a log D value <4.5  at all environmentally relevant pHs.  Screening for Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) is not  required. 
The PECsw value is greater than the 0.01  µg/L action  limit. Based on the PEC value, a Phase II 
environmental fate and effects analysis for tofacitinib  was required. Biodegradation studies conducted in 
sludge indicated that tofacitinib  may undergo moderate degradation during the wastewater treatment 
process via mineralization and primary biodegradation. Based on a sludge sorption coefficient (Kd) of 37, 
a minimal amount (0.6%)  may be removed through sorption to  sludge during the  wastewater treatment 
process. 
Based on an aqueous dissipation half-life of 6.3 –19 days under aerobic conditions,  tofacitinib is expected 
to quickly dissipate from the water to the sediment and continue to degrade once in the environment 
(primary degradation half-life total  system of 26.3  to 52.8 days). Multiple  degradation products, all 
present at <10%, were observed in the  sediment compartment sampled throughout the  study, indicating 
that  tofacitinib is expected to undergo primary degradation under the aerobic conditions  present in the 
water-sediment system; it  is not expected to persist. Tofacitinib is not volatile and therefore will not  enter 
the air compartment. 
The chronic aquatic effects of tofacitinib  were assessed in green algae, fish and daphnia. 
The fathead minnow  NOEC, based on sub-lethal effects related to observations of crocked tails, was more 
conservative than the NOEC established for population  relevant of survival. 
As per guidance, the chronic NOEC for Daphnia  magna and for sludge were used to  calculate the PNEC 
ground water and the NOEC for sludge will  be used to calculate the PNEC micro-organisms. 
The PEC/PNEC values were <1,  leading to  the MAH conclusion that  tofacitinib is unlikely to represent a 
risk to  the aquatic and wastewater environment. No further testing  was required.  
The present application concerns an extension of indication  (JIA) and line extension. Although a  new 
indication may indeed lead to an increase of exposure in the environment, and epidemiological data 
concerning the  new indication should be taken into  consideration when updating  ERA, calculation of the 
PECsw was based on the maximum daily dose for all indications (including those previously approved), 
which is higher than that  of JIA one. This is accepted by the CHMP.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No  new  pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and  toxicity  studies  were  submitted.  Impurities  present  in  the 
tofacitinib  oral  solution  have been adequately qualified in  nonclinical  evaluations as declared by  the  MAH 
and endorsed by the  CHMP.

Tofacitinib is not a PBT substance. 
- Considering the  above data, tofacitinib is not expected to  pose a risk to the  environment.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The tofacitinib paediatric development programme was designed to demonstrate efficacy and long-term 
safety in subjects with  JIA from 2 to <18  years of age. It consists of one completed Phase 1 
pharmacokinetics (PK) Study A3921103,  1 completed Phase 3 pivotal Study A3921104,  and 1  ongoing 
long term extension (LTE)  Study A3921145 for subjects with JIA who previously participated in Studies 
A3921103  and A3921104. There is an additional ongoing Study A3921165  for subjects with  systemic JIA 
with  active systemic features which, upon completing study,  are eligible to  participate in the LTE Study 
A3921145. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the  effect that  clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with  the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study A3921103  was an open-label multiple dose study in  subjects from 2 to <18 years of age with 
Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis.  Three cohorts were included, 12 to  >18 years (n=8),  6 to <12 years (n=9) 
and 2 to < 6 years (n=9). 
Study A3921104  was an open-label run-in phase study followed by randomised withdrawal double blind 
placebo-controlled phase which  evaluate efficacy in subjects with pJIA aged 2 to  <18 years. 225 subjects 
entered in  the open-label phase and 173  in the randomized phase (88 tofacitinib  and 85 placebo). The 
study duration was 44 weeks.

A phase 1 bioequivalence study (A3921354)  was also submitted  to demonstrate bioequivalence between 
a single dose of tofacitinib 5 ml oral solution and 5 mg tablet. This was a randomized, open label, 2 
period, cross over, single dose study conducted in fasted condition in healthy participants (11). 
An HPLC-MS/MS  method (Pfizer Validation A3929023) was developed and validated at WuXi AppTec 
(Shanghai, China) with  a quantitative  range of 0.100  to 350 ng/mLwith  quadratic regression.  The 
method was transferred to PPD (Richmond Virginia and Middleton,  Wisconsin) and validated (Pfizer 
Validation A3929032) with a truncated quantitative  range from 0.100 to  100 ng/mL with  linear 
regression.  The truncated  assay range from 0.100  to 100  ng/mL was also partially validated at  WuXi 
AppTec (Pfizer Validation A3929034). Both WuXi and PPD used solid phase extraction followed by HPLC-
MS/MS detection  with only minor differences in procedures to accommodate individual lab operational 
needs. Cross validation (Pfizer Validations A3929023 addendum 6 and A3929034) between WuXi and 
PPD was conducted and assay equivalency was established. 
For method A3929023, already submitted and validated, the  Applicant submitted the addendum 5 
(frozen storage matrix stability),  the addendum 6 (cross validation among laboratories) and amendment 
1 (to update the  freezer temperature range). 
The full report of A3929032 with  addendum 1 (method transfer from PPD Richmond to PPD Middleton) 
and addendum 2  (Interference Assessment, Frozen Storage Matrix Stability  and Primary Stock Solution 
Stability) and 3 (Primary Stock Solution Stability, IS Stock and Working Solution Stability  and Frozen 
Storage Matrix Stability)  were submitted  as well as the partial validation report A3929034 and 
addendum 1 (editorial revision). 
Bioavailability and bioequivalence 
Tofacitinib is  well-absorbed, with  an  oral bioavailability of 74%.  On the  basis of data already submitted  in 
the  initial  MA,  following  the  oral  administration,  systemic  exposure  of  tofacitinib  increases  in  an 
approximately dose proportional manner in healthy subjects. 
Two (2) tofacitinib formulations were used for the treatment of subjects with JIA, age 2 years to <18 years: 
the  oral  5  mg  immediate  release (IR)  tablet  and  the  oral  solution  formulation  (1  mg/mL)  developed to 
support  weight-based  dosing  in  the  JIA  clinical  studies.  Minor  changes  in  composition  of  the  proposed 
commercial oral solution formulation  relative to  the clinical oral solution formulation  were implemented: a 
reduction  in  the  sodium  benzoate  (preservative) level  from 1.5%  to  0.9%  and  the  use  of  natural  grape 
flavour instead of an artificial grape flavour. These changes are not expected to impact the physicochemical 
property  of  tofacitinib,  therefore  an  in  vivo  study  to  bridge  the  clinical  oral  solution  to  the  proposed 
commercial oral solution  is not  needed. 
Study A3921354  was performed to bridge the PK of Tofacitinib IR Tablet and Oral Solution. This is a 
phase 1,  randomized, open label, 2 period, cross over, single dose study to demonstrate the equivalence 
between 5 ml tofacitinib  oral solution formulation and 5 mg tablet formulation under fasted condition in 
healthy participants. All participants (11)  received tofacitinib 5 mL oral solution  (1 mg/mL) and 5 mg 
tablet separated by the washout period of 48 hours. The pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected 
prior to  dosing (0 hours) and post-dose at 0.25,  0.5, 1, 2,  3, 4, 8, 12,  16 and 24 hours in Periods 1 and 
2. Statistical  summary of plasma tofacitinib PK parameters is provided in Table 3.

Pharmacokinetics in target population – Study A3921103 
This was an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center,  oral tofacitinib,  multiple-dose (BID for 5 days) 
study in pediatric subjects with JIA aged from 2 to <18  years.  
The study consisted of 3 cohorts based on the age of the subjects: 
•  Cohort 1: 12 to  <18 years; 
•  Cohort 2: 6 to <12  years; 
•  Cohort 3: 2 to <6  years.  
Oral formulations of tofacitinib,  solution and tablet, were utilized for this study.  
In children in the age range of 6  to <18 years, the oral solution was used for those weighing <40  kg. Oral 
tablets were used for children weighing ≥40 kg in this  age range. Children aged 12 to <18 years who 
were unable to swallow tablets  had the  option of taking an oral solution. Children aged 6  to <12 years 
with  a BWT of ≥40 kg had the option of taking oral solution or tablets.  In the age range 2 to <6 years, 
children with  a BWT <30 kg had the option of taking oral solution or tablets,  and children weighing  <30 
kg were dosed with  the oral solution. 
The following doses were initially  administered: 
An unplanned interim analysis was conducted in this phase 1 study for subjects enrolled in  Cohorts 1 and 
2. The interim analysis indicated higher CL/F  values (28.09  L/h and 25.48 L/h  for Cohorts 1 and 2, 
respectively) in JIA subjects compared to adult RA subjects (18.4 L/h  at 5 mg BID dose), resulting  in 
steady state  AUCtau values in JIA subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 that  are 37.9% and 52.9%  lower 
compared to adult RA subjects. The Cmax values in Cohorts 1 and 2  in this study are also 19% and 28% 
lower compared to adult RA subjects (Cmax: 58 ng/mL). The allometric relationships were re-estimated 
during this  preliminary PK characterization using  observed concentration-time data from the first fourteen 
subjects (6 to <18  year age group) completing the study. The mean estimate of the power scalar for the 
CL-BWT relationship (Eq. 1) was 0.51,  lower than  that assumed for the initial  dose selection (assuming 
0.75  as allometric scaling factor).  
Doses for the  2 to <6-year age group were increased from that  initially planned based on this  analysis, to 
achieve exposures comparable to that  from a 5-mg-BID dose in adult RA subjects. The table below shows 
the new administered doses:

Population PK model 
The popPK Report PMAR-EQDD-A392l-Other-941 was performed in order to:  1) describe the PK of 
tofacitinib  in paediatric patients  from 2 to less than 18  years of age with  JIA; 2) identify potential 
covariates in the study population(s) which  account for the variability in tofacitinib  exposure; 3) assess 
the formulation effect and relative bioavailability of tofacitinib oral solution versus  tablet formulation 
administered during  clinical development; 4) evaluate PK similarity between the two  formulations in 
terms of AUC and Cmax using a model-based simulation approach and the stringent  80-125% 
bioequivalence; 5) provide individual-level exposure output  (concentration profile over time, AUC, Cmax, 
Cave, etc.) for subsequent analyses. The popPK includes data pooled from studies A3921103,  A3921104 
and A3921145.  A one compartment model parameterized in terms of CL/F  and V/F with  first-order ka and

absorption lag time  was chosen. The final estimates for CL/F,  V/F and Ka were 26.1 L/hr, 89.2  L, and 
2.78  hr-1, respectively. Absorption was described with  a lag time estimated at 0.186  hr. The solution has 
a 1.64 fold faster absorption rate compared to the reference formulation of the tablet. 
The available data indicated that  there were no clinically relevant differences in tofacitinib  exposure 
(AUC), based on age, race, gender, patient  type or baseline disease severity. The between-subject 
variability (%  coefficient of variation) in  (AUC) was estimated to be approximately 24%. 
To assess the overall impact of formulation effect, ratios (with  90% CI) for AUC and Cmax relative to a 
reference patient (body weight  46.3 kg and taking tablet) were calculated using the  estimated 
formulation effect from each bootstrap dataset. Formulation  was found to  be statistically  significant on 
Ka, which suggests that oral solution is expected to result in 113.9%  (95%  CI: 108.0%,  120.7%)  higher 
Cmax than  tablet for the  typical patient. 
Formulation is not  expected to affect AUC. Hence, the point  estimates of the  AUC and Cmax ratios and 
the associated 90%  CI indicated no relevant differences in tofacitinib  exposure over the formulations 
across all weights in the  study. 
The dosing  regimen selected for Phase 3  Study A3921104  was based on  the  popPK model including  data 
from  Study  A3921103.  From  the  predicted  AUC  and  Cmax  values it  was  evident  that  over the  range of 
weights  examined, higher  doses were needed to  reach an  efficacy target  Cavg,ss of  21  ng/ml,  the  5  mg 
BID equivalent  in adult  RA patients.   However, concentrations were within  the  range of 3 mg  BID dose in 
adult RA patients. The final dosing scheme proposed for Study A3921104  is described in Table 6.

No pharmacodynamic evaluations was performed in the context of this application. 
An  Exposure-Response  Relationships  for  efficacy  was  evaluated  in  the  context  of  POPULATION 
MODELING ANALYSIS REPORT PMAR-EQDD-A392I-Other-942. The objectives of this  population exposure-
response (E-R)  analysis were:  1)  To  develop  a  longitudinal  model characterizing  the  exposure-response 
relationship  between  CP-690,550  and  change  in  JIA  American College of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  scores in 
pediatric  patients  from  2  to  less  than  18  years of age  with  juvenile idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  in  the  open

label phase; 2) To identify potential  covariates in the  study population(s)  which account for the  variability 
in JIA ACR responder rates; 3)  To characterize the onset of tofacitinib  efﬁcacy. 
This analysis included data from the pivotal study A3921104.  Exponential  model was used to  describe the 
time  course and  onset  of  drug  effect.  Treatment  factor  and  Cave  were tested  for  drug  effect.  However, 
linear  or  non-linear  models  with  exposure metrics  (Cave)  did  not  provide  better  ﬁtting  than  the  simple 
treatment effect model. Therefore, treatment effect model was used to characterize the drug effect and for 
further model development. Based on the  covariate analysis, number of prior failed DMARDs (NFAIL) was 
identiﬁed  as  the  only  signiﬁcant  covariate  with  NFAIL  =  0  and  1  grouped  together  to  be  the  reference 
population. Patients  who had experienced 2 or more prior DMARDs treatment  failures showed signiﬁcantly 
lower  rates of  JIA ACR  response. The half-life  for  drug  effect onset  was  estimated  to  be  4.2  weeks. The 
rates of response for ACR scores based on ﬁnal model parameter estimates can be contextualized through 
simulation using the  ﬁnal model. The onset of tofacitinib  treatment effect was rapid. The simulations using 
the  final  model  showed  that  at  Week  2,  the  probabilities  of  JIA  ACR30,  50  and  70  responses  were 
approximately 47%,  26%  and  8%,  respectively, which  were  60%,  36%  and  16%  of  Week 18  efficacy, 
respectively. 
Based  on  population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A392l-Other-941)  a  post  hoc  estimated  individual  PK 
parameters  suggest  that  consistent  Cavg  (median  14.8  ng/mL,  range  8.9-30.0  ng/mL)  were  achieved 
among all JIA subjects and the Cavg in the different weight ranges (10 <15  kg, 15 <25  kg, 25 <40  kg and 
≥40  kg)  are similar.  Therefore it  is  not  feasible to  determine an  exposure/ response relationship and  an 
exponential model  was used  to  describe the  time  course and  onset of  drug  effect in  terms  of ACR30,  50 
and 70. Based on the model parameter estimates the half-life for drug effect onset was estimated to be 4.2 
weeks.  Based  on  model  simulation  the  probability  to  reach  ACR30,  50  and  70  seems  to  increase with 
treatment  duration. The number of  prior failed DMARDs (NFAIL)  was a significant  covariate impacting  the 
efficacy outcome. The model simulation showed that  the increase of NFAIL results in decreased probability 
of achieving ACR30, 50 and 70 and this effect is reasonably due to the  disease severity. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Tofacitinib plasma concentrations were measured through HPLC-MS/MS  method developed and validated 
at Wuxi AppTec (Shangai, China – A3929023)  and then transferred at PPD (Richmond and Middleton).   
Tofacitinib determinations were performed on samples collected in Study A3921103 (151  samples 
analysed by Wuxi), in Phase 3 pivotal Study A3921104  (815 samples analysed by Wuxi and 320 analysed 
by PPD Middleton),  in Study A3921145 LTE  (124 samples analysed by Wuxi and 363 analysed by PPD 
Middleton)  and the BE Study A3921354 (254  samples analysed by PPD Middleton).  As confirmed by the 
MAH,  the samples of studies A3921104  and A3921145  LTE were analysed by both  laboratories. 
Two cross-validations were submitted:   
•  Addendum 6 of method validation A3929023  which was a cross validation between Wuxi, BASi (not 
involved in tofactinib  determination for the  studies of interest) and PPD Richmond.  
• 
The method validation A3929034  aimed to  perform a partial validation with  truncated  quantitative 
range (0.100  to 100  ng/ml)  and cross validation between Wuxi and  PPD including  cross validation 
QC  samples  and  incurred  samples  (from  study  A3921104).  The  MAH  confirmed  that  the  PPD 
laboratory involved in the analysis of QCs was that in Richmond. 
A  method  transfer  was  performed  from  PPD  in  Richmond,  VA  to  PPD  in  Middleton,  WI  and  an  assay 
performance with respect to precision, accuracy, and specificity was conducted.  
No  cross-validation was performed between PPD Middleton  and  Wuxi.  However, the  MAH  considered that 
since the methods used at Richmond are the same as those used at Middleton, the cross validation between 
Wuxi and PPD Richmond supports the comparability of data analysis also between Wuxi and PPD Middleton.

This  is not  fully  in  line with  EMA  guideline on  Bioanalytical reports that  states: “Where  data are obtained 
from different methods within  and across studies  or when data  are obtained within  a study from different 
laboratories, applying the  same method, comparison of those data is needed and  a cross validation of the 
applied analytical  methods  should be  carried out”.  However,  since the  method  transfer to  PPD  Middleton 
showed that selectivity, carryover, linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, dilution, and stability 
were met, the method is considered valid for the extraction and analysis of human lithium heparin plasma. 
The issue was therefore not further pursued by the  CHMP. 
Within  this application, the  oral solution formulation was added to treat paediatric patients  in a weight-
based dosing. A BE study A3921354 was performed to compare the PK of tofacitinib  IR tablet and oral 
solution.  
Population PK model 
The model is well structured  and validated. As expected, the formulation showed an effect on Ka due to a 
faster absorption of the  oral solution.  Higher doses and tablet  formulation are associated to higher CL and 
V/f and this  is expected considering that  in  both cases they refer to  children in the  higher age and  weight 
group.  The  MAH  provided  the  requested  information  about  the  value  of  η-shrinkage  through  model 
development. The value of η-shrinkage is below 20% for both the base model and the final model. 
The  MAH  was  requested to  show  that  the  model  (PopPK Report PMAR-EQDD-A392l-Other-941)  can  truly 
capture the  concentration-time  profile for  all children included  in the  phase 3  trials and to  submit  pcVPCs 
of concentration over time stratified on weight.  The requested pcVPCs of concentration over time stratified 
over the  4 weight  groups was submitted.  pcVPCs demonstrated  that  the  population  PK model sufficiently 
characterized  tofacitinib  exposure  over  time  across  the  4  studied  weight  range  as  the  majority  of 
observations fall within  the predicted range of exposure. 
In  the  SmpC section  5.2  it  is  reported that  the  between-subject variability (%  coefficient of variation)  in 
(AUC)  was estimated to  be approximately 24%.  The MAH  clarified that  the  information reported in  SmPC 
regarding  the  %  coefficient  of  variation  around  AUC  value  is  related  to  the  between-subject  variability 
(%CV) in CL/F. 
Bioequivalence 
The design (cross over study) of bioequivalence study A3921354  and the wash out period are adequate, 
considering the  half-life of tofacitinib.  Although the BE Guideline states that  the study should be 
conducted at the highest  strength, tofacitinib  is a BCS class III, therefore the use of a lower strength of 5 
mg is acceptable also in  light of a linearity in  the considered range (5 mg and 10 mg). 
Following  administration of single oral doses of tofacitinib,  median time to  reach maximum plasma 
concentration (Tmax) was comparable between oral solution and tablet  (0.5 and 1.0 hour, respectively). 
Mean elimination half-life (t½)  values were nearly identical  (approximately 3 hours) for both formulations.  
Although  the  90%  CIs for  the  ratios (Test/Reference) of  adjusted geometric means  for AUCinf  (GM  ratio 
104.38,  CI 99.99-108.97),  AUClast (GM  ratio 104.48,  CI 100.16-108.99)  and Cmax (GM  ratio 110.00,  CI 
99.90-121.13)  were entirely contained within  the  acceptance region for bioequivalence (80%, 125%),  it is 
noted  that  in  study  A3921354  there  were  12  subjects  randomised,  but  only  11  completed  both  study 
periods. This  is  not  in  compliance with  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence, which 
states  that  the  number  of  evaluable subjects  in  a  bioequivalence study  should  not  be  less  than  12.  In 
addition,  the  subject  with  data  from  only  one  treatment  period  was  not  excluded  from  the  statistical 
analysis, and random, rather than  fixed effects were used for the subject term in the statistical  model. The 
MAH was requested to discuss about this  deviation from guideline to clarify the reason for not replacing the 
subject who did not complete both study periods. The MAH clarified that the subject was not replaced as it 
was  confirmed  that  11  subjects  provided adequate  power  for  demonstrating  AUC  equivalence  (primary 
study  objective),  and the  study  protocol  did  not  mandate  replacement of  study  subjects.  Given  that  the 
Assessment report

concerned  subject  completed  protocol  requirements  for  at  least  one  study  treatment,  this  subject  was 
deemed an  evaluable subject for  inclusion  in  the  PK  and safety  analyses. All  12  evaluable subjects  were 
included in the ANOVA mixed effect model with  sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and subject 
within  sequence as a random effect which is the standard analysis approach for crossover studies, and was 
pre specified in the analysis plan for this study. Therefore, the CHMP agreed with the MAH’s conclusion that 
the  exclusion of  data  from  one  subjects  in  Study  A3921354  did  not  cause a  significant  deviation  in  the 
comparison of tofacitinib exposure profile between the tablets  and Oral Solution. 
Target population and dose selection 
Phase I PK study A3921103  was initially conducted in 26  JIA subjects to inform the dosing regimen in 
patients with  JIA aged 2 through  less than 18  years for the subsequent pivotal efficacy study (A3921104) 
as well as the long-term extension (LTE) study (A3921145).   The JIA clinical program evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg BID for ≥40 kg subjects or weight-based lower doses for <40kg 
subjects to achieve comparable Cavg as those dosed at 5 mg BID. Study A3921103 consisted of 3 cohorts 
based on the age of the subjects:1) Cohort 1: 12 to <18  years; 2) Cohort 2: 6 to <12  years; 3) Cohort 3: 
2 to <6  years. 
The doses in paediatric patients were initially  calculated using the  allometric scaling (0.75)  on CL/F in 
order to obtain  exposure similar to that  in adults RA patients  administered with  tofacitinib  5mg BID  
dosing (assuming 70kg BWT for an adults). The considered PK parameter was the Cavg,ss after 5 mg BID 
dosing in adult RA (21 ng/ml).  An interim  analysis of this  study indicated higher CL/F values (28.09 L/h 
and 25.48 L/h  for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively) in JIA subjects compared to adult  RA subjects (18.4 L/h 
at 5 mg BID dose), resulting in steady state  AUCtau values in JIA subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 that 
are 37.9%  and 52.9% lower compared to adult RA subjects. The Cmax values in Cohorts 1 and 2 in  this 
study are also 19% and 28% lower compared to adult RA subjects (Cmax: 58 ng/mL). The allometric 
relationships were re-estimated and the  mean estimate of the power scalar for the CL-BWT relationship 
was 0.51, lower than that  assumed for the initial  dose selection. 
Doses for the  2 to <6-year age group were increased from that  initially planned based on this  analysis to 
achieve exposures comparable to that  from a 5-mg-BID dose in adult RA subjects (Table 4). 
The dosing regimen selected for Phase 3 Study A3921104  was based on the popPK model including data 
from Study A3921103.  The aim was to  select doses to  reach the exposure observed in adults 
administered with  5 mg BID dose. Simulations were performed using the parameters from the  final popPK 
model to predict AUC and Cmax at the  doses used in the A3921103  study.  From the predicted AUC and 
Cmax values it  was evident that  over the range of weights  examined, higher doses were needed to reach 
an efficacy target Cavg,ss of 21  ng/ml, the 5 mg BID equivalent in adult  RA patients.  However, 
concentrations were within  the range of 3  mg BID dose in adult RA patients.  
Simulations were performed in order to  predict the  Cavg,ss and Cmax,ss reached with  the dosing regimen 
of Study A3921104. The predicted steady state Cavg and Cmax (median and 90% PI) values overlaid 
with  median and 90%  CI of corresponding exposure metrics in RA subjects following  3, 5 and 10mg BID 
doses as relevant. As illustrated in the submitted  simulation, in the  entire considered weight  range, the 
predicted Cavg,ss is below the  median (21 ng/ml),  as well as the 5th  percentile, of the Cavg,ss observed 
with  5 mg BID dose in adult  RA patient.  The MAH stated that  the predicted Cavg is similar to  that of 3-5 
mg BID in adult RA subjects across the expected weight range. However, the median value of Cavg,ss 
that  results in efficacy outcomes is 21 ng/ml (5  mg BID dose) while the 3  mg BID dose did not show 
efficacy in previously submitted study in the  already approved indications.  
In the plot (Figure  1) of Cavg,ss versus continuous weight, the  subjects weighing  40 kg, that are given 
the same dose as adults,  have an exposure that is lower compared to adults. The MAH was requested to 
discuss about this unexpected finding.  The MAH explained that  the results of population PK analysis 
indicated that  the clearance of tofacitinib  in a JIA subject with  a typical body weight of 46 kg (26.1  L/h) 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 30/118 
  
  
was approximately 42% higher than in RA subjects (18.4  L/h) and consequently the exposure reached in 
subjects with JIA (although  weighing over that 40  kg) is lower than exposure reached in subjects with RA 
taking the same dose of 5 mg. Moreover, data from Schmitt C et  al, 2011 showed that the  higher 
clearance in subjects with  JIA compared to subjects with  RA may be related to the  higher inflammatory 
burden in the adult RA population compared to the JIA population, resulting in  greater downregulation of 
CYP enzymes in RA patients due to the  inflammatory stimuli.  Moreover, the MAH stated that  the predicted 
Cmax,ss did not exceed those reached with  10 mg BID in most subjects, a dose linked with  a worse 
safety profile. However, as illustrated in the  mentioned simulations,  subject with  a weight range of 5-20 
kg showed predicted Cmax,ss above the 95th  percentile of 5 mg BID dose and some reached the median 
Cmax,ss at 10 mg BID dose.  
The MAH stated that the predicted Cmax,ss did not exceed those reached with 10 mg BID in most subjects, 
a dose linked with  a worse safety profile. However, as illustrated in the mentioned simulations, subject with 
a weight range of 5-20 kg showed predicted Cmax,ss above the 95th percentile of 5 mg BID dose and some 
reached the median Cmax,ss at 10 mg BID dose.  
The paediatric data available so far do not give rise to new safety concerns. However, as the observed data 
is  rather  limited,  especially  regarding  the  longer  time  perspective,  the  assessment  relies  also  on 
extrapolation from the approved adult indications. In this regard, it is critical to demonstrate that the chosen 
paediatric posology is not likely to result in a higher exposure than what has been seen in the adults. This 
is underlined by the fact that it is known that important risks associated with tofacitinib are dose dependant. 
With  regard to  long  term  safety, the  MAH  was asked to  perform a comparison of  Cmin,  Cmax and  Cavg 
between observed exposure in adults with  RA and the  simulated exposure children (both  studied posology 
and the  new proposed posology). The MAH  performed this  comparison in terms of exposure (Cmax, Cave 
and Cmin) between  the posology used in  study A3921104  and the  proposed posology in SmPC are shown 
to be overlapping and contained within  RA exposure in adults.  
A more comprehensive popPK was developed including data from studies A3921103,  A3921104 and 
A3921145.  Further simulations were performed in order to predict the exposure measures at steady-state 
using dosing regimen of study A3921104.  The predicted median Cavg of 14.8 ng/mL  (range 8.9-30.0 
ng/mL)  was achieved among all JIA subjects. The dose recommendation proposed in the extension of 
indication was simplified to 3-dose steps instead of the 4-dose step in Study A3921104  with  the objective 
of having consistency between tofacitinib Cavg for <40 kg JIA subjects, and ≥ 40kg JIA subjects taking 5 
mg BID dose. The MAH  was requested to discuss the choice for dose selection. The MAH submitted  the 
Exposure Ratios of 3-dose-step versus 4-dose-step that  are close to 1 for all body weight  groups and for 
each PK parameters concerning exposure (Cmin, Cave, Cmax). The choice to  select a more simplified 
dosing-scheme with  3 dose steps for section 4.2 of the SmPC is therefore supported by the  CHMP. 
The MAH  was requested to clarify why the initial  target  exposure in paediatrics referred to those obtained 
with  administration of 5 mg BID in adults while, thereafter, a reference to the exposure reached with 3 mg 
BID dose in adults  has been considered. The MAH  clarified that the  dosing regimen was first established to 
reach a similar exposure to adults with RA and assuming a similar oral clearance (allometrically scaled using 
the  standard value  of  0.75).  The  POPPK analysis  indicated  that  the  oral clearance of  tofacitinib  in  a  JIA 
subject with  a typical body weight of 46  kg (26.1  L/h) was approximately 42%  higher than in  RA subjects 
(18.4  L/h). Therefore, the MAH concluded that  the Cavg after 5 mg BID dose in a JIA subject ≥40 kg body 
weight is comparable to the Cavg after 3 to 5 mg BID dose in adult RA subjects while doses for JIA subjects 
<40 Kg were adjusted by body weight,  to achieve Cavg similar to that  at 5 mg BID in JIA subjects ≥40 kg. 
On this justification, the MAH based the rationale to set the exposure reached with 3 mg BID dose in adults 
as a  reference for patients  with  JIA even though  the  MAH  did  not  explain the  choice  to  set the  exposure 
reached with  3  mg  BID  in  RA  patients  to  drive  the  dose  recommendation  in  the  proposed  indication  in 
paediatrics, considering that the  effective dose in RA patients is 5 mg dose BID. In addition, population  PK 
Assessment report

Page 31/118 
  
  
analysis  in  JIA  subjects  across  clinical  studies  (EQDD-A392l-  Other-941)  confirmed  that  40  kg  is  an 
appropriate cut-off  for the  5  mg  BID dose in  this  population  and  the selected dosing regimen resulted  in 
consistent exposure between recommended weight- based dose groups for JIA subjects. The dosing in  JIA 
subjects is therefore sufficiently appropriately justified.   
Drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
DDI studies have only been performed in adults and Conventional drug-interaction studies are not expected 
to  be  performed in  children.  The MAH  was requested  to  discuss extrapolation of  the adult  DDI results  to 
the  paediatric target  age  group or  possible differences in  CYP  contribution.  The MAH  considered that  the 
dose adjustment  recommendation due to  DDI from adult  RA patients  can  be extrapolated to  JIA patients 
down  to  2  years  of  age.  Indeed,  the  MAH  clarified  that  the  maturation  of  both  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C19 
enzymes leads to  enzymatic activities reaching the  adult  values before 2 years of age (Salem et al,  2015 
and  Upreti  et  al,  2016).  The  MAH  concluded that  the  contribution  of  CYP3A4 and  CYP2C19  to  tofacitinib  
metabolism in children down to 2 years of age is expected to  be comparable to those in adults. The MAH’s 
argumentation is endorsed by the CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients  with JIA has been sufficiently characterised.  
The following posology in JIA patients 2 years of age and older is endorsed by the CHMP: 
Body weight (kg) 
10 - < 20 
20 - < 40 
≥ 40 
Dose regimen 
3.2 mg (3.2 mL of oral solution) twice daily 
4 mg (4 mL of oral solution) twice daily 
5 mg (5 mL of oral solution or 5 mg film-coated tablet) twice daily 
Patients ≥ 40  kg treated with  tofacitinib 5 mL  oral solution twice  daily may be switched to  tofacitinib 5 mg 
film-coated tablets twice daily. Patients < 40 kg cannot be switched from tofacitinib  oral solution.

Methods 
All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). 
At  the  end  of  the  18-week  run-in  phase,  only  subjects  who  achieved at  least  a  JIA  American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response were randomized to the 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. 
Subjects who did  not achieve a JIA ACR 30  response at this  time  point were discontinued  from the  study. 
Subjects who  experienced a single  episode of disease flare (according  to  Pediatric Rheumatology Clinical 
Study  Group/Pediatric  Rheumatology  International  Trials  Organization  [PRCSG/PRINTO]  Disease  Flare 
criteria) at  any time  during  the  study  (including  the  open-label run-in  and double-blind  phase)  were also 
discontinued from the study. 
Subjects who were eligible for the 26-week double-blind phase were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active 
tofacitinib  or placebo.  
For subjects with  polyarticular JIA (PJIA) (ie, E Oligo, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF-,  and sJIA with 
active arthritis  but without  active systemic features), randomization was stratified by JIA category and 
baseline CRP (normal, above normal). Randomization for subjects with  PsA and ERA was stratified by JIA 
category.

Treatments 
Tofacitinib was provided as oral tablets (tofacitinib  citrate 5 mg) and as an oral solution (CP-690,550-10 
[tofacitinib  citrate] 1 mg/mL) by the Sponsor. Open-label bottles of tofacitinib tablets  and tofacitinib 
citrate oral solution  were provided for the run-in phase of the  study. Blinded-label bottles of tofacitinib 
tablets, tofacitinib  citrate oral solution,  and matching placebo, for oral administration,  were provided for

Sample size 
Approximately 170 subjects (in the polyarticular cohort) were to be enrolled in the open-label active 
treatment run-in  phase to provide a power of approximately 90% or above to detect a difference in the 
rate of disease flares between tofacitinib  versus placebo in the double-blind  phase, assuming a 54%  to 
65% response rate of ACR Pedi 30  from the run-in  active treatment phase, a 2-sided 5% Type I error, 
and a true difference of at least 31% in  flare rates between tofacitinib  and placebo, with  a placebo flare 
rate of 57%.  Sample sizes for the PJIA categories were determined from a combination of prevalence 
data and precedents in the literature. 
Randomisation 
All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib  for 18  weeks (run-in 
phase). At the end of the  18-week run-in  phase, subjects who achieved at least a JIA ACR 30 response 
were randomized to  the 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Subjects who entered the  26-
week double-blind phase were randomized (1:1  ratio) to either active tofacitinib  tablets/oral solution or 
matching placebo. For subjects with  PJIA, randomization was stratified by JIA category and baseline CRP. 
For subjects with  PsA and ERA, randomization was stratified by JIA category. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the double-blind phase of the study,  the Sponsor, subject, and investigator site staff were blinded 
to the subject’s treatment assignment. At the  initiation  of the  study, the study site was instructed on the 
electronic process for breaking the blind using  the interactive response technology (IRT) system. Blinding 
was only to  be broken in  emergency situations for reasons of subject safety. 
Statistical methods 
The primary hypothesis is that  among subjects who achieve ACR30 response at Week 18 in the OL  phase, 
those  who  remain  on  tofacitinib  will  have  a  lower rate  of  disease flare  up  to  Week  44/EoS  compared to 
those on placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 41/118 
  
  
 
 
 
Statistical decision rules 
Tofacitinib will be considered superior to placebo with respect to occurrence of disease flare by Week 44/End 
of Study (EoS) (Week 26 of the  double-blind phase) for polyarticular JIA subjects if the  test for difference 
in the occurrence rate results in  a p-value (two-sided) less than 0.05. 
In  order to  preserve type-I  error, the  primary endpoint  and  the  key secondary endpoints  were  assessed 
sequentially using gate keeping or step-down approach in the order showing below.  When an endpoint fails 
to  declare statistical  significance, this  endpoint  and the remaining endpoints  lower in the  hierarchy will be 
considered non-significant.  A 2-sided p-value ≤0.05  was considered statistically significant. 
Analyses other than primary and key secondary analyses were not controlled for type-I error, and such 
reported p-values are all nominal along with  95% confidence intervals.  
The sequence of primary and key secondary endpoints was:  
1) Disease flare by Week 44/End of Study (EOS);  
2) JIA ACR 50 at Week 44/EOS;  
3) JIA ACR 30 at Week 44/EOS; and  
4) JIA ACR 70 at Week 44/EOS;  
5) Change from baseline in  CHAQ Disability Index at Week 44/EOS.   
Analyses other than primary and key secondary analyses were not controlled for type-I error.  
It  has been suggested  that achievement of a  30%  improvement in  disease activity  (ie, JIA  ACR 30)  may 
not  represent  a  clinically  meaningful  degree  of  improvement  therefore  JIA  ACR  50  was  chosen  to  be 
evaluated in the sequence before JIA ACR 30 and 70 as it represents a more significant reduction in disease 
activity. 
Two tipping  point analyses based on two imputation  models (Weibull regression and binomial distribution) 
were planned to  be performed to  assess impact of  dropouts -  patients who  discontinued  from study after 
randomization  prior  to  the  efficacy cutoff  date  (Week 26  of  the  double-blind  phase)  who  do  not  have a 
primary event (flare) before dropout - on results of primary analysis.   
Analysis sets  
pJIA:  The primary outcome population  consists of subjects with  the following pJIA subtypes  
polyarthritis  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)+,  polyarthritis  RF-,  extended  oligoarthritis  (E  Oligo),  and 
systemic JIA (sJIA) without  active systemic features;  
JIA:   The pooled analysis population when  all the subtypes in Study A3921104  are included in an analysis 
(including  pJIA, ERA and PsA) or when the additional subjects from Study A3921145  are included.

Open-Label phase baseline is based  on Day 1, and Double-Blind phase baseline is based on Week 18. 
1 Active arthritis is defined as any joint with swelling, or in the absence  of swelling, limitation of motion accompanied 
by either pain on motion or tenderness  not due 
to deformity. 
2 Physician's Global: Higher Physicians' global evaluation of overall disease activity means more JIA disease activity. 
3 CRP normal is 0 - 0.287  mg/dL.  
4 ESR normal is 0 - 20 mm/h. 
5 Higher CHAQ scores mean more disability. 
6 CHQ-PF50 measures  14 domains, each ranging  from 0 to 100,  with a higher score  indicating better physical function 
or mental health. 
7 Higher JADAS-27 CRP scores mean more JIA disease activity. The possible range of scores  is 0 - 57. 
Prior DMARD,  corticosteroid, and immunosuppressant use.  
Overall, 216 (96.0%)  of the subjects had prior DMARD, corticosteroid, or immunosuppressant use. 
bDMARDs and csDMARDs were used by 85  (37.8%)  and 206  (91.6%)  of subjects, respectively, prior to 
the open-label run-in phase. The most frequently used bDMARD was etanercept (52 [23.1%]  subjects). 
MTX was the most frequently used csDMARD (204  [90.7%]  subjects), with folate being used by 164 
(72.9%)  of subjects. Corticosteroids were used by 111  (49.3%) subjects, with  the most common being 
prednisone (61  [27.1%]  
Concomitant medications: In the OL phase 171 (76.0%) of subjects used DMARD, corticosteroid, and/or 
immunosuppressant  medications.  csDMARDs  were  used  by  149  (66.2%)  subjects.  MTX  and  folate  were 
taken  by  148  (65.8%)  subjects  and  145  (64.4%),  respectively.  Concomitant  use  of  bDMARDs  was 
prohibited during the study. Corticosteroids were used concomitantly by 75  (33.3 %) subjects.  
DB  phase:    A  total  of  69  (78.4%)  and  63  (74.1%)  subjects  in  the  tofacitinib  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively, that used DMARD, corticosteroid, and/or immunosuppressant medications.  
csDMARDs (MTX) were used concomitantly by 58 (65.9%) subjects in the tofacitinib group and 58 (68.2%) 
subjects in  the  placebo group.  Any concomitant  DMARD, corticosteroid, and immunosuppressant use was 
76  and  74%  in  the  OL  and  DB  phase,  respectively. Therefore, a  percentage  of  subjects  (24-26%)  were 
treated with  Tofacitinib monotherapy.  
Corticosteroids were used  concomitantly  by  35  (39.8%)  and  23  (27.1%)  subjects  in  the  tofacitinib  5  mg 
BID and placebo groups, respectively.

Secondary endpoints results, although only descriptive analysis was conducted, were generally supportive 
of  better  activity of  tofacitinib  as  compared to  placebo for different  endpoints  related to  disease activity, 
however it  should  be  highlighted  that  for  more  stringent  endpoints  the  numerical  difference was  lower. 
Details are reported in the AR. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed on the primary endpoint  (Figure 4).

Population and by Subgroups - DBJAS 
 (1) Normal approximation. 
The DB phase is the study  period on and after randomization day. 
Europe  includes: Poland, Belgium, Great Britain, and Spain; All Other includes: Ukraine, Turkey, Russia, Australia, and 
Israel. 
LOCF was used for imputing intermittent missing components  and assessments. Subjects discontinued  study treatment 
for any reason, except while in clinical remission, were counted  as flares as of their discontinuation visit through  Week 
44. For subjects  who discontinued study  treatment and met clinical remission at the time of discontinuation, they were 
considered  as non-disease  flare from that visit onward  through  Week 44. 
95% CI was not calculated when  the flare rates were either 0% in both groups  or 100% in both groups. 
Sensitivity analyses are consistent with  results from the primary analysis.  
Sensitivity analysis for the  key secondary endpoints were also consistent with  the primary analysis.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Results from pivotal Study A3921104  and LTE Study A3921145 were pooled to assess the efficacy of 
tofacitinib  5 mg BID over the combined exposure to the study drug.  Of note subjects participating in 3 
qualifying studies (A3921103,  A3921104,  and A3921165)  in the  tofacitinib JIA program were enrolled into 
Study A3921145.   However, data from 2  of these studies have been excluded from the  integrated efficacy 
analyses due to the study design of Study A3921103  (a PK study in  which tofacitinib  was administered for 
only 1 week), and the study population in  Study A3921165, which  was conducted in  a different population 
(sJIA) and for which unblinding  of the double-blind phase data had not  been performed by the  cut-off 
date of the integrated analyses.   
The integrated data analysis was conducted in  subjects who received at least 1 dose of tofacitinib  in 
Study A3921104  and enrolled or not  in the LTE Study A3921145.   For subjects enrolled in the LTE,  the 
exposure considered here included, in addition to  the pivotal study exposure to tofacitinib,  follow up until 
the cut-off date of Study A3921145.   For subjects not  rolling over into the extension study, exposure was

limited to  the Study A3921104.  Subjects coming from A3921103,  A3921104  studies and enrolled into 
Study A3921145  were excluded. 
The focus of all the integrated analyses is on subjects randomized in  A3921104.  Therefore, the double-
blind and LTE portions of the data were utilized in the pooled analyses. In addition,  subjects randomized 
to placebo in  the qualifying Study A3921104 were included in an analysis aimed at exploring achievement 
of minimal disease activity upon re-initiation of tofacitinib  treatment in the LTE Study A3921145.

Disease  flares:  138  (81.2%)  subjects  remained  flare  free  for  the  entire  duration  of  follow-up.  The 
incidence rate (95% CI) of flares over this follow-up was 20.77 (14.21,  29.32) subjects with flares per 100 
subject-years with  24  (14.12%)  subjects  experiencing a  single  flare, 7  (4.12%)  subjects  experiencing 2 
flares, and 1 (0.59%)  experiencing 3 flares according to  PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criteria.

The maximum proportion (standard error [SE]) of subjects with occurrence of disease flare between Month 
6  and Month  24  was during  the  Month  15  visit  (4.88%  [2.38])  (Figure  2). Limited  data (sample size was 
<20  subjects) are available beyond the Month 24 visit  since many subjects in this study were still ongoing 
and had not yet reached these visits at  the time of data cutoff. 
ACR  response All  Subjects with  Juvenile  Idiopathic Arthritis:  The  maximum proportion  of subjects  (SE) 
with  JIA  ACR  30/50/70/90/100  responses  between  Month  1  and  Month  24  were  during  the  Month  12 
(66.14%  [4.20]),  Month  15  (62.20  [5.35]),  Month  12  (48.82%  [4.44]),  Month  24  (40.00%  [10.95]),  and 
Month  24 
(30.00%  [10.25])  visits,  respectively. Limited  data (sample  size was <20  subjects) are available beyond 
the Month  24 visit since many subjects in this study were still  ongoing and had not yet reached these visits 
at the time of data cutoff. 
Minimal Disease  Activity and Inactive  Disease  in Subjects with pJIA Limited data (sample size was 
<20 subjects) are available beyond the Month  21 visit since many subjects in this study were still ongoing 
and had not yet reached these visits at  the time of data cutoff. 
JADAS-27 (CRP) MDA was achieved prior to the data cut-off in 65  (79.3%)  of the  82 subjects analyzed 
with  a median time (95%  CI) to  achieving MDA of 12.6  (4.1, 24.4)  weeks.   
JIA ACR inactive disease was achieved as early as 12 weeks for 10 subjects and for a total  of 22  (26.8%) 
subjects prior to the  data cut-off.   Median time to inactive disease was not able to  be calculated due to 
the small number of subjects who achieved inactive disease status. 
Supportive study 
The ongoing Phase 2/3, long-term, open-label, follow-up Study A3921145  was designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability and efficacy of tofacitinib in subjects with  JIA.   
Approximately 340 subjects were projected to enroll into this  open-label extension study after completing 
a qualifying/index study in the  JIA program. For this  interim clinical study report (CSR), 26 subjects from 
A3921103,  197 subjects from A3921104,  and 2 subjects from A3921165  were enrolled and treated 
(excluded from this analysis). 
An interim analysis has been completed to summarize the available data based on the data cut-off 
04 June 2019. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH within  this  procedure intended initially to extend the indication of “tofacitinib  oral IR tablet and 
oral solution  5 mg BID for the  treatment of active polyarticular JIA in subjects 2 years of age and older”.   
To support the claimed indication,  the MAH  submitted the following studies:  study A3921104, a 
completed Phase 3 pivotal and an interim analysis of the ongoing OL  long-term extension study 
A3921145. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study A3921104  
Study design: This study was a randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate 
the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  tofacitinib  for  the  treatment  of  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic 
arthritis  (pJIA)  in  children  from  2  years of  age  and  older.  Superiority  of  tofacitinib  versus placebo  was 
analysed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 56/118 
  
  
All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). 
At the  end of the  18-week run-in phase, only subjects who  achieved at least a JIA ACR 30  response were 
randomized to the 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Subjects who did not achieve a JIA ACR 
30  response were discontinued  from  the  study.  Subjects  who  were eligible  for the  26-week  double-blind 
phase  were  randomized  (1:1  ratio)  to  either  active  tofacitinib  5mg  BID  or  placebo.  Although  for  an 
enrichment study design generalizability issues need to be considered, it is acknowledged that in the context 
of trials involving autoimmune/rheumatology diseases this approach is commonly used and ACR30 response 
is an acceptable measure to select responders.  
Study  endpoints  are  adequate  and  explore  appropriately  the  objectives  of  the  study  reflecting  those 
recommended in  the  EMA  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of 
juvenile idiopathic  arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014  Rev. 2). Endpoints  of low  disease activity, which are 
considered  “new”  as  compared to  those  classical,  have  been  included  and  this  is  acknowledged  by  the 
CHMP.  Prevention of  structural  damage is  not  among study  endpoints.  Since the  MAH  is  not  claiming  for 
such  effect this  is  acceptable to  the  CHMP.  However, the  CHMP  recommends to  add  this  endpoint  in  the 
long-term study.  
Statistical  hypothesis, decision rules and adopted statistical  analyses/methodologies are adequate for the 
proposed study design characteristics and endpoints.  
Study  population:  Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate and are representative of the 
target  population.  Enrolled  subjects  must  have met  ILAR JIA  classification  criteria  for  1  of  the  following 
categories and, in the opinion of the investigator, have active disease for at least 6 weeks prior to screening:  
a) polyarticular JIA (pJIA RF+;  pJIA RF-;  E Oligo;  sJIA with  active arthritis, but  without  active systemic 
features in the prior 6 months and at the time of enrollment); of note polyarticular JIA is defined as arthritis 
affecting 5 or more joints during the first 6-month  period and according to ILAR classification includes RF+ 
polyarthritis and, RF-polyarthritis.  However, for inclusion criteria, subjects with other subtypes of JIA who 
later  develop  arthritis  in  multiple  joints  and  have  polyarticular disease,  i.e.  extended oligoarthritis,  and 
systemic JIA without  active  systemic features are included in  the  study.  Subjects with  sJIA and  systemic 
features within  the previous 6 months  (sJIA with  any active systemic features other than active joints and 
elevated acute phase reactants within 6 months  of enrolment) are not included. Exclusion of this subset is 
supported  by  the  CHMP  in  view  of  a  different  pathogenesis  and  disease  phenotype.  To  define  disease 
activity, these subjects must have a minimum of 5 active joints. b) PsA; ERA, these must have a minimum 
of 3 active joints at  screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry. 
The selection criteria according to ILAR categories as well as the definition of disease activity are acceptable 
to the CHMP.   
The  key  exclusion  criteria  are  persistent  oligoarthritis  and  undifferentiated  JIA;  failure  of  more  than  3 
biologic therapies (with different mechanisms of action) for JIA. Regarding safety, in view of the mechanism 
of action as well as the know safety profile of the drug, particular attention  has been paid to infections. Risk 
factors for thromboembolic events and/or thrombophilia were not  included  among exclusion criteria since 
the safety signal was not known at the time of the study design and conduction, moreover in the paediatric 
setting  are less common (mainly genetic risk factors) as compared to adults.  
Therefore, in  view  of  the  inclusion  criteria  of  the  study  and  results  obtained  the  target  population  was 
defined as follow  a) polyarticular JIA including  pJIA RF+;  pJIA RF-;  E Oligo;  sJIA with  active arthritis,  but 
without  active  systemic features in  the  prior 6  months  and  at  the  time  of  enrolment  subtypes  or PsA or 
ERA; b) subjects with  inadequate response or intolerance to at  least one DMARD, which  may include MTX 
or biologic agents i.e. naïve or not to a biologic DMARD. The wording of the claimed indication was revised  
with  substantial  changes:  i)  excluding  the  sJIA  with  active  arthritis  (without  active  systemic  features) 
subgroup  among  pJIA  group;  ii)  including  the  PsA  subgroup  (which  was  separate  from  the  pJIA)  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 57/118 
  
  
 
excluding the  ERA subtype;  iii)  adding specification  to  the patient  population i.e.  responded inadequately 
to  previous therapy with  DMARDs (therefore including  patients  who are either bDMARD naïve or bDMARD 
experienced); combination  therapy with  MTX  or  as  monotherapy in  case of  intolerance  to  MTX  or  where 
continued  treatment  with  MTX  is  inappropriate.  The  inclusion  of  the  term  “polyarticular course  juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis” in the wording of the indication was not agreed by the CHMP. It is considered misleading 
since there  may be different  interpretations of  what  JIA categories are included  in this  term. In  addition, 
the  term  ‘course’  is  not  included  in  previously approved  paediatric  indications.  The  term  ‘course’ was 
therefore deleted from the agreed indication.   
Main  baseline  characteristics: in the  OL  phase, the  mean age of  subjects was  11.9,  mean age at  first 
diagnosis  8.1  years and  duration  of  JIA  since  onset  mean  of  3.8  years. All  age  ranges  were sufficiently 
represented: 12-18  y  (61.8%),  6-≤12  y  (28.4%)  and  2-≤6  y (9.8%),  reflecting the  epidemiology of  the 
disease. Most  subjects were White (not  Hispanic or Latino  (196  [87.1%]),  but  a minority of subjects were 
from EU  countries 6 (2.7%).  This  limited representation would  affect the  external validity of study results 
to the EU population. The MAH supported the similarity of enrolled pJIA population to the EU pJIA population 
using  different data sources. Although  the  provided comparison is  limited for some characteristics i.e. the 
populations  differ for the  respective proportion  of subjects being bDMARD naïve as compared to  bDMARD 
experienced (much higher in the tofacitinib study 38% versus 3-4% of patients in the German registry none 
in the British one), the comparison was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Subjects had active JIA (mean number of joints with active arthritis 12.2 and number of joints with limitation 
of motion mean 7.5  and swollen joints  10.4. JADAS-27 CRP score mean 21.5  (0-57). 
In the DB phase, baseline characteristics were generally similar between tofacitinib 5  mg BID and placebo 
groups,  with  only  some minor  difference. All age  groups were represented in  the  DB  phase substantially 
reflecting the distribution  by age seen in the  OL phase.  
Overall, 216 (96.0%)  of the subjects had prior DMARD, corticosteroid, or immunosuppressant use. 
bDMARDs and csDMARDs were used by 85  (37.8%)  and 206  (91.6%)  of subjects, respectively, prior to 
the open-label run-in phase. The most frequently used bDMARD was etanercept (52 [23.1%]  subjects). 
MTX was the most frequently used csDMARD (204  [90.7%]  subjects). Therefore, about40% of the 
population is bDMARD NOT  naïve.  
Corticosteroids were used by 111 (49.3%)  subjects, with  the most common being prednisone (61 
[27.1%].  Prior medications are those expected for this population.  
Concomitant  medications: OL phase csDMARDs were used by 149  (66.2%)  subjects. MTX  and folate were 
taken by  148  (65.8%)  subjects and  145  (64.4%),  respectively. Very similar percentage are replicated in 
the  DB phase.  Corticosteroids  were  used  concomitantly  by  35  (39.8%)  and  23  (27.1%)  subjects  in  the 
tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  and  placebo groups,  respectively. Therefore, a  similar  percentage of  subjects  used 
concomitant  medications between  tofacitinib and  PLB groups with  the exception of corticosteroids (12.7%  
difference between  arms).  This  difference could  have impacted  efficacy results  favouring  the  tofacitinib 
arm. Any concomitant DMARD, corticosteroid, and immunosuppressant use was 76 and 74% in the OL and 
DB  phase,  respectively.  Therefore,  a  percentage  of  subjects  (24-26%)  were  treated  with  Tofacitinib 
monotherapy. Upon the CHMP’s  request, the MAH  revised the proposed indication to describe the intended 
use of tofacitinib  as combination therapy and/or monotherapy.   
Subject’s  disposition:  185  subjects  completed  the  open-label  run-in  phase,  with  173  subjects  being 
randomized into the  double-blind  phase (there were 142  patients  with  pJIA, 15  with  juvenile PsA, and 16 
with  ERA randomised  into  the  double-blind  phase of  the  study).  Discontinuation  occurred in  27  (30.7%) 
and 47 (55.3%)  subjects in the tofacitinib  and PLB arm, respectively; the main reason was lack of efficacy 
22  (25%) and  44 (51.8%)  subjects in  the Tofacitinib  and PLB arms, respectively. Safety was a reason for 
discontinuation  in  a  very limited  number  of  subjects  and  similar  between  arms  (2  subjects  each  arm). 
Discontinuation  for lack of efficacy occurred in 30%  of subjects who  were ACR30 responders at the end of 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 58/118 
  
  
 
OL phase and  lost response, this  is  clinically relevant and  narrows the  subset of  responders. A total  of 99 
subjects  completed  the  double-blind  phase  (61  in  the  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  group  and  38  in  the  placebo 
group). Of those subjects, 97  were rolled over into  the A3921145  study and 2 were discontinued.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results:  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  occurrence  of  disease  flare  from  double-blind  randomization 
through  Week 44  (type  I  Error  Controlled)  of  study  being  significantly  lower  in  the  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID 
group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (p-value=0.0031),  with  a  difference  of  proportions  (tofacitinib-
placebo)  of  -23.69%,  95%  CI  (-39.41%,  -7.97%).  The  results  obtained  from  imputation  methods 
accounting for dropouts supported the primary endpoint  conclusion. 
Numerical treatment differences were observed in favour of tofacitinib in the reported subgroups. However, 
the subgroup “geographical region: Europe” and “sJIA” were considered very limited to allow any conclusion 
(see discussion on therapeutic indication below).  
Secondary endpoints measuring occurrence of flares (i.e. at different timepoints of the DB phase) supported 
the result of the  primary endpoint in  favour of tofacitinib  as compared to  PLB (analysis is only descriptive, 
significant difference is shown).  
To support the wide claimed indication,  the MAH was requested to provide primary endpoint results for the 
following categories: i) polyarticular JIA subtypes; ii) bDMARD naïve and experienced subjects; iii) subjects 
who  received tofacitinib  as  monotherapy  as  compared  to  those  in  combination  with  DMARDs  i.e.  MTX.  
Results  from  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  for  patients  with  pcJIA  (RF+  polyarthritis,  RF- 
polyarthritis,  E  Oligo) are overall supportive of  efficacy and consistent  with  those  of the  overall pJIA set. 
Exclusion of sJIA with  active arthritis but without  active systemic features in view of the results and limited 
number is endorsed by the CHMP.  The updated results on pJIA group (excluding the subgroup of sJIA with 
active arthritis but without  active systemic features) are reflected in the section 5.1 of the SmPC. Addition 
of PsA as a separate subgroup in the indication is endorsed by the CHMP in view of the results obtained in 
this subgroup. Results provided on bDMARD naïve and experienced subjects and on subjects who received 
tofacitinib as monotherapy as compared to those in combination with DMARDs i.e. MTX support the inclusion 
of  these  subgroups  as  well  as  use  of  tofacitinib  in  combination  with  MTX  or  as  monotherapy  in  case of 
intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. The MAH discussed the reasons 
why a high response is seen in PLB arm in the bDMARD subjects as compared to the experienced ones and 
on  the  concomitant  therapy MTX+corticosteroids  as  compared to  MTX  alone,  limited  numbers  and  some 
imbalance in disease characteristics are those identified. This is agreed by the  CHMP. 
The efficacy was also supported by key secondary endpoints:  
i)  JIA  ACR  50,  30,  and  70  responses  (at  Week  44,  Type  I  Error  Controlled),  a  significantly  greater 
proportion of subjects treated with  tofacitinib 5 mg BID achieved ACR 50, 30, and 70  responses compared 
to  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (response  48%,  delta  19.52  p=0.0166;  response  51%,  delta  23,69 
p=0.0031;  response  39%  delta  17.02  p=0.0387,  respectively).  Difference  from  PLB  was  statistically 
significant,  consistent  across  the  different  measure  of  ACR response  and  of  clinical  value  (a  percentage 
ranging from 50%  to 30%, for the ACR70 stringent endpoint,  showed ACR response).  
Subgroups  analyses  favour  tofacitinib  treated  subjects  although  the  limited  number  of  subjects  per 
subgroup i.e Europe as geographic region and others are too limited to  allow a firm conclusion.  
Secondary endpoints  measuring  ACR responses for the  entire  study  support  the  key secondary endpoint 
results: a statistically difference (although  analyses are descriptive) is shown  in favour of tofacitinib  for all 
time  points  considered  and  therefore  the  ACR  response  is  consistent  over  time;  the  proportion    of 
responders varies according  to  the  percentage considered for  the  ACR measure  i.e.  decrease for  higher 
percentage,  in  fact  for  the  most  stringent  ones  i.e.  ACR  90  and  ACR  100  only  a  numerically  difference 
between Tofacitinib and PLB arms is seen.

ii) Change from Double-Blind Baseline  in CHAQ Disability Index at Week 44 (Type I Error Controlled) 
the improvement was statistically  greater in  subjects treated  with  tofacitinib  5 mg BID than  those treated 
with  placebo, with a LS mean difference in the scores of -0.12, p-value=0.0292.  Range of the index is 0-3. 
Secondary endpoints results, although  descriptive analysis was conducted, were generally supportive of 
better activity of tofacitinib as compared to placebo for different endpoints  related to disease activity, 
however for endpoints more stringent the  numerical difference was lower. Those looking at disease 
activity i.e. minimal disease activity showed only a numerical trend and not a significant (although 
formally descriptive) clinical effect. For JIA ACR inactive disease, JIA ACR remission was achieved by 3 
subjects per arm, which is very limited; however, it  is recognized that this  is a very stringent  endpoint to 
meet in view of the definition  i.e. clinical inactive disease for 6 months continuously while on medications 
for JIA. No endpoints aimed at looking the prevention/effect of structural damage are included. Measures 
of disease activity could serve indirectly as an indicator for the effect on bone. Since pJIA is a chronic 
disease, long term effect in  terms of reducing disease activity sufficiently to  prevent life-long damage is 
an important clinical objective.  
Supportive results on tofacitinib  activity are from the mean change in  number of joints with  active 
arthritis in the  DB phase showing  a better trend in  particular at later endpoints in the  subjects treated 
with  tofacitinib.  The same trend favouring tofacitinib for number of joints with  limited  motion (often 
statistical  difference although descriptive in the DB phase) and also for evaluation of disease activity by 
physician and CHAQ parental is also seen.  
Overall, the efficacy results from the  pivotal study are supportive of tofacitinib superiority as compared to 
placebo, although  only a subset of pJIA enrolled subjects could be considered responders, this is in line 
with  the agreed therapeutic indication. 
Data coming from the OL LTE A3921145  Study (interim analysis, as of the 04 June 2019  data cut-off, 227 
subjects were enrolled in;  177 subjects are currently ongoing)  are overall supportive of those obtained in 
the pivotal trial although  differences from baseline are sometime not large and of limited clinical value. 
Upcoming analyses will further inform long term efficacy of tofacitinib  in treating JIA subjects.  
Stopping  rules  were  discussed  and  the  MAH  agreed  to  update  the  4.2  section  of  the  SmPC  providing 
information on  when to  stop treatment  with  tofacitinib  due to  insufficient response. The proposal includes 
a timeframe of clinical improvement observation of  within  18  weeks (more than  4 months,  corresponding 
to  the end  of induction  phase of the study)  and a description  of the lack of benefit  generally described as 
“no improvement” should be amended to include “clinical improvement”. The MAH disagrees to update the 
4.2  section  of the  SmPC providing information  on  when  tofacitinib  could  be stopped in  case of  prolonged 
remission, leaving the decision to physicians and patients/parents. In view of the absence of data in support 
of the decision the  issue is not further pursued by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Phase 3 study met its primary endpoint, the efficacy was further supported by key secondary endpoints. 
The claimed indication  of tofacitinib for treatment of active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(pJIA) in patients  2 years of age and older was revised to reflect the target population as recommended by 
the CHMP  as follows: 
for the  treatment  of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic  arthritis (rheumatoid  factor positive or 
negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis),  and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients  
2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with DMARDs. 
Tofacitinib  can  be  given  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX)  or  as  monotherapy in  case  of 
intolerance to  MTX or where continued treatment with  MTX is inappropriate.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of tofacitinib  oral 5 mg BID tablet  and oral solution formulation (1 mg/mL)  dosed twice 
daily (BID) for the  treatment of pediatric subjects with  active pJIA is supported by the data from the 
pivotal Study A3921104 and the Integrated Safety Population JIA (from Studies A3921103,  A3921104 
and A3921145). 
Patient exposure 
Integrated safety analysis population 
There have been 251  subjects exposed to  the  tofacitinib  5  mg BID dose in  the JIA ISAP safety database. 
Among  the  exposed subjects  in  the  ISAP,  the  overall  exposure was  351  PY  and  the  mean  duration  of 
exposure  was  511  days  (median  duration  485  days).  In  the  CISAP,  representing  continuous  exposure 
without  interruptions of more than 14 days, 251 subjects were exposed for a total of 253 PY and the mean 
duration of exposure was 368  days.

Most Frequent  All Causality  and Treatment-related  Adverse Events  
Study A3921104 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  the  double-blind  phase  of  Study  A3921104  (≥  10%  occurrence in 
tofacitinib, or placebo treatment group) were Upper respiratory tract infection (Tofacitinib: 14.8 %, placebo: 
10.6%  %),  Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (Tofacitinib:  3.4%;  placebo:  14.1%),  and  Disease  progression 
(Tofacitinib: 9.1%;  placebo: 15.3%). 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 64 (28.4%) subjects during the open-label run-in phase.  Most 
treatment-related TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 22 (25.0%)  subjects in  the tofacitinib  5 mg BID group and 33 
(38.8%)  subjects in the placebo group during the double-blind phase.

Subjects are only counted once per event. SOCs with at least one PT >=2%  are included. 
Totals for the No. of Subjects at a higher level are not necessarily the sum of those at the lower levels since a subject may report 
two or more different adverse events 
within the higher level category. The total number of subjects reporting adverse events within a particular SOC reflects all events 
reported within the SOC, 
including events with less than 2% occurrence. 
Includes events up to 999 days after the last dose of Tofacitinib. Events occurring during placebo exposure are excluded. 
MedDRA 22.0 coding dictionary applied. 
Treatment-related  AEs reported in  the integrated  safety population,  by PT, were reported at rates below 
5%,  with  the exception of upper respiratory tract  infection, which  was reported in 10%  of the  population. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  rate  of  treatment-related  JIA  disease  progression  in  the  integrated  safety 
population was below 5%,  because it  was reported under 2 separate PTs, i.e.  Disease progression (4.4%) 
and JIA (4.8%).  All TEAEs with  at least 2% occurrence have previously been identified as common AEs in 
the adult  RA population.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study A3921104 
In  Study A3921104  were reported a total  of  10  SAEs, with  the  majority being  reported in  the  open-label 
run-in  phase  (7 SAEs reported  by 7  subjects).    All  SAE  Preferred Terms (PT)  were  reported in  1  subject 
each.  
Integrated Safety Analysis Population 
Serious adverse events were reported in 23 subjects (9.2%) in the integrated safety analysis population, 
corresponding to an incidence rate of 6.18 (3.87, 9.36) subjects with SAEs/100 PYs. Most SAEs were related 
to hospitalizations for infections or due to  disease worsening/JIA exacerbation.

N: Number of subjects  in analysis set; n: Number of subjects  with the event in the Tofacitinib risk period. 
For subjects  who also enrolled in LTE study, total risk period is the sum of index and LTE risk periods.  
The gap between index and LTE studies can  add a maximum of 28 days to the risk period of 
exposure to Tofacitinib. Placebo exposure may contribute  a maximum of 28 days to the risk period. 
PD (subject-day): Sum of total follow-time for all subjects combined. Follow-up time is time from the first dose to 
the event or total exposure  for subjects  who did not have any event (to the earliest occurrence  of date of: the last 
dose + 28 days, date of death, or cut-off date). 
PY (subject-year): total follow-up time in years defined as PD/365.25. 
Serious infections 
Overall,  there  were  6  subjects  with  serious  infections  in  the  integrated  safety  population  of  the  JIA 
programme, representing an incidence  rate of 1.64  events/100  PY. Three subjects had  serious infections 
during  exposure to  tofacitinib  in  pivotal  Study  A3921104  in  the  open-label  run-in  phase  (1  subject  with 
pneumonia,  1  subject  with  epidural empyema,  pan  sinusitis  and  subperiosteal abscess with  a  history  of 
craniosynostosis repair, and 1 subject with appendicitis). Three subjects had serious infections in LTE study 
A3921145: acute pyelonephritis, abscess limb (buttocks) and UTI.  The subject with UTI discontinued before 
the infection was resolved 70 days after onset or UTI 
Based on the follow-up period of up  to 36 months in the  ISAP, there was no evidence of increasing IRs of 
serious infection over time. 
Herpes Zoster 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 70/118 
  
  
  
  
  
 
Overall, there were 3  subjects with  HZ  reported in  integrated  safety analysis set  for JIA, representing an 
incidence rate of 0.82 events/100 PY (Table 21).  
All 3 reported HZ cases were mild to moderate and monodermatomal. 
In JIA  tofacitinib  program, no cases of death,  GI perforation, ILD, MACE,  malignancy, MAS,  opportunistic 
infection, thromboembolism (no PE or DVT reported), or TB were reported. 
Hepatic  Function and Drug-Induced  Liver Injury 
There were 2 subjects with mild liver enzyme elevations; 1 case was adjudicated as possible and 1 case as 
probable  drug-induced  liver  injury.  There  was  also  1  subject  with  moderate  liver  enzyme  elevations 
adjudicated  as probable  DILI.   All  3  hepatic  events  occurred in  the  first  4  to  8  weeks of  treatment  with 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID in Study A3921104 and all 3 subjects were receiving background MTX.  None met Hy’s 
Law criteria. 
Uveitis 
Uveitis is a common ophthalmologic complication associated with  JIA and it  is evaluated in all JIA studies. 
There was  1  event of  mild  uveitis reported in  the  pJIA clinical  program. This event  occurred in  a subject 
after 511 days of exposure to tofacitinib  and was considered resolved at the next visit 23  days later.  One 
other  subject  reported  uveitis  symptoms  after  639  days of  exposure to  tofacitinib,  but  these  symptoms 
were not  recorded as an  adverse event.   Upon querying by the  medical monitor,  the  symptoms were not 
considered consistent with  active uveitis.  
Laboratory findings 
Haemoglobin 
To  enroll  in  the  JIA  index  Study A3921104,  subjects  were  required  to  have  Hb  levels  ≥10  g/dL  and 
hematocrit ≥33% at  the study enrollment visit.  
Pivotal Study A3921104 
In  Study  A3921104,  the  mean  (SE)  change  from  baseline  in  hemoglobin  at  Week 18  of  the  open-label 
run-in phase was 0.21 (0.09) g/dL. The changes from baseline in hemoglobin were similar in both treatment 
groups during the double-blind phase.  At Week 44, the mean (SE) change from the  double-blind baseline 
in  hemoglobin  was  -0.19 (0.19)  g/dL  for  the  tofacitinib  5 mg  BID  group  and  -0.01  (0.18)  g/dL  for  the 
placebo  group,  with  a  mean  hemoglobin  level  of  12,81  g/dL  and  12,86  g/dL  in  tofacitinib  and  placebo 
groups, respectively (Table 14.3.4.1.5.2.2) 
Continuous Integrated Safety Analysis Population 
There was no evidence of Hb decreases over time in the CISAP, and there were no subject discontinuations 
due to decreases in Hb. 
Neutrophils 
To enrol in the JIA index Study A3921104,  subjects were required to have a neutrophil count ≥1.2 x 109/L 
at the study enrolment visit.   
Pivotal Study A3921104: 
In Study A3921104, mean absolute total neutrophils decreased from baseline to Week 18 of the open-label 
run-in  phase  (reference  to  CSR).    At  Week 18,  the  mean  (SE)  change  from  baseline  in  neutrophils 
was  -0.46  (0.17)  ×  103/mm3.    During  the  double-blind  phase,  the  mean  changes  from the  double-blind 
Assessment report

baseline  in  absolute  neutrophils  were  similar  for  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  for  all  week  except 
Week 24.  At Week 24, the mean (SE) change from the double-blind baseline in absolute neutrophils was -
0.20  (0.30)  ×  103/mm3  for  the  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  group  and  0.39 (0.24)  × 103/mm3  for  the  placebo 
group.   The mean (SE) change from the double-blind  baseline in  absolute neutrophils  was -0.43  (0.34)  × 
103/mm3 and  -0.23 (0.29)  × 103/mm3  for  the  tofacitinib  5 mg  BID  and  placebo  groups,  respectively, by 
Week 44. 
Continuous Integrated Safety Analysis Population 
Neutrophil count changes over time were monitored in the CISAP.  There was no evidence of ANC decreases 
over time in the JIA population. 
Lymphocytes 
Pivotal Study A3921104 
In Study A3921104,  mean lymphocytes initially  increased from baseline at Week 2 and  decreased to near 
baseline  levels  by  Week 18  of  the  open-label  run-in  phase.    The  mean  (SE)  change  from  baseline  in 
lymphocytes was -0.13  (0.06) × 103/mm3 at Week 18.

Covance LLN is based on “Pediatric Reference Intervals” edited by S.J. Soldin, et al, AACC  Press, 7th edition, 2011. 
Platelets 
To enroll in the  JIA index Study A3921104, subjects were required to have a platelet count 
≥100,000  platelets/mm3 at the study enrollment visit. 
Pivotal Study A3921104 
Mean  platelet  counts  initially  increased  from  baseline at  Week 2  and  decreased by  Week  18  during  the 
open-label run-in phase. At Week 18, the  mean change from baseline was -14.24  x 103/mm3.  (the  mean 
value was 294,53  103/mm3) 
During the  double-blind  phase, the mean change from baseline increased more for subjects on tofacitinib  
5  mg  BID  than  on  placebo.    At  Week 44,  the  mean  change  from  the  double-blind  baseline  was  9.93  x 
103/mm3 and  0.24  x 103/mm3,  for  the  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID and  placebo groups,  respectively (PLT  mean 
values tofacitinib:  303,03  x 103/mm3; PLB: 281,57  x 103/mm3).

Platelet count changes overtime were monitored in the CISAP. 
Mean  Change (+/- SE) in Platelets  (103/MM3) – CISAP 
Adjudicated Hepatic  Events 
In the  ISAP there were 2 mild  hepatic events, 1 adjudicated as possible DILI and  1 as probable DILI, and 
1  moderate hepatic  event adjudicated as probable DILI.   One mild and  1 moderate event occurred 2 to  4 
weeks after start of Study A3921104, and 1 mild event occurred 53 days after the start of Study A3921104.   
All 3 subjects were  on background MTX  therapy.   None  met Hy’s  Law criteria.   1  subject was taking 
paracetamol and MTX  with  a  concurrent viral illness  which  was considered a possible  cause.   The second 
subject was also taking paracetamol and methotrexate when elevated AST and ALT occurred.  All 3 events 
resolved after discontinuation of methotrexate and interruption or permanent discontinuation of tofacitinib.   
No cases of Hy’s Law were reported in the integrated safety population  of pJIA. 
Creatine  Kinase 
CPK  levels  in  subjects  who  experienced increased  values  largely  remained  within  the  normal  reference 
range throughout  the duration of treatment with  tofacitinib. 
Regarding renal  function testing in CISAP there was no extra monitoring required in any JIA subject due 
to a creatinine increase >50% from the  initial value, and no subject had to be discontinued due to 
creatinine increase >100% from the initial value.   
Increases in lipid parameters are known effects of tofacitinib treatment and are reported in the SmPC. 
In the CISAP the percentage change from baseline was fluctuating.  However, no major adverse 
cardiovascular events were reported in the  pooled JIA population, even if a long-term safety evaluation is 
needed mainly for this  type of adverse events. 
Vital  signs 
There were no  significant  changes  in heart  rate  and blood pressure of  pJIA subjects  in  the  integrated 
safety population

The incidence rates of SAEs varied from 3.87  subjects with  SAEs/100 PY in the  youngest age category (2 
to  < 6  yrs), to 7.71  subjects with  SAEs/100  PY in the  6  to <12  yrs age category, and 5.99  SAEs/100  PYs 
in the oldest age category (12 to <18  yrs age). 
In comparison, higher rates of SAEs were reported in  the adult RA clinical program, with  an incidence rate 
of 9.73 subjects with SAEs/100 PY at tofacitinib 5 mg BID in the P2P3 RA population and 9.39 subjects with 
SAEs/100 PY at tofacitinib 5 mg BID in  the P123LTE RA population. 
Gender 
The  majority  of  JIA  subjects  in  the  clinical  program  were  female: 186  females,  compared to  65  males. 
Incidence rates of SAE were 9.79 SAEs/100 PY in males and 5.10  SAEs/100 PY in females. Incidence rates 
for  Adverse Events  Resulting  in  Study  Discontinuation were  24.68/100  PY  in  males  and  16.58/100  PY  in 
females.

Formulation 
Incidence rates of number of subjects with SAEs/100 PY reported in the two formulations were: tablet=6.49, 
liquid=7.56  and  for  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  were:  subjects  with  events/100  PY:  tablets=20.20, 
liquid=25.71.  The  spectrum  of  the  AEs  treatment  related  seems to  be  quite  similar  between  the  two 
formulation with abdominal pain, pyrexia and urinary tract infection being more common in liquid compared 
to tablet  formulation, although they occurred in few patients (4, 3,  3 respectively).

The incidence rate of TEAEs was lower in subjects on background MTX  (275.52/100PY)  compared to 
subjects who were MTX-free (338.30/100  PY). 
Rates of ALT/AST >1X ULN  were doubled in subjects on background MTX versus those who did not  receive 
MTX.  There were no  subjects  with  ALT/AST  elevations ≥2X  ULN  in  the  MTX-free  population  versus 3.2% 
and 0.6%  in  subjects on  background MTX.   Overall, the rates of  LFT  elevations were low  in  both subjects 
with  or without  background MTX therapy. 
Baseline  Corticosteroids  
Approximately 30% of JIA subjects received background oral corticosteroids (CS) at the start of tofacitinib 
5 mg  BID treatment  (Day 1).  Subjects on background MTX  and/or CS were required to  maintain  a stable 
dose of these therapies throughout  the studies.

The incidence rate of TEAEs (all causalities) was higher in subjects without  background CS (313.89/100 
PY) compared to subjects who received background CS therapy (262.68/100  PY).   
In general, baseline systemic oral CS use did not  appear to impact the IR for SI, HZ, OI and MACE, likely 
due to both the  limited number of events and the relatively low use of CS at baseline.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study A3921104 
In  Study  A3921104,  26  (11.6%)  subjects  discontinued  from  the  study  because  of  an  AE  during  the 
open-label run-in  phase.  
The  most  common  TEAE  by  PT  that  led  to  discontinuation  were  JIA  [6  (2.7%]),  Disease  Progression 
(5 [2.2%]),  and Condition Aggravated (3 [1.3%]). 
During the double-blind phase of Study A3921104,  there were 16 [18.2%]  subjects in the tofacitinib  5 mg 
BID group  and 29  [34.1%]  subjects  in  the  placebo group  that  discontinued  the  study  because of an  AE.  
The most frequently reported PTs for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo groups were Disease progression 
(8  [9.1%]  and  10  [11.8%] subjects,  respectively),  and  Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (3  [3.4%]  and 
12 [14.1%]  subjects, respectively). 
There  were 20  (8.9%)  subjects  with  dose  reduced  or  temporarily discontinued  because of  an  AE  in  the 
open-label run-in  phase.   During the  double-blind  phase, there were 9 (10.2%)  subjects in  the  tofacitinib 
5 mg BID group and 8 (9.4%) subjects in the placebo group with dose reduced or temporarily discontinued 
because of an AE.

If the same subject in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most 
severe occurrence is counted.  
Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as 
severe unless the subject experienced  
another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded.  
In this case, the reported severity is summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Maximum severity at any 
dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.  
Includes data up to 999 lag days after last dose of Tofacitinib. Events occurring during placebo exposure are excluded.  
MedDRA 22.0 coding dictionary applied.  
Post marketing experience 
As  of  05  May  2019,  cumulatively, there  have  been  approximately 209,081  PY  of  exposure to  tofacitinib  
from marketing experience.  There have been a total of 67,075 case reports received.  Of the 67,075 cases, 
97.6%  were  from  spontaneous  sources.  The  remaining  cases  were  reported  from  non-interventional 
studies,  the  literature,  and  other  non-interventional solicited  sources.   There was  a  total  of  181,756  AEs 
reported, of which 28,531  (15.7%)  were SAEs. 
The most  frequently  reported AEs in  the  67,075  reported cases were drug  ineffective  (14.7%),  condition 
aggravated  (6.9%),  headache  (6.7%),  product  use  in  unapproved  indication  (6.7%),  pain  (6.5%), 
arthralgia (6.3%),  fatigue (5.2%),  malaise (5%),  diarrhoea (4.3%), therapeutic  product effect incomplete 
(4.3%), nausea (4.2%),  pain in extremity (4.1%), nasopharyngitis (4.1%),  product dose omission (3.4%), 
herpes zoster (3.2%),  joint  swelling  (3.1%),  peripheral swelling  (2.9%),  cough  (2.7%),  musculo-skeletal 
stiffness  (2.7%),  influenza (2.5%),  pneumonia  (2.3%),  product  use  issue (2.5%),  abdominal  discomfort 
(2.1%),  dizziness  (2.1%);  sinusitis  (2.1%),  and  urinary  tract  infection  (2.0%).    The  most  frequently 
reported SAEs in the 67,075 cases (≥1%)  were rheumatoid arthritis (1.8%),  condition aggravated (1.6%), 
and pneumonia (2.3%). 
In summary, the review of the types and frequencies of AE reports from post-marketing 
spontaneous/non-interventional studies/non-interventional solicited sources supports the known safety 
profile of tofacitinib  identified through the  tofacitinib RA clinical development programme. No new safety 
signals were identified. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of tofacitinib  oral 5 mg BID tablet  and oral solution formulation (1 mg/mL)  dosed twice 
daily for the treatment  of pediatric subjects with active pJIA is supported by the data coming from the 
pivotal Study A3921104 and the Integrated Safety Population JIA (ISAP) (from Studies A3921103, 
A3921104  and A3921145). 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 85/118 
  
  
  
In the JIA ISAP safety database 251 patients  have been exposed to the  tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose with a 
mean duration  of exposure of 511 days. Considering that  the tofacitinib safety profile has been 
established in adults with  RA, this  is considered acceptable to the CHMP.  However, additional long-term 
safety data is needed to  be collected post-marketing from observational studies (i.e. registries) to 
evaluate the safety in larger populations according to  EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the  treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  The MAH  proposed as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities, two  non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies (PASS) using 
existing JIA registries (the German Biologics in  Pediatric Rheumatology Registry (BiKeR), the Juvenile 
Arthritis Methotrexate/Biologics long-term Observation (JuMBO), the  UK JIA Biologics  and the Swedish 
JIA Clinical Registry), to actively collect and monitor the safety events of interest in tofacitinib  treated JIA 
patients in  the post-approval real-world setting,  including events that have long latency and the possible 
effect of tofacitinib  on maturation, development,  bone growth and response to vaccination. 
Recommendation on immunization in  section 4.4  of the  SmPC has been included, recommending that 
prior to  initiating  tofacitinib all patients,  particularly JIA patients, be brought up to date with  all 
immunisations in agreement with  current immunisation guidelines. Moreover, in light  of the parallel 
evaluation of signal on MACE and malignancies, in  view of the long-term nature of these events,  the MAH 
committed to continue  to conduct routine pharmacovigilance on malignancies in JIA patients  and to 
assess all malignancies in the proposed JIA PASS studies (where lymphoma along with  other types of 
malignancies has been included as an event of interest) to  further inform risk characterization and 
minimization measures in this  population.  
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the overall JIA integrated safety 
set and the pivotal Study A3921104 open-label run-in and double-blind phase analysis sets. All age 
groups were adequately represented. However, in  view of disease epidemiology, the majority of subjects 
was in the oldest age group of 12 to <18  yrs old. Almost all subjects were treated with MTX at  baseline 
OL run-in phase as well as in the ISAP, suggesting a prevalent second line treatment of tofacitinib. In the 
Integrated JIA Safety Population most of subjects were b-DMARDs naïve (66%) and 33,9%  were 
bDMARDs experienced and the  majority of subjects (62%)  were treated with  background MTX at the start 
of tofacitinib treatment  (Day 1), at an average dose of 15  mg/week or CCS (approximately 30% of 
subjects). Other csDMARDs were used only in 2  patients at Day 1 of treatment. Based on these data, the 
MAH  revised the claimed indication to  better reflect the population studied  (see Section 2.5.3. Discussion 
on clinical efficacy). 
The majority of patients (78,2%)  in the Entire  Tofacitinib Exposure Period of Study A3921104 
experienced AEs and 8 subjects (3,6%) had a SAE. Most  TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and 
severe adverse events were reported for 5  (2.2%) subjects. 25 (18,7%)  subjects discontinued from study 
due to AEs. No meaningful differences were observed in the DBSAS of pivotal study between tofacitinib 
and PLB groups.  
The most common AEs occurring with  ≥10%  for tofacitinib  treatment reported in the  integrated safety 
population, by PT, were vomiting (10.0%),  Nasopharyngitis (11.6%),  and Upper respiratory tract 
infection (25.9%),  JIA (10.8%), and Headache (12.4%).  Treatment-related AEs by PT were reported at 
rates below 5%,  with the  exception of upper respiratory tract infection, which  was reported in 10% of the 
population. As stated by the MAH, all TEAEs with  at least 2% occurrence have previously been identified 
as common AEs in the adult RA population.  
A not negligible proportion of subjects (23.1%)  in the ISAP discontinued treatment due to AEs. However, 
it should be considered that  the most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation  in the integrated 
analysis were disease progression, JIA, and condition aggravated, rather suggesting a loss of efficacy. 6 
(2,4%)  subjects discontinued  due to  infections and infestations. 
There were no deaths reported neither in  Study A3921104  nor in the JIA safety population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 86/118 
  
  
In the ISAP, there were 23 subjects (9.2%)  with SAEs, corresponding to an incidence rate of 6.18  (3.87, 
9.36)  subjects/100 PYs. The majority of SAEs were reported in the  SOCs of infections and infestations  or 
due to disease worsening/JIA exacerbation.  
It was also noted that  3 subjects had SAEs relative to psychiatric disorders: one subject aged 11, was 
hospitalized for Major Depressive Disorder and Homicidal Ideation, one subject aged 13  years for Suicidal 
Ideation, and one subject aged 16  years for a Suicide Attempt,  but none were considered related to study 
drug. Two of these subjects had a positive relevant medical history for psychiatric disorders. The 
incidence rate (95%  CI) of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors in the ISAP was 0.82  (0.17, 2.39) 
subjects with events/100 PYs, which was higher than that  reported in the  RA programme (0.04  subjects 
with  events/100 PYs). However, the different age population and exposure between JIA patients  and RA 
subjects does not allow to  draw firm conclusion from this  comparison. Unfortunately, as reported by the 
MAH,  although an increased frequency of psychiatric disorders and depression in JIA subjects compared 
to healthy youth is acknowledged, incidence rates for psychiatric disorders, including  MDD and suicidal 
ideation in JIA patients are not  available in literature (Mullick,  Nahar, and Haq, 2005;  Hanns et al, 2018). 
However, it  is known that suicidality in  the child and adolescent population is a major public health 
concern and that  the risk for self-harm, suicidal thinking,  and attempted suicide may increase in case of 
chronic physical and mental conditions (Barnes AJ et al. Pediatrics, 2010).  Therefore, due to  these 
reasons and confounding factors, it  is difficult to draw final conclusion on psychiatric disorders and 
suicidal and self-injurious behaviors in tofacitinib  treated JIA population. Data provided from a literature 
review on the possible impact of jak inhibitors mechanism of actions on psychiatric events as well as on 
identifying incidence rates among a similar setting  of the  JIA population, are not sufficiently clear to 
conclude on an association of psychiatric events with  tofacitinib.  Moreover, data from the latest PSUR on 
signal evaluation of Psychiatric Disorders in adult population  were considered insufficient to  establish a 
causal relationship between the use of tofacitinib and the development of suicidal/self-injurious behaviour 
or anxiety. In pJIA subjects, 2 psychiatric disorders were judged by the  investigator as related to study 
drug (aggression and anxiety). However, as re-assessed by the MAH,  the event of anxiety occurred in a 
17-year old female, was moderate in intensity,  started at the 311  study day and did not require a change 
of the study drug. Moreover, she was taking concomitant medications (lutera and meloxicam) that  can be 
associated with  anxiety. The event of aggression [“worsening of behavior Alteration (aggressiveness)”], 
occurred in a 7-year old male patient,  started on Study Day 497, was mild in severity and did not require 
a change of study drug. Therefore, considering the late onset of the events, which did not require study 
drug interruption and the confounding factors, the CHMP  considers reasonable the MAH’s conclusion that 
a clear causal association of these events with tofacitinib,  cannot be established. 
The MAH was requested to  clary if some related AEs other than serious infections has similar frequency in 
JIA and RA patients. The MAH  identified some related AEs (e.g influenza, pharyngitis, sinusitis, viral 
infection, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, headache, cough), with  a higher frequency in 
paediatric JIA population compared to the adult  one. It is however noted that the JIA programme is 
smaller than  the adult programme and that the  differences observed are likely due to the  background 
risks associated with  the study population.  In order to better inform physicians and patients, this 
information is included in the SmPC Section 4.8. 
Adverse events of special interest 
There were no cases of GI perforation, ILD, MACE, malignancy, MAS, opportunistic  infection, 
thromboembolism (no PE or DVT reported), or TB. Risk factors for thromboembolic events and/or 
thrombophilia were not  included among exclusion criteria since the safety signal was not known at the 
time of the study design and conduction. Moreover, in the paediatric setting they are less common as 
compared to adults. Serious Infections and Herpes Zoster were the only AEs of Special Interest 
reported in the  ISAP. Serious infections occurred in three subjects during exposure to tofacitinib  in pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 87/118 
  
  
  
Study A3921104  in the open-label run in phase (1 subject with  pneumonia, 1  subject with  epidural 
empyema, pan sinusitis and subperiosteal abscess with  a history of craniosynostosis repair, and 1 subject 
with  appendicitis) and in three subjects in LTE  study A3921145:  acute pyelonephritis, abscess limb 
(buttocks) and UTI.  In addition, there was one event of pilonidal cyst not originally included in the  list of 
serious infections and in the incidence rate calculation due to  a discrepancy between the clinical and the 
safety databases. The incidence rate for serious infections is 1.92  patients with  events per 100 patient-
years.  
There were 3 subjects with  HZ reported in integrated safety analysis set for JIA (incidence rate of 0.82 
events/100 PY) and all of these were mild to  moderate and monodermatomal. However, a severe multi-
dermatomal case in  one additional subject (12 days outside of risk period) occurred. Serious and other 
important infections, and HZ reactivation are important identified  risks and RMMs are in place to mitigate 
them. 
Serious infections and HZ are known AESI of tofacitinib  treatment and are adequately reported in sections 
4.4 and 4.8  of the SmPC.  
Laboratory findings 
The changes from baseline in haemoglobin were similar in both treatment groups during the double-
blind phase of Study A3921104.  The mean absolute total  neutrophils decreased from baseline to 
Week 18 of the open-label run-in phase of Study A3921104  and were similar in the DB phase between 
the two  treatment groups. However, at week 24  a higher difference was observed between tofacitinib  and 
placebo groups [the mean (SE) change from the double-blind baseline in absolute neutrophils was -0.20 
(0.30)×103/mm3 for the tofacitinib  5 mg BID group and 0.39  (0.24)  × 103/mm3 for the placebo group. No 
patients were discontinued due to ANC decreases. Upon request from the  CHMP, the MAH  specified that  5 
patients in  the integrated safety analysis population had severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 
<1000  cells/mm3 at  one or more visits), which  was transient  in all patients and did not require treatment 
discontinuation  of the  study drug (except in one case in which neutropenia was reported in the last  day of 
the open-label phase). The first patient experienced a concomitant  mild viral infection with  fever which 
was considered not related to  study treatment. The second patient  experienced a mild upper respiratory 
tract infection before neutropenia and a mild viral infection probably after resolution of neutropenia. No 
concomitant infections were reported in the other patients. All patients  had concomitant medications at 
the time of the event. In addition, two  patients experienced severe anemia which was transient and no 
action was taken regarding study medication. Changes in Hb  and ANC are expected during treatment and 
they are reflected in the  current version of the SmPC with precautions on how the risks can be mitigated 
or managed. However, the  sections 4.2  and 4.4  of the SmPC have been modified recommending not  to 
initiate  tofacitinib treatment  in paediatric patients  with an absolute neutrophil count less than 1,200 
cells/mm3 and haemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL  according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the 
pivotal study. 
Overall, in the JIA clinical programme (CISAP) the majority of patients in different age groups had ALC ≥ 
2000/mm3. No  subjects met the  discontinuation criteria of ALC <500/mm3.  However, according to  the 
Covance classification, 4  patients (12,9%)  in the age group of 2 to < 6  Years had LLN  for ALC 
(<1500/mm3)  without  experiencing concomitant serious infections.  
In the  pivotal Study A3921104,  an initial  increase of platelets  count  at Week 2 followed by  a decrease by 
Week  18  during  the  open-label  run-in  phase  was  observed.  Only  patients  with  a  platelet  count 
≥100,000  platelets/mm3  at  the  study A3921104  enrollment visit  were allowed  to  participate in  the  study 
and this has been reported in the SmPC.  
Treatment with  tofacitinib was already associated with  an increased incidence of liver enzyme  elevation 
in some adult  patients. In the ISAP of the paediatric JIA programme, 3 hepatic events were judged as 
DILI (2  mild hepatic events, 1 adjudicated as possible DILI and 1 as probable DILI, and 1 moderate 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 88/118 
  
  
 
hepatic event adjudicated as probable DILI). All 3 subjects were on background MTX therapy and 2 
patients were also taking paracetamol, with  a concurrent viral illness in  one case, as confounding factors 
of possible causes of DILI. However, they resolved after discontinuation  of methotrexate and interruption 
or permanent discontinuation  of tofacitinib. No cases of Hy’s Law were reported. This information has 
been reported in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Pubertal  development  has been investigated using Tanner Stage Assessment at the baseline visit in the 
pivotal Study A3921104 and on a yearly basis after rollover into the LTE Study A3921145.  However, very 
few patients are available for a year or more in the  LTE study A3921145  at the time of data cut-off for 
this submission and this does not allow to draw firm conclusion on pubertal development.  
Height  and weight were compared with  data from standard growth charts and summarized using Z-
scores. Despite limitations  due to the limited  number of subjects with 2  years follow up, it  seems from 
data provided that  no significant changes from baseline in height  were observed over time in pJIA 
subjects continuously evaluated over 2 years in the CISAP. In the youngest age group (2 to <6 years) in 
the female JIA subjects in  the CISAP was observed mild weight Z-score increases.  However, due to the 
very few subjects in the  CISAP in which weight was assessed continuously for ≥2  years, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn.  
Almost all patients in each age group experienced AEs. No meaningful differences in TEAEs and SAEs 
were observed across age groups. However, it  was noted that the  incidence rates of SAEs are lower (3.87 
subjects with SAEs/100 PY) in the youngest age category (2 to < 6 yrs) compared to 7.71 subjects with 
SAEs/100 PY in the 6 to <12  yrs age category, and 5.99  SAEs/100 PYs in the  oldest age category (12 to 
<18 yrs age) and this  is of some reassurance for the  youngest group, although,  due to  the limited 
number of patients,  these observation should be interpreted with  caution. 
With  regards to gender, a higher IR of SAEs were observed in males 9.79 SAEs/100 PY compared to 
female 5.10  SAEs/100 PY. The MAH  was asked to specify if a trend in any specific SAE was observed in 
males. The majority of SAEs and discontinuations  due to AEs for males were related to flare/JIA 
worsening. The other SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuations occurred in few patients  and were single 
events. Therefore, no specific trend of SAEs in  males was identified. 
Percentage and IR of SAEs are higher in patients  with  sJIA (as expected due to  the different clinical 
aspect of the  disease) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis,. 
Regarding the distribution  of AEs among different regions, it  was noted  that SAEs occurred less 
frequently (only in one patient,  IR/100 PY 1.71)  in South and Central America compared to North America 
(IR/100 PY 6.90),  Europe (IR/100 PY 7.34)  and other (IR/100 PY 7.13),  even if in most cases were 
considered unrelated by both  investigators and sponsor and the difference seems to decrease when 
considering only serious infections. Moreover, an imbalance between rate of discontinuation (25.5%)  and 
reduced or temporary discontinuation due to AEs (4.3%)  in South and Central America was observed, but 
the rates of discontinuations  seem to become similar among regions when JIA flares are removed from 
calculation, suggesting that  most discontinuations were due to loss of efficacy. The same did not occur for 
reduced or temporary discontinuation, which  are reported to be not related to flares but  rather to  certain 
laboratory abnormalities or were up to  investigator discretion. Therefore, in this case a specific reason of 
difference in frequencies was not identified by the MAH.  Only one SAE (2.1%)  of pneumonia occurred in 
the South and Central America which was considered related to study drug. A higher frequency of SAEs 
was reported in the other regions (range: 8.9%  to 11.1),  even if in most cases were considered unrelated 
by both investigators and sponsor and the difference seems to decrease when considering only serious 
infections. Therefore, even though no certain conclusion can be drawn, the differences among regions 
seem to reduce when considering the provided justifications.  Therefore, the issue was not further by the 
CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 89/118 
  
  
As expected, there was a slightly higher rate of subjects experiencing AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and 
discontinuations  in bDMARDs experienced  patients  compared to bDMARDs naïve subjects, mainly 
driven by the subgroup of patients with  ≥ 2 prior bDMARDs. Subjects who had previously received 2 or 
more bDMARDs discontinued  at a rate of 43.6% compared to  18.7 % for bDMARD naive subjects. Also, 
for IR calculation, a trend towards a higher IR of TEAEs in bDMARD experienced (404,14/100 PY) than 
naïve bDMARDs (258,98/PY)  was observed.  
The majority of patients (62%)  in the ISAP was treated with MTX at  the start of tofacitinib. Overall, the 
tofacitinib  safety profile with  background MTX therapy did seem worse than  on monotherapy. There were 
only 3 patients taking concomitant csDMARDs other than MTX  (one leflunomide and 2 
hydroxychloroquine), therefore there are no sufficient information about the  tofacitinib safety profile with 
csDMARDs different to MTX as background treatment and this is reflected in the  SmPC. 
As expected, a higher rate of SAEs, severe and discontinuation  due to AEs was noted in the  JIA subjects 
who received background oral corticosteroids compared to the  others. 
The MAH took also the  opportunity to update the summary of safety profile for patients  with  rheumatoid 
arthritis, to  indicate the frequency of the  adverse reactions: 
The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections (see section 4.4).  In the  long-term 
safety all exposure population, the most common serious infections reported with  tofacitinib  were 
pneumonia (1.7%), herpes zoster (0.6%),  urinary tract infection (0.4%),  cellulitis  (0.4%), diverticulitis 
(0.3%),  and appendicitis (0.2%). Among opportunistic infections, TB and other mycobacterial infections, 
cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, oesophageal candidiasis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, 
BK virus infections and listeriosis were reported with  tofacitinib.  Some patients have presented with 
disseminated rather than localised disease. Other serious infections that  were not reported in  clinical 
studies may also occur (e.g., coccidioidomycosis). 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3  months in controlled clinical trials were 
headache (3.9%),  upper respiratory tract infections (3.8%),  viral upper respiratory tract infection (3.3%), 
diarrhoea (2.9%),  nausea (2.7%),  and hypertension (2.2%). 
The proportion of patients  who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during first 3 months of 
the double-blind, placebo or MTX controlled studies was 3.8% for patients taking  tofacitinib.  The most 
common infections resulting  in discontinuation  of therapy during the first 3 months in  controlled clinical 
trials were herpes zoster (0.19%)  and pneumonia (0.15%). 
This is agreed by the  CHMP. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile related to the JIA paediatric population  is considered generally similar to that  of the 
already approved tofacitinib indications, without  new clinically important  safety signals related to 
tofacitinib  treatment identified. In particular, the adverse reactions in JIA patients  were consistent with 
those seen in adult  RA patients,  with the  exception of some infections and gastrointestinal or general 
disorders, which were more common in  JIA paediatric population. This is appropriately reflected in the 
SmPC. 
The only adverse events of interest were serious infections (no opportunistic) and HZ.  
The  long-term  safety  in  JIA  patients  is  identified  as  missing  information  and  will  be  further  evaluated 
through  additional pharmacovigilance activities (PASS studies) in the post-marketing setting,  as agreed in 
the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication initially applied was “tofacitinib  oral IR tablet and oral solution 5  mg BID for the treatment 
of active polyarticular course JIA in subjects 2 years of age and older”.  
JIA is an umbrella-term describing a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by chronic arthritis 
with  onset before the age of 16 years, persisting for at least 6 weeks, and having no other identifiable 
cause.   
Polyarticular JIA is defined as arthritis affecting 5 or more joints during the first 6-month  period and 
includes RF+ polyarthritis and, RF- polyarthritis according to ILAR classification.  Subjects with  other 
subtypes of JIA who later develop arthritis in multiple  joints can also have polyarticular disease, however 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 108/118 
  
  
 
they are excluded from the ILAR polyarticular JIA subgroup (Oberle et al, 2014).   These subjects, along 
with  those with polyarticular JIA, could have polyarticular JIA.   
Aim of the  treatment is to delay the progression of symptoms of pJIA, as well as prevent joint  damage 
over the long term (Hashkes, 2011; Beukelmann et al, 2011).   Consequently, the  current treatment 
approach has shifted from a pyramidal approach to more aggressive therapy with earlier initiation  of 
bDMARDs. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Conventional treatment options for pJIA include local glucocorticoid injections, systemic glucocorticoids, 
NSAIDs, and csDMARDs (Schiappapietra et al, 2015;  Ringold et al, 2014).   
csDMARDs are first-line therapy for the treatment  of pJIA due to their proven ability to minimize joint 
damage and improve symptoms.  MTX  is the  most widely used csDMARD; side effects such as 
gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity are often associated with  its  use (Ringold et al, 2019;  Falvey et al, 
2017). 
Biological DMARDS, which  are directed at  extracellular targets such as individual soluble cytokines, have 
revolutionized the  treatment of pJIA, especially in those who fail to respond to  csDMARDs (Hodge et al, 
2016;  Ringold et al, 2019).  TNF  inhibitors were the first bDMARD approved for the treatment of pJIA, are 
the most widely used class of bDMARDs, and have been shown  to lead to significant  improvement in the 
reduction of signs and symptoms of pJIA.  Since their approval, other classes of bDMARDs have also been 
approved for use in pJIA (IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6  inhibitors, selective T cell costimulation modulator) (Sterba 
and Ilowite, 2016).   
Despite benefits of bDMARDs, there are still  downsides to  their use in children with  pJIA such as response 
in only a percentage of subjects, route of administration (parenteral) and the potential  development of 
anti-drug antibodies which  can result in loss of efficacy over time. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  A3921104  was  a  randomized withdrawal,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled study  to  evaluate the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofacitinib for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(including  not  only  the  classical  pJIA subsets  but  also  extended oligoarthritis  and  sJIA  with  arthritis  and 
without systemic features) in children from 2 years of age and older. Superiority of tofacitinib versus placebo 
was analysed. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint (occurrence of disease flare from double-blind randomization through Week 44 
(type I Error Controlled) of study was significantly lower in the tofacitinib  5 mg BID group compared to 
the placebo group (p-value=0.0031),  with  a difference of proportions (tofacitinib-placebo) of -23.69%, 
95% CI (-39.41%,  -7.97%).  The results obtained from imputation  methods accounting  for dropouts 
supported the primary endpoint conclusion. 
Numerical treatment differences were observed in favour of tofacitinib in the  reported subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints measuring occurrence of flares (i.e. at  different timepoints  of the  DB phase) 
supported the results of the  primary endpoint (analysis is only descriptive, significant difference is 
shown).  
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 109/118 
  
  
 
Efficacy is consistent across the  different JIA subtypes, bDMARD naïve and experienced groups included in 
the indication.   
The secondary (type I controlled) endpoints were also supportive of superiority of tofacitinib  over PLB:  
i) JIA ACR 50, 30, and  70 responses (at Week 44, Type I Error Controlled), a significantly greater 
proportion of subjects treated with  tofacitinib 5 mg BID achieved ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses compared 
to subjects treated with placebo (response 48%, delta 19.52  p=0.0166;  response 51%, delta 23,69 
p=0.0031;  response 39% delta 17.02  p=0.0387,  respectively). Difference form PLB was statistically 
significant, consistent  across the different measure of ACR response and of clinical value (a percentage 
ranging from 50%  to 30%, for the ACR70 stringent endpoint,  showed ACR response). Subgroups analyses 
favour tofacitinib  treated subjects.  
Secondary endpoints measuring ACR responses for the  entire study support the  key secondary endpoint 
results.  
ii) Change  from Double-Blind  Baseline  in CHAQ Disability Index  at Week 44 (Type I Error 
Controlled) the improvement was statistically greater in  subjects treated with  tofacitinib  5 mg BID than 
those treated with placebo, with  a LS mean difference in the scores of -0.12, p-value=0.0292.  Range of 
the index is 0-3. 
Secondary endpoints (not type  I controlled) results, although descriptive analysis was conducted, 
were generally supportive of better activity of tofacitinib  as compared to placebo for different endpoints 
related to  disease activity.  
Supportive results on tofacitinib  activity are from the mean change in  number of joints with  active 
arthritis in the  DB phase showing  a better trend in  particular at later endpoints in the  tofacitinib treated. 
Same trend favouring tofacitinib  for number of joints with  limited motion (often statistical  difference 
although descriptive in the DB phase) and also for evaluation of disease activity by physician and CHAQ 
parental is also seen.  
Overall  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  study  are  supportive  of  tofacitinib  superiority  as  compared  to 
placebo. 
Data coming from the OL LTE A3921145  Study (interim analysis, as of the 04 June 2019  data cut-off, 227 
subjects were enrolled in;  177 subjects are currently ongoing)  are overall supportive of those obtained in 
the pivotal trial. 
The oral formulation is considered an advantage to reduce the stress of parenteral administration on 
children with  pJIA and their families.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although EU  population is very limited represented, potentially affecting the external validity of study 
results to EU population,  the similarity of enrolled pJIA population to  the EU pJIA population needs was 
supported using different data sources.  
Secondary endpoints results were generally supportive of primary/key secondary, however analysis is only 
descriptive so limits on robustness of results apply.   
Efficacy on endpoints aimed at evaluating disease activity is not  or only partially demonstrated i.e. 
minimal disease activity showed only a numerical trend and not  a significant  (although formally 
descriptive) clinical effect. For JIA ACR inactive disease, JIA ACR remission was achieved by 3 subjects 
per arm, which is very limited; although it is recognized that  this is a very stringent endpoint.   
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 110/118 
  
  
 
 
No endpoints aimed at looking the  prevention/effect of structural damage are included. Measures of 
disease activity could serve indirectly as an indicator for the effect on bone. Being pJIA a chronic disease, 
long term effect in  terms of reducing disease activity sufficiently to  prevent life-long damage is an 
important clinical objective. This remains an uncertainty.  This is agreed by the CHMP  since no effect is 
claimed. 
Long term efficacy of tofacitinib in treating  JIA subjects will be further substantiated by upcoming 
analyses, results are from an interim analysis with  most subjects still ongoing.  The MAH  has agreed to 
submitted  to submit final results of Study A3921145 which  is listed as category 3 in the  RMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data set is an acceptable number of JIA paediatric patients  and all age ranges were represented. 
As expected, there was a slightly higher rate of subjects experiencing AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and 
discontinuations  in bDMARDs experienced  patients  compared to bDMARDs naïve subjects, mainly 
driven by the subgroup of patients with  ≥ 2 prior bDMARDs. Moreover, a higher rate of SAEs, severe and 
discontinuation  due to  AEs was noted in the  JIA subjects received background oral corticosteroids 
compared to the others. 
The majority of patients in the  Entire Tofacitinib Exposure Period of Study A3921104 experienced AEs. 
Most  TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and severe adverse events were reported for 5 (2.2%) 
subjects.  
The most common AEs occurring with  ≥10% for tofacitinib  treatment reported in the  integrated safety 
population, by PT, were Vomiting, Nasopharyngitis, Upper respiratory tract infection, JIA and 
Headache.  Treatment-related  AEs by PT were reported at rates below 5%, with  the exception of upper 
respiratory tract infection, which  was reported in 10% of the population.  The adverse reactions in JIA 
patients were consistent with  those seen in adult  RA patients, with  the exception of some infections and 
gastrointestinal or general disorders, which were more common in  JIA paediatric population. This is 
appropriately reflected in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
A large proportion of subjects (23.1%)  in the ISAP discontinued treatment due to AEs. However, the 
most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation  in the integrated analysis were disease 
progression, JIA, and condition  aggravated, suggesting a loss of efficacy. 6 (2,4%)  subjects discontinued 
due to infections and infestations. 
In the ISAP, there were 23 subjects (9.2%)  with SAEs, the majority reported in the SOCs of infections 
and infestations or due to  disease worsening/JIA exacerbation. 3 subjects had SAEs relative to psychiatric 
disorders. 
There were no cases of GI perforation, ILD, MACE, malignancy, MAS, opportunistic  infection, 
thromboembolism (no PE or DVT reported), or TB.  
Serious Infections and Herpes  Zoster were the  only AEs of Special Interest reported in the ISAP. 
Serious infections occurred in 7 subjects in the integrated safety analysis set for JIA (pneumonia, epidural 
empyema, pan sinusitis and subperiosteal abscess with  a history of craniosynostosis repair, pilonidal cyst, 
appendicitis, acute pyelonephritis, abscess limb (buttocks)  and UTI).  Overall, there were 3 subjects with 
HZ reported in  the integrated safety analysis set for JIA and all of these were mild to moderate and 
monodermatomal. One (1) additional patient  had an event of serious HZ outside the reporting window. 
It is known that  treatment with  tofacitinib was associated with  an increased incidence of liver enzyme 
elevation in some patients. In the ISAP of the paediatric JIA programme, 3 hepatic events were judged as 
DILI  (2 mild hepatic events, 1 adjudicated as possible DILI and 1 as probable DILI, and 1 moderate 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 111/118 
  
  
hepatic event adjudicated as probable DILI). All 3 subjects were on background MTX therapy, the events 
resolved after discontinuation  of MTX and interruption or permanent discontinuation  of tofacitinib. No 
cases of Hy’s Law were reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile was described in  a sufficient number  of JIA paediatric patients  and all  age groups were 
represented, even if,  in  view of disease epidemiology, the  majority were in the  oldest age group  of 12  to 
<18  yrs old. No  meaningful differences in  TEAEs and SAEs were observed across age groups.  However, a 
better  trend seems to be  observed in the  youngest age category (2  to <  6  yrs), even though,  due to  the 
limited number of patients, this  observation should be interpreted with  caution. 
Although  the  tofacitinib  safety profile has  been established in adults  with  RA, the long-term  safety profile 
in paediatric JIA population as well as possible effects on maturation, development, bone and the potential 
impact on the immune system, are at present not completely known due to the limited number of patients 
and exposure and will  be further investigated in planned PASS studies, as agreed in the RMP.  
The majority of SAEs were reported in the SOCs of infections and infestations or due to  disease 
worsening/JIA exacerbation.  
Serious Infections and Herpes  Zoster were the  only AEs of Special Interest reported in the ISAP. 
Although Herpes Zoster cases were in  the majority (all 3 subjects) mild to moderate and 
monodermatomal, however a severe multi-dermatomal case in one additional subject (12 days outside of 
risk period) occurred. Serious and other important infections, and HZ reactivation are important identified 
risks and RMMs  are already in place to mitigate  them.

Although activity on disease

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the  available treatments for pJIA, additional therapy options are still needed as up to 30%  of 
children with  pJIA continue to have active disease despite treatment with  MTX or biological agents.  
Results from the  pivotal study support a beneficial effect of tofacitinib for relevant clinical signs and 
symptoms of the disease i.e. disease flare, ACR responses in a clinically meaningful percentage of 
subjects. Efficacy for relevant groups which  potentially are included in the claimed broad indication has 
been provided and the  wording of indication  has been revised accordingly.  
Moreover, the safety profile related to the  JIA paediatric population is generally similar to that  of the 
already approved tofacitinib indications in adults  with the  exception of some infections and 
gastrointestinal or general disorders, which were more common in  JIA paediatric population. The only 
adverse events of interest were serious infections (no opportunistic)  and HZ. The long-term safety profile

will be further evaluated through  additional pharmacovigilance activities in the post-marketing setting,  as 
agreed in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The results from study A3921104  show a statistically  and clinically relevant effect for tofacitinib on the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The efficacy in JIA was demonstrated in patients with  active 
polyarticular JIA subtypes of rheumatoid factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended 
oligoarthritis, and in patients juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA); in bDMARD naïve and experienced patients 
and for patients  who received tofacitinib as monotherapy or concomitantly to cDMARD. 
The safety in the JIA population shows the same pattern  as the known safety profile of tofacitinib in  adult 
RA patients  with  the exception of some infections and gastrointestinal or general disorders, which were 
more common in JIA paediatric population. The long-term safety in JIA patients will  be further 
characterized in the post-marketing setting. 
The initially sought indication  ‘treatment of active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in 
patients 2 years of age and older’ was not  agreed by the CHMP since considered too broad. The wording of 
the  agreed indication  was revised according to  the  in/exclusion criteria  of study  A3921104 and  therefore 
restricted  to  patients  who  responded inadequately to  previous therapy  with  DMARDs. The  indication  was 
also restricted to the JIA subgroups where the efficacy was demonstrated: rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] 
or  negative  [RF-]  polyarthritis,  extended  oligoarthritis  and  juvenile  PsA.  The  inclusion  of  the  term 
“polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic  arthritis”  in  the  wording  of the  indication was  not  agreed by the 
CHMP since there may be different interpretations of what JIA categories are included in this term and it is 
not included in previously approved paediatric indications.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not  applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xeljanz is positive in the following indication: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (rheumatoid 
factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis),  and juvenile psoriatic arthritis  (PsA) 
in patients  2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to  previous therapy with  DMARDs. 
Tofacitinib can be given in combination with  methotrexate (MTX)  or as monotherapy in case of intolerance 
to MTX or where continued  treatment with  MTX is inappropriate. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Xeljanz new pharmaceutical form is favourable in the following  indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/389275/2021 
Page 115/118 
  
  
 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (rheumatoid 
factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis),  and juvenile psoriatic arthritis  (PsA) 
in patients  2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to  previous therapy with  DMARDs. 
Tofacitinib can be given in combination with  methotrexate (MTX)  or as monotherapy in case of intolerance 
to MTX or where continued  treatment with  MTX is inappropriate. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the  marketing authorisation for Xeljanz subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

Risk Management  Plan  (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in  the agreed 
RMP presented in Module  1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of XELJANZ in each Member State, the  MAH must  agree about the content and 
format of the  educational programme, including  communication media, distribution  modalities, and 
any other aspects of the programme, with the  National Competent Authority. The MAH shall ensure 
that  in each Member State where XELJANZ is marketed, healthcare professionals who intend  to 
prescribe XELJANZ have been provided with  an educational package. 
The main objective of the  programme is to increase awareness about the risks of the  product, 
specifically in regards to serious infections,  venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]

in the patient population means for systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure in patients treated with nevirapine. In the 
same study a decrease in patient population means of 
blood phosphorus was also noted. These signals triggered a 
retrospective analysis of relevant Viramune clinical trials, 
complemented by an analysis of post-marketing case 
reports (both healthcare professional confirmed cases and 
consumer reports) performed in the Global

the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. The exact mechanism 
remains unclear but there is some evidence that this effect 
could be independent from the antiretroviral activity as 
shown in controlled clinical studies NILE. However, in the 
absence of specific studies with nevirapine on modifying the 
cardiovascular risk in HIV infected patients, the clinical 
impact of these findings is not known. The selection of

section was shortened in order to clearly describe the non-
competitive mechanism of action of nevirapine (NVP) to 
inhibit the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). The antiviral 
activity in vitro section was also shortened in order to focus 
on the antiviral activity of NVP against several HIV isolates 
from HIV infected patients instead on the cell line used in 
protocols. The resistance section describing phenotypic and 
genotypic changes in HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving 
either NVP or NVP in combination with other RT inhibitors 
was rewritten to focus on mutations that emerged in vitro 
or in vivo. In the cross resistance section a generic 
statement, not mentioning individual mutations or mutation 
scores regarding cross-resistance was introduced. For the 
clinical aspect section data on both naive and experienced 
patients were presented. In order to increase the clinical

information on efficacy were completed with safety 
information. Data on perinatal transmission were updated 
to reinforce the current knowledge on the NVP resistance 
development after single dose. In women previously 
treated with single-dose NVP alone for prevention of 
mother to child transmission of HIV-1, the efficacy of NVP 
as part of a combination therapy which the women receive 
for their own health may be reduced. Implications on infant 
virologic failure has been also included in the SPC wording 
in order to complete the information: in infants previously 
treated with single-dose NVP alone for prevention of 
mother to child transmission of HIV-1, the efficacy of NVP 
as part of a combination therapy which they receive for

NVP is one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days. This 
lead-in period should be used because it has been found to 
lessen the frequency of rash. There are currently few 
clinical data to link the development of viral resistance with 
lower plasma levels of NVP with the lead-in dose 
nevertheless the risk cannot be excluded.  As a 
consequence a precautionary statement is added to the 
SPC to encourage alternative treatment in these cases of 
prolonged lead-in treatment dosing regimen not only to 
prevent an exacerbation of the rash but also to prevent the 
development of resistances due to underexposure.  Patients 
experiencing rash during the 14 day lead-in period of 200 
mg/day should not have their NVP dose increased until the 
rash has resolved. The 200 mg once daily dosing regimen 
should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in

Package Leaflet 
of section 4.5 has been tabled as recommended in 
Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products 
for the treatment of HIV infection (CPMP/EWP/633/02, Rev. 
2). As studies for newer classes of antiretrovirals and 
recently approved antiretroviral medicinal products are not 
available in all cases, SPCs of the recently approved 
antiretroviral products were used as reference document. 
For products where the pathway of metabolism is similar to 
nevirapine, the information was added that their plasma 
concentration may decrease when co-administered with 
nevirapine and that careful monitoring of their effectiveness 
is recommended. In the first column of the interaction 
section the dosage of the respective co-administered 
medicinal products has been specified. The interaction data 
is presented in the second column as geometric mean value 
with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) whenever these 
data were available. This facilitates the use of the 
interaction section for the treating physician. 
Recommendations to the treating physician concerning the 
co-administration are given in the third column. Where 
applicable, the recommendation concerning co-
administration has been worded uniformly as: "product 
concerned" and Viramune can be co-administered without 
dose adjustments. Overall, the description of the

in pregnancy, some data suggests that nevirapine exposure 
in the first trimester is not associated with a rate of birth 
defects above the expected one. This is consistent with 
preclinical data, which did not suggest a teratogenic effect. 
It thus seems reasonable for the SPC to state that there is 
no evidence of teratogenic effects with nevirapine. The 
already existing warning in section 4.4 regarding the higher 
frequency of liver toxicity in women with CD4 cell counts 
above 250 cells/mm3 was linked to this section to reinforce

II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of this Viramune continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and therefore considers that the benefit/risk 
profile of Viramune continues to be favourable. However, 
the low genetic barrier of nevirapine, associated with a 
significant number of "drug ineffective" reports, are a 
matter of concern in particular in view of the evolving 
therapeutic management of HIV infected patients. The 
emergence of resistance to nevirapine and associated 
virological failure should be carefully controlled in order to 
permanently ensure an optimal therapeutic management of 
HIV infected patients. In addition, serious adverse events 
associated with the use of nevirapine, in particular hepatic 
and cutaneous reactions, should continue to be monitored. 
Based on these issues, the CHMP concluded that the MAH 
should continue to submit yearly PSURs. Furthermore, the 
CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal 
on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds is required.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
14 rhabdomyolysis related, health professionals confirmed 
case reports associated with nevirapine treatment. Of these 
12 were reported as serious, 1 non-serious and another 
with no information. In all, except one (with limited 
information) rhabdomyolysis was accompanied by either 
hepatitis or severe cutaneous skin reactions. Acute renal 
failure in five cases seems to present a typical complication 
of rhabdomyolysis. Based on these findings, the warning

infected patients with different degrees of hepatic 
impairment and on nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) as part 
of a stable antiretroviral therapy showed that 
approximately 15 % of these patients had nevirapine 
trough concentrations 2-fold above (9,000 ng/ml) the usual 
mean trough. These patients should therefore, be under 
closely monitoring for any evidence of nevirapine induced 
toxicity. In addition, historical data from a single dose 
pharmacokinetic study in HIV negative patients with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment suggested that patients with 
worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of 
accumulating nevirapine.

antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment.  
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not yet been 
detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of 
CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection 
(OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for 
the complications most feared in this context; CMV-
retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and 
Page 36/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  An additional reason for 
treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially, is the 
great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due 
to drug interactions.  
The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune 
system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and 
the early recognition and diagnose of these inflamatory 
reaction is considering to be important to the clinical 
handling of the patients. Therefore, the CHMP further to the 
assessment of MAH's responses and discussions held at the 
pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, a class

system of HIV-infected patients treated with any type of

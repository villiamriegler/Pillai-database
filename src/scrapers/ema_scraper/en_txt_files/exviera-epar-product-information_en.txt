with mixed genotype 1 infection.
** When assessing severity of liver disease using non-invasive methods, a combination of blood biomarkers or 
the combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improves accuracy and should be undertaken 
prior to 8 week treatment in all patients with moderate fibrosis.
Missed doses
In case a dose of dasabuvir is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 6 hours. If more than 6 
hours have passed since dasabuvir is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken and the 
patient should take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to 
take a double dose.
Special populations
HIV-1 Co-infection
The dosing recommendations in Table 1 should be followed. For dosing recommendations with HIV 
antiviral medicinal products, refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5. See sections 4.8 and 5.1 for additional 
information.
Liver transplant recipients
Dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 
24 weeks in liver transplant recipients. Lower ribavirin dose at initiation may be appropriate. In the 
post-liver transplant study, ribavirin dosing was individualized and most subjects received 600 to 
800 mg per day (see section 5.1). For dosing recommendations with calcineurin inhibitors refer to 
section 4.5. 
Elderly
No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is warranted in elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 5.2). For patients that require ribavirin, 
refer to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics for information regarding use in patients 
with renal impairment.
3
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). 
Dasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B 
or C) (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of dasabuvir in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available.
Method of administration
The film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (i.e. 
patients should not chew, break or dissolve the tablet). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir tablets 
should be taken with food, without regard to fat and calorie content (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2).
Use of ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral 
contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers 
is expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see section 
4.5. Examples of contraindicated inducers are provided below.
Enzyme inducers:
 carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital
 efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine
 apalutamide, enzalutamide
 mitotane
 rifampicin
 St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)
Medicinal products that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations 
and must not be co-administered with dasabuvir (see section 4.5). Examples of contraindicated 
CYP2C8 inhibitors are provided below. 
CYP2C8 inhibitor:
 gemfibrozil
Dasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir. For contra-indications with
ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Dasabuvir is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and must be used in combination 
with other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection (see section 4.2 and 5.1).
Risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients with cirrhosis
Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, have 
been reported post-marketing in patients treated with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
with and without ribavirin. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced or 
decompensated cirrhosis prior to initiating therapy. Although causality is difficult to establish due to 
background advanced liver disease, a potential risk cannot be excluded.
Dasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B 
or C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.2).
For patients with cirrhosis:
 Monitoring should be performed for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation 
(such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage).
 Hepatic laboratory testing including direct bilirubin levels should be performed at baseline, 
during the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter.
 Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop evidence of hepatic 
decompensation.
ALT elevations
During clinical trials with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin, 
transient elevations of ALT to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 
approximately 1% of subjects (35 of 3,039). ALT elevations were asymptomatic and generally 
occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, without concomitant elevations of bilirubin, and 
declined within approximately two weeks of onset with continued dosing of dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin. 
These ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using 
ethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products such as combined oral contraceptives or 
contraceptive vaginal rings (6 of 25 subjects); (see section 4.3). In contrast, the rate of ALT elevations 
in subjects using other types of oestrogens as typically used in hormonal replacement therapy (i.e., oral 
and topical oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens) was similar to the rate observed in subjects who 
were not using oestrogen-containing products (approximately 1% in each group). 
Patients who are taking ethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral 
contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception 
(e.g., progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating dasabuvir with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Although ALT elevations associated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been 
asymptomatic, patients should be instructed to watch for early warning signs of liver inflammation, 
such as fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, as well as later signs such as 
jaundice and discoloured faeces, and to consult a doctor without delay if such symptoms occur. 
Routine monitoring of liver enzymes is not necessary in patients that do not have cirrhosis (for 
cirrhotics, see above). Early discontinuation may result in drug resistance, but implications for future 
therapy are not known.
5
Pregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin
Also see section 4.6. 
Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male 
patients when dasabuvir is taken in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.6 and refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information).
Use with tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus
Co-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, 
sirolimus or everolimus increases the concentrations of the immunosuppressant due to CYP3A 
inhibition by ritonavir (see section 4.5). Serious and/or life threatening events have been observed with 
co-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, and a 
similar risk can be expected with sirolimus and everolimus.
Avoid concomitant use of tacrolimus or sirolimus with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
unless the benefits outweigh the risks. If tacrolimus or sirolimus are used together with dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, caution is advised, and recommended doses and monitoring 
strategies can be found in section 4.5. Everolimus cannot be used due to lack of suitable dose strengths 
for dose adjustments. 
Tacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and 
throughout co-administration with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and the dose and/or 
dosing frequency should be adjusted as needed. Patients should be monitored frequently for any 
changes in renal function or tacrolimus or sirolimus associated adverse reactions. Refer to the 
tacrolimus or sirolimus Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing and monitoring 
instructions.
Depression or psychiatric illness
Cases of depression and more rarely of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with 
dasabuvir with or without ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment in combination with ribavirin in 
the majority of the cases. Although some cases had previous history of depression, psychiatric illness 
and/or 
or  without 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment cannot be excluded. Caution should be used in patients with 
a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Patients and caregivers should be instructed 
to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation.

Genotype-specific activity
Concerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning 
genotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1.
The efficacy of dasabuvir has not been established in patients with HCV genotypes other than 
genotype 1; dasabuvir should not be used for the treatment of patients infected with other genotypes 
than 1.
Co-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV
Dasabuvir safety and efficacy have been established in combination with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir 
/ritonavir with or without ribavirin. Co-administration of dasabuvir with other antivirals has not been 
studied and, therefore, cannot be recommended.
Retreatment
6
The efficacy of dasabuvir in patients previously exposed to dasabuvir, or to medicinal products 
anticipated to be cross-resistant, has not been demonstrated.
Use with statins 
Rosuvastatin
Dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to rosuvastatin 
more than 3-fold. If rosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily 
dose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).
Pitavastatin and fluvastatin
The interactions with pitavastatin and fluvastatin have not been investigated. Theoretically, dasabuvir 
with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to pitavastatin and 
fluvastatin. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin/fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of 
treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. If statin treatment is required during the treatment 
period, a switch to a reduced dose of pravastatin/rosuvastatin is possible (see section 4.5, Table 2).
Treatment of patients with HIV co-infection
Dasabuvir is recommended in combination with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, and ritonavir may 
select for PI resistance in HIV co-infected patients without ongoing antiretroviral therapy. HIV co-
infected patients without suppressive antiretroviral therapy should not be treated with dasabuvir.
Drug interactions need to be carefully taken into account in the setting of HIV co-infection (for details 
see section 4.5, Table 2).
Atazanavir can be used in combination with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir if 
administered at the same time. To be noted, atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir, since 
ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose 
combination. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular 
icterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen.
Darunavir, dosed 800 mg once daily, if administered at the same time as 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, can be used in the absence of extensive PI resistance (darunavir 
exposure lowered). To be noted, darunavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg 
once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination.
For the use of HIV protease inhibitors other than atazanavir and darunavir refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir.
Raltegravir exposure is substantially increased (2-fold). The combination was not linked to any 
particular safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks.
Rilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination with 
dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If 
an HIV protease inhibitor is added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even 
further and is, therefore, not recommended. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of 
repeated ECG monitoring.
NNRTIs other than rilpivirine (efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine) are contraindicated (see section 
4.3).
Hepatitis B virus reactivation
7
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should,
therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.
Use in diabetic patients 
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic medicinal products modified when necessary. The physician in 
charge of the diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is 
initiated. 
.
Lactose
Exviera contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Dasabuvir must always be administered together with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir . When co-
administered they exert mutual effects on each other (see section 5.2). Therefore, the interaction 
profile of the compounds must be considered as a combination.
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Coadministration with enzyme inducers may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions and ALT 
elevations (see Table 2).
Coadministration with ethinyloestradiol may lead to increased risk of ALT elevations (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3.
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Potential for dasabuvir to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including 
ritonavir. The following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are 
affected by dasabuvir when combined with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. See Table 2 for guidance 
regarding potential drug interactions and dosing recommendations for dasabuvir administered with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4
Refer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details. (see also 
Table 2). 
Medicinal products transported by the OATP family
Refer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details on 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 substrates (see also Table 2).
Medicinal products transported by BCRP
Dasabuvir is an inhibitor of BCRP in vivo. Co-administration of dasabuvir with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may 
increase plasma concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose 
8
adjustment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of 
the statins (see Table 2). See also Table 2 for specific advice on rosuvastatin which has been evaluated 
in a drug interaction study.
Medicinal products transported by Pgp in the intestine
While dasabuvir is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp, no significant change was observed in the exposure of 
the P-gp substrate, digoxin, when administered with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. 
It may not be excluded that the systemic exposure of dabigatran etexilate is increased by dasabuvir due 
to inhibition of P-gp in the intestine.
Medicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation
Dasabuvir is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 in vivo. Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products
that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased plasma concentrations of such 
medicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow therapeutic index 
medicinal products (i.e. levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on raltegravir and 
buprenorphine which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies. Dasabuvir has also been found 
to inhibit UGT1A4, 1A6 and intestinal UGT2B7 in vitro at in vivo relevant concentrations.
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19
Co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can decrease exposures of 
medicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, 
s- mephenytoin), which may require dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. CYP2C19 substrates 
evaluated in drug interaction studies include omeprazole and escitalopram (Table 2). 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9
Dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the 
CYP2C9 substrate warfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. 
glimepiride, glipizide) are not expected to require dose adjustments. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2
Dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the 
CYP2D6 /CYP1A2 substrate duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were 
decreased. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. 
ciprofloxacin, cyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, 
metoprolol and dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments. 
Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins
Dasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown by the lack of 
interaction with tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that dasabuvir is not an inhibitor of
organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin 
extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Therefore, dasabuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are primarily excreted by the 
renal route via these transporters (see section 5.2). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of dasabuvir
Medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8
Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8 (e.g. teriflunomide, 
deferasirox) may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations. Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are 
contraindicated with dasabuvir (see section 4.3 and Table 2).
Enzyme inducers
9
Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme inducers 
is expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. 
Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table 2. 
Dasabuvir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP and its major metabolite M1 is a substrate of OCT1 in 
vitro. Inhibition of P-gp and BCRP is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in exposures 
of dasabuvir (Table 2).
Dasabuvir M1 metabolite was quantified in all the drug interaction studies. Changes in exposures of 
the metabolite were generally consistent with that observed with dasabuvir except for studies with 
CYP2C8 inhibitor, gemfibrozil, where the metabolite exposures decreased by up to 95% and CYP3A 
inducer, carbamazepine, where the metabolite exposures decreased by only up to 39%.
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists
As liver function may change during treatment with dasabuvir administered with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is 
recommended.
Drug interaction studies
Recommendations for co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for a 
number of medicinal products are provided in Table 2.
If a patient is already taking medicinal product(s) or initiating a medicinal product while receiving 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, 
dose adjustment of the concomitant medicinal product(s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be 
considered (Table 2).
If dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, doses should be re-adjusted after administration of dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is completed.
Table 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and concomitant medicinal products. 
The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, and AUC) in the 
paritaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co-administered medicinal product (↑= increase more than 
20%, ↓ = decrease more than 20%, ↔ = no change or change less than 20%).
This is not an exclusive list. Dasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. For 
interactions with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

While no change in the
pharmacokinetics of

close monitoring of INR 
is recommended with 
all vitamin K 
antagonists. This is due 
to liver function 
changes during 
treatment with 
dasabuvir +

1. Lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg once daily (administered in the evening) was also administered with 
dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The effect on Cmax and AUC of DAAs and lopinavir 
was similar to that observed when lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily was administered with 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.
2. Rilpivirine was also administered with food in the evening and 4 hours after dinner with dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in the study. The effect on rilpivirine exposures was similar to that 
observed when rilpivirine was administered in the morning with food with dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.
3. Ciclosporin 100 mg dosed alone and 30 mg administered with dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Dose normalized cyclosporine ratios are shown for interaction with 
dasabuvir + ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. 
4. C12:= concentration at 12 hours following single dose of everolimus.
5. Sirolimus 2 mg was dosed alone, 0.5 mg administered with dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Dose normalized sirolimus ratios are shown for interaction with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.
6. C24:= concentration at 24 hours following single dose of cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus.
7. Tacrolimus 2 mg was dosed alone and 2 mg was administered with dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Dose normalized tacrolimus ratios are shown for interaction with 
dasabuvir + ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.
8. Dose normalised parameters reported for methadone, buprenorphine and naloxone.
Note: Doses used for dasabuvir + ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir were: ombitasvir 25 mg paritaprevir 150 mg, 
ritonavir 100 mg, once daily and dasabuvir 400 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily. The dasabuvir exposures 
obtained with the 400 mg formulation and the 250 mg tablet are similar. dasabuvir + 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir was administered as multiple doses in all the drug interaction studies except 
the drug interaction studies with carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, and 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.
Paediatric population
Drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential /contraception in males and females
29
Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male 
patients when dasabuvir is used with ribavirin. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have 
been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, ribavirin is contraindicated in 
women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Refer to the Summary
of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information.
Female patients: Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using 
an effective form of contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 4 months after treatment.
Male patients and their female partners: Either male patients or their female partners of childbearing 
potential must use a form of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 7 months 
after treatment. 
Ethinyloestradiol is contraindicated in combination with dasabuvir (see section 4.3). See additional 
information on specific hormonal contraceptives in sections 4.3 and 4.4.
Pregnancy
There are very limited data from the use of dasabuvir in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of dasabuvir during pregnancy.
If ribavirin is co-administered with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, the 
contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of ribavirin). 
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether dasabuvir and metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of dasabuvir and metabolites in milk (see 
section 5.3). Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the medicinal product in breastfed 
infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue treatment with 
dasabuvir, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. Patients receiving ribavirin 
should also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of dasabuvir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects on fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dasabuvir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
informed that fatigue has been reported during treatment with dasabuvir in combination with
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In subjects receiving dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, the most 
commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The 
30
proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% 
(5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of subjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in subjects who received 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin.  The majority of adverse 
reactions presented in Table 3 were of grade 1 severity in dasabuvir- and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir-containing regimens.
The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined 
as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).

Serum ALT elevations
In a pooled analysis of clinical trials with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and 
without ribavirin, 1% of subjects experienced serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) after starting treatment. As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women 
taking a concomitant ethinyloestradiol-containing medicine, such medicinal products are 
contraindicated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. No increase in incidence of ALT 
elevations was observed with other types of systemic oestrogens commonly used for hormone 
replacement therapy (e.g., oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens). ALT elevations were typically 
asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 8-
57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinyloestradiol. Three 
interrupted dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for one to seven days, including one on 
ethinyloestradiol. The majority of these ALT elevations were transient and assessed as related to 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with 
bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4).
Serum bilirubin elevations 
32
Transient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin 
transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations 
occurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing 
therapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of 
indirect bilirubin elevations was lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.
Liver transplant recipients
The overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered dasabuvir and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medicinal 
products) was similar to subjects treated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and 
ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse reactions were increased in frequency. 10 
subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 
subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an 
interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact SVR rates. 5 subjects required 
erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject 
received a blood transfusion.
HIV/HCV co-infected patients
The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV 
mono-infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 
17 (27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with 
hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases.
GT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD)
Dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects 
with genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see 
Section 5.1). The overall safety profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that 
seen in prior Phase 3 studies in subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater 
proportion of subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum 
haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in 
haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 
subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of these subjects were also 
treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 g/dL.  Two subjects 
received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected 
subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir was 
also evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia 
were seen in these subjects.
Paediatric population
The safety of dasabuvir in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has not yet been established. No 
data are available.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
33
4.9 Overdose
The highest documented single dose of dasabuvir administered to healthy volunteers was 2 g. No 
study drug-related adverse reactions or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed.
In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; direct-acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP09
Mechanism of action
Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the 
NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome. 
Co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combines three direct-acting 
antiviral medicinal products with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance 
profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle. Refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for its pharmacological properties.
Activity in cell culture and biochemical studies
The EC50 of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture 
assays was 7.7 and 1.8 nM, respectively. The replicon activity of dasabuvir was attenuated 12- to 13-
fold in the presence of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of dasabuvir against replicons containing 
NS5B from a panel of treatment-naïve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture 
assay was 0.77 nM (range 0.4 to 2.1 nM; n=11) and 0.46 nM (range 0.2 to 2 nM; n=10), respectively. 
In biochemical assays, dasabuvir inhibited a panel of genotype 1a and 1b polymerases with a mean 
IC50 value of 4.2 nM (range 2.2 to 10.7 nM; n=7).
The M1 metabolite of dasabuvir had EC50 values of 39 and 8 nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-
Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays, respectively, and the activity of the M1 metabolite 
was attenuated 3- to 4-fold in the presence of 40% human plasma. Dasabuvir had reduced activity in 
biochemical assays against NS5B polymerases from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a (IC50 values 
ranging from 900 nM to >20 μM).
Resistance
In cell culture
Resistance to dasabuvir conferred by variants in NS5B selected in cell culture or identified in Phase 2b 
and 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterised in the appropriate genotype 1a or 1b replicons.
In genotype 1a, substitutions C316Y, M414T, Y448H, A553T, G554S, S556G/R, and Y561H in HCV 
NS5B reduced susceptibility to dasabuvir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of dasabuvir was 
reduced 21- to 32-fold by the M414T, S556G or Y561H substitutions; 152- to 261-fold by the A553T, 
G554S or S556R substitutions; and 1472- and 975-fold by the C316Y and Y448H substitutions, 
respectively. G558R and D559G/N were observed as treatment-emergent substitutions but the activity 
of dasabuvir against these variants could not be evaluated due to poor replication capacity. In genotype 
1b, substitutions C316N, C316Y, M414T, Y448H, and S556G in HCV NS5B reduced susceptibility to 
dasabuvir. The activity of dasabuvir was reduced by 5- and 11-fold by C316N and S556G, 
respectively; 46-fold by M414T or Y448H; and 1569-fold by the C316Y substitutions in the genotype

1b replicon. Dasabuvir retained full activity against replicons containing substitutions S282T in the 
nucleoside binding site, M423T in the lower thumb site, and P495A/S, P496S or V499A in the upper 
thumb site. 
Effect of baseline HCV substitutions/polymorphisms on treatment response
A pooled analysis of subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, who were treated with dasabuvir, 
ombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials, was conducted to 
explore the association between baseline NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B substitutions/polymorphisms and 
treatment outcome in these recommended regimens. 
In the greater than 500 genotype 1a baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed 
resistance-associated variants were M28V (7.4%) in NS5A and S556G (2.9%) in NS5B. Q80K, 
although a highly prevalent polymorphism in NS3 (41.2% of samples), confers minimal resistance to 
paritaprevir. Resistance-associated variants at amino acid positions R155 and D168 in NS3 were rarely 
observed (less than 1%) at baseline. In the greater than 200 genotype 1b baseline samples in this 
analysis, the most frequently observed resistance-associated variants observed were Y93H (7.5%) in 
NS5A, and C316N (17.0%) and S556G (15%) in NS5B. Given the low virologic failure rates observed 
with recommended treatment regimens for HCV genotype 1a- and 1b-infected subjects, the presence 
of baseline variants appears to have little impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR.
In clinical studies
Of the 2,510 HCV genotype 1 infected subjects who were treated with regimens containing dasabuvir, 
ombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin (for 8, 12 or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and 3 clinical 
trials, a total of 74 subjects (3%) experienced virologic failure (primarily post-treatment relapse). 
Treatment-emergent variants and their prevalence in these virologic failure populations are shown in 
Table 5. In the 67 genotype 1a infected subjects, NS3 variants were observed in 50 subjects, NS5A 
variants were observed in 46 subjects, NS5B variants were observed in 37 subjects, and treatment-
emergent variants were seen in all 3 drug targets in 30 subjects. In the 7 genotype 1b infected subjects, 
treatment-emergent variants were observed in NS3 in 4 subjects, in NS5A in 2 subjects, and in both 
NS3 and NS5A in 1 subject. No genotype 1b infected subjects had treatment-emergent variants in all 3 
drug targets.

c. Substitutions were observed in combination with other emergent substitutions at NS3 position R155 or 
D168.
d. Observed in combination in genotype 1b-infected subjects.
e. Observed in combination in 6% (4/67) of the subjects.
Note: The following variants were selected in cell culture but were not treatment-emergent: NS3 variants 
A156T in genotype 1a, and R155Q and D168H in genotype 1b; NS5A variants Y93C/H in genotype 1a, and 
L31F/V or Y93H in combination with L28M, L31F/V or P58S in genotype 1b; and NS5B variants Y448H 
in genotype 1a, and M414T and Y448H in genotype 1b.
Persistence of resistance-associated substitutions
The persistence of dasabuvir, ombitasvir and paritaprevir resistance-associated amino acid 
substitutions in NS5B, NS5A and NS3, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1a-infected subjects in 
Phase 2b trials. Dasabuvir treatment-emergent variants M414T, G554S, S556G, G558R or D559G/N 
in NS5B were observed in 34 subjects. Ombitasvir treatment-emergent variants M28T, M28V or 
Q30R in NS5A were observed in 32 subjects. Paritaprevir treatment-emergent variants V36A/M, 
R155K or D168V were observed in NS3 in 47 subjects.
NS3 variants V36A/M and R155K and NS5B variants M414T and S556G remained detectable at post-
treatment Week 48, whereas NS3 variant D168V and all other NS5B variants were not observed at 
post-treatment Week 48. All treatment-emergent variants in NS5A remained detectable at post-
treatment Week 48. Due to high SVR rates in genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent 
variants in this genotype could not be established.
The lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the 
resistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the 
emergence or persistence of virus containing dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir -
resistance-associated substitutions on future treatment is unknown.
36
Cross-resistance
Cross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside 
NS5B inhibitors by class. The impact of prior dasabuvir, ombitasvir, or paritaprevir treatment 
experience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors 
has not been studied.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy and safety of dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and 
without ribavirin was evaluated in eight Phase 3 clinical trials, including two trials exclusively in 
subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), in over 2,360 subjects with genotype 1 chronic 
hepatitis C infection as summarised in Table 6.

In all eight trials, the dasabuvir dose was 250 mg twice daily and the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
dose was 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily. For subjects who received ribavirin, the ribavirin dose 
37
was 1000 mg per day for subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg per day for subjects weighing 
greater than or equal to 75 kg.
Sustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to determine the HCV cure rate in the 
Phase 3 studies and was defined as unquantifiable or undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end 
of treatment (SVR12). Treatment duration was fixed in each trial and was not guided by subjects’ 
HCV RNA levels (no response guided algorithm). Plasma HCV RNA values were measured during 
the clinical trials using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure 
System (except GARNET which used COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test v2.0). The 
High Pure system assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL and the 
AmpliPrep assay had a LLOQ of 15 IU per mL.

Pooled analyses of clinical trials
Durability of response
Overall, 660 subjects in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials had HCV RNA results for both the SVR12 and 
SVR24 time points. Among these subjects, the positive predictive value of SVR12 on SVR24 was 
99.8%.
Pooled efficacy analysis
In Phase 3 clinical trials, 1075 subjects (including 181 with compensated cirrhosis) received the 
recommended regimen (see section 4.2). Table 16 shows SVR rates for these subjects.
In subjects who received the recommended regimen, 97% achieved SVR overall (among which 181
subjects with compensated cirrhosis achieved 97% SVR), while 0.5% experienced virologic 
breakthrough and 1.2% experienced post-treatment relapse.

Impact of ribavirin dose adjustment on probability of SVR
In Phase 3 clinical trials, 91.5% of subjects did not require ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy. 
In the 8.5% of subjects who had ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy, the SVR rate (98.5%) was 
comparable to subjects who maintained their starting ribavirin dose throughout treatment.
TURQUOISE-I: treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced with HCV GT1 or GT4/HIV-1 co-
infection, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
Design: 
Treatment: 
randomised, global multicentre, open-label
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir coadminstered with or 
without weight-based ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks 
See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. Subjects were on a 
stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that included ritonavir-boosted atazanavir or 
raltegravir, dolutegravir (Part 2 only), or darunavir (Part 1b and Part 2 GT4 only)-, co-administered 
with a backbone of tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine. Part 1 of the study was a Phase 2 pilot 
cohort consisting of 2 parts, Part 1a (63 subjects) and Part 1b (22 subjects). Part 2 was a Phase 3 
cohort consisting of 233 subjects.  
In Part 1a, all subjects received dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin for 12 or 
24 weeks.  Treated subjects (N = 63) had a median age of 51 years (range: 31 to 69); 24% were Black; 
19% had compensated cirrhosis; 67% were treatment-naïve; 33% had failed prior treatment with 
pegIFN/RBV; 89% had HCV genotype 1a infection.
In Part 1b, all subjects received dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin for 12 
weeks.  Treated subjects (N = 22) had a median age of 54 years (range: 34 to 68); 41% were Black; 
14% had compensated cirrhosis; 86% were HCV treatment-naïve; 14% had failed prior treatment with 
pegIFN/RBV; 68% had HCV genotype 1a infection.
44
In Part 2, subjects with HCV GT1 received dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or 
without ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks.  Subjects with HCV GT4 received 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 Weeks.  Treated subjects (N = 233) had a 
median age of 49 years (range: 26 to 69); 10% were Black; 12% had compensated cirrhosis; 66% were 
treatment-naïve; 32% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 2% had failed prior treatment with 
sofosbuvir.
Table 17 shows the primary efficacy analysis of SVR12 performed on subjects with HCV GT1/HIV-1 
co-infection that received recommended regimen in Part 2 of the TURQUOISE-I study.

a. Includes all HCV GT1 subjects in Part 2 excluding Arm G subjects that did not receive recommended 
regimen.
b. Includes subjects who discontinued due to adverse event, lost to follow-up or subject withdrawal, and 
subjects with reinfection 
Efficacy analyses performed on other parts of the study demonstrated similarly high SVR12 rates. In 
Part 1a, SVR12 was achieved by 29/31 (93.5%) subjects on the 12-week arm (95% CI: 79.3% –
98.2%) and by 29/32 (90.6%) subjects on the 24-week arm (95% CI: 75.8% – 96.8%). There was 1 
relapse in the 12-week arm and 1 on-treatment virologic failure in the 24-week arm. In Part 1b, 
SVR12 was achieved by 22/22 (100%) subjects (95% CI: 85.1%, 100%). In Part 2, SVR12 was 
achieved by 27/28 (96.4%) subjects with HCV GT4/HIV-1 coinfection (95% CI: 82.3%, 99.4%) with 
no virologic failures.
The SVR12 rates in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects were thus consistent with SVR12 rates in the 
phase 3 trials of HCV mono-infected subjects. 
CORAL-I: treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced, GT 1 or GT4 infected, at least 3 months 
post liver transplant or 12 months post renal transplant 
Design: 
Treatment: 
ribavirin (investigator chosen dose) for GT1 and GT4 infection
randomised, global multicentre, open-label
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12 or 24 weeks with or without 
In subjects with liver transplant, no cirrhosis and GT1 infection, patients were dosed with dasabuvir
and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12-24 weeks, with and without RBV. Liver transplant 
subjects with cirrhosis were dosed with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV 
(GT1a for 24 weeks [n=4], GT1b for 12 weeks [n=2]). Subjects with renal transplant and no cirrhosis 
were dosed for 12 weeks (with RBV for GT1a [n=9], without RBV for GT1b [n=3]). Subjects with 
liver transplant and GT4 infection were dosed with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV (non-
cirrhotic for 12 weeks [n=2] and cirrhotic for 24 weeks [n=1]. The dose of ribavirin was individualized 
at the discretion of the investigator, with most subjects receiving 600 to 800 mg as a starting dose, and 
most subjects also receiving 600 to 800 mg per day at the end of treatment.
45
A total of 129 subjects were treated, 84 with GT1a, 41 with GT1b, 1 with GT1 other, 3 with GT4 
infection. Overall, 61% had fibrosis stage F0-F1, 26% F2, 9% F3, and 4% F4.  61% had prior HCV 
treatment experience before transplant. For immunosuppressive medication, most subjects were taking 
tacrolimus (81%), with the remainder taking cyclosporine.
Among all GT1 subjects who were post liver transplant, 111/114 (97.4%) achieved SVR12; with 2 
relapsing post treatment and 1 breakthrough on treatment.  Among the GT1 subjects who were post 
renal transplant, 9/12 (75%) achieved SVR12; however, there were no virologic failures.  All 3 
(100%) subjects with GT 4 infection who were post liver transplant achieved SVR12
Clinical Trial in patients receiving chronic opioid substitution therapy
In a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single arm study, 38 treatment-naïve or pegIFN/RBV treatment 
experienced, non-cirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 infection who were on stable doses of methadone 
(N=19) or buprenorphine with or without naloxone (N=19) received 12 weeks of dasabuvir in 
combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Treated subjects had a median age of 
51 years (range: 26 to 64); 65.8% were male and 5.3% were Black. A majority (86.8%) had baseline 
HCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL and a majority (84.2%) had genotype 1a infection; 15.8% 
had portal fibrosis (F2) and 5.3% had bridging fibrosis (F3); and 94.7% were naïve to prior HCV 
treatment.
Overall, 37 (97.4%) of 38 subjects achieved SVR12. No subjects experienced on-treatment virologic 
failure or relapse. 
RUBY-I; treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV experienced with or without cirrhosis who have severe 
renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD)
Design: 
Treatment: 
multicentre, open-label
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without RBV for 12 or 24 
weeks
Severe renal impairment or ESRD includes CKD Stage 4 defined as eGFR <30-15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
CKD Stage 5 defined as <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or requiring haemodialysis. Treated subjects (N=68) had 
a median age of 58 years (range: 32-77 years); 83.8% were male; 58.8% were Black; 73.5% of 
subjects were infected with HCV GT1a; 75.0%% had Stage 5 CKD and 69.1% were on haemodialysis. 
Sixty four of 68 (94.1%) subjects achieved SVR12. One subject experienced relapse at Post-Treatment 
Week 4, 2 subjects prematurely discontinued study drug and 1 subject had missing SVR12 data.
See also Section 4.8 for discussion of safety information for RUBY-I.
In another open-label phase 3b study evaluating 12 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or 
without dasabuvir and without RBV in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive GT1a and GT4 patients with 
CKD stage 4 or 5 (Ruby II), the SVR12 rate was 94.4% (17/18), with no subjects experiencing on-
treatment virologic failure or relapse.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in 
the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of the combination of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir
have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Table 18 shows 
mean Cmax and AUC of dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir
25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily following multiple doses with food in healthy volunteers.

Cmax (ng/ml) (CV%)
AUC (ng*hr/ml) (CV%)
Absorption
Dasabuvir was absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of approximately 4 to 5 hours. 
Dasabuvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner and accumulation is minimal. 
Pharmacokinetic steady state for dasabuvir when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
is achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing.
Effects of food
Dasabuvir should be administered with food. All clinical trials with dasabuvir have been conducted 
following administration with food.
Food increased the exposure (AUC) of dasabuvir by up to 30% relative to the fasting state. The 
increase in exposure was similar regardless of meal type (e.g., high-fat versus moderate-fat) or calorie 
content (approximately 600 kcal versus approximately 1000 kcal). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir
should be taken with food without regard to fat or calorie content.
Distribution
Dasabuvir is highly bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human ranged 
from 0.5 to 0.7 indicating that dasabuvir was preferentially distributed in the plasma compartment of 
whole blood. Dasabuvir was greater than 99.5%, and M1 major metabolite of dasabuvir was 94.5% 
bound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.05 to 5 g/mL. At steady-state the 
exposures ratio of M1 to dasabuvir is approximately 0.6. Taking into account the protein binding and 
in vitro activity of M1 against HCV genotype 1, its contribution to efficacy is expected to be similar to 
that of dasabuvir. In addition, M1 is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP family and 
OCT1 and thus, the hepatocyte concentration and thereby contribution to efficacy, may be larger than 
dasabuvir. 
Biotransformation
Dasabuvir is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A. Following a 
400 mg 14C-dasabuvir dose in humans, unchanged dasabuvir was the major component (approximately 
60%) of drug related radioactivity in plasma. Seven metabolites were identified in plasma. The most 
abundant plasma metabolite was M1, which represented 21% of drug-related radioactivity (AUC) in 
circulation following single dose; it’s formed via oxidative metabolism predominantly by CYP2C8.
Elimination
47
Following dosing of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir, mean plasma half-life of 
dasabuvir was approximately 6 hours. Following a 400 mg 14C-dasabuvir dose, approximately 94% of 
the radioactivity was recovered in faeces with limited radioactivity (approximately 2%) in urine.
Unchanged dasabuvir accounted for 26.2% and M1 for 31.5% of the total dose in faeces. M1 is mainly 
cleared through direct biliary excretion with the contribution of UGT-mediated glucuronidation and, to 
a small extent, oxidative metabolism.
Dasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and is not expected to inhibit 
organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin 
extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations; therefore, dasabuvir
does not affect medicinal product transport by these proteins.
Special populations
Elderly
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, a 10 year increase 
or decrease in age from 54 years (median age in the Phase 3 studies) would results in <10% change in 
dasabuvir exposures. There is no pharmacokinetic information in patients >75 years.
Sex or body weight
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, female subjects 
would have approximately 14 to 30% higher dasabuvir exposures than male subjects. A 10 kg change 
in body weight from 76 kg (median weight in the Phase 3 studies) would result in <10% change in 
dasabuvir exposures.
Race or ethnicity
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, Asian subjects 
had 29% to 39% higher dasabuvir exposures than non-Asian subjects.
Renal impairment
Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, 
with dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (CrCl: 60 to 89 ml/min), moderate (CrCl: 
30 to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCl: 15 to 29 ml/min) renal impairment, relative to subjects with 
normal renal function.
In subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, dasabuvir mean AUC values were 21% 
higher, 37% higher and 50% higher, respectively. Dasabuvir M1 AUC values were 6% lower, 10% 
lower, and 13% lower, respectively. 
The changes in dasabuvir exposures in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment are 
not considered to be clinically significant. Limited data in patients with end-stage renal disease 
indicate no clinically significant changes in exposure also in this patient group. No dose adjustment of 
dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or end-stage-renal 
disease on dialysis (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Pharmacokinetics of the combination of dasabuvir 400 mg, with ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 
200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-
Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic 
function.
In subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, dasabuvir AUC values were 17% 
higher, 16% lower and 325% higher, respectively. The AUC values of dasabuvir M1 metabolite were 
unchanged, 57% lower, and 77% higher, respectively. Plasma protein binding of dasabuvir and its M1 
48
metabolite were not meaningfully different in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to normal 
control subjects (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in paediatric patients has not 
been investigated (see section 4.2).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Dasabuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, 
chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat micronucleus 
assays.
Dasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage tested 
(2 g/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir AUC exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in 
humans at the recommended dose of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily).
Similarly, dasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dose tested (800 
mg/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in humans at 
500 mg.
Dasabuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rodents and were not teratogenic 
in two species. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of offspring were 
reported. The highest dasabuvir dose tested produced exposures equal to 16 to 24-fold (rat) or 6-fold 
(rabbit) the exposures in humans at the maximum recommended clinical dose. 
Dasabuvir was the predominant component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without effect on 
nursing pups. Elimination half-life in rat milk was slightly shorter than in plasma, AUC was about 2 
fold of that in plasma. Since dasabuvir is a BCRP substrate, distribution to the milk may change if this 
transporter is inhibited or induced by co-administration of other medicinal products. Dasabuvir-
derived material was minimally transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats.

1. What Exviera is and what it is used for
Exviera contains the active substance dasabuvir. Exviera is an antiviral medicine used to treat adults 
with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis 
C virus). 
Exviera works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells, thus 
clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time.
Exviera tablets do not work on their own. They are always taken with another antiviral medicine
containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Some patients may also take an antiviral medicine called 
ribavirin. Your doctor will talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Exviera.
It is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you 
take with Exviera. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or 
pharmacist.
2. What you need to know before you take Exviera
Do not take Exviera:
 If you are allergic to dasabuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
 If you have moderate to severe liver problems other than hepatitis C.
 If you are taking any of the medicines listed in the following table. This is because serious or life-
threatening effects can occur when Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir are taken with 
these medicines. These medicines can affect the way Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
work and Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can affect the way these other medicines 
work.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Exviera if you:

you more closely.

your diabetes medicines after starting Exviera. Some diabetic patients have experienced low sugar 
levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like Exviera.
When taking Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, tell your doctor if you have the following

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Exviera.
Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including 
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly 
in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness or in patients taking ribavirin with 
this medicine. You or your caregiver should also immediately inform your doctor of any changes in 
behaviour or mood and of any suicidal thoughts you may have.
Blood tests
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Exviera. This is so that 
your doctor can:
 Decide what other medicines you should take with Exviera and for how long.
 Confirm if your treatment has worked and if you are free of the hepatitis C virus.
 Check for side effects of Exviera or other antiviral medicines your doctor has prescribed for you to 
use with Exviera (such as “ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir” and “ribavirin”).
Children and adolescents
Do not give Exviera to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Exviera in children 
and adolescents has not yet been studied.

Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Exviera during pregnancy are not known. Exviera should not be used during pregnancy 
or in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.
 You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. 
Contraceptive medicines that contains ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with 
Exviera. Ask your doctor about the best contraception for you.
63
Extra precautions are needed if Exviera is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe 
birth defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective 
contraception is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards.
 There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes 
pregnant. 
 There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female 
partner becomes pregnant. 
 Read the “Contraception” section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is 
important that both men and women read the information.
 If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Exviera and ribavirin or in the 
months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately.
Breastfeeding
You should not breastfeed during treatment with Exviera. It is not known whether the active substance 
in Exviera (dasabuvir), passes into breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Some  patients  have  reported  feeling  very  tired  when  taking  Exviera  with  other  medicines  for  their 
hepatitis C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use any machines.
Exviera contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.

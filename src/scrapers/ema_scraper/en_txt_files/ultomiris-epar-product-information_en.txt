CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with a body weight of 10 kg or 
above with PNH: 
- 
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity.  
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the 
past 6 months. 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with a body weight of 10 kg or 
above with aHUS who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at 
least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab. 
Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) 
Ultomiris is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG 
who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with NMOSD who are anti-aquaporin 4 
(AQP4) antibody-positive (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Ravulizumab must be administered by a healthcare professional and under the supervision of a 
physician experienced in the management of patients with haematological, renal, neuromuscular, or 
neuroinflammatory disorders. 
Posology 
Adult patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD 
The recommended dosing regimen consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, 
administered by intravenous infusion. The doses to be administered are based on the patient’s body 
weight, as shown in Table 1. For adult patients (≥ 18 years of age), maintenance doses should be 
administered at a once every 8-week interval, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. 
Dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary by ± 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for 
the first maintenance dose of ravulizumab), but the subsequent dose should be administered according 
to the original schedule.

The weight-based doses and dosing intervals for paediatric patients ≥ 10 kg to < 40 kg are shown in 
Table 3.  
For patients switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab, the loading dose of ravulizumab should be 
administered 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion, and then maintenance doses should be 
administered per weight-based dosing regimen shown in Table 3, starting 2 weeks after loading dose 
administration.

Ravulizumab has not been studied in paediatric patients with PNH who weigh less than 30 kg. The 
recommended posology for these patients is based on the posology used for paediatric patients with 
aHUS, on the basis of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data available in aHUS and 
PNH patients treated with ravulizumab. 
PNH is a chronic disease and treatment with ravulizumab is recommended to continue for the patient’s 
lifetime, unless the discontinuation of ravulizumab is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
In aHUS, ravulizumab treatment to resolve thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) manifestations should 
be for a minimum duration of 6 months, beyond which length of treatment needs to be considered for 
each patient individually. Patients who are at higher risk for TMA recurrence, as determined by the 
treating healthcare provider (or clinically indicated), may require chronic therapy (see section 4.4).

In adult patients with gMG or NMOSD, treatment with ravulizumab has only been studied in the 
setting of chronic administration (see section 4.4). 
Ravulizumab has not been studied in gMG patients with an MGFA Class V. 
Supplemental dosing following treatment with plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), or 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown 
to reduce ravulizumab serum levels. A supplemental dose of ravulizumab is required in the setting of 
PE, PP or IVIg (Table 4).

Treatment switch from ravulizumab intravenous formulation to ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation 
In the maintenance phase, adult patients with PNH or aHUS treated with ravulizumab intravenous 
formulation have the possibility to switch to ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation in agreement with 
their treating physician. For posology recommendations about the subcutaneous maintenance dose, see 
section 4.2 of Ultomiris solution for injection in cartridge summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
Treatment initiation instructions of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation in patients treated with 
ravulizumab intravenous formulation are shown in Table 5.

7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection at treatment initiation (see

Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive 
prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination (see 
section 4.4). 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serious meningococcal infection 
Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient's susceptibility to 
meningococcal infection/sepsis (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup 
may occur (see section 4.8). To reduce this risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against 
meningococcal infections at least two weeks prior to initiating ravulizumab unless the risk of delaying 
ravulizumab therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate 
ravulizumab treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine, must receive 
treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against 
serogroups A, C, Y, W135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly 
pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to 
current national guidelines for vaccination use. If the patient is being switched from eculizumab 
treatment, physicians should verify that meningococcal vaccination is current according to national 
guidelines for vaccination use. 
Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given 
to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious or fatal 
meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with ravulizumab and in 
patients treated with other terminal complement inhibitors. All patients should be monitored for early 
signs of meningococcal infection and sepsis, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and 
treated with appropriate antibiotics. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms and 
steps should be taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians should provide patients with a 
patient information brochure and a Patient card. 
Immunisation 
Prior to initiating ravulizumab therapy, it is recommended that patients initiate immunisations 
according to current immunisation guidelines.  
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated 
diseases may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying disease. Therefore, patients 
should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination.  
Patients below the age of 18 years old must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for 
each age group.  
Other systemic infections 
Ravulizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. 
Ravulizumab blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased 
susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria species and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal 
infections, have been reported. 
Patients should be provided with information from the Package Information Leaflet to increase their 
awareness of potential serious infections and their signs and symptoms. Physicians should advise 
patients about gonorrhoea prevention. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Administration of ravulizumab may result in systemic infusion-related reactions and allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (see section 4.8). 
In case of systemic infusion-related reaction, if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory 
compromise occur, administration of ravulizumab should be interrupted and appropriate supportive 
measures should be instituted. 
Treatment discontinuation for PNH 
If patients with PNH discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be closely monitored for 
signs and symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis, identified by elevated LDH (lactate 
dehydrogenase) levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or haemoglobin, or 
re-appearance of symptoms such as fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath 
(dyspnoea), major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. 
Any patient who discontinues ravulizumab should be monitored for at least 16 weeks to detect 
haemolysis and other reactions. If signs and symptoms of haemolysis occur after discontinuation, 
including elevated LDH, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab.  
Treatment discontinuation for aHUS 
There are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective observational 
study, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 13.5-fold 
higher rate of TMA recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced renal function compared to patients 
who continued treatment.  
If patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs 
and symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, monitoring may be insufficient to predict or 
prevent severe TMA complications. 
TMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: 
-  At least two of the following laboratory results observed concurrently: a decrease in platelet 
count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during 
ravulizumab treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to 
baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or 
more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment (results should be 
confirmed by a second measurement) 
any one of the following symptoms of TMA: a change in mental status or seizures or other 
extra-renal TMA manifestations including cardiovascular abnormalities, pericarditis, 
gastrointestinal symptoms/diarrhoea; or thrombosis. 
- 
If TMA complications occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, reinitiation of ravulizumab treatment 
should be considered, beginning with the loading dose and maintenance dose (see section 4.2). 
Treatment discontinuation for gMG 
Considering that gMG is a chronic disease, patients benefiting from ravulizumab treatment who 
discontinue treatment should be monitored for symptoms of the underlying disease. If symptoms of 
gMG occur after discontinuation, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment discontinuation for NMOSD 
Considering that NMOSD is a chronic disease, patients benefiting from ravulizumab treatment who 
discontinue treatment should be monitored for symptoms of NMOSD relapse. If symptoms of 
NMOSD relapse occur after discontinuation, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab. 
Switch from eculizumab to ravulizumab 
In gMG patients who are not responding to eculizumab approved dosing regimen, treatment with 
ravulizumab is not recommended. 
Sodium content 
Ultomiris 300 mg/3 mL and 1 100 mg/11 mL concentrates for solution for infusion  
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.18 g sodium per 72 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 9.1% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Ultomiris 300 mg/30 mL concentrate for solution for infusion  
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 2.65 g sodium per 720 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 133% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of ravulizumab on 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, ravulizumab may reduce the expected 
pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab. 
See section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, or IVIg treatment. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception methods during treatment and up 
to 8 months after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical data from the use of ravulizumab in pregnant women.  
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with ravulizumab (see section 5.3).  
Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice using the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1, 
which assessed effect of C5 blockade on the reproductive system. No specific test-article related 
reproductive toxicities were identified in these studies. Human IgG are known to cross the human 
placental barrier, and thus ravulizumab may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in the 
foetal circulation.  
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
In pregnant women the use of ravulizumab may be considered following an assessment of the risks 
and benefits.  
10 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ravulizumab is excreted into human milk. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology 
studies conducted in mice with the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1 identified no adverse effect to 
pups resulting from consuming milk from treated dams. 
A risk to infants cannot be excluded. 
Since many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk, and because of 
the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with ravulizumab and up to 8 months after treatment.  
Fertility 
No specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. 
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule 
(BB5.1) identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ultomiris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Meningococcal infection/sepsis/encephalitis 
Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. In clinical trials, < 1 
% of patients developed serious meningococcal infections while receiving treatment with 
ravulizumab; all were adult patients with PNH or NMOSD who had been vaccinated.  
Please refer to section 4.4 for information on prevention and treatment of suspected meningococcal 
infection. In patients treated with ravulizumab, meningococcal infections have presented as 
meningococcal sepsis and encephalitis meningococcal. Patients should be informed of the signs and 
symptoms of meningococcal infection and advised to seek medical care immediately. 
Infusion-related reactions 
In clinical trials, infusion-related reactions were common (≥1%). These events, which were mild to 
moderate in severity and transient, included back pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, drop in blood 
pressure, elevation in blood pressure, rigors, limb discomfort, drug hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), 
dysgeusia (bad taste), and drowsiness. These reactions did not require discontinuation of ravulizumab.

Immunogenicity 
In adult PNH patient studies (N = 475), a paediatric PNH study (N = 13), aHUS studies (N = 89), a 
gMG study (N = 86), and an NMOSD study (N = 58), 2 (0.3%) cases of development of treatment-
emergent anti-drug antibody have been reported with ravulizumab (1 adult patient with PNH and 1 
adult patient with aHUS). These anti-drug antibodies were transient in nature with low titre and did 
not correlate with clinical response or adverse events. 
Paediatric population 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
In paediatric PNH patients (aged 9 to 17 years old) enrolled in the paediatric PNH Study 
(ALXN1210-PNH-304), the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult PNH patients. 
The most common adverse reactions reported in paediatric PNH patients were abdominal pain and 
nasopharyngitis, which occurred in 2 patients (15.4%).  
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) 
In paediatric patients with evidence of aHUS (aged 10 months to less than 18 years) included in 
ALXN1210-aHUS-312 study, the safety profile of ravulizumab appeared similar to that observed in 
adult patients with evidence of aHUS. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age 
appear similar. The safety data for patient below 2 years of age is limited to four patients. The most 
common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was pyrexia (32.3%). 
Generalised Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) 
Ravulizumab has not been studied in paediatric patients with gMG. 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) 
Ravulizumab has not been studied in paediatric patients with NMOSD. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be 
instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA43 
Mechanism of action 
Ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody IgG2/4K that specifically binds to the complement protein C5, 
thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating 
subunit of the membrane attack complex [MAC or C5b-9]) and preventing the generation of the 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C5b-9. Ravulizumab preserves the early components of complement activation that are essential for 
opsonisation of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Following ravulizumab treatment in both adult and paediatric complement inhibitor-naïve patients and 
eculizumab-experienced patients with PNH in Phase 3 studies, immediate, complete and sustained 
inhibition of serum free C5 (concentration of < 0.5 µg/mL) was observed by the end of the first 
infusion and sustained throughout the entire 26-week treatment period in all patients. Immediate and 
complete inhibition of serum free C5 was also observed in adult and paediatric patients with aHUS, in 
adult patients with gMG, and in adult patients with NMOSD by the end of the first infusion and 
throughout the primary treatment period. 
The extent and duration of the pharmacodynamic response in patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, or 
NMOSD were exposure dependent for ravulizumab. Free C5 levels less than 0.5 µg/mL were 
correlated with maximal intravascular haemolysis control and complete terminal complement 
inhibition. In gMG, terminal complement activation leads to MAC deposition at the neuromuscular 
junction and impairment of neuromuscular transmission. In NMOSD, terminal complement activation 
leads to MAC formation and C5a-dependent inflammation, astrocyte necrosis, and damage to 
surrounding glial cells and neurons. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in adult patients with PNH were assessed in two open-label, 
randomised, active-controlled Phase 3 trials:  
- 
a complement inhibitor-naïve study in adult patients with PNH who were naïve to complement 
inhibitor treatment, 
an eculizumab-experienced study in adult patients with PNH who were clinically stable after 
having been treated with eculizumab for at least the previous 6 months. 
- 
Ravulizumab was dosed in accordance with the recommended dosing described in section 4.2 
(4 infusions of ravulizumab over 26 weeks) while eculizumab was administered according to the 
approved dosing regimen of eculizumab of 600 mg every week for the first 4 weeks and 900 mg every 
2 weeks (15 infusions over 26 weeks). 
Patients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment 
with ravulizumab or eculizumab or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 
2 weeks after vaccination.  
There were no noteworthy differences in the demographic or baseline characteristics between the 
ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups in either of the Phase 3 studies. The 12-month 
transfusion history was similar between ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups within each of 
the Phase 3 studies.  
Study in complement inhibitor-naïve adult patients with PNH (ALXN1210-PNH-301) 
The complement inhibitor-naïve study was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label, randomised, 
active-controlled, Phase 3 study conducted in 246 patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor 
treatment prior to study entry. Eligible patients to enter this trial had to demonstrate high disease 
activity, defined as LDH level ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening along with the 
presence of 1 or more of the following PNH-related signs or symptoms within 3 months of screening: 
fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia 
(haemoglobin < 10 g/dL), history of a major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, 
or erectile dysfunction; or history of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion due to PNH. 
More than 80 % of patients in both treatment groups had a history of transfusion within 12 months of 
study entry. The majority of the complement inhibitor-naïve study population was highly haemolytic 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at baseline; 86.2 % of enrolled patients presented with elevated LDH ≥ 3 × ULN, which is a direct 
measurement of intravascular haemolysis, in the setting of PNH.  
Table 11 presents the baseline characteristics of the PNH patients enrolled in the complement 
inhibitor-naïve study, with no apparent clinically meaningful differences observed between the 
treatment arms.

b “Other” as specified on case report form included thrombocytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and pancytopenia, 
as well as a number of other conditions. 
The coprimary endpoints were transfusion avoidance, and haemolysis as directly measured by 
normalisation of LDH levels (LDH levels ≤ 1 × ULN; the ULN for LDH is 246 U/L). Key secondary 
endpoints included the percent change from baseline in LDH levels, change in quality of life 
(FACIT-Fatigue), the proportion of patients with breakthrough haemolysis and proportion of patients 
with stabilised haemoglobin.  
Ravulizumab was non-inferior compared to eculizumab for both coprimary endpoints, avoidance of 
pRBC transfusion per protocol-specified guidelines and LDH normalisation from day 29 to day 183, 
and for all 4 key secondary endpoints (Figure 1).

Study in adult PNH patients previously treated with eculizumab (ALXN1210-PNH-302) 
The eculizumab-experienced study was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label, randomised, 
active-controlled Phase 3 study conducted in 195 patients with PNH who were clinically stable 
(LDH ≤ 1.5 x ULN) after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months.  
PNH medical history was similar between ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups. The 
12-month transfusion history was similar between ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups and 
more than 87 % of patients in both treatment groups had not received a transfusion within 12 months 
of study entry. The mean total PNH RBC clone size was 60.05 %, mean total PNH granulocyte clone 
size was 83.30 %, and the mean total PNH monocyte clone size was 85.86 %.

The final efficacy analysis for the study included all patients ever treated with ravulizumab (n=192) 
and had a median treatment duration of 968 days. The final analysis confirmed that ravulizumab 
treatment responses observed during the Primary Evaluation Period were maintained throughout the 
duration of the study. 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) 
Study in adult patients with aHUS (ALXN1210-aHUS-311) 
The adult study was a multicentre, single arm, Phase 3 study conducted in patients with documented 
aHUS who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment prior to study entry and had evidence of 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). The study consisted of a 26-week initial evaluation period and 
patients were allowed to enter an extension period for up to 4.5 years.  
A total of 58 patients with documented aHUS were enrolled. Enrolment criteria excluded patients 
presenting with TMA due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or Shiga toxin Escherichia 
coli related haemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Two patients were excluded from the full 
analysis set due to a confirmed diagnosis of STEC-HUS. Ninety-three percent of patients had extra 
renal signs (cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, skin, skeletal muscle) 
or symptoms of aHUS at baseline.  
Table 13 presents the demographics and baseline characteristics of the 56 adult patients enrolled in 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 that constituted the full analysis set.

Complete TMA Response criteria at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, 
and any measurement in between.  
Complete TMA Response was observed in 30 of the 56 patients (53.6%) during the 26-week initial 
evaluation period as shown in Table 14.

Four additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that was confirmed after the 26-week initial 
evaluation period (with a Complete TMA Response occurring at Days 169, 302, 401 and 407). 
resulting in an overall Complete TMA Response in 34 of 56 patients (60.7%; 95% CI: 47.0%, 74.4%). 
Individual component response increased to 48 (85.7%; 95% CI: 75.7%, 95.8%) patients for platelet 
count normalisation, 47 (83.9%; 95% CI: 73.4%, 94.4%) patients for LDH normalisation, and 35 
(62.5%; 95% CI: 48.9%, 76.1%) patients for renal function improvement.

Complete TMA Response was achieved at a median time of 86 days (7 to 169 days). An increase in 
mean platelet count was observed rapidly after commencement of ravulizumab, increasing from 
118.52 × 109/L at baseline to 240.34 × 109/L at Day 8 and remaining above 227 × 109/L at all 
subsequent visits in the initial evaluation period (26 weeks). Similarly, mean LDH value decreased 
from baseline over the first 2 months of treatment and was sustained over the duration of the initial 
evaluation period (26 weeks).  
Of the patients who presented at CKD Stage 5, 67.6% (23/34) showed an improvement of 1 or more 
CKD Stages. Chronic kidney disease stage continued to improve for many patients (19/30) after 
achieving Complete TMA Response during the 26-week initial evaluation period. 17 of the 29 patients 
who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis by the end of the available 
follow-up while 6 of 27 patients who were off dialysis at baseline were on dialysis at last available 
follow-up. Table 15 summarises the secondary efficacy outcomes for Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311.

Generalised Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) 
Study in adult patients with gMG 
The efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with gMG was assessed in a Phase 3, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (ALXN1210-MG-306). Patients 
participating in this study were subsequently allowed to enter an Open-Label Extension Period during 
which all patients received ravulizumab.

Patients with gMG (diagnosed for at least 6 months) with a positive serologic test for anti-
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MGFA (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) 
clinical classification Class II to IV and remaining symptomatology as evidenced by a Myasthenia 
Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score ≥ 6 were randomised to receive either 
ravulizumab (N = 86) or placebo (N = 89). Patients on immunosuppressant therapies (corticosteroids, 
azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus) 
were permitted to continue on therapy throughout the course of the study. In addition, rescue therapy 
(including high dose corticosteroid, PE/PP, or IVIg) was allowed if a patient experienced clinical 
deterioration, as defined by the study protocol. 
A total of 162 (92.6%) patients completed the 26-week Randomised-Controlled Period of Study 
ALXN1210-MG-306. The baseline characteristics of patients are presented in Table 16. The majority 
(97%) of patients included in the study had been treated with at least one immunomodulatory therapy 
including immunosuppressant therapies, PE/PP, or IVIg in the last two years prior to enrolment.

In patients who initially received ULTOMIRIS during the Randomised-Controlled Period and 
continued to receive ULTOMIRIS during the first 34-weeks of the Open-Label Extension Period, the 
treatment effect was sustained (Figure 3). In patients who initially received placebo during the 26-
week Randomised-Controlled Period and initiated treatment with ULTOMIRIS during the Open-Label

In the Open-Label Extension Period of the study, clinicians had the option to adjust 
immunosuppressant therapies. In patients followed for 34 weeks in the Open-Label Extension Period, 
28.0% of patients decreased their daily dose of corticosteroid therapy and 6.2% of patients stopped 
corticosteroid therapy. The most common reason for change in corticosteroid therapies was 
improvement in MG symptoms while on ravulizumab treatment. 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) 
Study in adult patients with NMOSD 
The efficacy of ravulizumab in adult patients with anti-AQP4 antibody-positive NMOSD was assessed 
in a global, open-label clinical study (ALXN1210-NMO-307). 
Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 enrolled 58 adult patients with NMOSD who had a positive serologic 
test for anti-AQP4 antibodies, at least 1 relapse in the last 12 months prior to the Screening Period, and 
an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤ 7. Prior treatment with immunosuppressant 
therapies (ISTs) was not required for enrolment and 51.7% of patients were on ravulizumab 
monotherapy. Patients on selected ISTs (ie, corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, 
tacrolimus) were permitted to continue on therapy in combination with ravulizumab, with a 
requirement for stable dosing until they reached Week 106 in the study. In addition, acute therapy for 
relapse treatment (including high-dose corticosteroids, PE/PP, and IVIg) was allowed if a patient 
experienced a relapse during the study. 
Patients included in the study had a mean age of 47.4 years (ranging from 18 to 74 years) and most of 
them were female (90%). Median age at NMOSD initial clinical presentation was of 42.5 years, 
ranging from 16 to 73 years. Baseline disease characteristics are shown in Table 19.

The primary endpoint of Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 was the time to first adjudicated on-trial 
relapse as determined by an independent adjudication committee. No adjudicated on-trial relapse was 
observed in ravulizumab-treated patients during the Primary Treatment Period. All ravulizumab-
treated patients remained relapse free over the median follow-up of 90.93 weeks. Ravulizumab-treated 
patients experienced consistent relapse-free primary endpoint result with or without concomitant IST 
treatment.

Paediatric population 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
Study in paediatric patients with PNH (ALXN1210-PNH-304) 
The paediatric study (ALXN1210-PNH-304) is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 3 study conducted in 
eculizumab-experienced and complement inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients with PNH.  
From interim results, a total of 13 PNH paediatric patients completed ravulizumab treatment during 
the primary evaluation period (26 weeks) of Study ALXN1210-PNH-304. Five of the 13 patients had 
never been treated with a complement inhibitor and 8 patients received treatment with eculizumab 
prior to study entry.  
Most of the patients were between 12 years and 17 years of age at first infusion (mean: 14.4 years), 
with 2 patients under 12 years old (11 years and 9 years old). Eight of the 13 patients were female. 
Mean weight at baseline was 56 kg, ranging from 37 to 72 kg. Table 20 presents the baseline disease 
history and characteristics of the paediatric patients enrolled in Study ALXN1210-PNH-304.

Based on body weight, patients received a loading dose of ravulizumab on Day 1, followed by 
maintenance treatment on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter for patients weighing 
≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg. For patients who entered the 
study on eculizumab therapy, Day 1 of study treatment was planned to occur 2 weeks from the 
patient’s last dose of eculizumab.  
The weight-based dose regimen of ravulizumab provided immediate, complete, and sustained 
inhibition of terminal complement throughout the 26-week primary evaluation period regardless of 
prior experience with eculizumab. Following initiation of ravulizumab treatment, steady-state 
therapeutic serum concentrations of ravulizumab were achieved immediately after the first dose and 
maintained throughout the 26-week primary evaluation period in both cohorts. There were no 
breakthrough haemolysis events in the study and no patients had post-baseline free C5 levels above 
0.5 µg/mL. Mean percent change from baseline in LDH was -47.91% on Day 183 in the complement 
inhibitor-naïve cohort and remained stable in the eculizumab-experienced cohort during the 26-week 
primary evaluation period. Sixty percent (3/5) of complement inhibitor-naïve patients and 75% (6/8) 
of eculizumab-experienced patients achieved haemoglobin stabilisation by Week 26 respectively. 
Transfusion-avoidance was reached by 84.6% (11/13) of patients during the 26-week primary 
evaluation period. 
These interim efficacy results are presented in Table 21 below.

Based on data from these interim results, the efficacy of ravulizumab in paediatric PNH patients 
appears to be similar to that observed in adult PNH patients. 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) 
Use  of  Ultomiris  in  paediatric  patients  for  treatment  of  aHUS  is  supported  by  evidence  from  one 
paediatric clinical study (a total of 31 patients with documented aHUS were enrolled; 28 patients aged 
10 months to 17 years were included in the full analysis set).  
Study in paediatric patients with aHUS (ALXN1210 aHUS 312) 
The paediatric study is a 26-week ongoing, multicentre, single arm, Phase 3 study conducted in 
paediatric patients. 
A total of 21 eculizumab-naïve patients with documented diagnosis of aHUS and evidence of TMA 
were enrolled, of which 18 were included in the Full Analysis set. Enrolment criteria excluded patients 
presenting with TMA due to TTP and STEC-HUS. Two patients were given a single dose, and one 
patient received 2 doses, but then discontinued and were excluded from the full analysis set because 
aHUS was not confirmed. The overall mean weight at baseline was 22.2 kg; majority of the patients 
were in the baseline weight category ≥ 10 to < 20 kg. The majority of patients (72.2%) had 
pretreatment extra renal signs (cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, 
skin, skeletal muscle) or symptoms of aHUS at baseline. At baseline, 33.3% (n = 6) of patients had 
CKD Stage 5.  
A total of 10 patients, who switched from eculizumab to ravulizumab, had documented diagnosis of 
aHUS and evidence of TMA were enrolled. Patients had to have clinical response to eculizumab prior 
to enrolment (i.e. LDH < 1.5 X ULN and platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL, and eGFR 
> 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Consequently, there is no information on the use of ravulizumab in patient 
refractory to eculizumab.

ALXN1210-aHUS-312.

Complete TMA Response during the initial evaluation period was achieved at a median time of 
30 days (15 to 97 days). All patients with Complete TMA Response maintained it through the initial 
evaluation period with continuous improvements seen in renal function. An increase in mean platelet 
count was observed rapidly after commencement of ravulizumab, increasing from 60.50 × 109/L at 
baseline to 296.67 × 109/L at Day 8 and remained above 296 × 109/L at all subsequent visits in the

component response increased to 17 of 18 (94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for platelet count 
normalisation, 17 of 18 (94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for LDH normalisation, and 17 of 18 
(94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for renal function improvement.  
All 6 of the patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis; 5 of which 
had already done so by Day 43. No patient started dialysis during the study. The majority of the 
patient population (15/17), improved by 1 or more CKD stages by Day 183; 14 patients improved by 2 
or more stages. Table 24 summarises the secondary efficacy results for Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312.

In eculizumab-experienced patients, switching to ravulizumab maintained disease control as evidenced 
by stable hematologic and renal parameters, with no apparent impact on safety. 
The efficacy of ravulizumab for the treatment of aHUS appears similar in paediatric and adult patients. 
Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG)  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ultomiris in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 
See 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ultomiris in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of NMOSD. See 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Because the route of ravulizumab administration is an intravenous infusion and the dosage form is a 
solution, 100 % of the administered dose is considered bioavailable. The time to maximum observed 
concentration (tmax) is expected at the end of infusion (EOI) or soon after EOI. Therapeutic 
steady-state drug concentrations are reached after the first dose.  
Distribution 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) central volume and volume of distribution at steady state for adult 
and paediatric patients with PNH or aHUS and adult patients with gMG or NMOSD are presented in 
Table 25.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
As an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolised 
in the same manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via 
catabolic pathways) and is subject to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring 
amino acids and has no known active metabolites. The mean (SD) values for terminal elimination half-
life and clearance of ravulizumab in adult and paediatric patients with PNH, adult and paediatric 
patients with aHUS, and adult patients with gMG or NMOSD are presented in Table 25.

Linearity/non-linearity 
Over the studied dose and regimen range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear 
pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Special populations 
Weight 
Body weight is a significant covariate in patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD resulting in 
lower exposures in heavier patients. Weight-based dosing is proposed in section 4.2, Table 1, Table 3 
and Table 4.  
No formal trial of the effect of sex, race, age (geriatric), hepatic or renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab was conducted. However, based on population-PK assessment no 
impact of sex, age, race and hepatic or renal function on ravulizumab PK was identified in the studied 
healthy volunteers, subjects and patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD, and as a result, no 
dosing adjustment is considered necessary. 
The pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab have been studied in aHUS patients with a range of renal 
impairment including patients receiving dialysis. There have been no observed differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters noted in these subpopulations of patients including patients with 
proteinuria.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Animal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with ravulizumab but were 
conducted in mice with a murine surrogate complement inhibitory antibody, BB5.1. No clear 
treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in the murine surrogate reproductive 
toxicology studies in mice. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, 
two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring 
born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum 
recommended human ravulizumab dose, based on a body weight comparison); however, the exposure 
did not increase foetal loss or neonatal death. 
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 
ravulizumab. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on nonclinical studies using a murine 
surrogate molecule, BB5.1, in mice.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH): 
- 
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 
6 months.  
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 
months and have evidence of response to eculizumab.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Ravulizumab solution for injection is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a 
physician experienced in the management of patients with haematological or renal disorders. 
Posology 
Adult patients with PNH and aHUS 
Ravulizumab intravenous formulation loading dose  
For complement-inhibitor treatment-naïve patients or patients switching treatment from eculizumab, a 
weight-based loading dose using ravulizumab intravenous formulation is required prior to the 
initiation of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation maintenance therapy. For weight-based dosing 
information for the intravenous loading dose, see section 4.2 of the Ultomiris concentrate for solution 
for infusion summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

Ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation maintenance doses 
The recommended maintenance dose in adult patients with PNH or aHUS with a body weight greater 
than or equal to 40 kg is 490 mg, administered once weekly, starting 2 weeks after loading dose.  
The dosing schedule of ravulizumab solution for injection is allowed to occasionally vary by ± 1 day 
of the scheduled dose day but the subsequent dose should be administered according to the original 
schedule.  
Treatment initiation instructions in patients who are complement-inhibitor treatment-naïve or 
switching treatment from ravulizumab intravenous formulation or eculizumab are shown in Table 1.

PNH is a chronic disease and treatment with ravulizumab is recommended to continue for the patient’s 
lifetime, unless the discontinuation of ravulizumab is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
In aHUS, ravulizumab treatment to resolve thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) manifestations should 
be for a minimum duration of 6 months, beyond which length of treatment needs to be considered for 
each patient individually. Patients who are at higher risk for TMA recurrence, as determined by the 
treating healthcare provider (or clinically indicated), may require chronic therapy (see section 4.4). 
Treatment switch from ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation to ravulizumab intravenous formulation 
Patients treated with ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation maintenance treatment have the 
possibility to switch to ravulizumab intravenous formulation in agreement with their treating 
physician. See Ultomiris concentrates for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) for further details. 
Treatment initiation instructions of ravulizumab intravenous formulation in patients treated with 
ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation are shown in Table 2.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence 
indicating any special precautions are required for treating a geriatric population – although 
experience with ravulizumab in elderly patients is limited.  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; 
however pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation in children below 18 years of age 
have not been established. No data are available. Ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation should not 
be used in children below 18 years of age. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous injection. 
Ravulizumab solution for injection may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver or 
healthcare professional after appropriate training. 
The solution for injection in cartridge is administered with single-use on-body injectors. 
This medicinal product is for subcutaneous administration into the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of the 
upper arm region. Injection sites should be rotated, and injections should not be given into areas where 
the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. 
The 490 mg dose of ravulizumab is delivered using two on-body delivery systems. Each on-body 
delivery system consists of one on-body injector and one pre-filled cartridge containing 245 mg of 
ravulizumab. The two on-body delivery systems can be administered concurrently or sequentially. 
Each injection is delivered in approximately 10 minutes. 
Each pre-filled cartridge and on-body injector of Ultomiris is intended for single use only. 
Ravulizumab solution for injection in cartridge is not intended for intravenous administration. 
Ultomiris 245 mg solution for injection in cartridge does not require dilution prior to administration. 
Detailed instructions for administration: 
1.  Remove two cartons from the refrigerator. Two on-body injectors and two cartridges are required 
2. 
for a full dose. 
Inspect the packaging. The on-body injectors or cartridges should not be used if they have been 
dropped or appear to be broken or damaged. 
3.  Wait at least 45 minutes for the on-body injectors and pre-filled cartridges in the cartons to 
naturally reach room temperature. Do not return to the refrigerator. Discard after 3 days at room 
temperature (20°C - 25°C). 
4.  Before administration, visually inspect the solution. The solution should not be injected if it 
contains flakes or particles or is cloudy or discoloured.  
5.  Load the first clean cartridge into the first on-body injector and secure in place before closing the 
cartridge door on the injector. Do not insert the cartridge more than 5 minutes before the injection 
to avoid drying out the solution.  
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.  Peel away the adhesive backing of the first on-body injector and apply the on-body injector onto 
the clean, dry, chosen injection site(s) (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). 
7.  Start the injection by firmly pressing and releasing the blue start button. 
8.  Repeat for the second on-body injector.  
9.  Do not remove until the injection is complete (signalled by the green status light, 3 beeping 
sounds, and the white plunger filling the medicine window).  
For detailed instructions on how to use the on-body injector, see the instructions for use provided with 
the on-body injector. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection at treatment initiation (see section 4.4). 
Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive 
prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serious meningococcal infection 
Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient's susceptibility to 
meningococcal infection/sepsis (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup 
may occur. To reduce this risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal 
infections at least two weeks prior to initiating ravulizumab unless the risk of delaying ravulizumab 
therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate ravulizumab 
treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with 
appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serogroups A, C, 
Y, W135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic 
meningococcal serogroups. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national 
guidelines for vaccination use. If the patient is being switched from eculizumab treatment, physicians 
should verify that meningococcal vaccination is current according to national guidelines for 
vaccination use. 
Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given 
to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious or fatal 
meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with ravulizumab and in 
patients treated with other terminal complement inhibitors. All patients should be monitored for early 
signs of meningococcal infection and sepsis, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and 
treated with appropriate antibiotics. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms and 
steps should be taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians should provide patients with a 
patient information brochure and a Patient card. 
Immunisation 
Prior to initiating ravulizumab therapy, it is recommended that PNH and aHUS patients initiate 
immunisations according to current immunisation guidelines.  
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated 
diseases, may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying disease, such as 
haemolysis. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after recommended 
vaccination. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other systemic infections 
Ravulizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. 
Ravulizumab blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased 
susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria species and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections 
with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal 
infections, have been reported. 
Patients should be provided with information (e.g. Package Leaflet) to increase their awareness of 
potential serious infections and their signs and symptoms. Physicians should advise patients about 
gonorrhoea prevention.  
Infusion-related reactions 
Administration of ravulizumab may result in systemic infusion-related reactions and allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (see section 4.8).  
In case of a systemic infusion-related reaction if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory 
compromise occur, administration of ravulizumab should be interrupted and appropriate supportive 
measures should be instituted.  
Allergies to acrylic adhesives 
The on-body injector of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation uses acrylic adhesive. For patients 
with a known allergy to acrylics adhesive, use of this product may result in an allergic reaction. 
Premedication can be considered and/or supportive measures should be instituted if signs of allergy 
appear. 
Treatment discontinuation for PNH 
If patients with PNH discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be closely monitored for 
signs and symptoms of haemolysis, identified by elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels along 
with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or haemoglobin, or re-appearance of symptoms such as 
fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), major adverse vascular 
event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Any patient who discontinues 
ravulizumab should be monitored for at least 16 weeks to detect haemolysis and other reactions. If 
signs and symptoms of haemolysis occur after discontinuation, including elevated LDH, consider 
restarting treatment with ravulizumab. 
Treatment discontinuation for aHUS 
There are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective observational 
study, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 13.5-fold 
higher rate of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced 
renal function compared to patients who continued treatment.  
If patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs 
and symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, monitoring may be insufficient to predict or 
prevent severe TMA complications. 
TMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: 
- 
At least two of the following laboratory results observed concurrently: a decrease in platelet 
count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during 
ravulizumab treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline 
or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment; (results should be confirmed by 
a second measurement). 
any one of the following symptoms of TMA: a change in mental status or seizures or other extra 
renal TMA manifestations including cardiovascular abnormalities, pericarditis, gastrointestinal 
symptoms/diarrhoea; or thrombosis. 
If TMA complications occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, reinitiation of ravulizumab should be 
considered, beginning with the loading dose and maintenance dose described in section 4.2. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
Chronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and 
thereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception methods during treatment and up 
to 8 months after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical data from the use of ravulizumab in pregnant women.  
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with ravulizumab (see section 5.3). 
Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice using the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1, 
which assessed effect of C5 blockade on the reproductive system. No specific test-article related 
reproductive toxicities were identified in these studies. Human IgG are known to cross the human 
placental barrier, and thus ravulizumab may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in foetal 
circulation. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
In pregnant women the use of ravulizumab may be considered following an assessment of the risks 
and benefits. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ravulizumab is excreted into human milk. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology 
studies conducted in mice with the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1 identified no adverse effect to 
pups resulting from consuming milk from treated dams.  
A risk to infants cannot be excluded.  
Since many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk, and because of 
the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with ravulizumab and up to 8 months after treatment. 
Fertility 
No specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule 
(BB5.1) identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ravulizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions with ravulizumab intravenous or subcutaneous formulation are 
headache (28.3%), injection site reactions (25%), nasopharyngitis (19.8%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (18.1%), pyrexia (15.6%), diarrhoea (15.2%), nausea (13.2%), abdominal pain (12.2%), 
fatigue (11.2%), arthralgia (11.0%), and back pain (10.3%). The most serious adverse reactions in 
patients are meningococcal infection (0.3%) and meningococcal sepsis (0.1%). 
The safety profile of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation appeared similar to ravulizumab 
intravenous formulation.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Meningococcal infections/sepsis 
Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. In clinical studies, 
0.4% of the patients developed serious meningococcal infections/sepsis while receiving treatment with 
ravulizumab. All were adult patients with PNH who had been vaccinated. All patients recovered while 
continuing treatment with ravulizumab. Please refer to section 4.4 for information on prevention and 
treatment of suspected meningococcal infection. In patients treated with ravulizumab, meningococcal 
infections presented as meningococcal sepsis. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms 
of meningococcal septicaemia and advised to seek medical care immediately. 
Infusion-related reactions 
In clinical trials, infusion-related reactions were common (≥1%). They were mild to moderate in 
severity and transient (e.g., lower back pain, drop in blood pressure, elevation in blood pressure, limb 
discomfort, drug hypersensitivity [allergic reaction], dysgeusia [bad taste], and drowsiness). These 
reactions did not require discontinuation of Ultomiris. 
Immunogenicity 
In adult PNH patient studies (N = 475), paediatric PNH study (N=13), aHUS studies (N = 89), 2 
(0.3%) cases of development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies have been reported with 
ravulizumab IV (1 adult patient with PNH and 1 adult patient with aHUS). These anti-drug antibodies 
were transient in nature with low titre and did not correlate with clinical response or adverse events. 
In the ravulizumab subcutaneous study in PNH (N=128), no treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies 
were observed.  
Injection site reactions 
In clinical trials for PNH with subcutaneous administration of ravulizumab via the on-body-injector, 
local injection site reactions were reported in 25% of the participants. Injection site reactions included 
erythema, rash, swelling, pruritus, ecchymosis, pain, haematoma, induration, bruise, urticaria, and 
inflammation at the injection site. These reactions were mild in severity and transient and did not 
require discontinuation of ravulizumab. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation in children below 18 years of age 
have not been established. No data are available.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their injection and be closely 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be 
instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA43 
Mechanism of action 
Ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody IgG2/4K that specifically binds to the complement protein C5, 
thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating 
subunit of the membrane attack complex [MAC or C5b-9]) and preventing the generation of the C5b-
9. Ravulizumab preserves the early components of complement activation that are essential for 
opsonisation of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Following ravulizumab subcutaneous treatment, immediate and complete terminal complement 
inhibition was observed in adult eculizumab-experienced patients with PNH by the end of the first 
dose and was sustained throughout the 1-year treatment period. 
The PD results following ravulizumab SC treatment are consistent with prior results in PNH and 
aHUS adult patients treated with ravulizumab IV. 
The extent and duration of the pharmacodynamic response were exposure-dependent in patients with 
PNH, or aHUS following ravulizumab treatment. Free C5 levels of < 0.5 µg/mL were correlated with 
maximal intravascular haemolysis control and complete terminal complement inhibition. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Subcutaneous formulation 
Study of subcutaneous administration in adult patients with PNH (ALXN1210-PNH-303) 
Subcutaneous administration of ravulizumab was assessed in a multi-centre, randomized, open-label, 
Phase 3 study conducted in adult patients with PNH who were clinically stable (LDH ≤1.5x ULN) 
after having been treated with eculizumab for at least three months prior to study entry. The study 
enrolled 136 patients, of which 129 patients were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. The 
main outcome measure of Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 was the non-inferiority of Ctrough of 
ravulizumab when administered subcutaneously (SC) via an on-body injector compared to 
ravulizumab administered intravenously (IV). The study was designed to bridge efficacy and safety 
data from ravulizumab intravenous to ravulizumab subcutaneous administration. 
Patients who completed the 10-week randomized treatment period are followed for up to 172 weeks in 
the long-term Extension Period. During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients were stratified by 
weight group (≥ 40 kg to < 60 kg and ≥ 60 kg to < 100 kg) and randomized 2:1 to receive ravulizumab 
subcutaneous formulation or intravenous formulation. On Day 1, all patients received a weight-based 
ravulizumab intravenous loading dose. On Day 15, patients randomized to the ravulizumab 
subcutaneous formulation group received once weekly maintenance subcutaneous doses (490 mg), 
while patients randomized to the ravulizumab intravenous formulation group received the approved 
weight-based intravenous maintenance dose. Following the Randomized Treatment Period (on Day 
71), patients who were randomized to the intravenous formulation group switched to receive 490 mg 
of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation weekly through the end of the Extension Period.

The mean total PNH RBC clone size was 48.35%, with a mean total PNH granulocyte clone size of 
77.22% and a mean total PNH monocyte clone size of 80.18% at baseline. Ninety two percent of the 
patients had documented PNH-associated conditions that were diagnosed prior to informed consent. 
Overall, the disease history and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment 
groups. Table 4 presents the baseline characteristics of the PNH patients enrolled in Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-303.

a Breakthrough haemolysis (BTH) is defined as at least 1 new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular 
haemolysis (fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath [dyspnoea], anaemia [haemoglobin < 
10 g/dL], MAVE including thrombosis, dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH ≥ 2 
× ULN as assessed by the central laboratory. One patient in the IV group experienced BTH on Day 57. This 
patient did not have a free C5 sample obtained at the Day 57 visit; however, showed complete C5 control at all 
other sampling time points.

Overall, the efficacy of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation was similar to that of ravulizumab 
intravenous formulation during the primary evaluation period. At Day 71, all patients in the 
ravulizumab intravenous formulation group were switched to subcutaneous administration for the 
remainder of the study. The efficacy was maintained through 1 year of treatment and there were no 
significant differences in safety between the ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation and ravulizumab 
intravenous formulation arms aside from injection site reactions associated with the subcutaneous 
route of administration (See section 4.8). 
Results from the Treatment Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire (TASQ), a patient reported 
outcome questionnaire that scores treatment administration satisfaction, indicated that patients treated 
with the ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation experienced greater satisfaction with the subcutaneous 
route of administration than with the intravenous route of administration for eculizumab.

Intravenous formulation 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in adult patients with PNH were assessed in two open-label, 
randomised, active-controlled Phase 3 trials:  
- 
a complement-inhibitor naïve study in adult patients with PNH who were naïve to complement 
inhibitor treatment (Study ALXN1210-PNH-301). 
an eculizumab-experienced study in patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having  
been treated with eculizumab for at least the previous 6 months (Study ALXN1210-PNH-302). 
- 
Ravulizumab was dosed in accordance with the recommended dosing described in approved dosing 
regimen of Ultomiris (4 infusions of ravulizumab over 26 weeks) while eculizumab was administered 
according to the approved dosing regimen of eculizumab of 600 mg every week for the first 4 weeks 
and 900 mg every 2 weeks (15 infusions over 26 weeks). 
Patients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment 
with ravulizumab or eculizumab or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 
weeks after vaccination.  
There were no noteworthy differences in the demographic or baseline characteristics between the 
ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups in either of the Phase 3 studies. The 12-month 
transfusion history was similar between ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups within each of 
the Phase 3 studies. 
Study in complement-inhibitor naïve adult patients with PNH (ALXN1210-PNH-301) 
The complement-inhibitor naïve study was a 26 week, multicentre, open-label, randomised, active-
controlled, Phase 3 study conducted in 246 patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment 
prior to study entry. Eligible patients to enter this trial had to demonstrate high disease activity, 
defined as LDH level ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening along with the presence of 1 or 
more of the following PNH-related signs or symptoms within 3 months of screening: fatigue, 
haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dL), 
history of a major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction; 
or history of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion due to PNH. 
More than 80 % of patients in both treatment groups had a history of transfusion within 12 months of 
study entry. The majority of the complement-inhibitor naïve study population was highly haemolytic 
at baseline; 86.2 % of enrolled patients presented with elevated LDH ≥ 3 × ULN, which is a direct 
measurement of intravascular haemolysis, in the setting of PNH.  
Table 6 presents the baseline characteristics of the PNH patients enrolled in the complement-inhibitor 
naïve study, with no apparent clinically meaningful differences observed between the treatment arms.

b “Other” as specified on case report form included thrombocytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and pancytopenia, 
as well as a number of other conditions. 
The coprimary endpoints were transfusion avoidance, and haemolysis as directly measured by 
normalisation of LDH levels (LDH levels ≤ 1 × ULN; the ULN for LDH is 246 U/L). Key secondary 
endpoints included the percent change from baseline in LDH levels, change in quality of life (FACIT-
Fatigue), the proportion of patients with breakthrough haemolysis and proportion of patients with 
stabilised haemoglobin.  
Ravulizumab was non-inferior compared to eculizumab for both coprimary endpoints, avoidance of 
pRBC transfusion per protocol-specified guidelines and LDH normalisation from day 29 to day 183, 
and for all 4 key secondary endpoints (Figure 1).

Study in adult PNH patients previously treated with eculizumab (ALXN1210-PNH-302) 
The eculizumab-experienced study was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label, randomised, active-
controlled Phase 3 study conducted in 195 patients with PNH who were clinically stable (LDH ≤ 1.5 x 
ULN) after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months.  
PNH medical history was similar between ravulizumab IV and eculizumab treatment groups. The 12-
month transfusion history was similar between ravulizumab IV and eculizumab treatment groups and 
more than 87 % of patients in both treatment groups had not received a transfusion within 12 months 
of study entry. The mean total PNH RBC clone size was 60.05 %, mean total PNH granulocyte clone 
size was 83.30 %, and the mean total PNH monocyte clone size was 85.86 %.

Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) 
Study in adult patients with aHUS (ALXN1210-aHUS-311) 
The adult study was a multicentre, single arm, Phase 3 study conducted in patients with documented 
aHUS who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment prior to study entry and had evidence of 
TMA. The study consisted of a 26-week initial evaluation period and patients were allowed to enter an 
extension period for up to 4.5 years.  
A total of 58 patients with documented aHUS were enrolled. Enrolment criteria excluded patients 
presenting with TMA due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or Shiga toxin Escherichia 
coli related haemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Two patients were excluded from the full 
analysis set due to a confirmed diagnosis of STEC-HUS. Ninety-three percent of patients had extra 
renal signs (cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, skin, skeletal muscle) 
or symptoms of aHUS at baseline.

The primary endpoint was Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, as 
evidenced by normalisation of haematological parameters (platelet count ≥ 150 x 109/L and LDH 
≤ 246 U/L) and ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine from baseline. Patients had to meet each 
Complete TMA Response criteria at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, 
and any measurement in between.  
Complete TMA Response was observed in 30 of the 56 patients (53.6%) during the 26-week initial 
evaluation period as shown in Table 9.

Four additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that was confirmed after the 26-week initial 
evaluation period (with a Complete TMA Response occurring at Days 169, 302, 401 and 407), 
resulting in an overall Complete TMA Response in 34 of 56 patients (60.7%; 95% CI: 47.0%, 74.4%). 
Individual component response increased to 48 (85.7%; 95% CI: 75.7%, 95.8%) patients for platelet 
count normalisation, 47 (83.9%; 95% CI: 73.4%, 94.4%) patients for LDH normalisation, and 35

Complete TMA Response was achieved at a median time of 86 days (7 to 169 days). An increase in 
mean platelet count was observed rapidly after commencement of ravulizumab, increasing from 
118.52 × 109/L at baseline to 240.34 × 109/L at Day 8 and remaining above 227 × 109/L at all 
subsequent visits in the initial evaluation period (26 weeks). Similarly, mean LDH value decreased 
from baseline over the first 2 months of treatment and was sustained over the duration of the initial 
evaluation period (26 weeks).  
Of the patients who presented at CKD Stage 5, 67.6% (23/34) showed an improvement of 1 or more 
CKD Stages. Chronic kidney disease stage continued to improve for many patients (19/30) after 
achieving Complete TMA Response during the 26-week initial evaluation period. 17 of the 29 patients 
who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis by the end of the available 
follow-up while 6 of 27 patients who were off dialysis at baseline were on dialysis at last available 
follow-up. Table 10 summarises the secondary efficacy outcomes for Study ALXN1210aHUS-311.

53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
The estimated bioavailability of ravulizumab subcutaneous formulation is approximately 79% in adult 
PNH patients. Therapeutic concentrations are achieved immediately following the first dose of 
ravulizumab treatment. 
Distribution 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) volume of distribution at steady state for ravulizumab 
intravenously-treated patients (i.e. patients with PNH; adult and paediatric patients with aHUS) and 
for ravulizumab subcutaneously-treated patients (i.e. adult patients with PNH) are presented in Table 
11.  
Biotransformation and elimination  
As an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized 
in the same manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via 
catabolic pathways) and is subject to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring 
amino acids and has no known active metabolites. The mean (SD) terminal elimination half-life and 
clearance of ravulizumab in ravulizumab intravenously-treated patients (i.e. adult patients with PNH; 
adult and paediatric patients with aHUS) and for ravulizumab subcutaneously-treated patients (i.e. 
adult patients with PNH) are presented in Table 11.

Over the studied dose and regimen range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear 
pharmacokinetics (PK). 
Special populations 
Weight 
Body weight is a significant covariate on the PK of ravulizumab in patients with PNH and aHUS. 
No formal trial of the effect of sex, race, age (geriatric), hepatic or renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab was conducted. However, based on population-PK assessment no 
impact of sex, age, race and hepatic or renal function on ravulizumab PK was identified in patients 
with PNH or aHUS, and as a result, no dosing adjustment is considered necessary. 
The pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab IV have been studied in aHUS patients with a range of renal 
impairment and age including patients receiving dialysis. There have been no observed differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters noted in these subpopulations including patients with proteinuria.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Animal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with ravulizumab, but were 
conducted in mice with a murine surrogate complement inhibitory antibody, BB5.1. No clear 
treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in the murine surrogate reproductive 
toxicology studies in mice. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, 
two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring 
born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum 
recommended human ravulizumab dose, based on a body weight comparison); however, the exposure 
did not increase foetal loss or neonatal death. 
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 
ravulizumab. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on nonclinical studies using a murine 
surrogate molecule, BB5.1, in mice.

1.  What Ultomiris is and what it is used for 
What is Ultomiris 
Ultomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has 
been designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body’s defence system 
called the ‘complement system’. 
What is Ultomiris used for 
Ultomiris is used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease called paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), including patients untreated with complement inhibitor and 
patients who have received eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. In patients with PNH, the 
complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which can lead to low blood counts 
(anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, 
difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By attaching to and blocking the C5 
complement protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking red blood cells and so 
control symptoms of the disease.  
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease affecting the 
blood system and kidney called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), including patients 
untreated with complement inhibitor and patients who have received eculizumab for at least 3 months. 
In patients with aHUS, their kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can 
lead to low blood counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood 
clots, tiredness and difficulty in functioning. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, 
and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the 
disease including injury to the kidneys. 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles called 
generalised Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). In patients with gMG, their muscles can be attacked and 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
damaged by the immune system which can lead to profound muscle weakness, impaired vision and 
mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of 
daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and 
destroy its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and 
impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. Ultomiris is specifically indicated for patients 
who remain symptomatic despite treatment with other therapies. 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a disease of the central nervous system that mainly 
affects the optic (eye) nerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
(NMOSD). In patients with NMOSD, the optic nerves and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by 
the immune system working incorrectly, which can lead to loss of sight in one or both eyes, weakness 
or loss of movement in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of feeling, problems with bladder and 
bowel function and marked difficulties with activities of daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s 
abnormal immune response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own optic nerves and spinal cord, 
which reduces the risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ultomiris 
Do not use Ultomiris  
- 
If you are allergic to ravulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. 
If you have meningococcal infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. 
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms 
Because the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body’s defences against 
infection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain which can cause 
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and can spread throughout the blood and body (sepsis).  
Consult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks 
beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you 
have been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should 
also be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance with 
national recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to 
prevent infection.  
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who 
receive Ultomiris, you will be provided a ‘Patient card’ to carry with you at all times, listing relevant 
signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis /encephalitis.  
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache and fever 
headache with a stiff neck or stiff back 
fever 
fever and rash  
confusion  
muscle aches with flu-like symptoms 
eyes sensitive to light 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor 
as soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections. 
Infusion-related reactions 
When Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the infusion (drip) (infusion reaction) such 
as headache, lower back pain, and infusion-related pain. Some patients may experience allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty 
breathing or dizziness). 
Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections. 
Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over, 
although experience with Ultomiris in elderly patients with PNH, aHUS, or NMOSD in clinical 
studies is limited. 
Other medicines and Ultomiris  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
Women of childbearing potential 
The effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, effective contraception 
during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment should be used in women who are able to get 
pregnant. 
Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Ultomiris is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
Ultomiris contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
2.65 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 720 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 133 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
You should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
3. 
How to use Ultomiris  
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against 
meningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you 
cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will 
prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
If your child is less than 18 years, your doctor will administer a vaccine (if not yet done) against 
Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination 
recommendations for each age group. 
Instructions for proper use 
Your dose of Ultomiris will be calculated by your doctor, based on your body weight, as shown in 
Table 1. Your first dose is called the loading dose. Two weeks after receiving your loading dose, you 
will be given a maintenance dose of Ultomiris, and this will then be repeated once every 8 weeks for 
patient above 20 kg and every 4 weeks for patient less than 20 kg.  
If you were previously receiving Ultomiris subcutaneously (given under the skin through an on-body 
injector), no loading dose is required. Ultomiris intravenous maintenance dose should be given 1 week 
after the last dose of Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation. 
If you were previously receiving another medicine for PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD called 
eculizumab, the loading dose should be given 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion.

1.  What Ultomiris is and what it is used for 
What is Ultomiris  
Ultomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has 
been designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body’s defence system 
called the ‘complement system’. 
What is Ultomiris used for 
Ultomiris is used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease called paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), including patients untreated with complement inhibitor and 
patients who have received eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. In patients with PNH, the 
complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which can lead to low blood counts 
(anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, 
difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By attaching to and blocking the C5 
complement protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking red blood cells and so 
control symptoms of the disease.  
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease affecting the 
blood system and kidney called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), including patients 
untreated with complement inhibitor and patients who have received eculizumab for at least 3 months. 
In patients with aHUS, their kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can 
lead to low blood counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood 
clots, tiredness and difficulty in functioning. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, 
and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the 
disease including injury to the kidneys. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles called 
generalised  Myasthenia  Gravis  (gMG).  In  patients  with  gMG,  their  muscles  can  be  attacked  and 
damaged  by  the  immune  system  which  can  lead  to  profound  muscle  weakness,  impaired  vision  and 
mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of 
daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy 
its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and impact 
of the disease on the activities of daily living. Ultomiris is specifically indicated for patients who remain 
symptomatic despite treatment with other therapies. 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a disease of the central nervous system that mainly 
affects the optic (eye) nerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
(NMOSD). In patients with NMOSD, the optic nerves and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by 
the immune system working incorrectly, which can lead to loss of sight in one or both eyes, weakness 
or loss of movement in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of feeling, problems with bladder and 
bowel function and marked difficulties with activities of daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s 
abnormal immune response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own optic nerves and spinal cord, 
which reduces the risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ultomiris  
Do not use Ultomiris  
- 
If you are allergic to ravulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. 
If you have meningococcal infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. 
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms 
Because the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body’s defences against 
infection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain which can cause 
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and can spread throughout the blood and body (sepsis). 
Consult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks 
beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you 
have been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should 
also be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance with 
national recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to 
prevent infection.  
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who 
receive Ultomiris, you will be provided a ‘Patient card’ to carry with you at all times, listing relevant 
signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis/encephalitis.   
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache and fever 
headache with a stiff neck or stiff back 
fever 
fever and rash  
confusion  
muscle aches with flu-like symptoms 
eyes sensitive to light 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor 
as soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections.  
Infusion-related reactions 
When Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the infusion (drip) (infusion reaction) such 
as headache, lower back pain, and infusion-related pain. Some patients may experience allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty 
breathing or dizziness). 
Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections. 
Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over, 
although experience with Ultomiris in elderly patients with PNH, aHUS, or NMOSD in clinical 
studies is limited. 
Other medicines and Ultomiris  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
Women of childbearing potential 
The effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, effective contraception 
during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment should be used in women who are able to get 
pregnant.  
Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Ultomiris is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
Ultomiris contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.18 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 72 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 9.1 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
You should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

3. 
How to use Ultomiris  
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against 
meningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you 
cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will 
prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
If your child is less than 18 years, your doctor will administer a vaccine (if not yet done) against 
Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination 
recommendations for each age group. 
Instructions for proper use 
Your dose of Ultomiris will be calculated by your doctor, based on your body weight, as shown in 
Table 1. Your first dose is called the loading dose. Two weeks after receiving your loading dose, you 
will be given a maintenance dose of Ultomiris, and this will then be repeated once every 8 weeks for 
patient above 20 kg and every 4 weeks for patient less than 20 kg.  
If you were previously receiving Ultomiris subcutaneously (given under the skin through an on-body 
injector), no loading dose is required. Ultomiris intravenous maintenance dose should be given 1 week 
after the last dose of Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation. 
If you were previously receiving another medicine for PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD called 
eculizumab, the loading dose should be given 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion.

administration by exposure to ambient air during approximately 30 min.  
The diluted solution must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than the 
prevailing room temperature. 
Discard any unused portion left in a vial as the medicinal product contains no preservatives. 
The prepared solution should be administered immediately following preparation. Infusion must 
be administered through a 0.2 µm filter. 
If the medicinal product is not used immediately after dilution, storage times must not exceed 
24 hours at 2 °C–8 °C or 4 hours at room temperature taking into account the expected infusion 
time.  
3- Administration 
- 
- 
- 
Do not administer Ultomiris as an intravenous push or bolus injection. 
Ultomiris should only be administered via intravenous infusion.  
The diluted solution of Ultomiris should be administered by intravenous infusion over 
approximately 45 min using a syringe-type pump or an infusion pump. It is not necessary to

1.  What Ultomiris is and what it is used for 
What is Ultomiris 
Ultomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has 
been designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body’s defence system 
called the ‘complement system’. 
What is Ultomiris used for 
Ultomiris is used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease called paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), including patients untreated with complement inhibitor and 
patients who have received eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. In patients with PNH, the 
complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which can lead to low blood counts 
(anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, 
difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By attaching to and blocking the C5 
complement protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking red blood cells and so 
control symptoms of the disease.  
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease affecting the 
blood system and kidney called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), including patients 
untreated with complement inhibitor and patients who have received eculizumab for at least 3 months. 
In patients with aHUS, their kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can 
lead to low blood counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood 
clots, tiredness and difficulty in functioning. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, 
and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the 
disease including injury to the kidneys. 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles called 
generalised  Myasthenia  Gravis  (gMG).  In  patients  with  gMG,  their  muscles  can  be  attacked  and 
damaged  by  the  immune  system  which  can  lead  to  profound  muscle  weakness,  impaired  vision  and 
mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of 
daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy 
its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and impact 
of the disease on the activities of daily living. Ultomiris is specifically indicated for patients who remain 
symptomatic despite treatment with other therapies. 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a disease of the central nervous system that mainly 
affects the optic (eye) nerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
(NMOSD). In patients with NMOSD, the optic nerves and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by 
the immune system working incorrectly, which can lead to loss of sight in one or both eyes, weakness 
or loss of movement in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of feeling, problems with bladder and 
bowel function and marked difficulties with activities of daily living. Ultomiris can block the body’s 
abnormal immune response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own optic nerves and spinal cord, 
which reduces the risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ultomiris 
Do not use Ultomiris  
- 
If you are allergic to ravulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. 
If you have meningococcal infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. 
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms 
Because the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body’s defences against 
infection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain which can cause 
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and can spread throughout the blood and body (sepsis).  
Consult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks 
beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you 
have been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should 
also be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance with 
national recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to 
prevent infection.  
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who 
receive Ultomiris, you will be provided a ‘Patient card’ to carry with you at all times, listing relevant 
signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis/encephalitis.  
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache and fever 
headache with a stiff neck or stiff back 
fever 
fever and rash  
confusion  
muscle aches with flu-like symptoms 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
eyes sensitive to light 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor 
as soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections.  
Infusion-related reactions 
When Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the infusion (drip) (infusion reaction) such 
as headache, lower back pain, and infusion-related pain. Some patients may experience allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty 
breathing or dizziness). 
Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections. 
Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over, 
although experience with Ultomiris in elderly patients with PNH, aHUS, or NMOSD in clinical 
studies is limited. 
Other medicines and Ultomiris  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
Women of childbearing potential 
The effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, effective contraception 
during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment should be used in women who are able to get 
pregnant.  
Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Ultomiris is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
Ultomiris contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.18 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 72 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 9.1 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
You should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

3. 
How to use Ultomiris  
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against 
meningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you 
cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will 
prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
If your child is less than 18 years, your doctor will administer a vaccine (if not yet done) against 
Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination 
recommendations for each age group. 
Instructions for proper use 
Your dose of Ultomiris will be calculated by your doctor, based on your body weight, as shown in 
Table 1. Your first dose is called the loading dose. Two weeks after receiving your loading dose, you 
will be given a maintenance dose of Ultomiris, and this will then be repeated once every 8 weeks for 
patient above 20 kg and every 4 weeks for patient less than 20 kg.  
If you were previously receiving Ultomiris subcutaneously (given under the skin through an on-body 
injector), no loading dose is required. Ultomiris intravenous maintenance dose should be given 1 week 
after the last dose of Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation. 
If you were previously receiving another medicine for PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD called 
eculizumab, the loading dose should be given 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion.

1.  What Ultomiris is and what it is used for 
What is Ultomiris 
Ultomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has 
been designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body’s defence system 
called the ‘complement system’.  
Ultomiris should be self-administered or administered by a caregiver after training by a qualified 
health care professional. 
What is Ultomiris used for 
Ultomiris is used to treat adult patients with a disease called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH), including patients untreated with complement inhibitor and patients who have received 
eculizumab for at least the past 6 months.  
In patients with PNH, the complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which 
can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark 
urine, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By attaching to 
and blocking the C5 complement protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking 
red blood cells and so control symptoms of the disease. 
Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a disease affecting the blood system and kidney 
called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), including patients untreated with complement 
inhibitor and patients who have received eculizumab for at least 3 months. In patients with aHUS, 
their kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood 
counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and 
difficulty in functioning. Ravulizumab can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to 
attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the disease including 
injury to the kidneys.

2.  What you need to know before you use Ultomiris  
Do not use Ultomiris  
- 
If you are allergic to ravulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. 
If you have meningococcal infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. 
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms 
Because the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body’s defences against 
infection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain and can spread throughout 
the blood and body (sepsis). 
Consult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks 
beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after 
you have been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You 
should also be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance 
with national recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to 
prevent infection. 
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who 
receive Ultomiris, you will or have already been provided with a ‘Patient card’ to carry with you at all 
times, listing relevant signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis.  
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache and fever 
headache with a stiff neck or stiff back 
fever 
fever and rash 
confusion 
muscle aches with flu-like symptoms 
eyes sensitive to light 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor 
as soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections. 
Injection site reactions 
When Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the injection such as headache, lower back 
pain, and injection site pain.  
Allergies to the adhesives of the on-body-injector  
108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The on-body-injector of Ultomiris uses an acrylic adhesive and may cause an allergic reaction. Before 
starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have an allergy to acrylic adhesives. 
If you have an allergic reaction during the delivery of Ultomiris, remove the on-body injector and seek 
medical attention right away. 
Other medicines and Ultomiris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines.

3. 
How to use Ultomiris 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with 
your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended maintenance dose of Ultomiris solution for injection is 490 mg administered once a 
week for adult patients with a body weight of 40 kg or more. See the detailed “Instructions for Use” 
included with this leaflet for instructions about how to store, prepare, and use your on-body delivery 
system. 
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against 
meningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you 
cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will 
prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
Instructions for proper use 
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can administer your injections of Ultomiris (given under 
the skin through an on-body injector), you or your caregiver should receive training on the right way 
to prepare and inject Ultomiris. 
You will need 2 on-body delivery systems (each containing 1 on-body injector and 1 pre-filled 
cartridge) for a full dose, and each injection will take about 10 minutes. You or your caregiver or 
healthcare professional can administer the injections at the same time or one after the other into your 
abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor will determine when your treatment can start as this depends on whether or not you are 
being treated with Ultomiris intravenously or with another medicine for PNH and aHUS called 
eculizumab. Table 1 shows the treatment initiation instructions to start your treatment.

Detailed instructions for administration: 
1.  Remove two Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation cartons from the refrigerator. Two on-body 
injectors and two cartridges are required for a full dose. 
2.  Inspect the packaging. The on-body injectors or cartridges should not be used if they have 
been dropped or appear to be broken or damaged. 
3.  Wait at least 45 minutes for the on-body injectors and pre-filled cartridges in the cartons to 
naturally reach room temperature. Do not return to the refrigerator. Discard after 3 days at 
room temperature (20°C - 25°C). 
4.  Before administration, visually inspect the solution. The solution should not be injected if it 
contains flakes or particles or is cloudy or discoloured.  
5.  Load the first clean cartridge into the first on-body injector and secure in place before closing 
the cartridge door on the injector. Do not insert the cartridge more than 5 minutes before the 
injection to avoid drying out the solution.  
6.  Peel away the adhesive backing of the first on-body injector and apply the on-body injector 
onto the clean, dry, chosen injection site(s) (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). 
7.  Start the injection by firmly pressing and releasing the blue start button. 
8.  Repeat for the second on-body injector.  
9.  Do not remove until the injection is complete (signalled by the green status light, 3 beeping 
sounds, and the white plunger filling the medicine window).  
If you are currently not treated with Ultomiris intravenously or eculizumab 
If you are currently not being treated with Ultomiris intravenously or eculizumab, your doctor will 
start your treatment with a loading dose of Ultomiris intravenous formulation.  
If you are currently treated with eculizumab 
If you are currently being treated with eculizumab, your doctor will start your treatment with an 
intravenous loading dose of Ultomiris on your next scheduled eculizumab dose. Two weeks after the 
Ultomiris intravenous loading dose, your doctor will start your treatment with Ultomiris (given via the 
on-body injector as injection under the skin). 
If you are currently treated with Ultomiris intravenously  
If you are currently being treated with Ultomiris intravenously, you will not need a loading dose of 
Ultomiris. Your doctor will start your treatment with Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation 8 weeks 
after your last Ultomiris intravenous maintenance dose. 
If you receive more Ultomiris than you should 
If you suspect that you have been accidentally given or have used a higher dose of Ultomiris than 
prescribed, please contact your doctor for advice.

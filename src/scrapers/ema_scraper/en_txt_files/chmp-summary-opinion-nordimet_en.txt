Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Nordimet 
methotrexate 
On 23 June 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Nordimet, 
intended for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and severe psoriatic 
arthritis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Nordic Group B.V. 
Nordimet will be available as a solution for injection (7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg, 17.5 mg, 20 mg, 
22.5 mg and 25 mg). The active substance of Nordimet is methotrexate, an anti-metabolite folic acid 
analogue (ATC code: L01BA01) which inhibits DNA synthesis through the competitive inhibition of the 
enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. 
The benefits with Nordimet are its ability to reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis. The most common side effects are abnormal liver function tests, stomatitis, dyspepsia, 
nausea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite.  
Nordimet is a hybrid of Lantarel FS (25 mg solution for injection), a medicine containing the same active 
substance that has been authorised in Germany since 1992. 
The full indication is: 
“Nordimet is indicated for the treatment of: 
• 
• 
• 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients, 
polyarthritic forms of severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), when the response to 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate, 
severe recalcitrant disabling psoriasis, which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy 
such as phototherapy, PUVA, and retinoids, and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult patients.” 
It is proposed that Nordimet be prescribed by physicians with experience in the various properties of the 
medicinal product and its mode of action. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product

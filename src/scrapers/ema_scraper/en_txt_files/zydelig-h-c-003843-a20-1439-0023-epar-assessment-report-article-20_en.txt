1.  Information on the procedure 
On 10 March 2016, the European Commission was informed that an increased risk of death and higher 
incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) among subjects receiving idelalisib compared to the control 
groups had been observed in three clinical trials by the independent safety data monitoring group. The 
trials evaluated treatment combinations with chemotherapy and immunotherapy which are currently 
not authorised for Zydelig (idelalisib) in populations with earlier disease characteristics than the 
currently approved indication. However, in light of the emerging safety data, the European Commission 
(EC) considered that the findings from the clinical trials and all available safety data related to idelalisib 
should be reviewed in order to assess their potential impact on the benefit-risk balance of Zydelig in 
the approved indications and relevant ongoing variations. 
On 11 March 2016 the EC therefore triggered a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the impact of 
the above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of Zydelig (idelalisib) and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
Idelalisib is a targeted, selective competitive inhibitor of adenosine-5'-triphosphate binding to the 
catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p110δ (PI3Kδ), which has been shown to be 
prominently expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin (Leverrier, 2003 [1]). PI3Kδ is critical for 
multiple signalling pathways that are hyperactive in B-cell malignancies. Inhibition of PI3Kδ modulates 
B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling as well as signalling through cytokine, chemokine and integrin 
receptors. These signalling pathways act via downstream enzymes (most importantly the 
serine/threonine protein kinase [Akt]) to regulate proliferation, apoptosis, motility, homing, and 
retention of malignant B-cells in lymphoid tissues and bone marrow compartments. By inhibiting 
PI3Kδ-dependent signalling, idelalisib inhibits proliferation, survival, homing, motility, and retention in 
the tumour microenvironment in many B-cell malignancies. PI3Kδ also mediates signalling though T-
cell receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεR1). It has roles in immune 
signalling in T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, T regulatory cells (Tregs), and dendritic cells 
(DC). 
Zydelig (idelalisib) is authorised in the European Union (EU) since 18 September 2014. As of 
22 January 2016, 2,458 patients had been exposed in clinical trials and cumulative post-marketing use 
is estimated to 2,835 patient-years. At time of referral of the matter to the PRAC, it was indicated in 
combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL):  
•  who have received at least one prior therapy, or  
• 
as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for 
chemo-immunotherapy.  
Idelalisib is also indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma 
(FL) that is refractory to two prior lines of treatment.

In addition an extension of indication to authorise the use of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab 
in CLL received a positive CHMP opinion in February 2016. The PRAC was requested assess the impact 
of the emerging new safety information on this extension of indication before the final decision of the 
European Commission (EC) is adopted.  
This review was triggered on the basis of emergent safety information from the interim results of 
studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-01252 evaluating the addition of idelalisib 
to standard therapy in first line CLL and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(iNHL/SLL). These results suggested an increased risk of death and serious infection with idelalisib 
compared to the control group, which was not seen in other trials. The clinical trials, which have been 
stopped, evaluated idelalisib in different treatment combination and/or in patients at earlier stages of 
the diseases than currently authorised. Although the potential impact of these new safety findings in 
the authorised indications was unknown, based on the very limited and preliminary information 
available at the start of the procedure, the PRAC considered that provisional measures were needed 
while the issue was being further reviewed3. The PRAC considered that as a precautionary measure, 
idelalisib should not be initiated as a first line treatment in CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation and recommended provisional amendments of the indication of idelalisib. The committee 
considered that idelalisib could be used for continuing treatment in those patients who had already 
initiated the medicine as first line treatment based on individual benefit-risk balance assessment. The 
committee also recommended provisional risk minimisation measures including the update of the 
posology and warnings to take due account that treatment should not be initiated in patients with 
systemic infections, patients should be monitored for respiratory symptoms and be administered 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Regular clinical and laboratory screening for 
cytomegalovirus should also be performed. In addition, given the higher risk for infection, advice on 
dose reduction or treatment interruption in the event of severe neutropenia was also introduced in the 
product information. The European Commission issued a decision on the provisional measures on 23 
March 2016. 
Of note, four other studies in first line settings in CLL and iNHL and one in early line in pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma were also terminated further to the emergence of this safety signal (101-08, GS-US-
312-0118, GS-US-312-0133, GS-US-313-1414 and GS-US-385-1577)4.  
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterised by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs.  
Altered p53 function resulting from 17p deletion and/or TP53 gene mutation is associated with poor 
prognosis in CLL patients. While under 10% of CLL patients have detectable 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation at the time of diagnosis, the proportion increases up one-third in relapsed patients (Rossi,

2.2.1.  Safety signal identified in studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 
and GS-US-313-0125 
Interim results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125 showed decreased 
overall survivals in the idelalisib arms of those studies, predominantly attributable to deaths from 
adverse events, as shown in table 1. The fatal adverse events observed were mostly of infectious and 
respiratory origin, as detailed in table 2.

2.2.2.  Key safety data from all relevant studies  
The MAH submitted data from all relevant clinical studies, including the pivotal studies supporting the 
initial marketing authorisation and extension of indication in combination with ofatumumab as well as 
studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of idelalisib in new treatment combinations and/or study 
populations (including studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125). Some of 
these studies were completed and a final or interim (including completed primary analysis) clinical 
study report (CSR) was available while for the three most recent the data was interim and therefore 
limited analyses were available. An overview of the most relevant studies is presented in the table

Serious infections 
The MAH presented the key safety data in CLL and iNHL patients in all relevant clinical trials and 
compared the results of the different trials with the aim to identify the different factors that may have 
led to the increased risk observed in studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125, 
while acknowledging the limitations attached to direct comparison of study results. 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced within studies and mostly 
comparable across studies. 
Due to the first line setting of CLL studies GS-US-312-0123 and 101-08, time since diagnosis was 
shorter in these patients (see table 3). The median time since completion of last regimen before 
treatment initiation was comparable between studies GS-US-312-0116 (9.2 months) and GS-US-312-
0119 (9.0 months) and higher in study GS-US-312-0115 (18.2 months). The median number of prior 
regimens was slightly higher for GS-US-312-0116 and GS-US-312-0119 (3 prior regimens) compared 
to study GS-US-312-0115 (2 prior regimens). 
Within all iNHL studies the FL subpopulation were equally distributed at approximately 60%. Time since 
initial diagnosis was comparable between treatment and control arms within studies and also across 
studies. The median number of prior regimens was similar in studies GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-
313-0125 and higher in study 101-09 (see table 3). The median time since completion of the last 
regimen before treatment initiation was also equally distributed between treatment and control arms 
and comparable between studies: GS-US-313-0124 (25.3) and GS-US-313-0125 (20.3 months); time 
since completion of last regimen was shorter in study 101-09 (3.9 months). 
An abstract of the key safety data from those studies is presented in the below tables. Of note, 
however, when comparing the event rates, it should be kept in mind that time at risk was 2 to 4 times 
longer for patients in the idelalisib arms of the completed studies.

In CLL studies -0116, -0119 and -0115 PJP accounted respectively for 5-12 % and 0-4% of serious 
infection cases in the idelalisib and control arms respectively and cytomegalovirus (CMV) accounted for 
0% of the serious infection cases in studies -0116 and -0119 and 7.2% and 6.1% in the idelalisib and 
control arms of study -0115, respectively. In iNHL studies, PJP cases accounted for 3-10% and CMV for 
6-8% of the serious infection cases in the idelalisib arms and both accounted for 0% of serious 
infection case in the control arms. 
Of all grade ≥3 infection and infestation AE, the MAH provided the proportion of those that occurred 
concomitantly with grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea/colitis and pneumonitis which might indicate an autoimmune 
reaction. Among subjects with CLL in studies -0116, -0119, -0115, and -0123, of the subjects treated 
with idelalisib who had a ≥ grade 3 infection (291 of 646 subjects, 45.0%), 24 subjects (8.2%) had 
concomitant ≥ grade 3 diarrhoea and/or colitis, and 9 subjects (3.1%) had concomitant ≥ grade 3 
pneumonitis. Among subjects in the control group who had a ≥ grade 3 infection (141 of 557 subjects, 
25.3%), 1 subject (0.7%) had concomitant ≥ grade 3 diarrhoea and/or colitis, and 2 subjects (1.4%) 
had concomitant ≥ grade 3 pneumonitis. While among subjects with iNHL who received combination 
therapy in studies -0124, -0125, of the subjects treated with idelalisib who had a ≥ grade 3 infection 
(166 of 515 subjects, 32.0%), 12 subjects (7.2%) had concomitant ≥ grade 3 diarrhoea and/or colitis, 
and 3 subjects (1.8%) had concomitant ≥ grade 3 pneumonitis. Among subjects in the control group 
who had a ≥ grade 3 infection (33 of 250 subjects, 13.2%), none had a concomitant ≥ grade 3 
diarrhoea and/or colitis, or pneumonitis.  
In study -0123 the causes of death for 9 of the 12 subjects (75%) on the idelalisib plus bendamustine 
and rituximab arm were events either directly reported as infectious events (including one case of CMV 
sepsis and one PJP associated with cardiopulmonary failure) or associated with infection, compared 
with 2 of 11 subjects (18.2%) on the idelalisib plus rituximab arm in study -0124 and 15 of 28 subjects 
(53.6%) on the idelalisib plus bendamustine and rituximab arm in study -0125 (including two cases of 
Assessment report  
EMA/586939/2016

PJP). In the cases where the cause of death was not associated with infectious aetiologies, it mainly 
consisted of progressive disease. Death rates in the single arm study 101-08 were comparable to those 
observed in the front line setting treatment arm (6.3% and 4.9% in cohort 1 and 2, respectively). 
Whilst all deaths in study GS-US-312-0116 occurred during treatment, a very large proportion of 
deaths in study GS-US-312-0119 and GS-US-312-0115 occurred during long term follow-up (12.1% 
and 9.2% respectively). Broken down by time periods ≤1, >1-≤2, >2-≤3, >3-≤6 and >6 months and 
adjusted for the number of patients at risk, the death rates for each periods in first line CLL were 
1.9%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 2.1% and 1.5% respectively compared to 1.9%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 3.0% and 19.7%, 
respectively in relapsed/refractory patients.  
Of note, in the two other studies in front line CLL that were terminated, as of 14 March 2016, no 
subjects had died in study GS-US-312-0118, while seven subjects had died in study GS-US-312-0133 
including one during the long term follow up (102 days after end of treatment).  
Discussion 
The PRAC reviewed the safety data from all the studies submitted by the MAH, including the interim 
results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125 in the context of the 
results from other studies. The PRAC noted the limitations associated with comparison of results across 
studies and the premature nature of the data extracted from studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-
0124 and GS-US-313-0125. Comparison of the events occurring in the first month of treatment was 
considered of more relevance in view of the longer time-at-risk for patients in the treatment arms of 
the completed studies. 
The rate of SAEs in CLL patients was broadly consistent in all control arms despite varying treatment 
combinations and different patient populations in the different trials. SAE rates were consistently 
higher in the treatment arms compared to control arms. The infectious SAE rate in the idelalisib + 
rituximab + bendamustine arm in treatment naïve patients was comparable or slightly lower than rates 
in the relapsed/refractory CLL studies were idelalisib was administered in combination with rituximab, 
ofatumumab or rituximab and bendamustine. However, in the control arms the rate of infectious SAEs 
in treatment naïve patients was markedly lower compared to that in the other CLL studies.  
In the iNHL studies the overall rates of any SAEs and that of infectious SAE were similar in patients 
given idelalisib alone or in combination with rituximab but higher in patients administered 
bendamustine in addition to idelalisib and rituximab. A similar difference was observed in the control 
arms with and without bendamustine. There was a notable difference in the rates of infection between 
treatment arm and control arm in study GS-US-313-0124, which was also seen, albeit to a lesser 
extent, in study GS-US-313-0125. There was no apparent relationship between treatment duration and 
risk of infectious SAE. In the two placebo-controlled trials in relapsed iNHL patients, the risk of 
infectious SAE attributable to idelalisib was comparable. In the iNHL placebo controlled studies, deaths 
rates were lower than in the single arm study. The incidence of deaths that occurred on study 
treatment appeared to decrease with increasing number of prior regimens in studies GS-US-313-0124, 
GS-US-313-0125, and 101-09, however, the numbers in each group are too small to allow any firm 
conclusion. 
Analyses suggest that treatment with idelalisib in CLL versus placebo in combination with rituximab, 
ofatumumab or bendamustine and rituximab, results in a higher incidence of early infections across all 
quartiles of treatment-free intervals. There was no increased incidence of infection in patients with 
treatment-free intervals compared to shorter ones for the idelalisib-treated population. Hence, in 
relapsing CLL a long treatment-free interval before starting idelalisib does not appear to be associated 
with an increased risk for early infectious events. The death event rate was numerically higher in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/586939/2016  
Page 10/26 
 
 
 
 
 
idelalisib + rituximab + bendamustine of study -0123 compared to the control irrespective of time 
interval while in study -0115 this was only the case in the first month of the study. However, broken 
down by time periods, the rates were similar in treatment arms of both studies. Similarly, in 
studies -0124 and -0125 there is overall no relationship between time off therapy and infectious 
events. No clear relationship could be determined between risk of infection and deaths and number of 
prior therapies or time off treatment prior to idelalisib initiation either. It appeared that the different 
disease pathophysiology of CLL compared to iNHL contributed to an overall lower rate of infectious 
diseases and deaths in iNHL patients. 
When looking at immune related adverse events overall, numbers were small and there was no 
apparent association between the occurrence of infections and other adverse events in idelalisib 
treated patients based on the data presented. There was no obvious difference between first line and 
relapsed/refractory patients.  
The characteristics of patients in studies -0123, -0124 and -0125 are compatible with a better 
prognosis than the patients populations defined in the authorised indications. Patients with 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation represented a small proportion of the population in study -0123 and 
studies -0124 and -0125 included patients who had experienced few relapses and had a longer time 
since completion of the last regimen before treatment initiation, indicative of a slowly progressing 
disease. As suggested by the relatively low rates of serious infections in the control arms these 
patients were also less immunocompromised than those in later line trials.  
The SAG considered that the new evidence from study -0123 did not add evidence as to a possible 
benefit or detriment of idelalisib in first line treatment of CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation, nor in relapse/refractory patients, to which the PRAC agreed. While there were some 
concerns at the SAG that the toxicity might be higher in first-line treatment, further analysis showed 
that the risk was similar across treatment lines. The PRAC concluded that based on the review of all 
the relevant safety data, the evidence was not supportive of an increased risk in treatment naïve CLL 
patients. The results of study -0123 are explained by the good prognosis and therefore low 
disease-related mortality of the patients leading to the impossibility to observe the benefits from the 
idelalisib treatment early in the study while its known toxicity is observed as in the other trials. In 
addition, in this study bendamustine was added to the authorised combination of idelalisib and 
rituximab, which led to an increased toxicity. Considering that Zydelig is authorised in patients with a 
worse prognosis, due to either the p17 deletion or TP53 mutation or relapsed/refractory disease, these 
results are therefore considered of limited relevance, even more so as they were seen with a triple 
treatment combination. Following the same reasoning, the results appear to be of limited relevance for 
the use of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in the CLL indications. However it is 
acknowledged that safety and efficacy data are limited in treatment naïve patients with the p17 
deletion or TP53 mutation as was reflected in the wording of the indication, initially restricted to 
patients unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. Based on the very limited data available at the start of 
the procedure, the PRAC recommended as a precaution that idelalisib should not be initiated as a first 
line treatment in CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation while the review is ongoing. However 
based on the in-depth review of the data, the PRAC considered that idelalisib could now be initiated 
again in these CLL patients and taking into account the initial restriction of the indication as well as the 
recent availability of another treatment option for treatment-naïve CLL patients, recommended as a 
precaution that only patients with these genetic mutations who are not eligible for other therapies are 
administered idelalisib. It should be further explained in section 4.4 of the SmPC that idelalisib is only 
to be used as a first line treatment in patients with the p17 deletion or TP53 mutation that are not 
eligible for any other therapies due to the limited efficacy and safety data available in this indication.

The PRAC considered that this would also be relevant for idelalisib when used in combination with 
ofatumumab in the same indications. 
Similarly in the iNHL studies -0124 and -0125 the imbalance in the rate of deaths observed is thought 
to be due to the relatively good prognosis and low rate of disease related infectious SAEs of the 
patients enrolled, leading to an increased relative risk of idelalisib-related infectious SAEs early in the 
studies as the benefits are not yet observed. The results also reflect the additional toxicity of rituximab 
or rituximab + bendamustine, in contrast to the authorised use which is as monotherapy. It was 
discussed at the SAG, that the study that supported the initial granting of the indication in refractory 
follicular lymphoma did not include a comparator arm and that a confirmatory trial in this indication 
would add valuable information to the available evidence, which is acknowledged. However the SAG 
noted that the feasibility of a comparative trial appears to be limited, and considered that it would be 
of interest in view of the results of studies -0124 and -0125 to obtain observational safety data from 
clinical practice in a representative sample of institutions, to which the PRAC concurred. The MAH has 
agreed to conduct a category 3 post-authorisation safety study and is requested to submit the protocol 
of this study for assessment by EMA within 3 months of the European Commission decision on this 
article 20 procedure.  
While PRAC considered that the results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-
0125 were not directly relevant to the authorised use of Zydelig, they highlighted the risks linked to 
off-label use in first line CLL and early line iNHL and the importance of the risk of infection, including 
PJP and CMV (please see below) associated with idelalisib. However, while the PJP and CMV risks are 
important, these infections represented a relatively small proportion of the serious infections cases 
observed in the studies reviewed. Therefore, more general risk minimisation measures for serious 
infection are warranted. The risks of infections and neutropenia related to idelalisib treatment are 
known and are listed as very common adverse events in the product information. In study -0116, 
there was a modest increase in the risk of infections overall and in the risk of serious infections in the 
treatment arm compared to the control arm. However, in this study, measures were in place to 
mitigate the risk of infection with idelalisib: PJP prophylaxis was recommended, idelalisib treatment 
was to be avoided in patients with active infection, patients were to be monitored for neutrophil count 
every two weeks for the first 6 months (with dose modification guidance) and for respiratory 
infections. The PRAC considered that risk minimisation measures were warranted in order to bring the 
use in clinical practice closer to that in the clinical trials where a positive benefit-risk was observed. In 
this regard, the provisional measures which specified that patients should not start taking idelalisib in 
case of systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection and that patients should be monitored for 
respiratory signs and symptoms throughout treatment and advised to report promptly any new 
respiratory symptoms were considered justified and should be maintained. Further, as neutropenia 
leads to a higher risk of infection and infections were reported from the first month in the study, in line 
with measures applied in clinical trials and as implemented in the provisional measures, blood counts 
should be monitored every two weeks during the first six months of treatment. Blood counts 
monitoring should be intensified to weekly in patients with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) below 
1,000 per mm3 and treatment withheld while ANC is below 500 per mm3. Treatment may then be 
restarted at a reduced dose of 100 mg twice daily. In addition, it should be further specified in a 
footnote to the tabulated list of adverse reactions that the serious infections reported included 
opportunistic infections as well as bacterial and viral infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and 
sepsis. These measures and those related to PJP and CMV infections are expected to improve the 
benefit-risk balance in the authorised indications and ongoing extension of indication. The PRAC further 
requested that “serious infections including opportunistic infections such as PJP and CMV” and “off label 
use” in first line CLL therapy in patients without p17 deletion or TP53 mutation should be added to the 
Assessment report

risk management plan (RMP) as important identified risks. Neutropenia was already included in the 
RMP as an important identified risk. 
The MAH was also proposed to implement a targeted follow questionnaire for cases of serious 
infections, which is endorsed. This questionnaire has been included in a revised RMP and will collect 
information on concomitant medication in cases of serious infection, compliance with monitoring 
requirements and prophylactic treatment. Results will be discussed in future PSURs. 
The MAH also proposed to measure the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures through a 
European healthcare professional (HCP) Survey, which will evaluate awareness and self-reported 
changes in clinical practice in response to the implemented risk minimisation measures, which is also 
endorsed. The MAH is required to submit the protocol of this category 3 study to EMA for evaluation 
within 3 months of European Commission decision.  
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
An increased incidence of PJP cases was observed in the treatment arms compared to the controls in 
the CLL and iNHL studies. While a few patients in the control arms of CLL studies experienced PJP 
infections, this was not the case in the iNHL studies. The majority of cases (66% [23/35]) occurred 
within the first 6 months of treatment. Overall, there was no clear relationship to treatment duration or 
number of prior regimen.  
Depending on trials, between 20 and 70% patients were administered PJP prophylaxis defined as ≥ 4 
weeks of at least one antibiotic, as detailed in tables 7 and 8.

A pooling of the CLL studies -0116, 0119, -0115, -0123, and 101-08 show that two (0.5%) of the 387 
idelalisib-treated patients who received prophylaxis developed PJP infection compared to 20 (5%) of 
the 364 idelalisib-treated patients who did not receive prophylaxis. In these five studies, there were 
two deaths due to PJP infection in idelalisib-treated patients; both occurred in patients who had not 
received prophylaxis (one in study -0116 and one in study -0123). 
In the iNHL studies 101-09, -0124 and -0125, three (1.5%) of the 205 idelalisib-treated patients who 
received PJP prophylaxis developed PJP infection compared to 10 (2.3%) of the 435 idelalisib-treated 
patients who did not receive prophylaxis. In these studies, there were three deaths in idelalisib-treated 
patients (one in study -101-09 and two in study -0125), of which two occurred in patients who had not 
received prophylaxis. 
Pooled subjects treated with idelalisib with and without bendamustine and with best overall response in 
the following categories: complete response, complete response with incomplete marrow recovery, 
minor response, partial response, stable disease, or very good partial response without ≥ grade 2 
neutropenia, were examined for the effect of PJP prophylaxis. In subjects treated with idelalisib plus 
bendamustine and rituximab who received PJP prophylaxis, 1 subject (0.3%) experienced a PJP event, 
compared to 3 subjects (0.9%) in the group without PJP prophylaxis. In subjects treated with other 
idelalisib combinations (excluding bendamustine plus rituximab) who received PJP prophylaxis, 
1 subject (0.5%) experienced a PJP event, compared to 6 subjects (2.3%) without PJP prophylaxis. 
Of note, three PJP events occurred after the end of treatment. One PJP event occurred 22 days after 
end of treatment in Study GS-US-312-0116, and 2 PJP events occurred in Study GS-US-313-0125 
respectively 5 and 56 days after end of treatment. Overall 5 (14%) out of the 35 cases of PJP in 
idelalisib-treated patients in CLL and iNHL studies resulted in death with 4 of the 5 deaths occurring in 
patients who had not received PJP prophylaxis.  
Discussion 
Globally prophylaxis was administered proportionally across the different arms of the studies, therefore 
the higher incidence of Pneumocystis observed in the idelalisib groups in CLL was most likely due to 
idelalisib and not the small differences in PJP prophylaxis. Although this retrospective analysis of 
prospectively collected data has important limitations (e.g. the decision to administer PJP prophylaxis 
was at the discretion of the investigator, which may have resulted in selection bias), the data show 
that PJP prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of PJP infection in patients receiving idelalisib. 
This was especially the case in CLL where the relative risk reduction was 90%, which is comparable 
with published data for the efficacy of PJP prophylaxis in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
immunocompromised patients (Stern, 2014). The use of PJP prophylaxis in idelalisib-treated subjects 
Assessment report

was notably lower in the iNHL studies than in the CLL studies; however, this was not associated with a 
higher incidence of PJP. The risk of PJP in patients who did not receive prophylaxis appears to be lower 
in the iNHL group than the CLL group (2.3% vs 5%). This may reflect a lower susceptibility to PJP 
infection in the iNHL group of patients, although this should be interpreted with caution because of the 
limitations of comparing safety outcomes across studies. In addition, patients with adequate neutrophil 
counts and stable disease seem to benefit less from prophylaxis; however, the small numbers make 
interpretation difficult. 
Considering the significant morbidity and mortality associated with PJP infection, and the absence of a 
clearly identified low-risk group, PJP prophylaxis throughout treatment as recommended in the 
provisional measures is considered justified. While more cases occurred during the first 6 months on 
treatment, considering the proportion of cases occurring later it was not considered appropriate to limit 
the administration of PJP prophylaxis to this fixed time window. Further, the risk of PJP infection may 
persist when idelalisib treatment is stopped as a few cases where reported until 2 months after end of 
treatment. The SAG was of the view that the PJP prophylaxis should be prolonged after the end of 
treatment with idelalisib. Recent European conference on infections in leukaemia (ECIL) guidelines for 
preventing PJP in patients with haematological malignancies and stem cell transplant recipients 
recommend prophylaxis for ≥ 6 months after completion of other CLL treatments carrying a risk of 
PJP; for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, however, prophylaxis is recommended only from 
end of induction until end of maintenance (Maertens, 2016 [7]). In the idelalisib studies, the 
occurrence of clinical PJP was not associated with low (<140 cells/µL) CD4 counts, as is seen in 
fludarabine treatment or in patients with HIV. The MAH has indicated that the mechanism of idelalisib-
associated PJP is most likely that of a functional impairment of T cells. Therefore monitoring of CD4 
counts is unlikely to be of help in determining the duration of prophylaxis after idelalisib treatment is 
stopped. The duration of PJP prophylaxis after stopping idelalisib cannot be precisely defined based on 
the limited available data. However, in line with the SAG advice and in light of the occurrence of cases 
of PJP after stopping idelalisib as well as published guidelines (albeit in different patient populations), 
the MAH proposed that PJP prophylaxis should continue for 2-6 months after stopping idelalisib in a 
case by case basis. Section 4.4 of the SmPC should be further substantiated to advise physicians that 
factors to consider for adapting the duration of prophylaxis after the end of idelalisib treatment include 
concomitant corticosteroid treatment and prolonged neutropenia. In addition a cross reference to 
section 4.8 should be included, where the already listed adverse reaction “infection” with the frequency 
“very common” should be further qualified to mention that these included PJP. It should be further 
described that PJP was amongst the opportunistic infections observed in clinical studies, including after 
stopping idelalisib treatment and that most PJP cases, including fatal cases, occurred in patients that 
did not receive prophylaxis. The PRAC was also of the view that cases of PJP should be closely 
monitored; to this effect a targeted follow up questionnaire has been included in a revised RMP. The 
MAH should implement these questionnaires and their results should be discussed in future PSURs. 
Cytomegaloviral infection 
In relapsed/refractory CLL patients serious CMV infections occurred only in association with 
bendamustine, whilst small numbers of non-serious CMV cases were observed in all studies; in 
relapsed and refractory iNHL patients serious CMV infections were observed in the treatment arms of 
all studies including idelalisib monotherapy, idelalisib + rituximab, and idelalisib + rituximab + 
bendamustine regimens, whilst no cases of serious CMV infections were seen in the respective control 
arms. CMV infections occurred predominantly in the treatment arms of studies evaluating idelalisib in 
7 Maertens J, Cesaro S, et al. ECIL guidelines for preventing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with 
haematological malignancies and stem cell transplant recipients. J Antimicrob Chemother 2016.

combination with both rituximab and bendamustine. The majority of CMV cases (75% [39/52]) 
occurred within the first 6 month of treatment. Overall, there was no clear relationship to treatment 
duration or number of prior regimen.  
Of the 52 (2.4%) cases of treatment-emergent CMV across the 8 CLL and iNHL studies (n = 2,204), 
the location for the CMV infection was reported for 10 subjects in the gastrointestinal tract, 7 subjects 
in peripheral blood, 5 subjects in the lung, 4 subjects in multi-organ locations and 3 subjects in the 
eye. For the remaining 23 subjects, the location of infection was unspecified and therefore interpreted 
as peripheral blood. 
Of the 481 patients treated with idelalisib in studies -0116, -0119, -0124 (without bendamustine) 5 
subjects (1.0%) experienced a CMV AE with a median time to onset of 2.6 months.  
Discussion  
Consistently more CMV cases occurred in the treatment arms of the controlled studies. In the control 
arms of the studies in CLL that include bendamustine treatment a few patients experienced CMV, while 
in the control arm of the other CLL studies no patient experienced CMV events. No patients 
experienced CMV in the control arm of the studies in iNHL. Considering the CMV events reported, 
based on the limited data available at the start of the procedure the PRAC recommended as a 
precaution that clinical and laboratory screening for CMV infection should be conducted and that 
Zydelig should be discontinued if there is evidence of infection or viraemia. There does not appear to 
be a clear difference in the risk CMV in CLL and iNHL populations, but as already noted, this should be 
interpreted with caution given the significant limitations of comparing outcomes across different 
studies. Similarly as for PJP infection, while more cases occurred during the first 6 months of treatment 
considering the proportion of cases also occurring later, it was not considered appropriate to limit the 
CMV monitoring to this fixed period of time. However, overall in the clinical studies, the risk of CMV 
appears particularly evident in patients administered idelalisib and rituximab in combination with 
bendamustine. While it is acknowledged that the frequency of CMV might have been underestimated as 
symptoms of CMV infection are relatively unspecific and no regular screening for CMV (e.g. polymerase 
chain reaction [PCR]) was performed in the studies, in patients treated with idelalisib in combination 
with rituximab or ofatumumab in controlled studies (-0116, -0119 and -0124), the event rate of CMV 
was low (1%). The SAG advised that monitoring was only needed in patients with positive serology at 
start of treatment with idelalisib. This was agreed by the PRAC, which added that patients with other 
evidence of a history of CMV infection should also be monitored. In addition, the SAG considered that 
patients with increased viraemia compared to baseline should be carefully monitored but that idelalisib 
treatment should be continued. If clinical signs of CMV infection occur in these patients, then 
consideration should be given to interrupting idelalisib until the infection has resolved, weighting the 
need for idelalisib treatment against the severity of the CMV symptoms. The PRAC considered these 
recommendations appropriate. The SAG further advised that if the benefits of resuming idelalisib are 
judged to outweigh the risk, consideration should be given to administering pre-emptive CMV therapy. 
The PRAC considered that the precautionary warning included in the product information should be 
refined in line with these recommendations for healthcare professionals. Further, as for PJP, CMV 
should be added to further qualify the nature of the serious infections listed as adverse reactions in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC and that it should be further described that these were amongst the 
opportunistic infections reported in the idelalisib arms of clinical studies. The MAH should closely 
monitor cases of CMV and discuss these in detail in future PSURs.

2.3.  Data on efficacy 
The MAH provided relevant efficacy data including that previously submitted for the initial marketing 
authorisation on in CLL and FL, ongoing extension of indication with ofatumumab and limited interim 
data available from the three studies in which the safety signal was observed. 
2.3.1.  Data that supported the CLL indications 
Idelalisib in combination with rituximab  
Efficacy in CLL was mainly based upon the interim report from the pivotal phase 3 study 
GS-US-312-0116 in combination therapy and is further supported by reports of three additional 
studies, including study 101-08.  
Table 8. Efficacy results from study GS-US-312-0116 
In this study 43% of patients carried a 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation. Subgroup analysis showed 
a clinically relevant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) in these patients and overall 
response rate (ORR) results were consistent with the overall population (see table 9).

In study 101-08, a phase 2 single-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of continuous idelalisib 
+ rituximab (cohort 1) or idelalisib monotherapy (cohort 2) in subjects with previously untreated CLL 
or SLL, 9 subjects (14.1%) in cohort 1 and 6 subjects (14.6%) in cohort 2 had documented 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation status. The ORR based on investigator assessment was 97% in cohort 1 and 
85% in cohort 2. In cohort 1, all 9 subjects with either 17p deletion or TP53 mutation responded. 
Three of these subjects had a complete response. In cohort 2, 4 subjects with either 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation had a partial response and 1 subject with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation had a partial 
response with lymphocytosis for an ORR of 83%. 
Idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab  
The efficacy of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in patients with CLL has been confirmed in 
study GS-US-312-0119 which supported the extension of indication application for which the CHMP 
issued a positive opinion in February 2016. Study -0119 demonstrated an improved PFS in relapsed 
patients treated with idelalisib + ofatumumab compared to ofatumumab alone (idelalisib + 
ofatumumab median PFS=16.3 months; ofatumumab alone median PFS=8.0 months; HR+0.27, 
95%CI (0.19, 0.39), p<0.0001). The overall survival was not significantly different between the two 
treatment groups (adjusted HR [95% CI] of 0.74 [0.44, 1.24]; p = 0.27), however, methodological 
factors including differences in drop-outs, duration of treatment exposure and follow-up time between 
the treatment arms might be responsible for these results, as already discussed and accepted by CHMP 
in February 2016 (EMA/H/C/3843/II/0011). The efficacy of idelalisib + ofatumumab was consistent in 
the subgroups, including patients with high-risk prognostic features such as 17p deletion or TP53 
mutations. 
2.3.2.  Data that supported the indication in refractory FL  
Efficacy in FL was based upon the interim report from the pivotal single arm study 101-09 in idelalisib 
monotherapy, further supported by data in the reports of two phase 1/2 or 1 studies. Study 101-09 
was a phase 2, open label, single-arm, multicentre study conducted in 125 subjects with previously 
treated iNHL (including 72 patients with FL) that was refractory both to rituximab and to alkylating-
agent-containing chemotherapy. A summary of the results is presented in the below table.

The median duration of response (DOR) was 12.5 months. Due to the lack of a comparator for these 
patients, the ORR and DOR for idelalisib were compared with that of the last therapy prior to idelalisib 
treatment. The efficacy data of the subjects’ previous therapy was inferior with an ORR of 23.2% and 
median DOR of 5.9 months.

In the interim results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124 and GS-US-313-0125 overall

The efficacy of idelalisib in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed/remitting CLL has been 
confirmed in study GS-US-312-0116 which supported the authorisation of this indication. A significant 
benefit was seen for PFS, ORR and OS.  
The demonstrated benefits of idelalisib + rituximab treatment seen in relapsed CLL patients who 
carried the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation were extrapolated to first line CLL patients who carry either 
of these mutations. This was further supported by results of study 101-08 in which a response to first 
line idelalisib + rituximab treatment was seen in all 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation patients despite 
their poor prognosis. In study -0123 there were no statistically significant differences between the 
treatment groups for PFS, best overall response or OS in previously untreated CLL subjects with 17p 
deletion and/or TP53 mutation. However, the immaturity of the data and small number of patients are 
noted as a plausible reason for the lack of observed benefit. Although the dataset for first line patients 
with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation is too limited to draw direct conclusions, the overall 
assessment does not challenge the extrapolation of the benefits observed in relapsed/refractory CLL 
patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation to treatment naïve patients, for idelalisib in combination 
with rituximab or ofatumumab. However, the limited availability of the data should be reflected in the 
product information and, in view of availability of an additional treatment option for these patients the 
indication should, as a precaution, be reworded to include only patient that are not eligible for any 
other therapies. 
It was discussed at the SAG that conclusive evidence on the benefits and risks of idelalisib in this 
subset and line of treatment would require a randomised study in this setting but that due to the small 
number of patients and the availability of suitable alternative treatment such trial would likely not be 
feasible nor appropriate. This was agreed by the PRAC.

In follicular lymphoma, idelalisib showed consistent activity based on previous treatment responses in 
FL patients refractory to two prior lines of treatment.  
3.  Expert consultation 
The PRAC consulted the oncology scientific advisory group (SAG) which provided advice on a number 
of issues as summarised below. 
The SAG experts considered that the unexpected safety findings from studies -0123, -0124, -0125, did 
not add conclusive evidence as to a possible benefit or detriment of idelalisib in treatment of CLL 
relapsed/refractory patients and treatment-naïve patients who carry the 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation. On one hand, there were some concerns that the toxicity might be higher in first-line 
treatment; on the other it was considered that unauthorised use of idelalisib and rituximab in 
combination with bendamustine treatment may have accounted for the additional toxicity. Some SAG 
members agreed that the new data added to the overall uncertainty about benefits and risks in this 
indication which would impact the clinical decision-making since an alternative treatment is authorised 
in this indication (ibrutinib). However, other SAG members argued that idelalisib + rituximab (with 
appropriate risk minimisation measures) is still a valid treatment option as in some situations only 
potentially suboptimal treatment options are available (e.g. in case of contraindication to ibrutinib and 
when the only alternative treatment was dexamethasone). The SAG agreed that conclusive evidence 
on the benefits and risks of idelalisib in this subset and line of treatment would require a randomised 
study in this setting. However, the feasibility and appropriateness of such trial is questioned due to the 
small number of patients and the availability of suitable alternative treatment. 
Regarding mortality and serious adverse events in the studies of idelalisib in combination with 
rituximab and that with ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, the experts discussed a 
number of factors that could have led to the observed differences between these studies and 
considered these added complexity to any comparison. 
The SAG also agreed that these results do not add concerns of a detriment in the currently approved 
third-line monotherapy indication in FL considering the different combination likely resulting in 
increased toxicities compared to monotherapy and as the risk of infection can be further minimised 
with the new measures. A confirmatory trial in a third-line FL indication would be informative but the 
feasibility of such study was questioned, due to the observed effect of idelalisib monotherapy (e.g. 
approximately twice longer PFS compared to prior treatment), heterogeneity associated with many 
different possible comparators and approaches, the heterogeneity of the patient population also with 
respect to prior treatments, the increasing practice of maintenance treatment and response-adapted 
treatment approaches, the changing landscape with new active agents, and the interest to explore this 
drug in combination if toxicity does not become limiting. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to obtain 
data from an observational study with a representative sample of institutions to gain further 
information on the safety and efficacy in clinical practice; registry data could also be considered. 
In view of the unexpected increased risk of CMV infection observed particularly in association with 
treatment combinations and based on analogies with post-transplant patient management, the experts 
considered that regular monitoring of CMV using reverse transcription-PCR should be recommended 
and the frequency adapted depending on change in viraemia compared to baseline and clinical 
manifestations. In case of negative CMV serology at baseline, monitoring is not recommended. 
Interruption of idelalisib treatment should be considered in case of observation of CMV reactivation 
with clinical manifestations, balancing the severity of the clinical manifestations with the urgent need 
Assessment report  
EMA/586939/2016  
Page 21/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for idelalisib treatment. Once CMV with clinical manifestations has been observed, subsequent CMV 
prophylaxis should be recommended if continuing/restarting treatment with idelalisib is considered. 
When asked for its views on potential practical or clinical implications of recommending Pneumocystis 
prophylaxis throughout treatment with idelalisib, the SAG considered this measure appropriate and 
was of the view that prophylaxis should be prolonged beyond end of treatment in view of the reported 
cases. The appropriateness of prolonged prophylaxis should be considered in the context of subsequent 
therapies. The SAG considered the risk minimisation measures proposed appropriate. 
4.  Benefit-risk balance 
Zydelig (idelalisib) is a centrally authorised product and is currently indicated in combination with 
rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have 
received at least one prior therapy, or as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. Idelalisib is also indicated as monotherapy 
for the treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to two prior lines of 
treatment. The CHMP recently adopted a positive opinion to also authorise the use of idelalisib in CLL 
in combination with another anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, ofatumumab. 
This review was initiated due to a reported increased risk of death and higher incidence of serious 
adverse events (SAE) among subjects receiving idelalisib compared to the control groups observed in 
three clinical trials (GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124, GS-US-313-0125). The PRAC considered the 
new interim safety data and very limited efficacy data from three studies (-0123, -0124, -0125), that 
have been terminated, evaluating the addition of idelalisib to standard therapies in first line CLL and 
relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as well as the 
results of all other relevant trials including those that supported the above listed indications. The PRAC 
noted that in study -0123, idelalisib was administered in combination with rituximab and bendamustine 
(an unauthorised combination) in previously untreated CLL patients with and without 17p 
deletion/TP53 mutation, which is not the same population as the one in the current CLL indication in 
first line. Similarly, in studies -0124 and -0125 idelalisib was not used as monotherapy as currently 
authorised but in combination with rituximab or rituximab and bendamustine, respectively. Further, 
these two studies included patients with earlier disease characteristics than the population for which 
idelalisib is authorised. 
Idelalisib is known to cause very commonly infections and neutropenia and these risks are reflected in 
the product information. While these risks were considered acceptable due to the demonstrated 
beneficial effect observed in the studies that supported the initial marketing authorisation and later 
extension of indication, these three new studies indicate that in patients with early disease (CLL or 
iNHL) the risks (particularly of serious infection) are not outweighed by benefit. There was however no 
indication that treatment-naïve CLL patients constitute a population more at risk of developing 
idelalisib-related adverse events compared to relapsed/refractory patients. These results highlight 
nonetheless the importance of ensuring that the risk of serious infection is adequately minimised in the 
authorised indications, in line with the measures employed in studies that demonstrated the positive 
benefit-risk balance of idelalisib. In particular an increased incidence of PJP, carrying a high risk of 
morbidity and mortality, was observed in the idelalisib treatment arms compared to controls in all the 
studies, and appeared to be significantly lower in patients administered PJP prophylaxis. No low-risk 
population or risk-free period could be identified and the risk may persist after end of therapy, 
therefore, taking into account current guidelines on PJP prophylaxis and in line with the advice from 
Assessment report  
EMA/586939/2016

experts consulted during the review (SAG), the PRAC recommended that PJP prophylaxis should be 
administered to all patients throughout idelalisib treatment and prolonged afterward for up to 6 
months based on clinical judgement. CMV infections were also notably reported in the idelalisib 
treatment arms, however, in controlled studies where idelalisib was administered in combination with 
rituximab or ofatumumab and not bendamustine, the reported rate was low. Nonetheless, considering 
the seriousness of those events, and following the SAG advice, the PRAC recommended that patients 
with evidence of prior CMV infection should undergo regular clinical and laboratory monitoring and 
patients with CMV viremia should be carefully monitored. If clinical signs of CMV infection appear, 
consideration should be given to interrupting idelalisib until the infection has resolved. If the benefits of 
resuming idelalisib are judged to outweigh the risks of CMV, consideration should be given to 
administering pre-emptive CMV therapy. While CMV and PJP are important risks, in the studies they 
accounted for a relatively small proportion of the serious infections observed, therefore the PRAC 
considered that more general measures to minimise the risk of serious infections as implemented as 
part of the provisional measures were justified. In particular, PRAC recommended that treatment 
should not be initiated in patients with evidence of ongoing systemic infection, that patients should be 
monitored for respiratory signs and symptoms throughout treatment and advised to report new 
respiratory symptoms promptly. Patients’ blood counts should also be monitored during the first 6 
months of treatment, adapting the frequency to the ANC. In case of very low ANC (<500/mm3), 
treatment should be interrupted and may be resumed, at a lower dose, once this has resolved. These 
recommendations should be reflected in the product information together with a description of the 
infectious events and the MAH should conduct a study to assess healthcare practitioners’ awareness to 
these risk minimisation measures.  
The results of study -0123 are considered of limited relevance to the benefit-risk balance of idelalisib in 
the authorised CLL indication, due to the added toxicity of bendamustine. In addition, the data suggest 
that these results reflect the fact that the known toxicity of the treatment was not outweighed by its 
benefits due to the good prognosis and therefore low disease-related mortality of previously untreated 
CLL patients. However as patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation have a poor prognosis, the 
extrapolation of the positive results observed in relapsed/refractory subjects with 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation that supported the initial granting of the indication in patients unsuitable for 
chemoimmunotherapy is not questioned. Nevertheless, in view of the limited data available in this 
subset and considering availability of other options for first line treatment for CLL patients, the PRAC 
was of the view that as a precaution, idelalisib should only be used in patients with 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation if they are not eligible for any other therapies. The benefit-risk balance of idelalisib in 
combination with rituximab in treatment naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL is therefore considered to 
remain positive provided the recommended risk minimisation measures are applied. The wording of the 
indication in first line CLL should be amended to reflect the above recommendation and it should be 
specified that this is linked to the limited data available in this setting. 
For the same reasons, the relevance of the results of study -0123 is considered limited for the benefit-
risk balance of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in the same types of CLL patients. The PRAC 
concluded that the same risk minimisation measures should be applied. Following the same 
precautionary principle, in view of the limited data available in treatment naïve patients with 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation it was also considered that idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab should 
be only be used first-line in CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation who are not eligible for 
any other therapies. 
The unfavourable results of studies -0124 and -0125 reflect the use of the additional treatment related 
toxicity, which is not the same as that of the authorised use in monotherapy. Characteristics of 
patients in those studies are compatible with a good prognosis, including slow disease progression,

hence leading as in study -0123 to an unmasking of the idelalisib toxicity. Therefore while the 
relevance of these results are also limited for the authorised use in patients refractory to two prior 
lines of follicular lymphoma treatment, where idelalisib has been demonstrated to be effective and no 
other effective treatment options exist, they highlight the importance of minimising the risk of serious 
infection. The PRAC considered that the benefit-risk balance in this indication remained positive 
provided the risk minimisation measures are implemented. In addition as no controlled study was 
conducted in this indication, in view of the importance of the risk of serious infections, the MAH should 
conduct a post-authorisation safety study to collect additional safety data in those patients.  
The PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance in the authorised indications remained positive, 
provided that first line treatment with idelalisib is only used in patients with 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation that are not eligible for any other therapies and that changes are implemented in the product 
information to minimise the risk of serious infections. The PRAC considered that these measures should 
be applied for the use of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab in CLL patients. 
5.  Risk management 
The MAH should operate a risk management system described in a risk management plan which has 
been endorsed as part of the current review procedure. The PRAC considered that “serious infections 
including opportunistic infections such as PJP and CMV” should be added as an important identified risk 
as well as “off label use” in first line CLL therapy in patients without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation and 
early line iNHL therapy. 
5.1.  Pharmacovigilance activity 
5.1.1.  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires 
The PRAC considered that targeted questionnaires to collect additional follow-up information on 
reported serious infections and PJP cases should be implemented. Their results should be discussed in 
future periodic safety update reports (PSURs).  
5.1.2.  Non-interventional studies 
A survey of European HCPs was proposed by the MAH to measure the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures implemented in this procedure. The MAH is required to submit the protocol of 
this category 3 study to the EMA for assessment by the PRAC, within 3 months of adoption of the 
European Commission decision. 
In addition, in view of the results of studies GS-US-313-0124 and -0125 and as the study supporting 
the initial marketing authorisation in treatment of refractory FL did not include a control arm, the MAH 
is required to collect more safety data on these patients through an observational study. To this end, 
the MAH should consider establishing a registry or collaborating with an established one. The protocol 
of this category 3 study should also be submitted to the EMA for assessment by the PRAC, within 3 
months of adoption of the European Commission decision.

5.2.  Risk minimisation activities  
5.2.1.  Amendments to the product information 
The PRAC considered that routine risk minimisation measures in the form of updates to the product 
information would be necessary in order to minimise the risk of serious infections associated with the 
use of idelalisib. These changes refined those implemented in the provisional measures in March 20168 
and include amendments to sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The indication in first line treatment of CLL was revised to only allow treatment of adult patients with 
17p deletion or TP53 mutation who are not eligible for any other therapies. It was further explained 
that this is linked to the limited availability of data in this patient population. 
Warnings and precautions of use relating to the PJP and CMV risks associated with the use of idelalisib 
were also refined. The risk of serious infection was described and further qualified. 
The Package Leaflet was amended accordingly. In addition, the opportunity was taken to correct the 
local representatives of Slovakia and Slovenia in the Package Leaflet of the 100 mg strength in the 
English and Croatian languages. 
5.2.2.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communications/Communication 
plan 
A DHPC was disseminated in March 2016 based on the very limited and preliminary data available, to 
inform about the recommended temporary precautionary restrictions in the use of idelalisib and the 
additional monitoring requirements. A DHPC with updated information further to this thorough review 
was considered needed and the PRAC therefore adopted the wording of a Direct Healthcare 
Professional Communication to inform healthcare professionals of additional information identified 
during the review, including the indication in combination with rituximab for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation who are not eligible for any 
other therapies, the prolonged need for PJP prophylaxis and more adapted CMV monitoring 
requirements. The PRAC also agreed on a communication plan. 
6.  Grounds for Recommendation 
Whereas, 
•

• 
The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting 
from pharmacovigilance data for Zydelig (idelalisib). 
The PRAC reviewed the preliminary data provided by the marketing authorisation holder on the 
interim results of studies GS-US-312-0123, GS-US-313-0124, GS-US-313-0125 that suggested 
an increased risk of death and serious infection with idelalisib. The PRAC also reviewed all the 
other relevant data presented by the MAH and the views expressed by the oncology scientific 
advisory group. 
The PRAC noted that studies -0123, -0124 and -0125 involved patient groups and treatment 
combinations different from those of the authorised indications of Zydelig. The PRAC 
considered the results of these studies of limited relevance for the benefit-risk balance of

idelalisib in its authorised indications and ongoing extension of indication in combination with 
ofatumumab for the treatment of CLL. Nevertheless, as a precaution and in view of the fact 
that limited data are available in treatment-naïve CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation, the PRAC recommended that idelalisib should only be used in this group of patients if 
they are not eligible for any other therapies. 
• 
The PRAC noted that most of the serious adverse events reported in studies -0123, -0124 and 
-0125 were related to infections. The PRAC considered that further minimisation measures of 
the known risk of infection related to the use of idelalisib were necessary. To this effect, the 
PRAC recommended that treatment with idelalisib should not be initiated in patients with 
evidence of systemic infections, that patients should be monitored for respiratory symptoms 
and that they should be administered Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis 
throughout and after idelalisib treatment. Regular clinical and laboratory monitoring for 
cytomegalovirus infection is also recommended in patients with evidence of prior infection. In 
addition, neutrophil count monitoring is recommended. In the event of severe neutropenia, 
treatment should be interrupted and may be restarted at a lower dose upon resolution. 
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of Zydelig remains 
favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information.  
The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations for Zydelig.

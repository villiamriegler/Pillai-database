1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance, for MOUNJARO, as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in 
adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 
kg/m2 (obesity), or ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 
(overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-
related comorbid condition, based on a global, 
pivotal phase 3 study I8F-MC-GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) 
and five supportive phase 3 studies (SURPASS-1 to -
5) in participants with T2DM and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. 
SURMOUNT-1 is a phase 3, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of tirzepatide once weekly in 
participants without type 2 diabetes who have 
obesity or are overweight with weight related 
comorbidities. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.1 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial 
changes to the PI.

n/a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
This worksharing variation is being submitted to 
present and discuss the results of Study F1J-MC-
B034 Pregnancy Registry to meet the commitment 
made during the previous procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/WS1527/G which received positive CHMP 
opinion on 25 July 2019. 
As a consequence of the submission of the F1J-MC-
B034 Study Report, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
for duloxetine has been updated. 
The RMP for all Lilly duloxetine products are 
combined. The changes introduced are not specific to 
one product and are therefore the same for all 
products.

Submission of the final report from study F1J-MC-

investigate the association between duloxetine 
exposure and suicide-related behaviours and ideation 
duloxetine treatment in women with stress urinary 
inconsistence (SUI) compared to women with SUI without 
duloxetine treatment has been assessed in study F1J-MC-

the results the association between the risk of suicidality 
and duloxetine treatment cannot be completely ruled out. 
Currently, the risk of suicidality is an important identified 
risk for duloxetine-containing products and adequate

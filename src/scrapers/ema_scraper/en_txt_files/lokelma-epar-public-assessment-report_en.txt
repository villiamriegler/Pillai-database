1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant ZS Texas Ltd submitted on 3 December 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Lokelma, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP 
on 22 May 2014.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Lokelma is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients, acute and extended use.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0210/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0210/2014 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance sodium zirconium cyclosilicate contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 15/11/2015, 24/07/2014 and 19/09/2013. The

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hyperkalaemia is the presence of an abnormally high concentration of potassium in the blood. Most data on 
the occurrence of hyperkalaemia have been obtained from studies of hospitalised patients, and the incidence 
ranges from 1 to 10%. There is no agreed definition of hyperkalaemia, since the raised level of potassium at 
which a treatment should be initiated has not been established. The European Resuscitation Council 
guidelines consider hyperkalaemia to be a serum potassium (S-K) level > 5.5 mmol/L, with mild elevations 
defined as 5.5 to 5.9 mmol/L, moderate as 6.0-6.4 mmol/L, and severe as ≥ 6.5 mmol/L. The guidelines also 
note that extracellular potassium levels are usually between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L, which is considered the 
normal range for adults. However, a number of recent retrospective studies have shown the risk of mortality 
is increased even with only modest elevations of S-K. Mortality risk has been shown to be significantly higher 
in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with S-K levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In acute myocardial infarction 
patients, a mean postadmission S-K ≥ 5.5 mmol/L during hospitalisation corresponded to a 12-fold increase 
in death compared with S-K levels between 3.5 and 4.5 mmol/L but, more importantly, S-K levels between 
4.5 and 5.0 mmol/L, which is within the normal range, were associated with a 2-fold increased risk of 
mortality compared with S-K between 3.5 and 4.5 mmol/L.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Hyperkalemia develops when there is insufficient elimination, excessive intake, or shift of potassium from the 
intracellular space. Insufficient elimination, which is the most common cause of hyperkalaemia, can be 
hormonal (as in aldosterone deficiency), pharmacologic (e.g. treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors [ACEs], angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs], mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) or, most 
commonly, due to reduced kidney function. Often, the cause is multifactorial (e.g. reduced kidney function 
combined with drug treatment such as ACEs or ARBs). Increased extracellular potassium levels result in 
depolarization of the membrane potential of cells. This depolarization opens some voltage gated sodium 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 7/103 
  
  
  
 
channels, but not enough to generate an action potential. After a short period of time, the open sodium 
channels inactivate and become refractory, increasing the threshold required to generate an action potential. 
The subsequent impairment of neuromuscular, cardiac, and gastrointestinal organ systems is responsible for 
the symptoms observed with hyperkalaemia. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Symptoms of hyperkalaemia are non-specific and generally include malaise and muscle weakness or signs of 
cardiac arrhythmias such as palpitations, bradycardia, or tachycardia. Hyperkalaemia is detected via blood 
testing, often during routine screening for a medical disorder or after complications (such as cardiac 
arrhythmias) have developed. Of greatest concern is the effect of hyperkalaemia on the cardiac system, 
where impairment of cardiac conduction sometimes leads to fatal cardiac arrhythmias such as asystole or 
ventricular fibrillation. Because of the potential for fatal cardiac arrhythmias, severe hyperkalaemia 
represents an acute metabolic emergency that must be immediately corrected.  
2.1.4.  Management 
Two ion-exchange resins, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS), are 
currently authorized for use in the European Union (EU), although their efficacy have never been 
demonstrated in controlled trials. Neither SPS nor CPS are useful in the acute setting because the drug must 
reach the colon in order to exert an effect and, thus, time to onset is too slow to make a meaningful impact 
in patients with severe hyperkalaemia. In addition, due to their ionic contents, SPS can cause sodium 
overload and CPS can cause hypercalcemia and calcium loading. As both SPS and CPS bind magnesium, 
hypomagnesaemia can occur, whereas SPS also binds calcium potentially causing hypocalcaemia. Other 
currently used treatments in the acute setting, such as insulin/dextrose and beta-receptor agonists like 
albuterol, are not approved by the EU for hyperkalaemia and have several limitations, the most important 
being that the effect is transient and does not eliminate surplus potassium. Also, neither SPS nor CPS is 
suitable for continuous maintenance treatment due to poor tolerability, as they require administration with a 
laxative, such as sorbitol, to induce diarrhea to avoid severe constipation. Hence, poor gastrointestinal 
tolerability typically makes chronic administration difficult. 
About the product 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) has been developed as treatment for hyperkalaemia. The indication 
applied for is: Treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients, acute and extended use. ZS is an inorganic 
cation exchange crystalline compound. ZS has a high capacity to selectively entrap monovalent cations, 
specifically excess potassium and ammonium ions, over divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium, in 
the gastrointestinal tract. The high specificity of ZS for potassium is attributable to the chemical composition 
and diameter of the micro pores, which act in an analogous manner to the selectivity filter utilized by 
physiologic potassium channels. The exchange with potassium ions occurs throughout the gastrointestinal 
tract with onset in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. The trapped potassium ions are excreted from 
the body via the faeces, thereby reducing any excess and resolving hyperkalaemia. As claimed by the 
applicant, ZS demonstrates improved capacity, selectivity, and speed for entrapping excess potassium over 
currently available options for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. The proposed commercial formulation of ZS is 
a non-absorbed, insoluble, white crystalline powder for suspension with a specific particle size distribution

profile. The proposed starting dose of ZS for reversal of hyperkalaemia (when serum potassium is > 5.0 
mmol/l) is up to 10 g/day, divided in 3 doses (TID) to achieve normokalaemia.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for oral suspension containing 5 g or 10 g of sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate as active substance. The finished product contains no excipients. 
The product is available in sachets of a PET/LDPE/LLDPE/aluminium foil laminate as described in section 6.5 
of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is hydrogen sodium zirconium (IV) silicate hydrate. Due to the 
natural variability in the manufacturing process of the active substance, it is expected to have the formula 
Na~1.5H~0.5ZrSi3O9 • 2–3 H2O and relative molecular mass in the range of 390.5 – 408.5. The WHO chose not 
to designate an INN for the active substance, and a USAN sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is used throughout 
the dossier and this CHMP AR. The active substance has the following structure: 
Figure 1. Stick-and-ball (left) and polyhedral (right) unit cell structural representation of the main 
framework of the microporous sodium zirconium cyclosilicate active substance. Red = zirconium, green = 
silicon, blue = oxygen atoms. Cations are not pictured. 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 9/103 
  
  
  
 
 
The structure of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a cubic cell arrangement of octahedrally coordinated Zr and 
tetrahedrally coordinated Si units that interconnect through oxygen bridges as Zr–O–Si and Si–O–Si. The two 
types of units are observed in a ratio 1:3, respectively, and repeat orderly to form a three-dimensional 
framework characteristic of the compound. The framework acquires its negative charge from the octahedral 
fractions, [ZrO6]2–, and features channels and cavities that interconnect and locate the positive ions that 
counter-balance the negative charge of the framework. Electrostatic interactions between the framework and 
the cations allow for mobility and possibility of exchange with other cations that would fit and pass the free 
pore openings of ~ 3.0 Å. The uniform micropore structure allows a high exchange capacity and selectivity 
for potassium (K+) and ammonium (NH4
selectivity features responsible for its mode of action. In vitro characterisation of ion selectivity of sodium 
+) cations, providing the compound with its distinctive ion-exchange 
zirconium cyclosilicate was provided by the applicant and considered satisfactory. 
The structure of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was confirmed using synchrotron powder diffraction, standard 
X-ray powder diffraction, 29Si magic angle spinning solid nuclear magnetic resonance studies (29Si-MAS-
NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, 
wave dispersive X-ray microprobe analysis and thermo-gravimetric analysis. Calculations using proprietary 
software were also used for structure elucidation. 
The active substance is a white crystalline powder. Bonding interactions in the main framework are 
considered primarily of covalent nature, with some ionic contribution due to the difference in electronegativity 
between Si–O and Zr–O. The covalent bonding interactions in all directions within the crystals make sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate a compound insoluble in water or in organic solvents. It is neither hygroscopic nor 
sensitive to light and it is resistant to heat. 
During the hydrothermal synthesis, the possibility that other crystalline phases are formed exists. The 
observed crystalline forms are controlled by the manufacturing process parameters and release 
specifications. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is considered to be a new active substance. The applicant demonstrated that 
neither it, nor its derivatives have ever been active substances in medicinal products authorised in the EU. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A single manufacturer carries out the entire process. The active substance is manufactured using a 
hydrothermal synthesis process. 
The process was developed using QbD elements although no design space or other regulatory flexibility is 
requested. Critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance 
were identified. Based on this work, adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. 
The specifications and control methods for starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.

The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (FT-IR, XRPD), potassium 
exchange capacity (ion chromatography), crystalline impurities (XRPD), limit of acetate (HPLC), Zr content 
(WD-XRF), Si content (WD-XRF), Na content (WD-XRF), Hf content (WD-XRF), pH (potentiometry), moisture 
content (TGA), particle size (laser diffraction) and elemental impurities (ICP-MS). 
The release specification is in accordance with the permissible daily exposures (based on a 10 g dose) for oral 
dosage forms as defined by ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for the active substance and impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
Stability 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for commercial production were 
provided. Data on three batches was provided for 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH 
and for up to 9 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. Data 
on three batches was provided for 12 months under long term conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 12 
months under conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. Additional supporting data was 
provided on four batches (including three batches from an additional manufacturer used in early development 
stages) for 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 9 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity (XRPD), potassium exchange capacity, moisture 
content and particle size. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability 
indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no trends were observed. 
Forced degradation studies including forced oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, acid and base conditions, 
thermal degradation and photolysis were also performed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on three batches. All results remained 
within specification and no trends were observed indicating good photostability. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored at or below 30 ºC in

the proposed container, double colourless low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags inside a rigid opaque outer 
container/ drum. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a powder for oral suspension containing 5 g or 10 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 
as active substance. It is readily suspended in water with stirring or swirling. 
Powder for oral suspension was selected as the optimal dosage form based on posology requirements. Data 
was provided to demonstrate that the dose volume, the dosing container, the method of mixing and the 
order of addition of the finished product and water had no significant effect on the percentage of the dose of 
the product delivered. 
The active substance is completely insoluble. Polymorphism is controlled within the active substance 
manufacturing process and in the active substance specifications. It was demonstrated that there is no 
conversion to other crystalline forms on storage. 
The finished product manufacturing encompasses only the filling and packaging processes of the active 
substance. 
The active substance was packaged in three different container closure systems (bulk bottle, single-use bottle 
and pouched material) throughout the clinical program. The differences in packaging presentations or the 
processes used to fill the finished product did not influence the performance of the product. 
The primary packaging is PET/LDPE/LLDPE/aluminium foil laminate. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: filling and sealing of the pouches containing the neat 
active substance. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Two manufacturers are 
involved in the process. 
Full process validation will be completed in line with the provided protocol, encompassing a minimum of three 
consecutive commercial scale batches prior to the distribution of the finished product, which was found 
acceptable and in line with the guidelines. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a 
number of studies. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of the 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identity (FT-IR, XRPD), potassium exchange capacity (ion chromatography), Zr content (WD-XRF), Si content 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 12/103 
  
  
  
(WD-XRF),  Na  content  (WD-XRF),  Hf  content  (WD-XRF),  moisture  content  (TGA),  particle  size  (laser 
diffraction), average delivered weight and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
The finished product contains only the active substance, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. The specifications 
have been established according to physico-chemical characteristics and properties of the crystalline active 
substance. The finished product is released to the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for the active substance 
and impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Additional supportive results were provided for 30 commercial and pilot scale batches used in the pre—clinical 
and clinical studies. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of the finished product of each strength stored under long 
term conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for 18 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH, for 12 months at 30 ºC 
/  75%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  In  addition,  supportive  data  was  provided  on  pilot  scale  batches  of  the  finished 
product stored in HDPE Bottles for 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 9 months under accelerated 
conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH.  The  batches  of  Lokelma  in  the  primary  stability  study  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity (XRPD), potassium exchange capacity, moisture 
content  and  particle  size.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  were  stability 
indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no trends were observed. 
Forced  degradation  studies  performed  on  the  active  substance  were  considered  applicable  to  the  finished 
product as it contains no excipients. Compatibility with the container closure system was  validated with the 
provided stability data. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on three batches. All results remained 
within specification and no trends were observed indication good photostability. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Lokelma is a non-sterile powder for oral suspension containing the active substance, sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate only. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate forms part of a family of compounds that feature specific ion 
exchange properties. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is white, non-soluble, non-absorbed, inorganic crystalline 
powder with a uniform micropore structure allowing a high exchange capacity and selectivity for potassium 
(K+) and ammonium (NH4
+) cations, responsible for its mode of action. 
GMP Inspection 
On 17 March 2017, EMA was made aware of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refusal of the 
AstraZeneca New Drug Application for Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate). The FDA Complete Response 
Letter (CRL), issued on 16 March 2017, stated that the active substance manufacturing, release and stability 
testing facility (ZS Pharma Inc., Coppell, TX, USA) was found to be GMP non-compliant. 
Manufacturers of chemical APIs in 3rd countries are not routinely inspected during the evaluation as the 
legislation place on the manufacturing authorisation holders the responsibility to use active substances that 
have been manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice for active substances. Further to 
this new information, the CHMP expressed concerns at its March 2017 plenary meeting on the possible 
impact of the FDA findings on the marketing authorisation application for Lokelma and asked the European 
Commission services to consider returning the Opinion in order to allow the CHMP to assess the possible 
impact of the FDA inspection findings on the marketing authorisation application. 
During its plenary meeting on 18-21 April 2017, having discussed the possible impact of the FDA findings on 
the marketing authorisation application for Lokelma, the CHMP adopted a request for a GMP inspection of the 
active substance manufacturing, release and stability testing facility (ZS Pharma Inc., Coppell, TX, USA). 
The purpose of the inspection was to verify the compliance of the manufacturer with the principles of the EU 
GMP Part II and relevant GMP Annexes. 
The inspection was performed by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) on 25-29 September 2017 and the 
inspection report was issued on 11 January 2018.  
A total of seventeen deficiencies were raised, five of which were categorised as major. After reviewing the 
answers provided to the initial report, AIFA concluded that the site operates in general compliance with the 
European Good Manufacturing Practice, and issued a GMP Certificate for the site, valid until 31 January 2019, 
with certain follow up activities (e.g. provision of a final cleaning validation report) due by October 2018. 
On 1 January 2018 the legal ownership of ZS Pharma was officially transferred to AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals LP, in which name the Certificate was issued.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lokelma contains the active substance sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for oral suspension that is a 
microporous zirconium silicate with a high exchange capacity and selectivity for potassium (K+) and 
ammonium (NH4+) cations. It is developed for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. As stated by the applicant 
with respect to nonclinical studies, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was evaluated in a programme of 
pharmacology and toxicology studies that conformed to current regulatory guidance and scientific standards, 
with pivotal safety studies conducted in compliance with GLP regulations. Based on the results of the 
nonclinical pharmacology and safety studies in animals, oral administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 
is expected to provide therapeutic benefit and to have a reasonable safety margin when used as directed to 
treat hyperkaliaemic patients. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The non-clinical development was performed predominantly with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) but 
some early pharmacology and toxicity studies of ≤ 14-days duration employed the material (designated ZS-
9). The differences between ZS and ZS-9 are the sodium counter-ion content, the particle size distribution 
and the pH of the aqueous suspensions. 
The applicant presented data from 9 sources from studies in vitro and in vivo in rats. The pharmacology 
(non-GLP) data show the experimental potassium exchange capacity (KEC) value. The sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate cation exchange has been shown to be highly selective for small monovalent ions such as sodium 
(Na+), hydrogen (H+), potassium (K+) and ammonium (NH4+) while divalent cations such as calcium 
(Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are not exchanged to any significant extent. The high selectivity for K+ is 
attributed to the dimensions and possibly the chemical configuration of the micro pores. 
In vitro studies in the presence of mixed ion media containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ show that, unlike sodium 
polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), the KEC of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and ZS-9 is essentially unaffected by 
the presence of these ions and is ~9-fold higher than that of SPS when these ions are present. In contrast, 
SPS was found to selectively take up Ca2+ in preference to K+. The effect of pH on the KEC in different 
media, buffered to mimic the physiological conditions in different areas of the human gastrointestinal tract 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 15/103 
  
  
  
showed minimal effects except at low concentrations under conditions of low pH. At a pH of approximately 
1.2 (simulated gastric fluid; SGF) and at concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, the binding capacity of ZS-9 
was decreased by 91% and 67% respectively, compared to the binding capacity observed in water. There 
was no effect on the KEC at the 50 mg/ml concentration. The decreased exchange at the lower 
concentrations is attributed to the high H+/K+ ratio, which would favour proton exchange over potassium 
uptake. Time-course studies to examine the effect of pH on the ion exchange properties of sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate at a concentration of ~2 mg/ml showed there was no measurable K+ uptake in SGF. In 
simulated small intestinal fluid (pH ~4.5; SIF), there was an immediate uptake of K+ followed by a small 
release; with equilibrium reached in about 20 minutes and in simulated large intestinal fluid (pH 6.8), there 
was a rapid uptake of K+ during the first 10 minutes, followed by a slower uptake over the next hour. These 
results show that while potassium exchange in the stomach may be limited and depend on the concentration 
of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate present, potassium exchange will occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract 
and the equilibrium will occur quite rapidly. 
In vivo, the administration of ZS-9 decreased the urinary excretion of potassium and urea nitrogen and 
increased the fecal excretion of potassium and urea nitrogen in a dose dependent manner when administered 
in the diet to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses up to 6 g/kg/day. These changes were accompanied by 
corresponding increases in urinary sodium concentration and decreases in faecal sodium excretion. There was 
no effect on the urinary and faecal concentrations of calcium and magnesium. The serum concentrations of 
all these electrolytes remained unchanged. In the GLP toxicity studies in dogs, oral administration of sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate also decreased the urinary fractional excretion of potassium (FE-K) in a dose 
dependent manner by 85-95% and significantly reduced the serum potassium concentration at the highest 
doses when administered at 1000 mg/kg/tid for 28 days or at 2000 mg/kg/day for 9 months. These dosages, 
equivalent to a human dose of ~97 g/day and ~65 g/day, respectively, also resulted in hypokalaemia in 
some animals, demonstrating that orally administered sodium zirconium cyclosilicate removes potassium 
from the body. 
Presented studies indicate that oral administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can effectively remove 
potassium from the body. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
For the secondary pharmacodynamics development, the applicant presented one study results on ZS water 
absorption and swelling capacity. ZS has little water absorption capacity and does not swell compared with 
other preparations, which is an attribute that may account for the very low gastrointestinal adverse event 
profile. The applicant stated that ZS is not expected to be absorbed due to its insolubility and no interactions 
with secondary targets are expected. Hence, no in vitro secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been 
conducted. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant presented bridged data from toxicology studies in beagle dogs. Treatment with ZS-9 had no 
effect on respiration rate or ECG parameters when administered for 14 days at total daily dosages of up to 
4,479 mg/kg (1493 mg/kg/tid; study 14250-10), which is equivalent to a human dose of ~145g/day. ZS also 
had no effect on qualitative ECG parameters, heart rate, RR or PR intervals or QRS duration when 
administered for 28 days at dosages up to 3000 mg/kg/day or for 270 days at dosages up to 2000 
mg/kg/day. A slight increase in the QTc interval, that was not considered clinically meaningful, was observed 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 16/103 
  
  
  
in females at the 1000 mg/kg tid dose in the 28-day study and was considered secondary to the sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate-induced hypokalemia in these animals, as it was not observed in animals treated with 
the same dose of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate that received potassium supplementation or in a second 28-
day study used to qualify some of the possible different silicate phases produced in the manufacturing 
process where no animals became hypokalemic. No adverse effects were noted on the central nervous 
system or gastric motility in any of the rat and dog GLP toxicity studies, in which rats and dogs were treated 
for 14-days with ZS-9 or up to 180 days (rats) or 270-days (dogs) with ZS. 
From the provided results of the nonclinical pharmacology in vivo and safety studies in animals, oral 
administration of ZS is expected to provide therapeutic benefit and to have a sufficient safety margin when 
used as directed to treat hyperkalemic patients. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
There has been no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. This is acceptable to the 
CHMP as potential such interactions are more likely at pharmacokinetic level rather than pharmacodynamic. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Due to its inorganic composition, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, is not subject to enzymatic metabolism and 
due to its insolubility and particle size it is in not a substrate for transporter processes, has no effect of 
cytochrome P450 metabolism or induction and is systemically not absorbed. The lack of any significant 
absorption is confirmed by analysis of dog whole blood and urine in which no Zr could be detected following 9 
months of daily administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate at a dose of 2000 mg/kg/day, equivalent to a 
human dose of ~65g/day based on a 60 kg body weight. In a rat mass balance study 97-99% of the 
administered Zr dose was excreted in the faeces within 48 hours of administration. 
No significant amounts of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) elements were found to leach from the API 
following incubation in USP SGF and USP SIF. Of the five elements listed per USP <232> testing that were 
detected in the Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF) and Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) supernatants, the amount 
of each element released was ≤ 1 µg/g sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for aluminium, chromium copper, 
molybdenum, nickel and palladium and well below the permissible daily exposure limits for these elements 
when sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is administered at the 5g to 30g dose range. The potential amount of 
silicon exposure following administration of 5-30 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate ranged from ~1 to 10% 
of the total estimated silicon intake/day and the average amount of zirconium released per gram of sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate for batches manufactured at the commercial scale was less than 0.5% of the average 
daily zirconium intake. Overall, these data indicate that exposure to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate over the 
proposed 5-30 g dose range does not demonstrate a significant risk of exposure to elemental leaching for 
USP <232> elements, silicon, zirconium, hafnium or aluminum.  
The applicant presented drug drug interaction (DDI) test results with drugs from various therapeutic classes 
such as: aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, docusate sodium, propranolol 
hydrochloride, captopril, losartan potassium, digoxin, levothyroxine sodium, lithium carbonate, lanthanum 
carbonate, docusate sodium, furosemide, glipizide, lisinopril, metformin HCl, quinapril HCl, spironolactone, 
valsartan, sevelamer carbonate, atorvastatin calcium, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, clopidogrel, ketoconazole, 
prednisone, warfarin sodium, allopurinol, amlodipine besylate, acetilsalicylic acid, cyclosporine, dabigatran 
etexilate, phenytoin. In vitro tests were performed according to GLP requirements using USP dissolution 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 17/103 
  
  
  
methods as well as aqueous solutions that covered the physiologic range of pH expected within the 
gastrointestinal tract. There was no evidence of uptake/binding with the exception of calcium and lithium ions 
where uptake was attributed to the high ion concentration and the absence/low level of other competing ions. 
Both, decreases and increases in the tested medicine concentration of >10% were noted in various media in 
the presence of ZS for atorvastatin calcium, dabigatran etexilate, clopidogrel, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, 
furosemide, Al(OH)3, MgCO3, glipizide, ketoconazole, levothyroxine sodium, losartan potassium, valsartan. 
Based on the pH solubility profile and pH study data all changes were attributed to the ZS-induced change in 
the pH of the media and not to uptake/binding by ZS. The KEC of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was 
unaffected by the presence of other drug substances with the possible exception of lithium carbonate 
capsules, USP 300 mg where a 10 - 12% decrease was noted. This minor decrease was attributed to the high 
lithium: potassium ratio (100:1) in the test solution. 
During follow-up Scientific Advice procedure, the applicant was advised to provide data on any in-vitro 
interaction with hot fluids and a selection of beverages. Since such data seemed missing, the CHMP 
requested these during the procedure and the applicant was asked to discuss the potential correlation of ZS 
and hot fluids and beverages or to present sufficient justification of the lack of this data (see section 2.3.6). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology

Major findings 
Treatment with ZS-9 did not result in moribundity or mortality. There was 
a test article-related increase in plasma mean prothrombin time (PT) in M 
and F from Group 4 when compared to control Group 1. Treatment with 
ZS-9 did not result in abnormal gross findings, alterations on absolute or 
relative organ weights. Conclusion: Oral dose MTD (maximum 
tolerated dose) for ZS-9 is 2000 mg/kg/day. 
No effect on mortality and no adverse clinical signs. Conclusion: gavage 
administration of ZS-9 at up to 2000mg/kg/dose is suitable for use 
in a 14-day repeat dose study. 
Thirty-two rats died on study (4 M and 5 F at 0 mg/kg/dose, 5 M and 2 F 
at 400 mg/kg/dose, 3 M and 5 F at 800 mg/kg/dose and 4 M and 4 Fat 
1600 mg/kg/dose). All deaths were attributed to gavage error and were 
not test article related. 
Clinical signs: Clinical findings were related to issues with the gavage 
procedure and errors and not test article related. 
Body Weight: ZS-9 administration had no effect on body weight. A 
decrease in body weight gain across all dose groups including control 
compared to pre-trial during the 14-day dosing period was attributed to 
the volume of the dose formulation. 
Food Consumption: A reduction in mean daily food consumption was 
observed for both the 0 mg/kg/dose (Control) group as well as all the 
groups administered ZS-9. This reduction in food consumption is most 
likely reflective of animals receiving a 10 mL/kg dose volume, three times 
a day. 
Hematology: At Day 15/16 and Day 25, there were no alterations in 
hematologic values for M and F that were related to ZS-9 administration. 
At Day 15/16, there was a statistically significant increase in LUC (large 
unstained cells) for M at 1600 mg/kg/dose and a statistically significant 
increase in absolute eosinophil count for F at 1600 mg/kg/dose. Both 
alterations were of low magnitude and were not toxicologically relevant to 
ZS-9 administration. There were several animals in each group that had 
hypochromasia (HYPO) of red blood cells noted. However, there were no 
accompanying changes in hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. 
Therefore, these red blood cell morphology changes were of no relevance 
and unrelated to ZS-9 administration. 
Clinical Chemistry: no alterations in serum chemistry values for M and F 
that were related to ZS-9 administration. For the remaining parameters, a 
few were statistically significant at either Day 15, Day 16 or Day 25. These

Major findings 
included a statistically significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
for M at 800 mg/kg/dose and F at 400 mg/kg/dose and 800 mg/kg/dose; a 
statistically significant decrease in glucose (GLU) for F at 400 mg/kg/dose; 
and a statistically significant decrease in potassium (K) for M at 1600 
mg/kg/dose at Day 25. These alterations were either of low magnitude 
and/or showed no dose-related patterns or trends to suggest they were 
toxicologically relevant or associated with ZS-9 administration. 
Urinalysis: a statistically significant decrease in specific gravity for M at 
400 mg/kg/dose; Overall urinary potassium was decreased by 35 to 55% 
in M and 32 to 49% in F. Mean urinary urea nitrogen concentration largest 
decreases of ~ 50% were seen at the 400 mg/kg/dose falling to ~10% at 
the 1600 mg/kg/dose. 
Dose-related increases in urinary sodium concentration were observed in M 
treated with ≥ 400 mg/kg/dose and in F treated with ≥ 800mg/kg/dose. 
The decreases in urinary potassium and urea nitrogen concentrations and 
increase in urinary sodium concentration were considered to be due to the 
cation exchange properties of ZS-9 and were not considered toxicologically 
adverse. Increases in the urine pH (pH ≥ 9) were noted in M and F rats 
treated with ZS-9 across all dose groups. 
Microscopic: At Day 15/16 there were a few microscopic findings of 
minimal to slight extent involving the urinary bladder that occurred with 
slightly increased incidence and/or intensity in test article-treated M 
(Group 2, 3, and 4) and F (Group 4) as compared to their respective 
vehicle-treated controls (Group 1). The more notable findings included: 
acute inflammation in Group 4 M and F; and dose related mononuclear cell 
infiltration and mucosal hyperplasia in M of Groups 2, 3, and 4. The 
presence of mucosal hyperplasia with accompanying inflammatory cell 
infiltrates was likely a consequence of irritation of the urinary bladder 
mucosa. A definitive relationship between these urinary bladder findings 
and ZS-9 treatment was uncertain. Following the 10-day recovery period, 
there were no microscopic observations involving the urinary bladder in 
Group 6 M and F suggesting reversibility of these possible ZS-9- related 
findings.

Major findings 
Motrality: No 
Clinical signs : Light coloured faeces were recorded in some of the animals 
receiving ZS. In animals receiving 3000 mg/kg/day this was recorded in 
4/10 M and 6/10 F during Week 1. In animals receiving 6000 mg/kg/day 
this was noted in the majority of M throughout the treatment period and in 
3/15 F during Week 1. The finding was not noted in animals receiving 900 
mg/kg/day or those receiving 2000 mg/kg/day. 
Body Weight: no body weight differences that were considered to be 
related to treatment with ZS. 
Food Consumption: Food consumption was unaffected by treatment with 
ZS. 
Hematology: Haematology parameters were unaffected by treatment with 
ZS. The only differences in haematology parameters potentially related to 
ZS were slightly lower red blood cell mass to plasma ratios in F receiving 
2000 mg/kg/day or 6000 mg/kg/day (2000 mg/kg/dose TID), reflected in 
lower group mean red blood cell counts, haemoglobin concentrations, and 
haematocrits, when compared with controls. 
Clinical Chemistry: Clinical chemistry was unaffected by treatment with ZS. 
There were a few statistically significant differences in group mean clinical 
chemistry parameters compared with controls. These included a slightly 
lower sodium concentration in F receiving 900 mg/kg/day, slightly lower 
concentrations of urea, triglycerides, and sodium in F receiving 3000 
mg/kg/day, and slightly lower triglyceride concentrations and higher 
chloride concentrations in F receiving 2000 mg/kg/day or 6000 mg/kg/day. 
Urinalysis: ZS treatment resulted in dose-related effects on the urinary 
excretion of electrolyte.  Sodium (UNa) and the sodium:creatinine ratio 
(NaC-R) were higher and potassium (UK), the potassium:creatinine ratio 
(KC-R) and chloride (UCl) and chloride:creatinine ratio (ClC-R) were lower, 
when compared with controls. A statistically significant lower 
urea:creatinine ratio was noted in F receiving 2000 mg/kg/day and 3000 
mg/kg/day, when compared with controls. Urinary pH was statistically 
significantly lower in M receiving 2000 or 6000 mg/kg/day (2000 
mg/kg/dose TID), when compared with controls. 
Gross Pathology: no test article-related gross findings noted. The gross 
findings observed were considered incidental, of the nature commonly 
observed in this strain and age of rat, and/or were of similar incidence in 
control and treated animals and, therefore, were considered unrelated to 
administration of ZS. 
Microscopic: no test article-related microscopic findings were noted. The 
microscopic findings observed were considered incidental, of the nature 
commonly observed in this strain and age of rat, and/or were of similar

during the observation period. Pale coloured faeces were recorded only in 
animals receiving 6000 mg/kg/day of ZS. This was recorded from Day 32 
with the finding recorded in all male cages from Day 50. In F this finding 
was recorded in all cages from Day 36. ZS is insoluble in aqueous media 
and would not be expected to be systemically absorbed. The change in the 
colour of the faeces of some animals was considered due to the excretion 
of ZS. 
Body Weight: no body weight differences that were considered to be 
related to treatment with ZS. 
Food Consumption: Food consumption was unaffected by treatment with 
ZS. 
Clinical Chemistry: 
* At Week 13 and Week 26, lower mean plasma potassium concentrations 
in M dosed with 6000 mg/kg/day, and at Week 13, in F that dosed with 
≥3000mg/kg/day; 
* At Week 13, lower mean plasma urea in F that received ≥3000 
mg/kg/day, and at Week 26 in F that received 6000 mg/kg/day; 
* At Week 26, minimally lower mean plasma sodium in sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate-treated F; 
* At Week 26, minimally lower mean plasma chloride in M treated with

and without correction for creatinine of up to 390% (M) and 212% (F); 
* Dose-related increases in mean urinary chloride, with and without 
correction for creatinine, at Week 13 in sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-
treated M, and at Week 26, in M that received ≥3000 mg/kg/day;

≥3000 mg/kg/day and F treated with ≥1000 mg/kg/day at Week 26. 
Following correction for creatinine significant decreases were observed in F 
treated with 6000 mg/kg/day at Week 13 and ≥ 3000 mg/kg at Week 26; 
* Slightly higher urinary pH in animals treated with sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate at all time points. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate treatment had no effect on organ weights, 
and there were no treatment related macro- or microscopic findings. 
Treatment with ZS-9 had no effect on mortality, body weights, body 
weight changes, food consumption, serum chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, routine urinalysis parameters, urine chemistry (Na+, K+ and 
urine urea nitrogen [UUN]), absolute or relative organ weights. No test 
article related effects were detected following microscopic evaluation of the 
kidney tissue sections from Groups 1 to 4 dogs. Clinical signs 2 were 
confined to the presence of white material mixed with feces in all ZS-9 
treated animals and was attributed to excreted test article. Conclusion: 
The MTD established in this study for repeat administration in beagle dogs 
was 2000 mg/kg.

Major findings 
There were no adverse effects on food consumption but body weight 
decreased by around 0.2 kg over the 7-day treatment period but in the 
absence of control animals it is not clear whether this effect was test article 
related. Clinical signs were limited to the observation of white material, 
presumed to be test article, in the feces of each dog from the afternoon of 
Day 3 through Day 7. There were no adverse effects on hematology or 
coagulation parameters but treatment was associated with increases in 
serum sodium, chloride and calcium and an ~90% decrease in urinary 
potassium concentration when compared to pre-treatment values. Urinary 
sodium concentration was also increased in 1 M and both F and urinary 
nitrogen concentration was decreased in 1M and both F. 
Conclusion: a dose of 1300 mg ZS-9 /kg administered three times a 
day was considered suitable for use in 14-day toxicity studies in 
Beagle dogs. 
Motrality: No. 
Electrocardiographic Examinations: ZS-9 treatment had no adverse effect 
on heart rate, PR, QRS or QT intervals. 
Clinical observations : With the exception of white material in feces noted 
in one M and one F dog in Group 2 (325 mg/kg/dose) and in all dogs in 
Groups 3 and 4 (≥ 650 mg/kg/dose) ZS-9 had no adverse effect on clinical 
signs. 
Serum Chemistry:  At 325 mg/kg/dose, BUN was increased and chloride 
was decreased in M. At 650 mg/kg/dose, LDH was increased and 
triglyceride was decreased in F, and cholesterol was increased in M; at 
>650 mg/kg dose, creatinine and magnesium were increased and glucose 
and chloride were decreased in F, and phosphorus and the 
albumin/globulin ration were decreased in M. At the 1300 mg/kg/dose 
magnesium and AST were increased and potassium was decreased in F and 
sodium, globulin LDH and AST were increased in M. A dose-related 
decrease in serum potassium was observed in M, but failed to reach 
significance. 
Hematology : A statistically significant increase in WBC was observed in 
Group 4 M compared to control. This finding was considered to be 
incidental as the magnitude of the change was well within normal values, 
was below the pre-test value, was not dose related and did not occur in 
females. A statistically significant reduction in PT was observed in all 
treated M compared to control. This finding was considered incidental as 
the magnitude of the change was well within normal values, was similar to 
the pre-test values for these animals, was not dose related and did not 
occur in F. 
Urinalysis: On Day 13, a statistically significant increase in pH was

Major findings 
observed in all treated M and in Group 2 and Group 4 F. There was a 
significant, dose dependent increase in urinary sodium concentration in M 
and F in Groups 2, 3 and 4 and a dose related decrease in urinary 
potassium and urea nitrogen concentration. The decrease in urinary 
potassium concentration reached statistical significance in Group 3 M and 
Group 4 M and F and statistically significant reductions in urea nitrogen 
concentration were observed in Group 4 M and F. 
Necropsy Findings: There were no abnormal external findings in any 
animal on Day 14 necropsy. Internal findings consisted of mottled lungs in 
a Group 1 M, an enlarged spleen, mottled lungs and red fluid in the 
stomach of a Group 3 F, spleen-like tissue collected from the mesentery 
with the lymph node of another Group 3 F , bright yellow fluid in the 
stomach of a Group 4 M and an enlarged spleen in a Group 4 F. 
At the Day 24 recovery necropsy, one Group 1 F , and one Group 4 F , 
were thin. Internally, the Group 4 F had clear fluid in abdominal cavity. 
Histopathology: Microscopically minimal to mild focal and/or multifocal 
inflammation was observed in the kidneys of treated animals. The renal 
lesions of both sexes had similar incidence and severity at 650 and 1300 
mg/kg/dose and were less frequent and severe at 325 mg/kg/dose. In 
some 
dogs the inflammation was unilateral rather than bilateral and in some 
cases was associated with inflammation in the urinary bladder and origin of 
the ureter. 
Taken together these observations suggest that factors other than direct 
renal injury, such as alterations in urine composition of ZS-9 treated dogs 
may have resulted in increased susceptibility to subclinical urinary tract 
infections, even though no microorganisms were observed in these tissues. 
Results of Day 13 urinalysis data, with elevated pH in all treated groups 
compared to control are also consistent with, but not diagnostic of, a 
urinary tract infection. In recovery animals the inflammation was 
completely resolved in F and partly resolved in M suggesting that whatever 
the cause of the inflammation it was reversible following cessation of 
dosing. A number of other spontaneous lesions commonly observed in 
young dogs were also diagnosed but were not considered to be test article 
related. 
Conclusion: As aresult of the microscopic findings no NOAEL was 
established in this study. 
Mortality: No. 
Clinical observations: There were no adverse test article-related clinical 
findings observed during this study. White material, presumed to be the 
test article and/or the potassium supplement, was frequently observed in

the feces of the three dogs in Group 3 treated with ZS-9 + K. All other 
reported clinical findings were considered incidental to treatment and are 
commonly found in dogs of this age and strain under normal laboratory 
conditions. 
Clinical Chemistry: No clinically meaningful differences or test article-
related effects were identified among clinical chemistry analytes in any 
treatment group. 
Urinalysis: 
There was a statistically significant increase urinary pH compared to 
Control in animals treated with 600 mg/kg/dose of screened or unscreened 
ZS-9 that was not observed at the 100 mg/kg/dose or in animals treated 
with 600 mg/kg/dose of screened and protonated ZS-9 or 50 mg/kg/dose 
of sodium bicarbonate. Mean urinary pH in these animals increased from 
5.33 to ~7.67 on Day 7 and from 5.83 to 7.733 on Day 13. The lack of 
effect on urinary pH in animals treated with 600 mg/kg/dose of protonated 
ZS-9 (ZS-9SP) suggests that the increase in the urinary pH in animals 
treated with the higher dose of sodium loaded ZS-9 (ZS-9 and ZS-9S) was 
a result of gastrointestinal hydrogen absorption. 
On Days 7 and 13 the fractional excretion of sodium was increased relative 
to pre-dose intervals in all groups including controls. Animals receiving 600 
mg/kg/dose ZS-9, ZS-9 + K, and ZS-9S tended to have increases that 
were slighter greater (up to 116% relative to controls) than those seen in 
other treatment groups or among the control animals. 
Significant decreases in the fractional excretion of potassium, relative to 
Control, were observed in animals treated with 600 mg/kg/dose ZS-9, ZS-
9S, ZS-9SP, and 100 mg/kg/dose ZS-9S on Days 7 and 13. 
On Days 7 and 13 the fractional excretion of chloride was mildly increased 
relative to pre-dose intervals in all groups including controls. Animals 
receiving 600 mg/kg/dose ZS-9 and ZS-9S tended to have mild decreases 
in the fractional excretion of chloride (up to 49%) relative to controls. 
On Days 7 and 13 urea nitrogen/ creatinine ratio was mildly increased 
relative to predose intervals in all groups including controls. There were 
mild decreases in urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios on Days 7 and 13 in 
animals receiving 600 mg/kg/dose ZS-9, ZS-9 + K, ZS-9SP, and ZS-9S 
relative to controls (up to 26%). 
Microscopic: Test article related microscopic findings were in all groups 
dosed at 600 mg/kg/dose and included minimal to mild mixed leukocyte 
infiltrates in the kidney sometimes associated with minimal to mild renal 
tubular regeneration, and occasionally minimal renal tubular degeneration/ 
necrosis, minimal mixed leukocyte infiltrates in ureter and /or urethra and 
minimal pyelitis in dogs dosed with ZS9 or ZS-9S. The presence of pyelitis

and/or the mixed leukocyte infiltrates in the urethra and ureters in some 
dogs and random distribution of kidney findings are likely an indirect effect 
of the test article and, in the absence of the manifestation of clinically 
adverse effects (urine and serum chemistries, food consumption, weight 
gain and behavior), were not considered to be toxicologically adverse. 
Mortality: No. 
Clinical observations : There were no adverse test article-related clinical 
findings observed during this study. 
Clinical Pathology: At the Week 2 and Week 4 collections, both sexes 
receiving 1000 mg/kg tid had minimal increases in serum pH that were 
associated with minimal increases in bicarbonate (HCO3) (up to 1.2-fold), 
relative to controls. Minimal increases in tCO2 (up to 1.2-fold) were also 
present in these treatment groups. Similar changes were also noted at the 
Week 2 collection in males receiving 1000 mg/kg + KCl tid, and at the 
Week 4 collection in females receiving 1000 mg/kg + KCl tid. There were 
no test article-related effects among hematology endpoint parameters in 
either sex at any interval. 
Clinical Chemistry: Dose-related changes in mean clinical chemistry 
parameters included decreases in serum potassium, phosphorous, and 
aldosterone, a mild to moderate increase in mean urine volume with 
associated decreases in specific gravity and osmolality, a dose-related 
reduction in the mean fractional excretion of urinary potassium (FE: K) and 
a slight increase in mean urine pH. There was a tendency for mean serum 
bicarbonate to be minimally increased in both sexes receiving 1000 mg/kg 
TID that corresponded to a mild increase in mean serum pH relative to 
controls. In most treatment groups, there was a mild to moderate increase 
in the mean fractional excretion of sodium (FE: Na), relative to control 
groups but these were not associated with meaningful changes in mean 
serum sodium. All changes were reversible following a 21-day recovery 
period. Mild increases in FE: K and fractional excretion of chloride (FE: Cl) 
were noted in both sexes receiving potassium supplemented ZS (1000 
mg/kg + KCl; TID) relative to controls and were considered secondary to 
KCl supplementation. In three F at the 1000 mg/kg tid dose serum 
potassium was decreased by up to 1.8 mmol/l over the dosing period. 
These same animals also had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and aspartate transaminase (AST) values at Weeks 2 and/or 4. No 
elevations in ALT/AST were observed in high dose animals that remained 
within the normokalemic range or in high dose animals supplemented with 
potassium suggesting that the elevations may have been a secondary 
response to the hypokalemia.

glands included increased intracytoplasmic lipid vacuolation in cells of the 
zona glomerulosa in all groups of ZS-treated animals given daily ZS doses 
≥ 900 mg (300, 1000 + KCl, and 1000 mg/kg/dose tid, and 1000 mg/kg 
sid) and an increased incidence of cystic degeneration in the zona 
glomerulosa in M and F given 1000 mg/kg tid. These changes were 
attributed to the decrease in aldosterone production. Kidneys from animals 
given 1000 mg/kg tid had multifocal areas in the medulla and cortex with a 
spectrum of tubular and interstitial degenerative and inflammatory 
changes that included vacuolation/degeneration of tubules or 
vacuolation/degeneration of tubules with concomitant expansion of the 
interstitium by inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes, macrophages, 
and/or fibroblasts). Some animals had dilation of tubules with attenuation 
of tubular epithelium and one hypokalemic F animal in this group also had 
hemorrhage, hyperplasia of transitional epithelium lining the renal pelvis, 
and increased neutrophils in addition to the other inflammatory cells in the 
interstitium. These renal findings are consistent with changes described in 
the kidneys of animals with prolonged decreased body potassium, and 
were prevented by potassium chloride supplementation. 
Mortality: No. 
Clinical observations : There were no ZS-related clinical findings. 
Clinical Pathology: all F treatment groups administered ZS had minimal 
dose-dependent increases in bicarbonate (HCO3, up to 1.1-fold) and tCO2 
(up to 1.1-fold), relative to controls. There were no test article-related 
effects among hematology parameters in any treatment group. At the 
Week 4 collection, minimal statistically significant decreases in sodium 
(2%) and chloride (2%), and a mild statistically significant increase in 
potassium (11%) were present in F administered 1000 mg/kg ZS tid 
relative to controls. 
Electrocardiographic Examinations: All animals were in sinus rhythm or 
sinus arrhythmia, both of which are normal rhythms in dogs. There was no 
effect of the oral administration of ZS on qualitative or quantitative ECG 
parameters. 
Urine Chemistry:  
• In the control group, FE:K increased by 40% at Week 2 and by 77% at 
Week 4. This increase was reversible, as FE:K decreased during the 
recovery period. 
• In the groups given ZS at 100 and 300 mg/kg tid, mean FE:K was little 
changed at Week 2 and had increased (35% and 15%, respectively) by 
Week 4. 
• In the group given ZS at 1000 mg/kg tid, mean FE:K had decreased by 
46% at Week 2 but had nearly returned to the mean pre-test value by

Week 4. There was little change in FE:K in this group during the recovery 
period. 
• In the group given ZS at 1000 mg/kg tid and KCl at 224 mg/kg tid, mean 
FE:K was substantially increased (>200%) at Weeks 2 and 4, which was 
considered secondary to KCl supplementation. There were also mild to 
moderate increases in the fractional excretion of sodium (FE: Na), relative 
to controls. These effects were most pronounced in females administered 
1000 mg/kg + KCl TID (up to 188% increase), and indicated increased 
renal sodium excretion, however this increase was not associated with 
meaningful changes in serum sodium. There were no test article-related 
microscopic findings. 
Mortality: No. 
Clinical observations : After 13 weeks of dosing, there were no clinical 
findings related to ZS administration at any dose level. All observations 
recorded were considered typical of dogs of this age and strain. ZS-related 
clinical findings were observed between Weeks 17 and 31 in one F 
administered 300 mg/kg/day and one M and 5 F administered 2000 
mg/kg/day without KCl supplementation and were attributed to 
hypokalemia, consistent with the expected pharmacology of the compound. 
These included decreased activity, inappetence, impaired limb function, 
ataxia, and rigid body. 
Physical Examinations: In M, all mean blood pressure measurements were 
broadly similar in all groups, including controls. In F at the end of the 
dosing period, mean systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure 
were 20-25%, 44-70%, and 27- 32% greater in all treated groups than in 
the control groups. The magnitude of the difference was unrelated to ZS 
dose level, and mean values in treated F groups were similar to mean 
values in all M groups, including controls. 
Electrocardiographic Examinations: There was no effect of the oral 
administration of ZS on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters at the 
Week 13 interim or Week 39 terminal examinations. Recovery 
electrocardiographic examinations were therefore not conducted. 
Clinical Pathology: 
• Minimal reversible decreases in serum potassium in animals at 2000 
mg/kg/day without KCl; 
• Minimal reversible increases in HCO3 and tCO2 in animals receiving 2000 
mg/kg/day without KCl; 
• Mild reversible decreases in aldosterone in animals receiving 2000 
mg/kg/day without KCl; 
• Mild reversible increases in urine pH in animals receiving ≥1000 
mg/kg/day and 2000 + KCl mg/kg/day;

Major findings 
• Minimal increases in urine volume in animals at 2000 mg/kg/day with 
and without KCl; 
• Marked reversible decreases in renal potassium excretion in animals 
receiving ≥300 mg/kg/day without KCl; 
• Mild reversible increases in renal sodium excretion in M receiving ≥1000 
mg/kg/day and F at ≥300 mg/kg/day with and without KCl; 
• A trend towards a minimal increase in calcium and 
phosphorous/creatinine ratios in animals receiving 2000 with or without 
KCl mg/kg/day. 
Clinical Chemistry: The only difference in the pattern of change that was 
potentially related to administration of ZS was a minimal decrease in mean 
serum potassium concentration in both sexes at 2000 mg/kg/day that was 
apparent by Week 6 and continued through Week 39 (up to -13% from 
baseline). All other mean and individual clinical chemistry values were 
considered within expected ranges for biological and/or procedure-related 
variation. 
At Weeks 13 and 39 in both sexes receiving 2000 mg/kg/day there were 
mild reductions in aldosterone (up to -41%) relative to controls. Trends 
towards reductions were also seen at Week 6 but were less substantial (up 
to -14%). Decreases in serum aldosterone were attributable to reductions 
in aldosterone biosynthesis secondary to test article-related decreases in 
serum potassium. 
Urinalysis: 
• Minimal to mild increases in urine pH at Weeks 2, 6, 13, 26, and/or 39 in 
both sexes receiving ≥ 1000 mg/kg/day, and 2000 + KCl mg/kg/day 
relative to controls. These differences occasionally reached statistical 
significance and appeared dose-related. The effects on urine pH had 
resolved by the recovery interval in both sexes. 
• A trend towards increased urine volume in animals receiving 1000 
mg/kg/day, and 2000 mg/kg/day with or without potassium 
supplementation. 
Urine Chemistry:  
• A dose-related decrease in the fractional excretion of potassium (up to -
91%) relative to controls at Weeks 2 through 39 at all dose levels. This 
finding was not observed in mg/kg/day supplemented with KCl. 
• A dose-related increase in the fractional excretion of sodium (up to +5.6-
fold) at Weeks 2 through 39 in males at ≥ 1000 mg/kg/day and in females 
at all dose levels, relative to controls. 
• A trend towards a minimal increase in calcium and 
phosphorous/creatinine ratios in animals receiving 2000 with or without

different from controls. 
Microscopic: Microscopic findings observed in M and F treated with 2000 
mg/kg/day included mild intracytoplasmic lipid vacuolation in cells of the 
zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands and multifocal areas in the medulla 
and cortex of the kidneys with a spectrum of tubular and interstitial 
degenerative and inflammatory changes. These findings were consistent 
with prolonged potassium depletion and correlated with the hypokalemia 
observed in the affected animals. The incidence and grade of 
tubulointerstitial inflammation was similar after 13 or 39 weeks of 
administration, but there were additional renal changes (increased 
interstitial matrix and interstitial fibrosis) after 39 weeks of administration. 
At both time points, renal changes were less common and less pronounced 
in the kidneys of dogs supplemented with potassium, suggesting that 
potassium supplementation reduced the incidence and magnitude of this 
finding.

Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were conducted up to a maximum duration of 180-days and 
270-days, respectively. The only effects of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate administration in either species 
were related to the intended pharmacodynamic activity of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, which is to reduce 
potassium absorption from the GI tract. The effects reflected adaptive responses intended to maintain 
homeostasis, particularly adequate serum potassium concentration and adequate total body potassium 
stores. The primary adaptive response was to substantially reduce urine potassium excretion. Related 
secondary effects included decreased serum potassium and aldosterone concentrations, increased serum 
HCO-
(increased urine pH). Both rats and dogs tolerated chronic oral administration of sodium zirconium 
3 concentration, increased urine sodium excretion, and decreased urine hydrogen ion excretion 
cyclosilicate at very high dose levels. Rats tolerated sodium zirconium cyclosilicate at up to the maximum 
feasible dose level of 2000 mg/kg tid (6000 mg/kg/day) for up to 26 weeks, and dogs tolerated sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate at 1000 mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks. These dose levels are equivalent to human 
dose levels of approximately 58 g/day (rats) and 32 g/day (dogs). In dogs, the pharmacodynamic effects of 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate became dose-limiting with chronic administration at very high dose levels due 
to the development of clinically significant hypokalemia and secondary degenerative and inflammatory 
changes in the kidneys and lipid vacuolisation in the adrenal cortex. Potassium supplementation helped 
reduce the incidence and/or magnitude of hypokalemia and its associated renal and adrenal effects. 
Human equivalent dose (HED) calculations were prepared according to the Guidance for Industry Estimating 
the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers. The 
summary of the safety margins for the NOAEL doses of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in pivotal toxicology 
studies are presented below:

The CHMP noted that quite a high percentage of the rats used in the toxicological studies had injuries during 
dosing. The applicant explained that the gavage dose administration is an invasive procedure and it was 
performed 3 times a day over a 12-hour period. The high incidence of oesophageal injury in studies 
conducted with ZS-9 was attributed to the differences in formulation pH with the commercial formulation. 
The CHMP considered that even though overall mortality in the toxicological studies is increased, this finding 
has no major clinical impact.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate exhibited no genotoxic potential in an ICH-recommended battery of in vitro 
and in vivo studies.  It was examined for mutagenic activity in a bacterial reverse mutation assay. The assays 
were conducted at concentrations of up to 5000 μg /plate, in the presence and absence of a metabolic 
activation system. Under these test conditions, ZS-9 did not exhibit any mutagenic activity in these assays. 
The ability of ZS-9 to induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was also 
evaluated with and without metabolic activation. No significant increases in chromosomally aberrant cells 
were observed at any of the concentrations tested. Under the conditions of the assay, sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate did not induce a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells. Sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate was evaluated for in vivo clastogenic activity and/or disruption of the mitotic apparatus by 
quantifying micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) cells in rat bone marrow mg Fe. Dose levels 
ranged from 900 to 2000 mg/kg/day for 28 days given as an oral administration. 
In conclusion, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate exhibited no genotoxic potential in an ICH-recommended 
battery of in vitro and in vivo studies.

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. However, because sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not 
systemically absorbed, and exhibited no genotoxic potential in an ICH recommended battery of in vitro and in 
vivo studies (ICH S2 [R1]), it is not considered to present a genotoxic hazard to humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted according to GLP principles. The fertility 
and early embryonic development, embryo-foetal development, and pre- & post-natal development were 
studied following oral administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.  An overview of the results from 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits are presented in the table below.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate did not affect reproductive function in rats of either sex at up to the maximum 
feasible dose level of 6000 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to a human dose level of approximately 62 g/day. 
When administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at up to 6000 mg/kg/day, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate did

not affect maintenance of pregnancy or fetal development. The rabbit 6000 mg/kg/day dose is equivalent to 
a human dose of ~115 g/day based on a 60 kg body weight. When administered to pregnant rats from the 
first trimester of pregnancy through the end of lactation at up to 6000 mg/kg/day, sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate did not affect pregnancy, parturition, or the development of offspring. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was included into the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Local Tolerance  
The dermal sensitization potential of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was evaluated in a GLP-compliant study 
performed in Hartley-derived albino guinea pigs. Ten male and 10 female guinea pigs were topically treated 
with 100% ZS once per week, for 3 consecutive weeks. Following a 2-week rest period, a challenge was 
performed whereby the 20 test and 10 previously untreated (naïve) challenge control guinea pigs were 
topically treated with 100% ZS. A α-hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) positive control group consisting of 10 HCA 
test and 10 HCA control guinea pigs was included in this study. Based on the results of this study, sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) is not considered to be a contact sensitizer in guinea pigs, as the criterion for 
sensitization (dermal scores ≥ 1 in at least 15% of the test animals) was not met. The results of the HCA 
positive control study demonstrated that a valid test was performed and indicated that the test design would 
detect potential contact sensitizers. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate elicited no dermal irritation in guinea pigs 
following topical administration at the maximum feasible dose (0.3 g), and is therefore not considered to be a 
dermal sensitizer. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicology studies were conducted with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A specific environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been performed for Lokelma oral powder for suspension, 
which contains the completely insoluble drug substance, sodium zirconium silicate, and no excipients.

According to the applicant, the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not applicable for sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, 
which will be excreted into the sewage system with patient stools. After entering the sewage system, sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate is expected to be retained in the sewage treatment plant by filtering and 
sedimentation, and disposed of in landfill or by incineration. Where disposed of in landfill, the stability and 
the complete insolubility of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate will cause it to remain localised. If any sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate enters the terrestrial environment outside of landfill sites by limited spreading of 
sewage sludge on agricultural land, no adverse environmental effects would be expected given its dilution 
within the terrestrial compartment and since sodium, zirconium and silicon are all common elements in the 
environment.  
Furthermore, it can be concluded that there are no impurity concerns for the sewage treatment plant and 
other aquatic compartments including surface water, taking into account environmental exposure to sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate from the use of Lokelma.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical profile of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate has been evaluated in a programme of 
pharmacology and toxicology studies that conformed to current regulatory guidance and scientific standards, 
with pivotal safety studies conducted in compliance with GLP regulations. 
From the data provided, it is evident that the ion exchange activity of ZS is selective for small monovalent 
ions such as sodium, hydrogen, potassium and ammonium over divalent cations such as calcium and 
magnesium. Based on in vitro studies using simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate-related potassium exchange is likely to be limited in the stomach and will occur throughout the 
gastrointestinal tract, with equilibrium occurring quite rapidly. As expected from its ion exchange activity, its 
administration to rats and dogs decreased the urinary excretion of potassium and increased the faecal 
excretion of potassium in a dose-related manner. These effects were accompanied by changes in urinary 
excretion of urea (decreased) and sodium (increased) and faecal excretion of urea (increased) and sodium 
(decreased). Both rats and dogs tolerated chronic oral administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate at 
very high doses, which resulted in excretion of light-coloured faeces due to the excretion of sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate. Rats tolerated sodium zirconium cyclosilicate at up to the maximum feasible dose level of 2000 
mg/kg tid (6000 mg/kg/day) for up to 26 weeks. Dogs tolerated sodium zirconium cyclosilicate at up to 1000 
mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks. These dose levels are equivalent to human dose levels of approximately 62 
g/day (rats) and 32 g/day (dogs) assuming a 60 kg body weight. 
Upon request of the CHMP, the applicant provided data on in-vitro interaction of ZS-9 with hot fluids and a 
selection of beverages. The effect of temperature on the integrity and potassium exchange of sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate was discussed and the applicant submitted data from a study investigating the effect 
of temperature on the integrity and potassium exchange of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. It was 
demonstrated that both the structural integrity and potassium exchange capacity of ZS-9 and sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate are stable at temperatures <150 °C. 
Hence, the dynamic nature of the ion exchange and the thermal stability data  indicate that the in vivo 
performance of ZS will not be affected by type of beverage or hot fluids consumed in conjunction with 
administration of ZS, however, considering the volume of liquid recommended for taking Lokelma in the 
proposed SmPC and the need to take the medication quickly before the powder settles, it is not advisable to 
use hot fluids which might burn the throat and oesophagus. Consequently, when taking the medicine, only 
the use of water is advised in the Product Information. 
The only effects of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate administration in either species were related to its ion 
exchange activity, which reduced potassium absorption from the GI tract. ZS is insoluble and thus, not 
systemically absorbed to a significant extent. The effects seen in animals reflected adaptive responses 
intended to maintain homeostasis in animals that were healthy and that had normal potassium stores; 
specifically, responses aimed at maintaining adequate serum potassium concentration and total body 
potassium stores. The primary adaptive response was to substantially reduce urine potassium excretion. This 
generally was adequate to maintain serum potassium concentration at a lower level but within the normal 
range (except on a few occasions in dogs at the highest dose level of 2000 mg/kg, equivalent to a human 
dose of ~65g/day). Related secondary effects included decreased serum aldosterone concentrations, 
increased serum HCO3- concentration, increased urine sodium excretion, and decreased urine hydrogen ion 
excretion (manifested as increased urine pH). In rats, these effects were relatively mild and not considered 
adverse even at the maximum feasible dose level of 6000 mg/kg/day. In dogs, the pharmacodynamic effects 
of ZS became dose limiting with chronic administration at very high dose levels due to the development of 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 39/103 
  
  
  
clinically significant hypokalaemia. In dogs (but not rats), chronic administration of ZS resulted in 
degenerative and inflammatory changes in the kidneys and lipid vacuolisation in the adrenal cortex, both of 
which were considered to be secondary to hypokalaemia. Potassium supplementation helped reduce the 
incidence and/or magnitude of hypokalaemia and its associated renal and adrenal effects. The hypokalaemia 
also reversed rapidly following cessation of dosing. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate exhibited no genotoxic potential in an ICH-recommended battery of in vitro 
and in vivo studies, and is thus not considered to present a genotoxic hazard to humans. Sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate also produced no hyperplastic or pre-neoplastic findings in chronic toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs at a human equivalent dose of ~65g/day and because of this, the lack of systemic absorption and the 
absence of genotoxic potential, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is considered unlikely to present a carcinogenic 
hazard to humans. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate did not affect reproductive function in rats of either sex at 
up to the maximum feasible dose level of 6000 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to a human dose level of ~ 62 
g/day. When administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at up to 6000 mg/kg/day, sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate also did not affect maintenance of pregnancy or fetal development. When administered to 
pregnant rats from the first trimester of pregnancy through the end of lactation at up to 6000 mg/kg/day, 
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate did not affect pregnancy, parturition, or the development of offspring. Sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate elicited no dermal irritation in guinea pigs following topical administration at the 
maximum feasible dose (0.3g), and is therefore not considered to be a dermal sensitizer. 
Based on the crystal phase composition of the batches used in the toxicology studies, the species in the 
pivotal non-clinical toxicology studies were exposed to higher levels of the crystalline phases than are present 
in the drug substance produced by the commercial manufacturing process. Thus, the potential toxicity of 
these phases has been appropriately studied, and is considered to be qualified as safe at the specified levels. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Based on the results of the non-clinical pharmacology and safety studies in animals, oral administration of 
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is expected to provide therapeutic benefit and to have a reasonable safety 
margin when used as directed to treat hyperkalaemia patients. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted in the application for the marketing authorisation of Lokelma are considered 
sufficient and although the CHMP identified several other concerns for clarification, the applicant satisfactorily 
addressed all. Therefore, the non-clinical data could be considered appropriate to support the clinical use of 
Lokelma for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant did not perform conventional clinical pharmacology programme based on the facts that (1) 
non-clinical data from a mass balance study in rats demonstrated that there is no significant systemic 
absorption as would be expected for an insoluble material with this particle size; (2) as an insoluble, 
inorganic compound, ZS is not subject to enzymatic metabolism. However, measurements of Zr levels in 
urine and blood samples as a possible indicator of ZS absorption were performed in in vitro study TD14-008 
and in clinical studies ZS-002, EUZS-003 and ZS-004. One study (Study BR-01519) provided an analysis of 
Zr concentrations from samples obtained in study ZS-004 using the validated bioanalytical methods. Also, 
open-label phase 1 pharmacodynamic clinical study (ZS-006) was conducted to characterize the potential 
effect of ZS 5 and 10 g QD doses on sodium and potassium excretion in healthy subjects.  
The applicant presented bioanalytical report of the measurement of concentration of Zr in human urine and 
whole blood samples collected during clinical study ZS-004. Main characteristics of the method used 
(system suitability, carryover, selectivity, linearity, lower limit of quantitation, intra- and inter-assay 
precision and accuracy, dilution integrity, injection medium stability, freeze-thaw stability, long term frozen 
stability and stock solution stability) were validated before study, validation criteria were met and validation 
reports were included. Open-label phase 1 DDI clinical study (ZS-009) was conducted to determine effect of 
ZS on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 9 drugs in healthy subjects. 
Absorption  
Due to exposure to stomach acid, it was speculated weather some Zr or heavy metal impurities could be 
released from the crystal and subject to systemic absorption. Therefore an in vitro study (TD14-008) was 
conducted in which 13 different batches of ZS were sequentially incubated at 37 °C in USP simulated gastric 
fluid (pH 1.2) for 2 hours followed by USP simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) for 20 hours. A total of 5 
elements listed per USP <232> testing (chromium, copper, molybdenum, nickel and palladium) were 
detected in the SGF and simulated intestinal fluid supernatants, as well as Zr and aluminum. The amount of 
each element released was ≤ 1.0 μg/g ZS for aluminum, chromium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, and 
palladium, and remains well below the permissible daily exposure for these elements over the 5 to 30 g/day 
ZS dosing range. The average amount of Zr released per gram of ZS for batches manufactured at the 500 L 
and 200 L scale was 0.466 μg and 0.696 μg, respectively. One batch (RD011-9S) used in clinical study ZS-
002 released 3.54 μg Zr/g ZS. The applicant explained that the potential amount of Zr exposure following 
oral administration of ZS at doses ranging from 5 to 30 g/day ranges from ~2.3 to 21 μg, which is <0.5% 
of the average daily Zr intake. ZS exchanges sodium and hydrogen for potassium, thus it is possible that 
some of the sodium released from the ZS crystal might be absorbed. Although no increase in urinary 
sodium excretion or clinically significant increases in serum sodium, blood pressure, or body weight were 
observed in the completed studies, sodium and potassium excretion was evaluated in a phase 1 
pharmacodynamic study ZS-006. ZS did not increase urinary sodium output in this subject population and 
study conditions. Specific study evaluating the possible effect of gastrointestinal transit time with ZS is not 
deemed necessary. 
Bioavailability study BR-01519: At selected sites of study ZS-004 in the US, whole urine and blood samples 
were collected and assayed for Zr levels at baseline, prior to administration of the first dose, and on 
maintenance phase study days 15 and 29, following ZS 10 g TID dosing in the acute phase. A total of 46 
urine samples were analysed (placebo: 17; ZS 5 g QD: 9; ZS 10 g QD: 10; ZS 15 g QD: 10). Zr 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 47/103 
  
  
  
concentrations were less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). Zr concentration in blood samples 
from the same subjects were at ≤ LLOQ of 10 ng/mL in all but 1 sample. The performed in-vitro release 
and clinical Zr levels in blood and urine analyses showed only minimal potential for systemic absorption. 
This is considered negligible. 
Influence of food: In study ZS-002, ZS was administered TID in conjunction with meals (8 am, 12 noon and 
6pm), except on study Day 1 when the first dose was administered ~90 minutes prior to breakfast. In 
studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004, the first dose of the acute phase was administered in conjunction with meal. 
The applicant explained that the effect of food can be assessed by comparing S-K decreases across studies 
at 1 hour after the first dose of ZS 10 g TID or placebo. Statistically significant difference from placebo at 1 
hour after the start of dosing was observed in studies ZS-002 and EUZS-003 with the mean decrease from 
baseline of -0.11 for the ZS 10 g TID group in both studies. These results indicate that the effect of ZS is 
largely independent of food. Statistically significant mean decrease from baseline in S-K was also observed 
at 1 hour after the start of dosing in Study ZS-004. Larger (-0.23 mmol/L) mean reduction from baseline as 
compared to studies ZS-002 or EUZS-003 was explained with the higher starting S-K level in study ZS-004. 
The CHMP noted that formal interaction studies with food and diet were not performed. Form the safety and 
DDI perspective this is reasonable approach, however, from the efficacy perspective, the lack of influence is 
not so obvious. The impact of food is acknowledged (direct binding potassium in the food), thus impact of 
the S-K decreasing capacity would be expected to be higher if low potassium diet is used and the ZS 
capacity is directed more towards decrease in circulating S-K (removal form the systemic circulation) but 
not diminishing alimentary intake of S-K. On CHMP’s request, the applicant explained that ZS would not be 
expected to induce hypokalaemia in subjects receiving low potassium diets based on its mechanism of 
action. The main impetus for the amount of potassium removed by ZS in vivo is the ionic potassium 
gradient in the gastrointestinal tract. When S-K level is high, ZS removes more potassium than when S-K 
level is lower, an effect that was consistently demonstrated in the ZS clinical studies.  
The applicant was also asked to discuss the effect of drug-drug interactions, manifesting in an adverse 
effect (hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, and QTc change). The applicant conducted a Phase 1 study (Study 
ZS-009) to examine the potential for drug-drug interactions with ZS in vivo with 9 compounds that 
displayed significant in vitro changes in solubility in the presence of ZS. The final clinical study report for 
Study ZS-009 has been submitted during the procedure. In vivo, coadministration of ZS with 5 of the 9 
compounds did not meet the bioequivalence criteria when coadministered with ZS. According to the 
applicant, all changes in pharmacokinetics are not clinically meaningful. 
Distribution 
As no relevant systemic absorption is expected, the formal distribution studies were not conducted and this 
is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Elimination 
No formal studies were conducted to examine the elimination or inter-conversion, PK of metabolites, 
genetic polymorphism, inter- and intra-variability in target, special populations, or to investigate the effect 
of gender, race, weight and age. Children < 18 years of age have not been studied; however, the pediatric 
development programme will be initiated upon the approval of ZS in treatment of adults. This is considered 
acceptable to the CHMP.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In acute phase, dose response for S-K was evaluated with ZS doses of 0.3 g, 3 g, and 10 g TID for 48 
hours in study ZS-002 and doses of 1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g TID for 48 hours in study EUZS-003. For 
extended dosing in study EUZS-003, ZS demonstrated dose-dependent differences from placebo. A 
statistically significantly smaller mean increase in S-K from extended dosing baseline to extended dosing 
study day 12 was observed for ZS 10 g QD vs placebo (0.06 mmol/L vs 0.58 mmol/L). A similar trend was 
noted for ZS 5 g QD dosing (0.14 mmol/L vs. 0.24 mmol/L), although the difference was not statistically 
significant. 
Special populations 
No formal PK studies in special populations were performed. It is not expected that in special population the 
local GI kinetics would be different from the targeted population. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro drug-drug interaction studies were conducted to examine the effect of ZS on various compounds, 
including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antacids, antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiepileptics, antimanics, 
antithrombotics, beta blockers, biguanidines, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, 
diuretics, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors, immunosuppressants, NSAIDs, 
stimulant laxatives, phosphate binders, sulfonylureas, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and thyroid replacement 
hormone. Drug products were evaluated using both standard USP compendial and Pharmacopeia Forum 
methods for dissolution, as well as physiologically relevant aqueous media (simulated gastric fluid, pH 4.5 
sodium acetate buffer, and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer). When the USP dissolution media were used, no 
significant interactions were observed. When physiologically relevant dissolution media were used, the only 
significant findings were uptake of calcium and lithium by ZS in simulated gastric fluid and pH 4.5 acetate 
buffer. There was no significant effect of any of the drug products tested on the KEC of ZS. Thus, no 
contraindication of concomitant administration with ZS for any of the drug products tested is proposed.  
Subgroup analyses from other ZS clinical studies demonstrated that efficacy and safety of ZS among 
subjects with concomitant use of rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors was similar to that 
among all ZS-treated subjects.  As changes in diet or initiation of or dose changes in medications that are 
known to increase S-K (e.g., RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, mineralocorticoid-receptor 
antagonists) or decrease S-K (e.g., thiazide or loop diuretics) could potentially impact a subject’s response 
to ZS, S-K should be monitored to determine appropriate dose adjustments to prevent hyperkalemia or 
hypokalemia. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. Following the analysis of all in-vitro drug 
interactions, the SmPC has been adequately updated to reflect these findings of possible interactions. The 
SmPC also informs the prescriber that there was a ~40% decrease in dabigatran systemic exposure when 
co-administered with ZS. However, no dose adjustment of dabigatran seems to be necessary when ZS is 
co-administered with dabigatran. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have not been preformed and this is not considered to 
be of concern.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
ZS is an inorganic cation exchange crystalline compound. The effect of ZS is based on the ability of cations 
(hydrogen and sodium), contained within its crystalline structure to freely exchange with other monovalent 
cations, potassium and ammonium, with high capacity and high selectivity. High affinity for potassium ions 
is not influenced by the presence of other cations such as calcium and magnesium. ZS ion-exchange 
properties and ion selectivity depends on its pore-openings size. The main factors to potentially affect the 
duration and potency of ZS at its site of action in the gut are potassium exchange capacity (KEC) as 
predicted by the crystalline structure of ZS, gastrointestinal motility (including the effect of food), and the 
gastric pH. It is assumed that ZS exerts its PD action throughout the entire GI tract through binding 
potassium in the food and in the intestinal fluid. The trapped potassium ions are excreted from the body via 
the faeces, resulting in lower absorption of potassium and lower S-K levels. Thus, the most direct PD 
measure of the potassium binding effect is the change in S-K levels, an objective clinical endpoint assessed 
in all clinical studies throughout the development programme. The mechanism of action is based on in-vitro 
studies, where potassium exchange capacity (KEC) was established to prove that ZS binds potassium. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology was examined in a phase I study and in KEC investigations for several batches. 
In the phase I pharmacodynamic study ZS-006 healthy subjects on standard diet were enrolled. The 
following changes were observed: mean numerical decrease from baseline to the average over study days 7 
and 8 was observed in both ZS 5g and 10g QD groups in urine sodium (-0.93 mmol/24 h and -5.47 
mmol/24 h, respectively and decrease in urine potassium (-9.67 mmol/24 h and -21.17 mmol/24 h, 
respectively) that was statistically significant in ZS 10 g QD group (p = 0.0017), but not in ZS 5 g QD 
group (p = 0.0604). Secondary endpoints analyses revealed decrease in S-K (-0.059 mmol/L [p = 0.3591] 
and -0.247 mmol/L [p = 0.0014]) and increase in faecal potassium (363.998 mg [p = 0.0304] and 695.560 
mg [p = 0.0021], respectively). This supports the concept that potassium, but not sodium is trapped in ZS 
and eliminated via GI, thus decreasing both S-K and urinary K. The mean reductions in S-K values were 
associated with mean dose-related reductions in urinary potassium excretion and by dose-related mean 
increases in faecal potassium in both dose groups, which is consistent with the known mechanism of action 
of ZS. The decreases in urinary potassium of ~379 and ~829 mg correspond to an in vivo KEC of 9.7 and 
21.2 mEq potassium for the 5 g and 10 g doses of ZS, respectively. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant did not perform conventional clinical pharmacokinetic investigations with zirconium 
cyclosilicate due to the facts that no significant systemic absorption would be expected based on non-
clinical data and this was confirmed by the limited amount of Zr available determined in blood and urine. 
The analytical methods developed for determination of the active substance in biological fluids were 
acceptable and showed <1% of possible Zr absorption. There were no studies showing a difference in 
pharmacodynamics whether sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is administered with or without food. 
The investigation of the mechanism of action of ZS is based on in vitro studies, where potassium exchange 
capacity (KEC) was established to prove that ZS binds potassium. Primary pharmacology was tested in a 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 50/103 
  
  
  
phase 1 study (006), in KEC investigations and by analysing S-K changes in phase 2-3 clinical studies. 
Studies showed S-K decreasing effect via direct binding in GI tracts and thus, increased faecal potassium 
removal. Although in study 002 the effect started as soon as an hour after administering the dose of 10 g, a 
more pronounced effect is observed later with an acute effect in 48 hours. Secondary pharmacology was 
investigated in acute and extended phases of studies 002, 003 and 004. Small increases in bicarbonate and 
GFR and decreases in calcium were observed for acute phase; decreases in calcium and increase in sodium 
were observed in extended phase. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects 
co-administration of amlodipine, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, furosemide, glipizide, warfarin, losartan, or 
levothyroxine did not result in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions and no dose adjustments are 
required. The SmPC also informs the prescriber that there was a ~40% decrease in dabigatran systemic 
exposure when co-administered with ZS. However, no dose adjustment of dabigatran seems to be 
necessary when ZS is co-administered with dabigatran. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the applicant conducted sufficient studies in order to investigate the clinical 
pharmacology of ZS. There are no measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology in 
the post-marketing setting. The SmPC includes adequate information informing the prescribing physicians 
about the correct use of Lokelma including its potential for drug-drug interactions and their management in 
clinical practise. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The applicant provided a Phase 2, first in human, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind dose escalating study report in subjects with mild hyperkalemia in CKD and moderate kidney 
dysfunction. Study sites were located at 9 sites in the US. A total of 90 subjects were randomized to 
cohorts of escalating ZS doses (0.3, 3, and 10 g) or placebo (2:1), administered TID with meals. Safety and 
tolerability were assessed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board after completion of each cohort, 
before escalation to the next dose level was allowed. 
The acute lowering of S-K level was also assessed in 2 pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
(study ZS-002 and acute phase of study EUZS-003) and 1 supportive open-label, single ZS treatment 
group study (acute phase of study ZS-004). Studies ZS-003 and ZS-004 are discussed in section 2.5.2.  
Study ZS-002: The applicant provided a phase 2, first in human, multicentre, prospective, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind dose escalating study report in subjects with mild hyperkalaemia in CKD 
and moderate kidney dysfunction. Study sites were located at 9 sites in the US. A total of 90 subjects were 
randomized to cohorts of escalating ZS doses (0.3, 3, and 10 g) or placebo (2:1), administered TID with 
meals. Safety and tolerability were assessed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board after 
completion of each cohort, before escalation to the next dose level was allowed. Main inclusion criteria : 
adult subjects, ability to have repeated blood draws with: S-K of 5.0-6.0 mmol/L at screening; GFR 40-60 
mL/min (after completion of Cohort 1 and 27 of 36 subjects in Cohort 2, the protocol was amended to 
broaden the GFR criteria to 30-60 mL/min. Eligible subjects in a double-blind dose-escalating fashion (3

separate cohorts), were to be randomized to receive escalating doses of ZS (0.3 g, 3 g, and 10 g) or 
placebo, administered TID daily with meals.  
The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 3 ZS doses TID 
administered for 48 hours to subjects with moderate CKD and mild hyperkalemia. The doses (0.3, 3, and 
10 g) were selected based on the in vitro finding that ZS was ~10 times more effective than SPS in 
exchanging potassium cations in the presence of physiological levels of magnesium and calcium, and to 
define the dose-response relationship. The secondary objectives were to identify the optimal dose for the 
subsequent studies, evaluate the effect of ZS on BUN, on other electrolytes, on various biomarkers for 
kidney damage, on urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and 24-hour creatinine 
clearance. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the exponential rate of change in S-K levels 
during the initial 48 hours of study drug treatment between placebo- and ZS-treated subjects. A total of 90 
subjects (38 females, 52 males) with CKD (mean GFR on Study Day 0 = 45.4 mL/min, range: 30 to 62 
mL/min) and hyperkalaemia (mean screening S-K [per central laboratory] = 5.16 mmol/L, range: 4.6 to 
6.0 mmol/L) were randomized to treatment in the study. Among all subjects, the mean age was 71.1 years 
(range: 42 to 96 years) and most were white (98%). 
ZS met the predefined primary endpoint of exponential decrease in S-K from baseline to 48 hours at the 10 
g TID dose (mean maximal reductions of 0.43 mmol/L;  p < 0.0001) and the 3 g TID dose (mean maximal 
reductions of 0.92 mmol/L, p = 0.048), see table below. ZS 0.3 g TID did not result in a significant S-K 
reduction.

The exponential rate of decline from baseline to 48 hours of treatment was modeled as S(t) = S(0) exp (-βt) where 
β is the exponential rate of decline using a longitudinal model. 
The S-K lowering effect started immediately, with statistically significant reductions vs. placebo 1 hour after 
the first ZS 10 g TID dose (p = 0.044), see figure below.  
Serum Potassium over Initial 48 Hours and 7 days– ITT Population, Study ZS-002 
Over 48 hours 
Over 7 days 
During Study Day 2 (from 28 to 48 hours post first study dose), statistically significantly greater mean 
reductions in S-K values were observed at all time points in the ZS 10 g TID dose group vs. placebo (p 
0.001), and this reduction continued for 2.5 days after the last dose of study drug (p = 0.005 at Study Day 
≤
4 and p = 0.003 at Study Day 5). Mean maximal reductions (-0.66 mmol/L) occurred 38 hours into the 
study, 4 hours after the 6th dose of ZS 10 g TID: a > 1 mmol/L drop in S-K was observed in 41.7% of ZS 
10 g TID subjects had vs. 3.4% of placebo subjects.  
Dose-dependent responses were also demonstrated with other S-K assessments with the maximal effect at 
the ZS 10 g TID dose:

• 
The time to first S-K decrease of 0.5 mmol/L was statistically significantly reduced with the ZS 10 g TID 
dose vs. placebo (p = 0.042), with a modest reduction observed with the ZS 3 g TID dose and 
generally no difference was observed for the ZS 0.3 g TID dose. There were no statistically significant 
differences between placebo and the lower ZS dose (0.3 g and 3 g) groups. 
Following the 4th dose, 58.3% of ZS 10 g TID subjects achieved a ≥ 0.5 mmol/L decrease in S-K vs. 
the 17.2% in placebo group (p = 0.004). At 48 hours, after 6 doses, 33.3% of ZS 10 g TID subjects 
had achieved a ≥ 1.0 mmol/L decrease in S-K vs. 6.7% in placebo group (p = 0.016).  
Time to normalization of S-K levels (3.5 to 4.9 mmol/L) was also dose-dependent and statistically 
significantly faster in the ZS 10 g TID vs. the placebo group (p = 0.040). S-K levels had normalized in 
all 24 ZS 10 g TID subjects after 48 hours of treatment so they did not need to extend the treatment. 
In contrast, 30% (9/30) of subjects in the placebo group received study drug treatment beyond the 
initial 2 days.

The reduction in S-K levels was accompanied by a similar reduction in urinary potassium excretion, with a 
23% reduction in urinary potassium excretion observed from baseline to Study Day 2 at the10 g TID dose 
(p < 0.002 vs. placebo). There were no statistically significant reductions in urinary potassium excretion 
between the 2 lower ZS doses and placebo. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study ZS-003: A Phase 3, multicentre, two-phase, multi-dose, prospective, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of ZS, an oral sorbent, in 
subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalaemia 
ZS-004: A phase 3 multicentre, multi-phase, multi-dose, prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled maintenance study to investigate the safety and efficacy of ZS, an oral 
sorbent, in subjects with hyperkalaemia 
Methods, study participants and treatments 
Study EUZS-003 was a phase 3, multicentre, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
dose-ranging study in subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalaemia. Study sites were located at 65 sites in 
the United States, Australia, and South Africa. A total of 754 subjects were randomized to the 48-hours 
Acute Phase of whom 543 subjects followed in ≤12-days Subacute Phase (Extended Dosing). Study EU-004 
was a phase 3, multicentre, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study 
in subjects with hyperkalaemia. Study sites were located at 44 sites in the United States, Australia, and 
South Africa. A total of 258 subjects were treated in the outpatient, open-label Acute Phase, of whom 237 
achieved normokalaemia (S-K 3.5-5.0 mmol/L) and were randomized to Extended Dosing.  
In both pivotal studies, adult subjects (<18 years) of both genders with an ability to have repeated blood 
draws were included. Potassium requirements: In study EUZS-003, the mean i-STAT potassium of 5.0-6.5 
mmol/L on Study Day 0; Study ZS-004: Two consecutive i-STAT potassium values, measured 60 min. 
apart, both ≥5.1 mmol/L and measured within 1 day of the first ZS dose on Acute Phase Study Day 1.  
Both pivotal studies exclusion criteria included pseudohyperkalaemia signs and symptoms, such as 
haemolysed blood specimen, history of severe leucocytosis or thrombocytosis; cardiac arrhythmias that 
required immediate treatment; diabetic ketoacidosis; dialysis; treatment with resins, calcium acetate, 
calcium carbonate, or lanthanum carbonate, within the last 7 days. Study 003 included also the following 
conditions as exclusion criteria: receiving insulin, but stable dose not established; HIV positive, except 
subjects enrolled at sites in South Africa; treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, or other non-absorbed 
antibiotics for hyperammonaemia within the last 7 days. 
In study EUZS-003, eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind 
treatment with 1 of 4 doses of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo, administered TID for the initial 
48 hours (acute phase), followed by a randomized dose of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo 
administered QD for 12 days (subacute phase). For subacute phase, normokalaemic subjects were 
randomized to 1 of the 4 active doses in a 1:1 ratio for the same acute phase dose QD and placebo QD, 
whereas subjects who received placebo in the Acute Phase were randomized to receive either 1.25 g or 2.5 
g of ZS administered QD in Subacute Phase. During the acute phase (study days 1 and 2), all randomized 
subjects received study drug TID with meals. All subjects who completed the acute phase and had i-STAT 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 54/103 
  
  
  
potassium values within the normal range (3.5 to 4.9 mmol/L) on the morning of study day 3 were to enter 
into the subacute phase (extended dosing) during which study drug was to be administered QD with 
breakfast. All subjects were to continue the treatments they were on upon admission into the study. 
In study ZS-004, eligible subjects were enrolled in the study and treated on an outpatient basis. In the 
open-label acute phase, subjects were treated with ZS 10 g TID for the initial 48 hours (6 doses). Subjects 
who achieved normokalemia during the acute phase were randomized in a double-blind manner in a 
4:4:4:7 ratio to 1 of 3 doses of ZS (5 g, 10 g, or 15 g) or placebo administered QD for a further 28 days 
(maintenance phase, or extended dosing).  An additional week of safety follow-up after the last dose day 
extended the study to a total of 35 days. During the acute phase, all enrolled subjects received study drug 
TID for 2 days (a total of 6 doses). On each day, the first dose was to be administered at the site and the 
second and third doses were to be taken at home just before lunch and the evening meal, respectively. 
Subjects with i-STAT potassium values ≥ 6.1 mmol/L on day 1 at the 4-hour post dose 1 received the 
second dose of study drug 4 hours after the first dose. If the i-STAT potassium value was > 6.2 mmol/L or 
met any of the ECG stopping criteria at the 90-minute post dose 2 time point, the subject was to be 
discontinued from the study. All subjects who completed the acute phase and had i-STAT potassium values 
within the normal range (3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L) on the morning of acute phase study day 3 were to be 
randomized into the maintenance phase. Study drug was administered QD at the site in the morning on 
maintenance phase study days 1 (acute phase study day 3), 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 19, 22, and 26; on all other 
days, subjects were to take study drug at home, just before breakfast. Subjects who developed i-STAT 
potassium values between 3.0 and 3.4 mmol/L, inclusive, during the maintenance phase, were to have 
study drug dosing reduced from QD to every other day (QOD) for the remainder of the study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study EUZS-003 for the acute phase was % of subjects achieving 
normokalaemia after 48 hours of therapy. For the subacute phase, it was the cumulative number of days 
remaining normokalaemic during the 12 days of therapy for subjects on subacute therapy and randomized 
withdrawal, separately calculated for the 4 acute phase active treatments. In study ZS-004, the primary 
efficacy endpoint was the model-based least squares mean (LSMEAN) of all available S-K values during 
maintenance phase study days 8 to 29.  The secondary efficacy endpoints for the maintenance phase 
included the number of normokalaemic days during maintenance phase study days 8 to 29; mean change 
and mean % change from acute phase baseline in S-K and from maintenance phase baseline in S-K; time 
to hyperkalaemia (S-K ≥ 5.1 mmol/L); time to relapse in S-K values. 
In study EUZS-003, 1433 subjects were screened for entry into the study, and 679 of these failed to meet 
the entry criteria, primarily due to average i-STAT values not within the acceptable range (628 subjects). 
Among the 754 subjects randomized in the acute phase of the study, 158 were randomized to placebo, 154 
to ZS 1.25 g TID, 141 to ZS 2.5 g TID, 158 to ZS 5 g TID, and 143 to ZS 10 g TID. Majority of subjects in 
each study group completed the acute phase of the study (range: 96.2 to 99.4%). A total of 18 subjects 
(including subject who was never dosed) prematurely discontinued from the study, of them 4 ZS and 1 
placebo treated subjects due to hyperkalaemia. Study ZS-004. Overall, 425 subjects were screened for 
entry into the study. Of these, 167 failed to meet the entry criteria, primarily due to average i-STAT values 
not within the acceptable range (160 subjects), and were not enrolled in the study. The 258 subjects 
enrolled in the open-label acute phase of the study were treated with ZS 10 g TID. Of them, 7 subjects 
prematurely discontinued; 5 due to withdrawal of consent and 2 due to hyperkalaemia (i-STAT potassium 
values of 6.3 mmol/L, 90 minutes after the second dose of ZS on acute phase study day 1). 
The applicant claimed that demographic characteristics in the study 003 were generally similar among the 
acute phase treatment groups at baseline: mean age ranged from 65.2 to 66.2 years, majority of subjects 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 55/103 
  
  
  
in each of the treatment groups were male (range: 53.9% to 64.5%) and white (range: 83.9% to 88.7%). 
The greatest proportions of subjects had baseline S-K values (per central laboratory) ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (range: 
49.4% to 65.7%). The most common aetiology of elevated S-K within each of the acute phase treatment 
groups (subjects could have multiple aetiologies) was CKD (based on eGFR < 60 mL/min, ~75%; range: 
71% to 80%). Other aetiologies of elevated S-K included use of RAAS inhibitor medication (~67%; range: 
63.1% to 70.8%), and diabetes mellitus (~60%; range: 56.6% to 61.1%). At baseline of the acute phase 
of study ZS-004, mean age was 64.0 years, the majority of the subjects were male (57.8%) and white 
(83.3%). Baseline S-K values (per central laboratory) were < 5.5 mmol/L for 46.1% of subjects, ≥ 5.5 to < 
6.0 mmol/L for 38.8% of subjects, and ≥ 6.0 mmol/L for 15.1% of subjects. The most common aetiologies 
of elevated S-K (subjects could have had multiple aetiologies) were use of RAAS inhibitor medication 
(69.8%), CKD (based on eGFR < 60 mL/min, 69.4%), and diabetes mellitus (65.9%). The demographic 
and other baseline characteristics of the maintenance phase were generally similar to those noted for the 
acute phase: among the treatment groups, mean age ranged from 61.5 to 64.9 years, the majority of the 
subjects were white (range: 80.0 to 86.3%). The proportions of male subjects tended to be higher in the 
ZS 15 q QD group (71.4%) compared with the placebo (51.8%) and the lower ZS dose (5 g QD: 60.0%; 10 
g QD: 52.9%) groups. Greater proportions of subjects in the ZS 15 g QD group had HF, CKD (based on 
eGFR < 60 mL/min) and diabetes mellitus vs. placebo group. Almost all of the subjects in study 004 
(97.3%) enrolled in the acute phase. The most common types of medications included agents acting on the 
renin-angiotensin system (66.7%), drugs used in diabetes (62.4%), and lipid-modifying agents (57.4%). 
Almost all of the subjects in each treatment group of study 004 (range: 94.6 to 100%) randomized in the 
maintenance phase reported the use of medication, the most commonly agents acting on the renin-
angiotensin system (range: 57.1 to 70.6%), drugs used in diabetes (range: 55.6 to 72.5%), and lipid 
modifying agents (range: 51.1 to 62.7%). 
Objectives 
Study EUZS-003. The primary objective was to perform a controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy of 
4 ZS TID doses (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) for 48 hours in the Acute Phase for subjects with mild to 
moderate hyperkalemia at baseline.   
The secondary objectives were: (1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZS QD for 12 additional days in a 
Subacute Phase; (2) to assess the robustness of efficacy in normalizing S-K (Acute Phase), and maintaining 
normalized S-K (Subacute Phase); (3) to evaluate the effect of ZS on other electrolytes. 
Study ZS-004. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 ZS QD doses for 28 days 
in maintaining normokalemia in subjects achieving normokalemia following 2 days of acute therapy for 
subjects with hyperkalemia at baseline.  
The secondary objectives were: (1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ZS 10 g TID dose 
administered for 48 hours in the Acute Phase in subjects with hyperkalemia; (2) to assess the robustness of 
efficacy with ZS treatment for normalizing S-K (Acute Phase), and maintaining normalized S-K; (3) to 
evaluate the effect of ZS on other electrolytes.

number of days remaining normokalaemic during the 12 days of therapy for subjects on subacute therapy 
and randomized withdrawal, separately calculated for the 4 acute phase active treatments (excluding acute 
phase placebo). Secondary efficacy endpoints for the acute phase included the exponential rate of change 
in S-K values during the initial 48 hours of study drug treatment, S-K change from baseline at all time 
points, time to first decrease in S-K of 0.5 mmol/L, time to normalization of S-K (3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L), and 
proportion of subjects who achieved normalization in S-K values by time point.  Secondary efficacy 
endpoints for the Subacute Phase included exponential rate of change in S-K values during the 12 days, 
time to relapse in S-K values (return to original S-K baseline value), proportion of subjects within each 
treatment group who retain normal S-K values (3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L) at the end of study, S-K change from 
baseline at all time points, and time to an increase in S-K values of 0.5 mmol/L.  
Study ZS-004: The primary efficacy endpoint was the model-based least squares mean (LSMEAN) of all 
available S-K values during maintenance phase study days 8 to 29. The secondary efficacy endpoints for 
the maintenance phase included (1) number of normokalaemic days during Maintenance Phase Study Days 
8 to 29; (2) mean change and mean % change from Acute Phase baseline in S-K and from Maintenance 
Phase baseline in S-K; (3) time to hyperkalaemia (S-K ≥ 5.1 mmol/L); (4) time to relapse in S-K values 
(return to original Acute Phase S-K baseline value); (5) mean S-K intra-subject standard deviation 
calculated among subjects with ≥ 2 values on or after Maintenance Phase Study Day 8; and (6) proportion 
of subjects who remained normokalaemic at Maintenance Phase Study Days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 19, 22, 26, 
29, and 35. The secondary efficacy endpoints for the Acute Phase included (1) exponential rate of change in 
S-K values during the initial 48 hours of treatment; (2) mean change and mean % change from baseline in 
S-K values at all measured time intervals post dose; (3) proportion of subjects who achieved 
normokalaemia during the Acute Phase at 24 and 48 hours after start of dosing; and (4) time to 
normalization in S-K values (3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L).   
Sample size 
Study EUZS-003: Sample size for the exponential rate of change during the Acute Phase was calculated 
using the program for sample size calculation of a random slopes model with parameters estimates based 
on Study ZS-002 data. When the model was fit to the ZS-002 data, with time measured in days, the 
variance of the intercept was 0.00802, the variance of the slope was 0.00130 and the covariance was -
0.00045, the residual variance was 0.00473. Based on these parameters, there was 90% power to detect a 
difference in slopes of 0.0183/day. On the log potassium scale, this was a reduction of 1.83%/day. For the 
percentage normokalaemic at the end of the Acute Phase, any 20% absolute gain after 48 hours in the 
percentage with normokalaemic control from placebo control to any ZS dose could have been detected with 
at least 90% power for a two-sided test with 0.05 Type I error. For the subacute phase, it was estimated 
that at least 100 of the 150 treated Acute Phase subjects would achieve normokalaemia for each ZS dose 
group. With the parameters above, there was a 90% chance of detecting a difference in slopes of 
0.0205/day. On the log potassium scale, this was a slope of 2.05%/day. For the Subacute Phase, it was 
projected that there was at least 80% power to detect a 0.6 effect size (based on a 3-day difference with a 
5-day standard deviation) for cumulative days normokalaemic. 
Study EUZS-004: The sample size was based on the mean S-K during Maintenance Phase Study Days 8 
through to 29. To optimize the comparison of 3 active doses vs. placebo, the placebo group had 1.73 × the 
number of subjects per active dose. A 4:4:4:7 allocation best approximated the optimum Dunnett’s 
allocation. A sample size of 232 Maintenance Phase subjects (49 per active dose and 85 placebo controls) 
had 90% power and 5% Type 1 error for a 2-sided hypothesis test to detect a mean 0.3 mmol/L advantage 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 57/103 
  
  
  
for Maintenance Phase Study Days 8 through 29 for any active dose vs. placebo using a pre-specified closed 
testing order (highest to lowest dose); a mean 0.3 mmol/L decrease represents a meaningful advantage 
between any dose and placebo for a pooled 0.5 standard deviation. The sample size also had 90% power 
and 5% Type I error to detect a mean 4-day increase in days normokalaemic between any dose and 
placebo over the 28-day Maintenance Phase for a pooled 6-day standard deviation. 
Randomisation 
Study EUZS-003: Each subject was randomized once and received the Acute Phase randomization and the 
separate Subacute Phase randomization. For the Acute Phase, subjects were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 
doses of ZS or placebo for the Acute Phase in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects entering the Subacute Phase were 
already randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the same dose of ZS or placebo control QD while subjects 
receiving placebo in the Acute Phase were randomized to receive ZS at either the 1.25 g or 2.5 g QD. All 
randomizations were assigned in a double-blind fashion using the kit number based on the randomization.  
Study ZS-004: Acute Phase was open-label. During the Maintenance Phase, subjects were randomly 
allocated by the IWRS to 1 of 3 doses of ZS (5 g, 10 g, and 15 g) or placebo in a 4:4:4:7 ratio. All 
randomizations were assigned in a double-blind fashion using the kit number based on the randomization. 
The randomization code was held by Sharp Clinical Packaging, which was not associated with the clinical 
management of the study.  
Blinding (masking) 
Studies EUZS-003, maintenance phase in ZS-004 were double blind; acute phase in study ZS-004 was 
open-label.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods: the primary efficacy population of each study was the ITT population. In the acute 
phase the ITT population included: (1) for study EUZS-003: all subjects who were randomized, received 
TID study drug, and had S-K measurements after 48 hours of treatment, (2) for study ZS-004: all subjects 
who received TID study drug, and had a post-baseline S-K measurement during the first 48 hours after 
start of dosing. In the extended dosing the ITT population included: (1) for study EUZS-003, all randomized 
subjects who received QD study drug and had a post-baseline S-K measurement during extended dosing 
(subacute phase); (2) for study ZS-004, all randomized subjects who received QD study drug and had at 
least 1 S-K measurement on or after extended dosing (maintenance phase) Study Day 8.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Study EUZS-003: Overall, 1433 subjects were screened for entry into the study, and 679 of these failed to 
meet the entry criteria, primarily due to average i-STAT values not within the acceptable range (628 
subjects). Among the 754 subjects randomized in the Acute Phase of the study, 158 were randomized to 
placebo, 154 to ZS 1.25 g TID, 141 to ZS 2.5 g TID, 158 to ZS 5 g TID, and 143 to ZS 10 g TID. Majority 
of subjects in each study group completed the Acute Phase of the study (range: 96.2 to 99.4%). A total of

18 subjects (including subject who was never dosed) prematurely discontinued from the study, of them 4 
ZS and 1 placebo treated subjects due to hyperkalemia.Participant flow in Study EUZS-003 is depicted in 
the figure below. 
Study ZS-004: Overall, 425 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these, 167 failed to meet 
the entry criteria, primarily due to average i-STAT values not within the acceptable range (160 subjects), 
and were not enrolled in the study. The 258 subjects enrolled in the Open-Label acute phase of the study 
were treated with ZS 10 g TID. Of them, 7 subjects prematurely discontinued; 5 due to withdrawal of 
consent and 2 due to hyperkalaemia (i-STAT potassium values of 6.3 mmol/L, 90 minutes after the second 
dose of ZS on Acute Phase Study Day 1). Of the 251 subjects who completed the Acute Phase, 240 were 
eligible to enter the Maintenance Phase. Among the 11 subjects who were ineligible to enter the 
Maintenance Phase, 2 had i-STAT potassium values < 3.5 mmol/L (3.2 and 3.4 mmol/L), 9 had i-STAT 
potassium values ≥ 5.1 mmol/L. Three eligible subjects did not enter Maintenance Phase due to consent 
withdrawal, investigator’s decision and ECG withdrawal criteria. Thus, 237 subjects entered Maintenance 
phase; of them, 85 were randomized to placebo, 45 to ZS 5 g QD, 51 to ZS 10 g QD, and 56 to ZS 15 g 
QD. 
Recruitment 
Study EUZS-003 recruitment was initiated in November 2012 and completed in October 2013. Study ZS-
004 recruitment was initiated in March 2014 and completed in August 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
Study EUZS-003: 11 subjects had major protocol deviations based on blinded data review: Acute Phase: 
not fasting for the baseline S-K value (1 placebo subject), not fasting for Study Day 3 S-K value (1 ZS 1.25 
g TID subject), dosed while S-K > 7.0 mmol/L (1 ZS 1.25 g TID subject), received incorrect study drug (1 
ZS 5 g TID subject), received SPS within 7 days (1 ZS 10 g TID subject), and < 80% dosing compliance (1 
ZS 10 g TID subject). Subacute Phase: i-STAT potassium value did not qualify for Subacute Phase (1 ZS 
1.25 g TID/Placebo subject and 1 Placebo/ZS 1.25 g QD subject) and received incorrect study drug (2 ZS 5

g TID/5 g QD subjects and 1 ZS 5 g TID/Placebo subject). The Applicant explained that small number of 
subjects who had major protocol deviations would have no impact on the overall efficacy and safety results 
of the study. 
Study ZS-004: Deviations are not summarised and provided by individual patient data only. The Applicant 
explained that deviations noted during the study included mistiming or omission of study procedures or 
deviations in study drug dosing. All subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study. 
Baseline data 
Study EUZS-003: The applicant claimed that demographic characteristics in the study 003 were generally 
similar among the Acute Phase treatment groups at baseline: mean age ranged from 65.2 to 66.2 years, 
majority of subjects in each of the treatment groups were male (range: 53.9% to 64.5%) and White 
(range: 83.9% to 88.7%). The greatest proportions of subjects had baseline S-K values (per central 
laboratory) ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (range: 49.4% to 65.7%). The most common etiology of elevated S-K within each 
of the Acute Phase treatment groups (subjects could have multiple etiologies) was CKD (based on eGFR < 
60 mL/min, ~75%; range: 71% to 80%). Other etiologies of elevated S-K included use of RAAS inhibitor 
medication (~67%; range: 63.1% to 70.8%), and diabetes mellitus (~60%; range: 56.6% to 61.1%). The 
demographic and other baseline characteristics in the Study 003 Subacute Phase ITT Population were 
generally similar to that noted for the Acute Phase ITT Population. The demographic and other baseline 
characteristics of the Maintenance Phase were generally similar to those noted for the Acute Phase. 
Study ZS-004: At baseline of the Acute Phase, mean age was 64.0 years, the majority of the subjects were 
male (57.8%) and White (83.3%). Baseline S-K values (per central laboratory) were < 5.5 mmol/L for 
46.1% of subjects, ≥ 5.5 to < 6.0 mmol/L for 38.8% of subjects, and ≥ 6.0 mmol/L for 15.1% of subjects. 
The most common etiologies of elevated S-K (subjects could have had multiple etiologies) were use of 
RAAS inhibitor medication (69.8%), CKD (based on eGFR < 60 mL/min, 69.4%), and diabetes mellitus 
(65.9%). While predefined primary efficacy population was ITT population, and all efficacy analyses were 
conducted with this population, all the baseline data is provided for the safety population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study EUZS-003 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
In a Study 003 ZS met primary endpoints of (1) the percentage of normokalaemic subjects at 48 hours 
after the initial dose (acute phase) and (2) the total number of days maintaining normokalaemic control 
during the Subacute Phase: in the Acute phase analysis, the normal S-K values (3.5-5.0 mmol/L) were 
achieved at 48 hours for 86.4%, 77.6%, 67.9%, 51.3%, and 47.8% of subjects in the 10 g TID, 5 g TID, 
2.5 g TID, 1.25 g TID, and placebo groups, respectively. The 10 g TID, 5 g TID, and 2.5 g TID doses of ZS 
were statistically significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.0001) (see table below).

Secondary endpoints 
Acute Phase 
The applicant stated that ZS met all of the predefined acute phase secondary endpoints. Mean baseline S-K 
values were comparable among the acute phase treatment groups, ranging from 5.26 to 5.37 mmol/L, with 
no statistically significant difference between any ZS dose group vs. placebo. The S-K lowering effect 
started immediately, with a statistically significant difference from placebo for the mean change from 
baseline at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the first 10 g,  5 g, and 2.5 d dose of ZS (p = 0.009, p = 0.033, and p = 
0.011, respectively) (see table below). During study day 2 (from 24 to 48 hours), statistically significantly 
greater mean reductions in S-K values were observed at all time points in the ZS 10 g TID (p < 0.001), ZS 
5 g TID (p < 0.001), and ZS 2.5 g TID (p < 0.05) dose groups vs. placebo (see Table 3.4.13). The largest 
mean decrease from baseline in S-K was at 48 hours after the first dose in all ZS TID groups: 10 g (-0.73 
mmol/L), 5 g (-0.54 mmol/L), and 2.5 g (-0.46 mmol/L).

Baseline was calculated by taking the mean of the screening time points (0 hour, 30 minutes, and 1 hour) 
a  
averaged with the 0-hour time point on Study Day 1; all values used in the calculation were determined by the central 
laboratory.  
The 10 g, 5 g, and 2.5 g TID doses of ZS were statistically significantly superior to placebo  for the 
exponential decrease in S-K over the initial 48 hours of treatment (-0.73 mmol/L, p < 0.0001, t-value: 
11.40; -0.54 mmol/L, p < 0.0001, t-value: 6.55; and -0.46 mmol/L, p = 0.0009, t-value: 3.33, 
respectively), and over the initial 24 hours of treatment (study day 2: 0 hour; p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and 
p = 0.0315, respectively). Median time to a 0.5 mmol/L decrease in S-K values was 24.8 hours in the 
placebo group vs. 22.8, 23.5, 21.4, and 24.1 hours in the ZS 10 g, 5 g, 2.5 g, and 1.25 g TID groups,

Subacute Phase 
A statistically significantly (p ≤ 0.001) smaller mean increase in S-K from subacute phase baseline to 
subacute days 2, 3, 6, and 12 was observed for ZS QD vs. placebo in subjects who received ZS 10 g TID in 
the Acute Phase (0.00 vs. 0.28 mmol/L; -0.06 vs. 0.37 mmol/L; 0.10 vs. 0.43 mmol/L; 0.06 vs. 0.58 
mmol/L, respectively); for ZS 10 g TID difference was not significant at subacute days 1 and 18, for all 
other dosing groups difference was not significant at any time point. For the exponential rate of change in 
S-K values (1) over the 12-day treatment interval, the 10 g and 5 g QD doses of ZS were statistically 
significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0083, respectively); (2) over the first 5 days of the 
subacute phase, 10 g QD doses (p < 0.0001) were superior over placebo. There was no statistically 
significant difference between other ZS QD groups vs. placebo, or in acute phase placebo subjects in ZS 
1.25 and 2.5 g QD groups. 
In the study 003 time to first increase of ≥ 0.5 mmol/L in S-K during the subacute phase was statistically 
significantly later with ZS QD vs. placebo for subjects who received ZS 10 g TID (18 vs. 3 days) in the 
acute phase. Time to relapse in S-K values (return to acute phase S-K baseline value) was statistically 
significantly later with ZS QD vs. placebo for subjects who received ZS 5 g TID (6 vs. 2 days, p = 0.0328) 
and ZS 2.5 g TID (12 vs. 1 day, p = 0.0061), but not for the ZS 10 g QD (18 vs. 12 days; may be due to 
the extended effect of ZS dosing during the acute phase within the placebo group) and ZS 1.25 QD group 
(2 vs. 3 days). A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the ZS 10 g and 5 g QD groups 
retained normal S-K values (3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L) at the end of treatment (subacute day 12) compared to 
their corresponding placebo groups, but not until the end of the subacute phase (subacute day 18); see 
table below.

The applicant explained that superior efficacy of ZS 10 g TID vs. placebo in reducing S-K during the acute 
phase and of ZS 5 g and 10 g QD vs. placebo in maintaining S-K during the subacute phase was evident 
across a variety of subpopulation analyses, including subjects with diabetes mellitus, congestive heart 
disease, CKD, and concurrent use of RAAS inhibitor medication. During the Acute Phase, the difference 
between the ZS 10 g TID and placebo groups in the percentage of subjects with normalized S-K at 48 hours 
increased with higher baseline S-K values (from 28.1% with baseline S-K ≤ 5.3 mmol/L to 54.8% with 
baseline S-K > 5.5 mmol/L) and with lower baseline eGFR values (from 4.5% with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 to 73.3% with baseline eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
Study ZS-004 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
In Study 004 Subjects who achieved normokalaemia following ZS 10 g TID in the acute phase were 
randomized to 28 days of placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g, or 15 g QD dosing during the maintenance phase. ZS met 
the primary efficacy endpoint of mean S-K value during Maintenance Phase Study Days 8 to 29 at all 3 
doses of ZS (see table below). Each ZS group had a statistically significantly (p ≤ 0.0001) smaller mean S-
K value vs. placebo. The mean S-K value decreased with increasing dose of ZS (5.1, 4.8, 4.5, and 4.4 
mmol/L for placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g QD, respectively).

Phase and Maintenance Phase baseline serum potassium; age (< 55, 55-64, ≥ 65 years); and binary indicators for RAAS inhibitors use, 
chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. The observed margins option (option uses actual sample size ratio 
between treatment groups instead of assuming equal balance) and an unstructured variance covariance matrix were used.

Secondary endpoints 
Acute Phase 
In Study 004 ZS demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline in S-K with ZS 10 g TID 
over the first 48 hours of dosing (see table below). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 84.3% of subjects 
had normalized S-K values at 24 hours after the first dose of ZS, and 97.6% of subjects had normalized S-
K values at 48 hours after the first dose of ZS. The S-K lowering effect was rapid, with a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful decrease from baseline noted at 1 hour after the first 10 g dose of ZS. 
The median time to normalization of S-K values during the acute phase was 2.17 hours after the first dose 
of ZS.  
Subjects with higher starting S-K values demonstrated a greater mean decrease in S-K. As an example, 
subjects with a starting S-K 
 6.0 mmol/L demonstrated a mean decrease in S-K of -1.5 mmol/L at 48 
hours after the first dose of ZS as compared with a mean decrease of -0.8 mmol/L in subjects with a 
≥
starting S-K < 5.5 mmol/L. Similarly, subjects with a starting S-K 
 6.0 mmol/L demonstrated a mean 
reduction 2 hours after the first dose of ZS of -0.7 mmol/L as compared with the overall population where 
≥
the mean reduction was -0.4 mmol/L.

Maintenance Phase 
A statistically significant greater number of normokalaemic days during maintenance Phase Study Days 8 to 
29 were observed for each ZS group vs. placebo. The mean number of normokalaemic days increased with 
increasing dose of ZS (13.4, 13.9, and 16.8 days for ZS 5 g, 10 g and 15 g QD, respectively) vs. 7.4 days 
for placebo (out of 22 days in total), see table below.

*, **, *** p ≤ 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively (Fisher exact test).  
The mean change from the acute phase baseline to maintenance phase study Day 29/Exit was -0.44 
mmol/L in the placebo group, -0.77 mmol/L in the ZS 5 g QD group, -1.10 mmol/L in the ZS 10 g QD 
group, and -1.19 mmol/L in the ZS 15 g QD group. Statistically significant differences from placebo were 
observed for all ZS groups from maintenance phase study day 2 to Day 26. Mean change from the

maintenance phase baseline to maintenance phase study day 29/Exit was 0.56 mmol/L in the placebo 
group, 0.25 mmol/L in the ZS 5 g QD group, 0.11 mmol/L in the ZS 10 g QD group, and -0.09 mmol/L in 
the ZS 15 g QD group. Statistically significant differences vs. placebo were observed (1) from maintenance 
phase study day 2 to day 26 for the ZS 15 g QD group, and (2) from maintenance phase study day 2 to 
day 22 for the ZS 5 g and 10 g QD groups. Time to hyperkalaemia (S-K ≥ 5.1 mmol/L) during the 
maintenance phase occurred later with continued ZS QD treatment than with placebo for subjects on ZS 5 g 
(p = 0.0012), ZS 10 g (p < 0.0001), and ZS 15 g QD (p < 0.0001). Median time to hyperkalaemia from the 
maintenance phase baseline was 7 and 14 days in the placebo and ZS 5 g QD groups, respectively; <50% 
of subjects in the ZS 10 g and 15 g QD groups had hyperkalaemia before the end of the maintenance 
phase, therefore, the median in these 2 groups was not reached. 
Time to relapse (return to S-K value measured at acute phase baseline) during the maintenance phase was 
later with continued ZS QD vs. placebo for subjects who received ZS 5 g QD (p = 0.0045), ZS 10 g QD (p = 
0.0001), and ZS 15 g QD (p < 0.0001). Median time to relapse from the maintenance phase baseline was 
19 and 29 days in the placebo and ZS 5 g QD groups, respectively; <50% of subjects in the ZS 10 g QD 
and ZS 15 g QD groups had relapsed at the end of the Maintenance Phase, therefore, the median in these 2 
groups was not reached. 
Ancillary analyses 
The consistency of ZS efficacy across subpopulations was assessed in Studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004 
individually.  
Acute Phase 
Study EUZS-003: The ZS 10 g TID group had statistically significantly larger mean decreases than the 
placebo group in all demographic subpopulations tested (age <65 years/≥65 years; male/female gender; 
White/Black/Other race; and US/not US geographic region); in Black subjects (17 subjects in each 
treatment group) the treatment difference from placebo was almost double (-0.82 mmol/L) than for White 
subjects (-0.43 mmol/L). The ZS 10 g TID group had larger mean decreases vs. placebo with regards to 
baseline S-K (>5.5/5.4-5.5/≤5.3 mmol/L), eGFR (≥60/30 to <60/15 to <30/<15 mL/min/1.73 m2), 
concomitant diseases (diabetes mellitus, CKD, HF), and use of RAAS inhibitor medication; the treatment 
difference was statistically significant in all subpopulations, except for subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean reduction at 48 hours in the ZS 10 g TID group increased with higher baseline 
S-K values (from -0.57 mmol/L with baseline S-K ≤ 5.3 mmol/L to -1.10 mmol/L with baseline S-K > 5.5 
mmol/L; difference from placebo: -0.42 mmol/L and -0.68 mmol/L, respectively) and with lower baseline 
eGFR values (from -0.79 mmol/L with baseline eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to -1.03 mmol/L with 
baseline eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2; difference from placebo: -0.57 mmol/L to -0.86 mmol/L, 
respectively). 
Study ZS-004: The ZS 10 g TID group had mean decreases in all demographic subpopulations (age, 
gender, race, and geographic region). The largest mean changes in S-K were observed in subjects who 
were Black (-1.28 mmol/L) or from outside the United States (-1.27 mmol/L). The ZS 10 g TID group had 
mean decreases in with regards to baseline S-K, eGFR, concomitant diseases, and use of RAAS inhibitor 
medication. The mean reduction in S-K at 48 hours increased with higher Acute Phase baseline S-K values 
(S-K ≥ 6.0: -1.49 mmol/L; S-K ≥ 5.5 to < 6.0: -1.19 mmol/L; S-K < 5.5: -0.78 mmol/L). Among subjects 
with baseline S-K values ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, statistically significant mean decreases from baseline in S-K were 
observed at all time points from 1 to 48 hours following ZS dosing. 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 69/103 
  
  
  
Extended Dosing  
Study EUZS-003: In Study 003 Extended dosing ZS 5g and 10 g QD group had smaller mean increases vs. 
placebo in all demographic subpopulations (age, gender, race, and geographic region), except for female 
subjects in ZS 5 g QD group:  in ZS 5 g QD group, statistically significant mean differences were observed 
for males (0.06 vs. 0.30 mmol/L) and Black subjects (-0.30 vs. 0.29 mmol/L) vs. placebo. Overall 
difference from placebo was substantially larger for Black vs. White subjects (-0.59 vs. -0.04 mmol/L), and 
for males vs. females (-0.24 vs. 0.11 mmol/L). Black subpopulation had few (a total of 17) subjects. In ZS 
10 g QD group, difference vs. placebo was statistically significant in all subpopulations except few subjects 
enrolled at sites outside the United States (8 subjects) and Blacks (16 subjects). The ZS 5 g QD group had 
smaller mean increases in S-K vs. placebo group all subpopulations with regards to baseline eGFR, S-K, 
concomitant diseases, and use of RAAS inhibitor medication, except for GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; these 
differences were not statistically significant. The ZS 10 g QD group had smaller mean increases vs. placebo 
group in all subpopulations with regards to baseline eGFR, S-K, concomitant diseases, and use of RAAS 
inhibitor medication, except for subjects with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.87 vs. 0.46 mmol/L, 
respectively). The treatment difference was statistically significant in all subpopulations except for the few 
subjects with baseline S-K > 5.5 mmol/L (18 subjects) and with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (8 subjects).  
Study ZS-004: mean change in S-K from Extended Dosing baseline to Extended Dosing Study Day 29/Exit 
with ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g QD and placebo groups was summarised. The ZS 5 g, 10 g and 15 g QD group 
had smaller mean increases in S-K vs. placebo group in all demographic subpopulations (age, gender, race, 
and geographic region), except for other races in ZS 5 g QD group. In ZS 5 g QD group these differences 
were statistically significant for subjects enrolled at sites in the United States (0.17 vs, 0.47 mmol/L), 
Whites (0.20 vs. 0.53 mmol/L), Males (0.21 vs. 0.52 mmol/L), and subjects 
 65 years of age (0.36 vs. 
0.69 mmol/L). In ZS 10 g QD group these differences were statistically significant in all subpopulations 
except for Blacks, other races, and subjects < 65 years of age. Differences between each ZS group and 
≥
placebo were consistent across subpopulations with regards to baseline eGFR, Baseline S-K, Concomitant 
Diseases, and Use of RAAS Inhibitor Medication: smaller mean increases in S-K was observed in all ZS 
groups than with placebo group. In ZS 5 g group these differences were statistically significant for eGFR < 
60 mL/min/1.73m, RAASi medication, Diabetes mellitus, Heart failure and CKD. In ZS 10 g group, also 
difference for Baseline S-K ≥ 6.0 mmol/L was statistically significant. In ZS 15 g group statistically 
significant difference was also observed for Baseline S-K ≥ 6.0 mmol/L and for Baseline S-K 5.5 to < 6.0 
mmol/L; only difference with regards to Baseline S-K < 5.5 mmol/L was not statistically significant. 
The Applicant concluded that ZS reduced S-K and maintained normokalaemia independently of the 
underlying cause of hyperkalaemia, demonstrating similar efficacy in subjects with CKD, heart failure, and 
diabetes mellitus, as well as in subjects receiving concomitant treatment with RAAS inhibitor medication. In 
addition, ZS demonstrated comparable efficacy across demographic subgroups, including age, gender, race, 
and geographic region.

Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Two-phase, Multi-dose, Prospective, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-
controlled Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of ZS, an Oral Sorbent, in Subjects with Mild to 
Moderate Hyperkalemia 
Study identifier  EUZS-003 
Design 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment with 1 of 4 
doses of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo, administered TID for the initial 48 hours 
(Acute Phase), followed by a randomized dose of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo 
administered QD for 12 days (Subacute Phase). For Subacute Phase, normokalemic subjects 
were randomized to 1 of the 4 active doses in a 1:1 ratio for the same Acute Phase dose QD 
and placebo QD, whereas subjects who received placebo in the Acute Phase were randomized 
to receive either 1.25 g or 2.5 g of ZS administered QD in Subacute Phase. Subjects were 
followed for 7 days after the last dose of study drug.

Study identifier 
ZS-004 
Design 
In the Open-label Acute Phase subjects were treated with ZS 10 g TID for the initial 48 hours (6 
doses). Subjects who achieved normokalemia during the Acute Phase were randomized in a double-
blind manner in a 4:4:4:7 ratio to 1 of 3 doses of ZS (5 g, 10 g, or 15 g) or placebo administered 
QD for a further 28 days (Maintenance Phase).  Subjects who completed the Maintenance Phase 
Study Day 29 visit or who discontinued due to hypo- or hyperkalemia were able participation in an 
open-label extension study (ZS-004E). All study subjects who did not enter the extension study were 
to be followed for a total of 7 (± 1) days after the last dose of study drug.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
For the acute phase, the placebo and ZS 10 g TID groups are displayed from studies ZS-002, EUZS-003 
and ZS-004; 10 g TID dose of ZS was evaluated in each of the studies, and it is the proposed dose for the 
acute treatment of hyperkalemia. For extended dosing, the placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g QD, and 15 g QD groups 
are displayed. The placebo, ZS 5 g, and 10 g QD groups were evaluated in studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004. 
The 15 g QD dose of ZS was evaluated only in Study ZS-004. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
generally similar across each of the ZS studies. More than 90% and more than 86% of subjects completed 
treatment in each treatment group during extended dosing of studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004, respectively. 
According the applicant, effect of ZS was consistent across the studies: (1) in acute phase, rapid effect 
following ZS 10 g TID in lowering S-K was demonstrated, while (2) in extended dosing, sustained efficacy 
of ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g QD doses was demonstrated.

Clinical studies in special populations 
All pivotal studies involved subjects with CKD and in various age groups. The applicant performed studies in 
renally impaired population of several age groups. The analyses of these subgroups did not provide 
information about differences amongst these patients. 
The applicant submitted a Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for ZS to the paediatric development and the 
PDCO agreed to defer studies with ZS in children from birth to < 18 years of age with hyperkalaemia until 
the safety and efficacy of ZS in adults has been established and an adult dose and regimen is defined. In 
addition, age-appropriate oral and rectal formulations of ZS are under development for studies in paediatric 
subjects.  
Supportive studies 
Long-term efficacy has been assessed in the completed study ZS-004E and ongoing Study ZS-005. When 
the combined ZS exposure across studies ZS-004 and ZS-004E was added to the ZS exposure from study 
ZS-005, the overall extent of exposure as of 7 December 2015 was > 30 days for 634 subjects, > 90 days 
for 524 subjects, > 180 days for 360 subjects, > 270 days for 243 subjects, and > 360 days for 149 
subjects. According the applicant, there has been no indication of loss of effect (tolerance) in study ZS-
004E or ZS-005 and extended dosing with ZS for up to 11 months was effective in maintaining 
normokalaemia, see table below.

Extended Dosing Phase: Proportion of Subjects With Average Serum Potassium Values ≤ 
5.5 mmol/L Across Extended Dosing Study Days 8 to 337 a (Study 004E) 
Across Extended Dosing Study Days 8 to 337, 88.3% (95% CI: 81.2%, 93.5%) of subjects had average S-
K values ≤ 5.1 mmol/L, which is statistically significantly higher than the 50% null hypothesis. The least 
squares mean from a logistic regression analysis, which adjusted for baseline covariates, was 92.8% (95% 
CI: 84.7%, 96.8%). Results were consistent across subgroups defined by age and baseline presence of 
CKD, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and RAAS inhibitor use. In addition, the proportions of subjects with 
S-K values ≤ 5.1 mmol/L were relatively constant among the Extended Dosing Phase time points, ranging 
from 77.1% to 87.5%. 
The ongoing study ZS-005 is a phase 3, multicenter, multi-dose, open-label study to investigate the long-
term safety and efficacy of ZS in subjects with hyperkalemia (i-STAT potassium values at entry ≥ 5.1 
mmol/L). No CSR was provided for this study, only high level results of ongoing study. The open-label 
maintenance study contains an Acute Phase, in which subjects are dosed with ZS 10 g TID for 24 to 72 
hours, followed by a long-term Extended Dosing period in which subjects are dosed with ZS starting at 5 g 
QD. During Extended Dosing, the ZS dose may be increased or decreased in increments/decrements of 5 g 
QD up to a maximum of 15 g QD or a minimum of 5 g QOD based on i-STAT potassium measurements. 
In the randomized withdrawal study, subjects either continue on the same ZS dose they were receiving at 
the time of the Extended Dosing Study Day 176 visit (n = 100) or receive placebo (n = 100) for an 
EMA/93250/2018

additional 28 days. No dose titration is allowed during the randomized withdrawal study. The randomized 
withdrawal component of the study has not yet started. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four completed clinical studies (1 phase 2 studies, and 3 phase 3 studies) were presented to evaluate 
efficacy in the target population: (1) for the acute lowering of S-K: 2 studies (study ZS-002 and acute 
Phase of study EUZS-003) and 1 supportive study (acute phase of study ZS-004); (2) for the maintenance 
of normokalaemia: 2 pivotal studies (≤12 days in the subacute phase of study EUZS-003 and ≤28 days in 
the maintenance phase of study ZS-004) 1 supportive long-term extension of study ZS-004 (≤11 months in 
study ZS-004E).  
Study ZS-002 was a Phase 2, first in human, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind dose escalating study report in subjects with mild hyperkalemia in CKD and moderate kidney 
dysfunction. Treatment: Eligible subjects in a double-blind dose-escalating fashion (3 separate cohorts), 
were to be randomized to receive escalating doses of ZS (0.3 g, 3 g, and 10 g) or placebo, administered 
TID daily with meals. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 3 ZS 
doses TID administered for 48 hours to subjects with moderate CKD and mild hyperkalemia. A total of 90 
subjects (38 females, 52 males) with CKD (mean GFR on Study Day 0 = 45.4 mL/min, range: 30 to 62 
mL/min) and hyperkalemia (mean screening S-K [per central laboratory] = 5.16 mmol/L, range: 4.6 to 6.0 
mmol/L) were randomized to treatment in the study. 
Study EUZS-003 was a phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
dose-ranging study in subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalemia. Study sites were located at 65 sites in 
the United States, Australia, and South Africa. A total of 754 subjects were randomized to the 48-hours 
acute phase of whom 543 subjects followed in ≤12-days subacute phase (extended dosing), study EU-004 
It was a phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging 
study in subjects with hyperkalemia. Study sites were located at 44 sites in the United States, Australia, 
and South Africa. A total of 258 subjects were treated in the outpatient, open-label acute phase, of whom 
237 achieved normokalaemia (S-K 3.5-5.0 mmol/L) and were randomized to extended dosing. 
In both pivotal studies, adult subjects (<18 years) of both genders, and with ability to have repeated blood 
draws were enrolled. Potassium requirements were: study EUZS-003: mean i-STAT potassium of 5.0-6.5 
mmol/L on study Day 0; study ZS-004: two consecutive i-STAT potassium values, measured 60 min. apart, 
both ≥5.1 mmol/L and measured within 1 day of the first ZS dose on Acute Phase Study Day 1. Both 
pivotal studies exclusion criteria included (1) pseudohyperkalemia signs and symptoms, such as hemolyzed 
blood specimen, history of severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis; (2) cardiac arrhythmias that required 
immediate treatment; (3) diabetic ketoacidosis; (4) dialysis; (5) treatment with resins (such as sevelamer 
acetate, SPS), calcium acetate, calcium carbonate, or lanthanum carbonate, within the last 7 days. In 
summary, the study designs of both pivotal studies (003 and 004) are appropriate to establish absolute 
effect and safe enough to avoid. The potassium content in the food was not regulated and nor was the 
impact of potassium content impacting concomitant medications, such as ACEI or diuretics. The 
concomitant medications were required to be continued. Even if this could be considered as a potential 
weakness of the study, the conditions are closer to real life and thus, the control of potassium in 
diet/concomitant therapy is acceptable to the CHMP.

In study EUZS-003, eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind 
treatment with 1 of 4 doses of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo, administered TID for the initial 
48 hours (acute phase), followed by a randomized dose of ZS (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g) or placebo 
administered QD for 12 days (subacute phase). There was a one-time randomization to assign the acute 
phase and the subacute phase if normalized S-K was achieved after completion of the acute phase. In the 
subacute phase, normokalaemic subjects were randomized to 1 of the 4 active doses in a 1:1 ratio for the 
same acute phase dose QD and placebo QD, whereas subjects who received placebo in the acute phase 
were randomized to receive either 1.25 g or 2.5 g of ZS administered QD in subacute phase; study ZS-004: 
in the open-label acute phase subjects were treated with ZS 10 g TID for the initial 48 hours (6 doses). 
Subjects who achieved normokalaemia during the acute phase were to be randomized in a double-blind 
manner in a 4:4:4:7 ratio to 1 of 3 doses of ZS (5 g, 10 g, or 15 g) or placebo administered QD for a 
further 28 days.  An additional week of safety follow-up after the last dose day extended the study to a 
total of 35 days. In both pivotal studies patients received mainly two days acute phase dosages via TID 
regimen that was ranging from 1.25 TID to 10 g TID in Study 003 (with meals) and 10 g dose TID in Study 
004 (it is understood, that “with meals”). For the maintenance phase, the dosage was administered QD for 
12 (in Study 003) or 28 days (in Study 004). Maintenance phase in study 004 was designed enriching the 
population by responders excluding non-responders. The magnitude of the ineligible patients to enter 
maintenance phase is very limited (less than 5%). The magnitude of lowering dosages in study 004 (from 
QD to QOD regimen) was more pronounced: ~20% of patient in 10 g and 15 g dosages. This led to 
applicant to advise starting maintenance dose not with 1/3 of the two highest dosages but rather with only 
5g QD. This is acceptable due to rigorous monitoring and clear titration scheme is proposed. 
The primary objective in study EUZS-003 was to perform a controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy 
of 4 ZS TID doses for 48 hours in the acute phase for subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalemia at 
baseline. The primary objective in study ZS-004 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 ZS QD doses 
for 28 days in maintaining normokalaemia in subjects achieving normokalaemia following 2 days of acute 
therapy for subjects with hyperkalemia at baseline. Thus, two primary objectives in two pivotal studies 
focus on two separate issues – acute hypokelaemic effect and maintenance of normokalaemic effect during 
a rather short term. This approach in the development is not seen as a usual in the development where one 
study is replicating another for acute hypokalemic effects. The primary efficacy endpoint in EUZS-003: (1) 
for the acute phase was % of subjects achieving normokalaemia after 48 hours of therapy; (2) for the 
subacute phase was the cumulative number of days remaining normokalaemic during the 12 days of 
therapy for subjects on subacute therapy and randomized withdrawal, separately calculated for the 4 acute 
Phase active treatments (excluding acute phase placebo). The primary efficacy endpoint in ZS-004 was the 
model-based least squares mean (LSMEAN) of all available S-K values during maintenance phase study 
(days 8 to 29).  One of the secondary efficacy endpoints for the maintenance phase included number of 
normokalaemic days during maintenance phase study days 8 to 29. Thus, the two primary objectives were 
targeted with three main endpoints – one for acute phase in study 003 and two for maintenance phase in 
studies 003 and 004. This might be acceptable considering supportive secondary endpoints for acute phase 
from study 004. The scope of study and its objectives with endpoints do not interfere with statistical 
considerations and recommendations for phase III trial. The primary endpoint for maintenance therapy 
represents more a pharmacodynamic than clinical oriented, because the maintenance without maintenance 
is clinically questionable. Thus, the cumulative number of days normokalaemic where the subjects are 
normokalaemic were the advised primary endpoint that was followed and results were recalculated 
Sample size for the exponential rate of change during the acute phase in EUZS-003 was calculated using 
the program for sample size calculation of a random slopes model with parameters estimates based on 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 81/103 
  
  
  
study ZS-002 data. The sample size in EUZS-004 was based on the mean S-K during maintenance phase 
study days 8 through to 29. To optimize the comparison of 3 active doses vs. placebo, the placebo group 
had 1.73 × the number of subjects per active dose. A 4:4:4:7 allocation best approximated the optimum 
Dunnett’s allocation. The randomization‘s specifications, conditions and procedure are appropriate for the 
trial. In studies EUZS-003 and 004, subsets of study sample analysis were built properly. In general, the 
statistical specifications were adequate. The multiplicity issue was approached properly. Missing data were 
treated properly. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study 002 ZS met the predefined primary endpoint of exponential decrease in S-K from baseline to 48 
hours at the 10 g TID dose (mean maximal reductions of 0.43 mmol/L; p < 0.0001) and the 3 g TID dose 
(mean maximal reductions of 0.92 mmol/L, p = 0.048), while ZS 0.3 g TID did not result in a significant S-
K reduction. The S-K lowering effect started immediately, with statistically significant reductions vs. placebo 
1 hour after the first ZS 10 g TID dose (p = 0.044). During study day 2, statistically significantly greater 
mean reductions in S-K values were observed at all time points in the ZS 10 g TID dose group vs. placebo 
(p 
 0.001), and this reduction continued for 2.5 days after the last dose of study drug (p = 0.005 at day 4 
and p = 0.003 at day 5). Mean maximal reductions (-0.66 mmol/L) occurred at 38 hours of the study: a > 
≤
1 mmol/L drop in S-K was observed in 41.7% of ZS 10 g TID subjects had vs. 3.4% of placebo subjects. 
Dose-dependent responses were also demonstrated with other S-K assessments with the maximal effect at 
the ZS 10 g TID dose. Thus, three dosages (0.3, 3, and 10 g) were tested over placebo during 48 hours 
and two doses (3 and 10 g) were statistically superior over placebo in decreasing S-K. This was sufficient to 
proceed further in the development. 
In study 003, ZS met primary endpoints of (1) the percentage of normokalaemic subjects at 48 hours after 
the initial dose and (2) the total number of days maintaining normokalaemic control during the subacute 
phase: in the acute phase analysis, the normal S-K values (3.5-5.0 mmol/L) were achieved at 48 hours for 
86.4%, 77.6%, 67.9%, 51.3%, and 47.8% of subjects in the 10 g TID, 5 g TID, 2.5 g TID, 1.25 g TID, and 
placebo groups, respectively. The 10 g TID, 5 g TID, and 2.5 g TID doses of ZS were statistically 
significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.0001). In a study 003, subacute phase ZS subjects, the total 
numbers of days normokalaemic were statistically significantly greater in the ZS 10 g QD (10.2 vs. 8.2 
days), 5 g QD (9.0 vs. 6.0 days), and 2.5 g QD (8.6 vs. 6.2 days) groups compared with their 
corresponding placebo controls. 
In Study 004, subjects who achieved normokalaemia following ZS 10 g TID in the acute phase were 
randomized to 28 days of placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g, or 15 g QD dosing during the maintenance phase. ZS met 
the primary efficacy endpoint of mean S-K value during the maintenance phase at all 3 doses. Each ZS 
group had a statistically significantly (p ≤ 0.0001) smaller mean S-K value vs. placebo. The mean S-K 
value decreased with increasing dose of ZS (5.1, 4.8, 4.5, and 4.4 mmol/L for placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 
15 g QD, respectively). A statistically significant greater (p ≤ 0.0001) number of normokalaemic days 
during the maintenance phase were observed for each ZS group vs. placebo. The mean number of 
normokalaemic days increased with increasing dose of ZS (13.4, 13.9, and 16.8 days for ZS 5 g, 10 g and 
15 g QD, respectively) vs. 7.4 days for placebo (out of 22 days in total).  
This suggests that ZS might have an absolute hypokalaemic effect and might be beneficial for the mild to 
moderate hyperkalaemia if dosed at mild to moderate hyperkalemia level in 5 g to 10 g dosages in ~80% 
of patients. The proposed dosage to start with dose “up to 10 g” seems not entirely justified as the median 
time to normalization of S-K values (to 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L) during first 48 hours was statistically significantly 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 82/103 
  
  
  
reduced with the ZS 10 g TID dose vs. placebo, but not with the ZS 5 g, 2.5 g, or 1.25 g TID doses, that 
was 1.1 hours vs 3.9, 3.8, and 4.0 respectively. This is in disagreement with median time to 0.5 mmol/L 
decrease in S-K values that were statistically significantly different from placebo with the dosages ZS 10 g, 
5 g, and 2.5 g TID dosages vs. placebo, but not with the 1.25 g TID dose. In the acute therapy, median 
time to normalization of S-K values (to 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L) during first 48 hours was statistically significantly 
reduced with the ZS 10 g TID dose vs. placebo only but not with the ZS 5 g, 2.5 g, or 1.25 g TID, that were 
1.1 hours vs 3.9, 3.8, 4,0, and 4,0 respectively. In addition, there was significant proportion of patients not 
achieving normokalaemia during first 24h. For the maintenance therapy the primary analysis in the study 
003 subacute phase showed that the total numbers of normokalaemic days were statistically significantly 
greater in the ZS 10 g QD (10.2 vs. 8.2 days), 5 g QD (9.0 vs. 6.0 days), and 2.5 g QD (8.6 vs. 6.2 days) 
groups compared with their corresponding placebo controls. In the Study 004, median time to hyperkalemia 
from the maintenance phase baseline was 7 and 14 days in the placebo and ZS 5 g QD groups, 
respectively. This is useful information to address for the efficacy monitoring purpose. The applicant was 
also asked to summarise the data for relapses for various baseline S-K values before maintenance phase. 
Dose dependence in time to relapse was found with median time for 5 g dose ranging from 4 to 21 days 
depending on the baseline S-K values. 
In Study 004, subjects who achieved normokalaemia following ZS 10 g TID in the acute phase were 
randomized to 28 days of placebo, ZS 5 g, 10 g, or 15 g QD dosing during the maintenance phase. ZS met 
the primary efficacy endpoint of mean S-K value during the maintenance phase at all 3 doses of ZS. Each 
ZS group had a statistically significantly (p ≤ 0.0001) smaller mean S-K value vs. placebo. The primary 
efficacy analysis for the maintenance effect in study 003 incorporated both normokalaemic (24/49 for dose 
1.25 g QD, 33/54 for dose 2.5 g QD, 40/64 for dose 5 g QD, and 50/63 for dose 10 g QD) and non-
normokalsemic patient at the end of subacute phase. The proportions of subjects with S-K values ≤ 5.1 
mmol/ ranged between 77.3% and 84.2% during the extended dosing phase (study 004E) time points up 
through study Day 239, with an average throughout study day 239 of 80.7%. The CHP asked the applicant 
to reanalyse the data for both pivotal studies and calculate the cumulative number of normokalaemic days 
where the subjects are normokalaemic for the entire primary endpoint time in subacute/maintenance 
phases. The additional analyses for studies 003, 004 and 004E showed dose dependent proportions of 
patients who remained normokalaemic during the entire subacute phases that were numerically higher as 
compared to placebo, i.e., ranging from ~30% to 49% as compared to 26% in placebo group in study 003 
and ranging from 27% to 52% as compared to 12% in placebo group. The respective proportions of 
patients who remained normokalaemic during entire maintenance period of 1 year was ~16%.  During 
CHMP assessment of these results, it was agreed to simplify the indication to “Lokelma is indicated for the 
treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients”. Several other changes were introduced into SmPC, such as 
posology scheme and mode of administration in order to bring clarity and to adequately inform the 
prescribers about the safe and efficacious use of Lokelma.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considers the clinical efficacy data submitted by the applicant are sufficient to conclude on a 
positive benefit/risk balance.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data were analysed for the safety population, defined as all subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
study drug during the particular phase. The primary evaluation of safety is based on the data accumulated 
from the 4 completed Phase 2/3 studies. Data from Studies ZS-002, EUZS-003, and ZS-004 have been 
pooled to produce safety summaries. As of 7 December 2015 a total of 1,980 subjects (1760 patients and 
220 healthy volunteers) have been exposed to at least 1 dose of ZS in the clinical program. Subject 
disposition data are presented by acute phase and extended dosing (see table below). The period of 48 
hours up to 96 hours in Study ZS-002, 48 hours in Studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004, and 24 hours up to 72 
hours in ongoing study ZS-005 is described as Acute Phase. Acute Phase was double-blind and placebo-
controlled in Studies ZS-002 and EUZS-003, and open-label in Studies ZS-004 and ZS-005.

While ZS doses varied from 0.3 to 10 g in acute phase and from 1.25 to 15 g in extended dosing, the 
primary focus of the safety assessment is the comparison of ZS 10 g TID to placebo in the acute phase and 
ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g QD to placebo during extended dosing. In the acute phase, 1101 subjects were 
treated (188 with placebo, 913 with ZS) mainly in studies ZS-002, EUZS-003, and ZS-004. For acute 
phase, extent of exposure was summarised by number of doses received; the majority of the subjects in 
each of the treatment groups received between 4 and 6 doses of study drug (94.7% placebo; 97.4% total 
ZS), see table below:

Adverse events 
The applicant stated that overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the acute 
phase was comparable among the treatment groups (placebo 10.6%, ZS ≤ 3 g TID 12.4%, ZS 5 g TID 
14.0%,  ZS 10 g TID 10.4%). The only TEAE reported by 
 2 . 0 %  o f s u b
diarrhea (2.1% in placebo group, 2.4% in the ZS ≤ 3 g TID group, 1.9% in ZS 5 g TID group, and 1.2% in 
ZS 10 g TID group). According the applicant, the overall incidence of gastrointestinal (GIT) disorders was 
comparable among the treatment groups (5.3% placebo; 3.6% ZS ≤ 3 g TID, 3.8% ZS 5 g TID, and 4.5%

ZS 10 g TID). The incidence of hypokalemia (a potential concern with any potassium-lowering drug) at the 
ZS 10 g TID dose was very low (0.7%; 3/425) in the acute phase, and all cases were classified as mild (S-K 
between 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/L). The only TEAEs considered related to study drug that were reported by 
 1 %  
of subjects in any treatment group were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The overall incidence of GIT 
disorders considered related to study drug was comparable among the treatment groups (3.2% placebo; 
1.8% ZS ≤ 3 g TID, 3.2% ZS 5 g TID, and 2.1% ZS 10 g TID).  
Only one subject reported TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be severe. During extended 
dosing, the overall incidence of TEAEs was highest in the ZS 15 g QD group (44.6%), followed by the ZS 5 
g QD (34.5%), ZS 10 g QD (31.6%), placebo (26.6%), and ZS ≤ 2.5 g QD (23.6%) groups. The applicant 
explained that increased incidence of TEAEs in ZS 15 g QD group was related with the higher frequency of 
events associated with general disorders and administration site conditions and those associated with 
infections and infestations. The overall incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the ZS 15 g QD group (see 
table below), which may be associated with the greater disease burden in this group. No clear dose-related 
trends were observed among the treatment groups for any specific type of event reported.

During extended dosing in study ZS-004E, 82 (66.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE. Fourteen 
(11.4%) subjects had TEAEs considered related to study drug.  Related AEs reported for more than one 
subject were muscle spasms (3 subjects; 2.4%), oedema peripheral (2 subjects; 1.6%), electrocardiogram

Ongoing study ZS-005 (as of 7 December 2015): During the acute phase, a total of 26 (3.5%) subjects 
reported at least 1 TEAE; the most common types of TEAEs reported were gastrointestinal disorders (9 
subjects, 1.2%), including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal distension; hypertension was 
reported in 2 subjects (0.3%).  All of the events that occurred during the acute phase were reported in < 
1% of subjects.  A total of 7 (0.9%) subjects reported at least 1 TEAE considered related to study drug 
including nausea (2 subjects), diarrhoea (2 subjects), constipation (1 subject), abdominal distension (1 
subject), oedema peripheral (1 subject), hyperaesthesia (1 subject), and pruritus (1 subject).  During 
extended dosing, a total of 398 (53.4%) subjects reported at least 1 TEAE, 1408 TEAEs in total. The most 
common events were hypertension (8.2%); events related to oedema (8.0%) (include oedema peripheral, 
oedema, pulmonary oedema, and generalized oedema); and constipation (5.0%). The incidence of these 
events did not show clear increases in proportions with increasing duration of exposure to ZS, as shown in 
table below.

a Subjects reporting more than 1 event during Extended Dosing are counted only once in the total number of Subjects 
reporting any event. 
In extended dosing of the Study 005, 1332/1408 (94.6%) TEAEs were considered unrelated to study drug. 
In total, 76 (10.2%) subjects reported TEAEs considered related to study drug, the most commonly 
constipation (2.9%, 22 subjects), nausea (1.5%, 11 subjects), and oedema peripheral (1.2%, 9 subjects). 
Based on study 005 analysis, the applicant changed safety profiling. The SmPC Section 4.8 was updated 
accordingly to the interim analysis of Study 005. This was challenged by CHMP due to lack of justification 
for each and every case of exclusion of adverse reaction reported by the investigator is provided. The 
applicant was asked to provide (1) thorough narrative analysis of the ADRs reported by investigators and 
(2) combine the events into syndromes (do the clustered safety specification). In response to that, the 
applicant explained the stepwise approach they took for the safety specification. In this respect volemia and 
potassium changes were encountered as safety signals as well as QTs changes. The applicant examined the 
signals generated by the investigators for possible gastrointestinal events (constipation, diarrhoea, 
abdominal pain/distension and nausea), possible hypersensitivity reactions (rash, pruritus, and dermatitis), 
and possible changes in serum electrolytes content (decreased or increased calcium and decreased 
magnesium). This approach is based either on the fact that findings are not essentially different form 
placebo controlled study results or due to fact that changes are common in this population (for diarrhoea, 
magnesium and calcium changes), low potential for this side effect (for calcium changes) or due to absence 
of clear mechanistic associations (for gastrointestinal events, such as constipation).  The CHMP did not 
agree on this approach due to the incompleteness of the analysis and lack of data to exclude ADRs from the 
safety specification. Placebo controlled data are relevant to this discussion but do not override the value of 
clear observational findings of the investigators from the longer term, exposures and the class effects with 
other similar products. The deletions of observations are not justified also by clear alternative explanations 
for particular events such as increased/decreased calcium/magnesium supplementation, alternative reasons 
for GIT or hypersensitivity events. If this information had not been collected during long term study there is 
acknowledged difficulty to both either to exclude or to confirm the opinion of the investigator. Thus, the 
next study should be designed in such a way that these events would be assessed more specifically.  
Therefore, before this information is available, the CHMP preferred to take more precautionary approach 
and requested inclusion of the possible ADRs into safety specification by statement in Section 4.8:Long 
term exposure (interim data): In an ongoing clinical trial with open label exposure of Lokelma up to 1 year 
in 751 subjects several events were reported as related by investigators: possible gastrointestinal events 
(constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain/distension and nausea), possible hypersensitivity reactions (rash, 
pruritus, and dermatitis), and possible changes in serum electrolytes content (decreased or increased 
calcium and decreased magnesium).“   
In response to this position of CHMP, the applicant made an further analysis and provided additional 
justification about the uncertainty regarding possible changes in serum electrolytes content (decreased or 
increased calcium and decreased magnesium). For these changes specific patient confounding factors were 
provided, as well as in-vitro and in-vivo non-clinical data and thus, the electrolyte changes could be 
considered as not related for the time being. The alternative wording is reasonable to accept for the time 
being, until final analysis will be available. Thus, the alternative wording proposed for Section 4.8 of SmPC 
is acceptable: “In an ongoing clinical trial with open label exposure of Lokelma up to 1 year in 751 subjects, 
the following events were reported as related by investigators: gastrointestinal events (constipation, 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain/distension, nausea and vomiting); and hypersensitivity reactions (rash, pruritus, 
and dermatitis). A causal relationship between these events and Lokelma has not been finally established.”

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Among the completed phase 2/3 ZS studies, 2 deaths have been reported (0.2%; 2/1,009): 
• 
• 
in Study EUZS-003, 71-year-old male subject, treated with ZS 5 g in the Acute Phase (TID) and 
Extended Dosing (QD), died due to respiratory arrest on Study Day 4 (1 day after last ZS dose).  
in Study ZS-004, 60-year-old female subject, treated with ZS 10 g in the Acute Phase (TID) and 
Extended Dosing (QD), died due to myocardial infarction on Study Day 24 (4 days after last ZS 
dose).  
No deaths were reported during long-term extension Study ZS-004E. Three deaths, 1 due to haemorrhagic 
cystitis, 1 due to interstitial lung disease, and 1 due to a severe cardiovascular event, were reported in 
long-term ongoing study ZS-005 up through 15 July 2015, Thus, the combined overall incidence of death 
across the ZS clinical program up through 15 July 2015 is 0.3% (5/1,592 subjects). All events were 
considered unrelated to the study drug. 
Acute Phase: Studies ZS-002, EUZS-003, and ZS-004: None of the 913 subjects treated with ZS during 
acute phase dosing experienced a serious TEAE; one placebo subject experienced a serious TEAE of acute 
renal failure. 
Extended dosing: Studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004: Twenty (4.2%, including the 2 deaths) of the 479 
subjects treated with ZS during extended dosing experienced at least 1 serious treatment-emergent 
adverse event compared with 5 (1.7%) of 301 placebo subjects. During extended dosing, the overall 
incidence of serious TEAEs tended be higher among ZS-treated subjects in the 5 g and 15 g QD dose 
groups and comparable between placebo and subjects in the ZS 2.5 g and 10 g QD dose groups (1.7% in 
the placebo group, 3.0% in the ≤ 2.5 g QD group, 7.3% in the 5 g QD group, 2.6% in the 10 g QD group, 
and 5.4% in the 15 g QD group). The Applicant explained that no dose-response relationship was observed. 
None of the events by Preferred Term was reported in more than a single subject. The only serious TEAE 
considered possibly related to study drug was severe gastroenteritis in the placebo group.  
Extended dosing: long-term Study ZS-004E: Twenty four (19.5%) of 123 subjects experienced serious 
TEAEs. Most serious adverse events were reported for a single subject; 2 (1.6%) subjects each experienced 
cardiac failure congestive, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  
None of the serious TEAEs were considered related to study drug administration. 
Other significant events:  
Fluid overload and cardiac failure: Sodium (together with hydrogen) contained in the drug substance of ZS 
as a counter ion could be released from the crystal and might be absorbed as the drug exerts its effect in 
reducing levels of S-K. If sodium is absorbed, it could be associated with an increased risk of fluid overload 
in predisposed patients with severe heart failure or renal insufficiency, conditions which may be prevalent in 
patients with hyperkalemia. The applicant explained that no increase in urinary sodium has been observed 
with ZS administration, thus it is unlikely that sodium is being absorbed and thus is unrelated to the 
increased incidence of oedema-related events. During the acute phase of studies ZS-002, EUZS-003, and 
ZS-004, no subjects had a TEAE identified for inclusion in the cardiac failure broad SMQ; 4 ZS-treated 
subjects had TEAEs that were identified for inclusion in the haemodynamic oedema, effusions, and fluid

In pooled studies EUZS-003 and ZS-004, 18 ZS-treated subjects and 4 placebo subjects had a total of 24 
oedema-related events; 17/18 subjects were determined to be at risk for fluid overload-related events. A 
higher incidence was observed with the ZS 15 g QD dose (14.3%), with generally similar rates observed 
 2.5 g QD (1.0%, 2 subjects), ZS 5 g QD (0.9%, 1 subject), 
among the placebo (1.7%, 5 subjects), ZS 
and ZS 10 g QD (5.3%, 6 subjects) groups. All of the other events reported in this SMQ were considered 
≤
mild or moderate in severity.  One event of mild oedema peripheral reported in the ZS 10 g QD group (007-
023) was considered probably related to study drug.  More than half of the events (14 of 24 events) 
resolved without requiring study drug withdrawal and ~50% of the events required treatment, typically an 
adjustment in diuretic dosing. In study ZS-004E, 16 (13%) subjects had a total of 17 oedema-related 
events; 11/16 subjects were determined to be at substantial increased risk for fluid overload-related 
events. In Study ZS-004E (≤11 months of dosing), the overall rate of oedema-related events was slightly 
less than in the ZS 15 g QD group in Study ZS-004 (≤28 days of dosing), 13.0% vs. 14.3%, respectively. 
Overall, among the 33 (6.3%; 33/527) ZS-treated subjects who reported oedema-related adverse events 
during extended dosing in studies EUZS-003, ZS-004, and ZS-004E, 31 (93.9%) had events that were 
considered mild or moderate in severity, 19 (57.6%) required treatment for the event, 3 (9.0%) had an 
event that was serious, and 2 (6.1%) discontinued study drug due to the event. 
In ongoing study ZS-005, as of 7 December 2015, a total of 83 (11.1%) subjects have reported adverse 
events associated with fluid overload and cardiac failure. The applicant was asked to address the long-term 
risk of hypervolemia. In response to that the applicant reviewed cases of subjects with fluid overload events 
and agreed on dose dependence on this event and credits the occurrence of oedema to comorbidities, which 
predispose to hypokalaemia. Hypervolemia is included in the SmPC of Lokelma, section 4.8. 
Urinary tract infections: Non-clinical toxicology studies with the non-protonated form of ZS (ZS-9) showed 
an increase in urinary pH at the higher dosages, which was accompanied by urinary bladder inflammation in 
rats and minimal to mild mixed leukocyte infiltration in the kidneys of dogs that was associated with 
minimal to mild tubular regeneration and occasionally minimal tubular degeneration/necrosis and pyelitis. 
Renal findings in dogs were ameliorated by administration of potassium or the use of partially protonated 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 91/103 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
form of ZS-9. Thus, urinary tract infection was prospectively identified as an adverse event of special 
interest in the ZS clinical programme. The applicant noted that overall incidence of urinary tract infections 
is comparable to the incidence reported for this population in the literature. 
Laboratory findings 
The MAA recorded vital signs, haematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white and red blood cells), serum 
chemistry (S-K, sodium, magnesium, calcium, phosphates, BUN, bicarbonates, pH, and eGFR), urine 
chemistry and ECG parameters during both acute and extension phase studies (Studies 003 and 004, as 
well as during extension study (004E). Number of AE were to be considered as AESI (AE observed during 
non-clinical development phase (increase in serum HCO3 and urine pH, decrease in BUN, signs of bladder 
and renal degeneration/inflammation) together with AE known for other similar products 
(hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia, constipation, poor gastrointestinal tolerability and electrolytes 
disturbances for sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS). The clinical 
development program confirmed several findings, demonstrating a consistent dose-related increase in 
serum bicarbonate (approximately 10 to 15% increase from baseline with the 10 g and 15 g ZS doses; 
Study EUZS-003 and Study ZS-004) and a dose-dependent decrease in BUN (between 5 and 10% decrease 
from baseline with the 10 g ZS dose; Study EUZS-003 and Study ZS-004). There was also observed an 
increase in BUN in Study ZS-004E. The Applicant explained that in a patient population who tends to be 
acidotic and to have reduced kidney function, an increase in bicarbonate and companion decrease in BUN 
might be beneficial, although the clinical program was not designed to evaluate any improved outcome. 
This is agreed. The dose dependent QTc changes were observed during acute treatment phase (Study 003). 
In addition, number of withdrawals due to QTc changes was noticed during maintenance phase (Studies 
004/004E). Although the view of the MAA could be shared that these are related to S-K decrease events 
more predictable risk management is needed. Relevant warnings were include into SmPC. The QTc changes 
were observed during both treatment phases dose dependently during acute phase (study 003) and leading 
to withdrawals. The applicant was asked to comment and justify the appropriateness of the ADR 
assignment process used. The applicant described their step-wise approach, which was reasonable to 
accept.  Hyper- and hypokalaemia: although the applicant notes that there were no important dose-related 
trends for the proportions of the subjects who had other than efficacy related S-K post-baseline electrolytes 
values, there were clearly non-negligible proportion of patients  (~20%) with abnormal S-K values (~6% 
(7/123) of confirmed hypokalsemia and 13% (16/123) hyperkalemia experiencing patients in Study 004E. 
Although dataset is representative only of a limited safety size, these findings highlights the need for more 
predictable risk management. Relevant warnings were added to the SmPC for the prescribing physicians. 
Safety in special populations 
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for the acute phase in studies ZS-002, EUZS-003, and ZS-
004, and for extended dosing in studies EUZS-003, and ZS-004 are summarized by intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors. Data presented in this section are limited to those TEAEs reported for 
 2.0% of subjects in any 
treatment group for the pooled analyses of acute phase and extended dosing. For analysis, patients 
≥
exposed to the proposed ZS doses for labelling (ZS 10 g TID for acute phase and ZS 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g 
QD for extended dosing) and placebo in safety population were taken. 
Acute phase: The only TEAE reported by 
 2.0% of subjects in any treatment group was diarrhoea; no 
clinically important trend was apparent for the incidence of diarrhoea by any of the intrinsic (age, gender,

race, baseline weight, baseline serum potassium, CKD, heart failure, diabetes mellitus) or extrinsic 
(geographic region, use of RAAS inhibitors, use of diuretics) factors. 
Age (< 65 years and 
 65 years): For extended dosing, notable differences between age groups for the ZS 
15g QD dose included oedema peripheral (17.9% vs. 3.6%), generalized oedema (7.1% vs. 0%), and QT 
prolonged (7.1% vs. 0%), which were more commonly observed among subjects 
 65 years of age,

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The applicant calculated that during the acute phase dosing, the incidence of TEAEs that led to premature 
discontinuation of study drug was similar between ZS- (0.7%; 6/913) and placebo-treated (0.5%; 1/188) 
 3 g TID: 0.9%; 5 g TID: 
subjects. No dose-response relationship was observed for the overall incidence (
0.6%; and 10 g QD: 0.5%) or for any specific type of TEAE that led to premature discontinuation of study 
≤
drug. During the extended dosing, 11/479 (2.3%) subjects treated with ZS experienced at least 1 TEAE 
that led to premature discontinuation of study drug vs. 1/301 (0.3%) of placebo subjects. 
Post marketing experience 
They are currently no post-marketing data on Lokelma, since the medicinal product is not authorised. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety data were gathered from five studies: 006, 002, 003, 004 and 004E. In addition, preliminary 
results were submitted from the ongoing study 005. In total, 913 patients in acute phase and 527 patients 
in extended phase were exposed to ZS. As of 7 December 2015, a total of 1,980 subjects (1760 patients 
and 220 healthy volunteers) have been exposed to at least 1 dose of ZS in the clinical programme. 
Extended phase was investigated in double blind and placebo controlled studies 003 (for 12 days, 327 ZS 
vs 216 placebo patients) and study 004 (for 28 days, 152 ZS vs 85 placebo patients) and in open-label 
study 004E (for up to 11 months) and intermediate results of study 005.  
The applicant recorded TEAE and ADRs therapy during acute and extension phase studies 003 and 004, 
extension study (004E) and intermediate data from ongoing study 005. The applicant claims that overall, 
TEAE incidences were not essentially different in ZS vs placebo groups in comparative studies during acute 
phase studies with exception of highest dose in extension phase studies. The higher proportions of TEAE in 
highest ZS group (15 g QD) in extension studies are likely to be associated with general disorders (mainly 
generalised and peripheral oedema). The overall ADR incidences were also comparable in ZS vs placebo 
groups in comparative studies (Studies 003 and 004) during acute phase studies (~ 2 to 3% vs ~3% in ZS 
vs placebo arms, respectively). There is no clear dose-related trends observed among the treatment groups 
for any specific type of event reported. The proportions of ADRs during long-term non-comparative data 
from study 004E and preliminary result from study 005 show rather similar qualitative findings with in 
~11% of patients, represented mainly by oedema (~2%), muscle spasms (~2%), QT prolongation (~2%), 
and hypomagnesemia (~2%). Intermediate results from study 005 do not show new findings for the 
current intermediate evaluation. Furthermore, the applicant recorded deaths and serious TEAE during the 
acute and the extension phase studies (studies 003 and 004, as well as during long-term studies (004E and 
005). Eight deaths are reported (1 in study 003, 1 in study 004 and 6 in study 005); none of them related 
to study drug by principal investigator. No of SAEs were reported for acute phases and higher proportions 
were reported for extended phases (4.2% vs 1.7%) but without clear tendencies in either ZS or placebo 
groups as well as no clear dose response can be observed. Rather high proportion (~20%) of subjects 
experienced SAEs in the long-term extension study (study 004E), some of them leading to withdrawals but 
without clear time dependence. Immunologic effects were not specifically tested.  
The applicant recorded discontinuation events during both, the acute, and the extension phase studies 
(studies 003, 004, 004E) and concluded that during the acute phase dosing, the incidence of TEAEs that led 
to premature discontinuation of study drug was similar between ZS (0.7%; 6/913) and placebo-treated 
(0.5%; 1/188) subjects. No dose-response relationship was observed for the overall incidence or for any 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 96/103 
  
  
  
specific type of TEAE that led to a premature discontinuation of study drug. Higher incidence in these 2 
dose groups was possibly attributable to study ZS-004, where subjects randomised to the ZS 5 g and 15 g 
QD doses had a greater disease burden at baseline than subjects in the placebo and ZS 10 g QD dose 
groups. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, as there are no safety concerns and the long-term safety is defined based on sufficient safety 
population. Several methodological issues were raised for definitive representation of safety profile but 
these have been satisfactorily resolved mainly by defining the risk profile of the Lokelma in the PI and in 
the RMP. In addition, it is considered that the results of the study 005 will be presented post-marketing as 
the post-marketing commitment in the RMP.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1 edition 4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 98/103 
  
  
  
 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will use the EBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, 
was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Favourable effects 
The main beneficial effect of Lokelma is the hyperkalaemia dose-related decreasing effect for the acute 
treatment of hyperkalemia that is achieved in mild to moderate hyperkalaemia:  
• 
in more than two thirds of patients in acute phase during (84% in first 24h), when the therapy is 
started (either 2.5 or 5 or 10 g is started in TID regimen) and this response rate is higher than is 
seen in placebo group (in half of population). For patients who are still hyperkalaemic at 24 hours, 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 99/103 
  
  
  
 
 
another 48 hours of ZS 10 g TID dosing should be given. This would restore normokalaemia in most 
of the remaining patients;  
•  may be maintained for longer period of time as compared to placebo (extended dosing with ZS (5 g 
QD, 10 g QD and 15 g QD) for up to 12 months was effective in maintaining normokalemia. Across 
Extended Dosing Study Days 8 to 337, 88.3% (95% CI: 81.2%, 93.5%) of subjects had average S-
K values ≤ 5.1 mmol/L.). 
These effects have a fast onset (in one to 4 few hours) and can be reasonably expected at 48 to 72 hours 
from the start of therapy. The GI tolerability seems promising as compared to general knowledge for other 
resins. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The effects of Lokelma in more severe hyperkalaemia cases (>6.5 mmol/l) and when the urgent effect is 
needed, is not fully determined, as only a small number of such patients studied in the studies. Data on 
constant maintenance of the effect are limited for the long-term use. This is highlighted in the SmPC. The 
indication was simplified to state that Lokelma is used for treatment of hyperkalaemia, without specifying 
the acute or chronic phase. The ongoing study will resolve this uncertainty. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
During the use of Lokelma, GI ADRs were observed in 1 to 3% of subjects during the extended phase. They 
included mainly the constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and nausea. 
Hyperkalaemia (inefficiency, especially during long-term use) and hypokalaemia were also observed, 
suggesting a possible under- or over-dose. Of the 913 subjects treated with Lokelma during the acute 
phase, 4 (0.4%) developed a serum potassium below 3.5 mmol/L. Three of the subjects received 10 g TID 
and one 3 g TID. No other subject had a serum potassium below the lower limit of normal (< 3.5 mmol/L) 
during the Acute Phase dosing. 
Events related to the QTc interval (electrocardiogram QT prolonged and long QT syndrome) were the most 
common cause of the premature discontinuation of study drug in both, acute and extended dosing in ZS-
treated subjects. Electrocardiogram QT prolonged led to premature discontinuation of study drug in 4 ZS-
treated subjects in study ZS-004. 
Common events of muscle spasms and of oedema were also observed. Pooled analyses of extended dosing 
from studies ZS-003 and ZS-004 showed a higher incidence of oedema-related events that was observed 
with the 15 g QD dose (14.3%). Numerically smaller rates were observed in patients receiving placebo 
(1.7%, 5 subjects), 2.5 g QD (1.0%, 2 subjects), 5 g QD (1.8%, 2 subjects) and 10 g QD (5.3%, 6 
subjects). In the acute phase, the incidence of oedema was lower at 0.4% (4 subjects). Over half of these 
cases resolved without treatment, the remaining resolved after change in medication, e.g. increase in 
diuretics dose. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Limited data have been provided on the long-term safety profile from an ongoing study 005. The ongoing 
study will resolve this uncertainty. Interpretation of QTc changes is challenged, but the monitoring of the 
EMA/93250/2018 
Page 100/103 
  
  
  
safety is required as mentioned in the SmPC and this includes monitoring of hypokalaemia.  The possibility 
of a local (non-systemic) uptake of small particles under long term treatment has not been established; 
however, based on the results of the available nonclinical and clinical studies, no clinical consequences are 
apparent.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The observed hyperkalaemia reducing effect of ZS is important for management of the condition in clinical 
practice. Untreated hyperkalaemia is deleterious to patient health and if not controlled, poses the risk of 
further worsening and development of life threatening complications. Current list of unfavourable effects is 
rather limited but indicates that the product is moderately risky and the adverse reactions can be 
adequately managed. The post-marketing study will provide further details. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The acute effect in hyperkalaemia treatment is important as currently available therapies are not approved 
for such a broad spectrum of indications. Considering the favourable effect of Lokelma in lowering the 
serum potassium level and the reported unfavourable effects, the CHMP considered the benefit/risk balance 
positive and the risk minimisation measures adequate for the product’s use. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lokelma is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Lokelma is favourable in the following indication: 
Lokelma is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients (see section 4.4 and 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

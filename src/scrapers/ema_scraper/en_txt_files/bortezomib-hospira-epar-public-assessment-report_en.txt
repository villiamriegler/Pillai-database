2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation concerns a generic application of a Centrally Authorised Medicinal 
Product according to article 10(1) for Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection. The reference 
product is Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection which has been authorised in the EU since 26th  April 
2004 through centralised procedure by Janssen-Cilag International NV.  
Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid derivative, is a highly selective and reversible inhibitor of the 
chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome subunit in mammalian cells. Inhibition of the proteasome 
results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At 10 µM concentrations, bortezomib does not inhibit any of a wide 
variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500 fold more selective for the proteasome than 
for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib 
was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t½ of 20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome 
inhibition by bortezomib is reversible. 
Bortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but not limited 
to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB) 
activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. NF kB is a transcription factor 
whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, including cell growth and survival, 
angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, bortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells 
to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment. 
The reference product Velcade is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer products 
in treatment of multiple myeloma for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell 
lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The currently approved indication 
for Velcade is as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421198/2016 
Page 6/23 
 
  
  
 
Velcade as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy 
and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated for the 
induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose 
chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection can be used for either subcutaneous or intravenous 
administration, but reconstitution is different. This corresponds to the mode of administration of the reference 
medicinal product (VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection, Janssen-Cilag International NV, Belgium). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for solution for injection containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib (as 
mannitol boronic ester) as active substance.  
The other ingredient is mannitol.  
The product is available in type 1 glass 10 ml vial with a rubber stopper and an aluminium seal as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of bortezomib is [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-3-phenyl-2-(pyrazine-2 carbonylamino) 
propanoyl]amino]butyl] boronic acid, and has the following structure and properties:

Formula: C19H25BN4O4.H2O           Molecular weight: 402.24 g/mol 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of bortezomib. 
The chemical structure of bortezomib was confirmed by elemental analysis (C, H, N), mass 
spectrometry, 1H and 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, identification by HPLC (retention 
time), single crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, slightly hygroscopic, practically insoluble in 
water. 
Bortezomib contains two chiral centres and diastereomer/enantiomeric content is controlled routinely by HPLC. 
The active substance shows polymorphism and it has been confirmed by XRD that the polymorphic form 
produced by the proposed manufacturer is a novel for . Bortezomib is fully dissolved and lyophilised with 
mannitol during finished product manufacturing process, therefore polymorphic form is not considered to be 
important for finished product performance.  
Manufacture 
Bortezomib is produced by one manufacturer in seven convergent steps from three well defined starting 
materials with suitable specifications. One chiral centre originates in one of the starting materials whilst the 
other is introduced selectively during the process. Stereoisomeric impurities are controlled both by testing the 
relevant starting material and intermediate, and in the active substance specification. Polymorphic form is 
adequately controlled by the final crystallisation step. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is packaged in a transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag purged with nitrogen 
and tied with strip seal. This bag is placed in another transparent LDPE bag which contains a silica gel bag and 
is strip sealed. This double transparent LDPE bag is further placed in a triple laminated Sunlight Barrier (TLSB) 
bag  and  heat  sealed.  Subsequently,  this  triple  laminated  bag  is  placed  into  high  density  polyethylene  drum 
(HDPE). The LDPE bags comply with the EC regulation 10/2011 and amendments for plastic materials and the 
Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.3. Polyolefins.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (IR, HPLC), appearance of 
solution, water content (KF oven), chiral purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.) , heavy metals (Ph. Eur., USP), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for the active substance and impurities has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on nine production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on four commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers packaged 
in the container closure system intended for the market and stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (-20°C±5°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (5±3°C), according to the ICH 
guidelines, were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, appearance of solution, identification (IR), water content 
(coulometer or TGA), diastereomer/enantiomer content (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and 
bacterial endotoxins. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under long term or accelerated 
conditions.  
Forced degradation studies including acid and base hydrolysis, oxidation, thermal degradation and photolysis 
were also performed, indicating that bortezomib was unstable under all conditions tested. The results from this 
study demonstrated that the proposed methods for assay, enantiomer and related substances are stability 
indicating and suitable for their intended use, and that the active substance should be stored protected from 
light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored in the proposed container closure 
system.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product Bortezomib Hospira is a sterile, lyophilized powder for solution for injection which contains 
3.5 mg of the active substance bortezomib (as a mannitol boronic ester) per vial intended for dilution with 0.9% 
sodium chloride prior to administration.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a finished product equivalent to Velcade. The 
formulation of Bortezomib Hospira was based on the reference medicinal product. 
The only excipient present in the finished product is mannitol (bulking agent). All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421198/2016 
Page 9/23 
 
  
  
paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. Since the excipients selected are the same used for the reference medicinal 
product, no excipient compatibility studies were performed. 
Although different forms of bortezomib are used for the manufacture of the reference medicinal product 
(trimeric anhydride form) and generic medicinal product (monohydrate form), since the active substance is 
dissolved during compounding, both forms dissociate and exist as the same species: bortezomib free acid. This 
is followed by a conversion to a boronic ester (a ‘di-ester’) with mannitol during lyophilization. Therefore, the 
form present in both finished products is the same, which has been supported by comparative batch analysis 
data, supplemented by NMR identification analysis. No differences were identified irrespective of concentration 
or storage conditions, and the ratio of bound to unbound bortezomib was the same in Velcade and Bortezomib 
Hospira’s samples. 
During formulation development a risk assessment of the formulation variables against finished product critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) was conducted. Acceptable ranges for the high and medium risk formulation variables 
were established and included in the control strategy.  
The CQAs of the finished product have been adequately investigated by development studies and are controlled 
by tests and specifications. 
During  pharmaceutical  development,  analysis  of  reference  medicinal  product  batches  determined  the 
concentration of bortezomib and mannitol to be used the bulk solution prior to lyophilisation. This information 
was also used when assessing the thermal properties of both the active substance and finished product bulk 
solution to determine the lyophilisation conditions.  
The  stability  of  the  bulk  formulation  was  assessed  at  different  storage  conditions.  The  data  obtained 
demonstrated  that  the  bulk  solution  can  be  stored  at  the  proposed  storage  conditions.  A  series  of  risk 
assessments were conducted to better understand the manufacturing process and to develop a control strategy 
to reduce the risk of a failed batch. The risks of critical process variables was reduced to an acceptable level and 
controlled in the finished product by specified parameters. 
The  applicant  performed  a  study  of  the  photostability  of  the  active  substance  to  determine  if  any  special 
precautions  are  required  during  product  manufacture  or  storage.  The  results  demonstrated  that  bortezomib 
active substance is stable under ambient lighting conditions for up to 24 hours. 
Since Bortezomib Hospira is to be reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration (1.0 mg/mL 
for  intravenous  use  and  2.5  mg/mL  for  subcutaneous  use),  a  compatibility  study  with  the  proposed 
reconstitution  solution  and  the  container  closure  system  was  also  performed.  Samples  of  Velcade  and 
Bortezomib Hospira diluted to 1.0  and 2.5 mg/mL with 0.9% sodium chloride, stored under  25°C ± 2°C or 5°C 
± 3°C for up to 24 hours were tested for description, pH, assay, related substances, particulate matter and 
reconstitution. The results demonstrated that the finished product reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride at 
both concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL and stored in the original vial or syringe stored under those 
conditions is stable for 8 hours. 
The primary packaging is type I glass 10 ml vial with a rubber stopper and an aluminium seal containing 3.5 mg 
bortezomib. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data. Container closure integrity studies and a study on potential 
extractables and leachables have been also performed. The integrity of the chlorobutyl elastomeric closure 
relative to the container clear glass vial has been ensured.  The results confirm that the proposed primary 
packaging is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: compounding, filtration, filling, lyophilization, sealing and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. A detailed description of the 
manufacturing process of the finished product including the manufacture of the bulk solution, subsequent steps 
of the sterile filtration and respective in-process controls has been provided.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for a sterile parenteral preparation and 
include: description, identification (HPLC, UV), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water 
content (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time (visual), 
particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The finished product is 
released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release 
testing. 
The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. Nevertheless, the CHMP recommends the revision of the 
limits for the parameter total impurities in the release and shelf-life finished product specification once additional 
long term stability data from commercial scale active substance and finished product batches becomes 
available. 
The absence of a test for chiral impurity has been adequately justified based on batch analysis data on the active 
substance and corresponding finished product stored for six months under accelerated storage conditions 
(40°C/75%RH) demonstrating no increase in chiral impurities. The absence for a test for clarity and colour of 
solution has also been justified based on available stability data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 12 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.   
The batches of Bortezomib Hospira are representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description of plug, description of reconstituted solution, pH, clarity of solution, color of 
solution, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time (visual), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. 
Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The vials were stored in 
upright and inverted positions. 
All results of the stability study comply with the proposed shelf-life specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421198/2016 
Page 11/23 
 
  
  
Stress studies on the finished product were performed by storing samples from three commercial scale batches 
in inverted position in a freezer (-15°C to -25°C) for 1 month. Results showed that the freeze-thaw conditions 
had no impact on the finished product since all attributes (appearance, pH, assay and related substances) 
remaining unchanged. 
Forced degradation studies on one lab batch exposed to acid, base, heat, oxidation (H2O2) and light were also 
conducted. The data demonstrates that the product is only susceptible to degradation under harsh oxidative 
conditions. 
In addition one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. No detrimental effect on the appearance, reconstitution time or pH. No significant 
difference between the samples protected from light by either aluminum foil or cardboard carton was observed. 
However, the data showed significant degradation of the finished product after exposure for 10 days to 
accelerated lighting conditions, especially with an increase of impurities C and D. Therefore, a protection from 
light for long term storage has been proposed.  
As indicated under pharmaceutical development, since Bortezomib Hospira is required to be reconstituted with 
0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration (1.0 mg/mL for intravenous use and 2.5 mg/mL for subcutaneous 
use), a study to demonstrate the stability of the product upon reconstitution and storage for up to 8 hours, was 
conducted. Samples were tested for description, pH, assay, related substances and particulate matter. The 
results demonstrated that similarly to the reference medicinal product, the reconstituted product as described 
above, is stable for 8 hours in the original vial or syringe at room temperature (25°C ± 2°C) or under 
refrigeration (5°C ± 3°C).  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. The reconstituted solution should be used immediately after 
preparation. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of 
the user. However, as indicated above, the chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution 
has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 5°C and 25°C stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage 
time for the reconstituted medicinal product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The different forms of bortezomib are used for the manufacture of the reference medicinal product (trimeric 
anhydride form) and the generic medicinal product (monohydrate form), and their lack of impact on the final 
finished product have been adequately addressed. It has been confirmed that the form present in both finished 
products is the same. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To revise the limits for the parameter total impurities in the release and shelf-life finished product specification 
once additional long term stability data from commercial scale active substance and finished product batches 
becomes available. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Bortezomib Hospira manufactured by Hospira UK Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all bortezomib containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
The impurity profile of applicant´s bortezomib is comparable to that of VELCADE. Thus, additional toxicology 
studies to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable.

2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of non-clinical studies based on the literature 
review and the claim that Bortezomib Hospira is a generic of the reference product VELCADE. The literature data 
presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-clinical aspects of 
Bortezomib Hospira in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of bortezomib based on published literature. The relevant SmPC sections of Bosterzomib 
Hospira are in line with the SmPC of the reference product VELCADE. 
Exemption  
The marketing authorisation application (MAA) for Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
is based upon „essential similarity‟ to the original product (VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection) in 
accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.  
The active drug substance (bortezomib), pharmaceutical form (powder for solution for injection), the strength 
(3.5 mg) and the route of administration (the lyophilised powder enables intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration after reconstitution) are the same for both products. The concentration (after reconstitution) is 
the same as those for VELCADE, and so are the indications applied for. In addition, the excipients are the same 
in very similar amounts.  
Regarding the waiver of bioequivalence studies it is important to highlight that Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg 
powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. This corresponds to 
the mode of administration of the reference product (VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection). 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1/Corr**), 
“bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous 
intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product.  In the case of 
other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and when the test product is of the same type of 
solution (aqueous or oily), contains the same concentration of the same active substance and the same 
excipients in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, bioequivalence studies are not 
required” as well. 
Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection has the same active substance in the same 
concentration (after reconstitution) and the same excipients in similar amounts as the reference medicinal 
product. Furthermore Bortezomib Hospira 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection has the same indications, 
pharmaceutical form, route of administration (the lyophilised powder enables intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration after reconstitution), and the same strength as VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for 
injection. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1/Corr**), the 
waiving of bioequivalence studies is therefore deemed acceptable.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The product under review is essentially similar to the originator product VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for 
injection and, as outlined in Section 2.3 (Exemption), bioequivalence studies are not required. Therefore, the 
generic and originator products can be regarded as therapeutic equivalents and it is fully justified to transfer the 
information on clinical efficacy and safety from the reference product VELCADE to the bortezomib formulation 
under review. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Bortezomib Hospira and justifications that the active 
substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product 
was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional 
clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of bortezomib, 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection. The 
reference product Velcade is indicated for: 
Velcade as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy 
and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated for the 
induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose 
chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
A bioequivalence study was not submitted and this was considered acceptable. Bortezomib Hospira contains the 
same active ingredient and excipients in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the 
same route of administration (parenteral) as for the reference product. The results of tests carried out indicate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421198/2016 
Page 20/23 
 
  
  
 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics for Bortezomib Hospira, hence, the 
quality of this product is considered to be acceptable. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
Therefore, the benefit risk balance for Bortezomib Hospira is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Bortezomib Hospira is not similar to Revlimid (lenalidomide), 
Thalomide Celgene (thalidomide), Imnovid (pomalidomide), Farydak (panobinostat), Kyprolis (carfilzomib), 
Darzalex (daratumumab), Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Torisel (temsirolimus), within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Bortezomib Hospira in the following indications: 
- Bortezomib Hospira as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or 
dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have 
received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. 
- Bortezomib Hospira in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- Bortezomib Hospira in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated 
for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for 
high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- Bortezomib Hospira in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation  subject to the following

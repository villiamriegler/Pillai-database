PART II: Safety Specification 
PART II: Module SI - Epidemiology of Indication(s) and Target 
Population(s) 
Deep Partial- and Full-Thickness Thermal Burns 
Incidence/Prevalence: 
Severe burn injuries requiring medical attention affected nearly 11 million people globally in 
2004, representing the fourth leading cause of major injury worldwide (Stylianou et al, 2015; 
World Health Organization, 2018). Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal 
childhood injuries (World Health Organization, 2018). 
Exact data showing the incidence/prevalence of burn injuries in the EU/EEA are not 
available. The annual incidence of severe burn injuries was estimated to lie between 0.2 and 
2.9 per 10,000 European inhabitants based on the systemic review of studies published 
between 1985 and 2009 and focused on severe burn injuries requiring hospitalisation in 
Europe (Brusselaers et al, 2010). Children are reported to account for almost half of all burns 
and scalds in European hospitals (Brusselaers et al, 2010). 
Scandinavian data show the incidence of burn injuries requiring medical attention at 0.4% per 
year (Akerlund et al, 2007). The rate of hospital admissions for burn injuries was 
15.5/100,000/year in 2007 in Norway (Onarheim et al, 2009). 
Demographics of the Population in the Authorised Indication – Age, Gender, Racial 
and/or Ethnic Origin and Risk Factors for the Condition: 
Patients admitted to hospital for burn injury showed a double-peaked age distribution with the 
first maximum at age group of 0 to 4 years and the other lower maximum in early adulthood 
(20 to 25 years; up to 35 years of age in certain regions) (den Hertog et al, 2000; Chien et al, 
2003; Akerlund et al, 2007). 
The most common age for a child to suffer a burn injury is 1 year, with ten times as many 
burns and scalds as any school year age group (Battle et al, 2016). 
The median age of the children was 2 years in the retrospective study conducted in the United 
Kingdom (UK) and including data from a 7-year period. As in previous research, more male 
children presented to the emergency department with scalds and burn injuries than female 
(Battle et al, 2016). 
Elderly people were found at increased risk for burn injury in studies from the United States 
(US) and the Netherlands (den Hertog et al, 2000; Bessey et al, 2006) but not from Sweden 
(Akerlund et al, 2007). 
Burn injuries in the EU are more prevalent in men than women. The analysis of 24,538 burn 
cases requiring hospitalisation in Sweden between 1987 and 2004 showed a male:female ratio 
of 2.23:1 (i.e., 69% of men and 31% of women) and men predominated in all age groups 
analysed (Akerlund et al, 2007). This finding is supported by the data from other studies 
conducted in Europe (Portugal, Norway, England/Wales) (da Silva et al, 2003; Onarheim et 
al, 2009; Stylianou et al, 2015) or worldwide, including Israel (Haik et al, 2007), China or 
Taiwan—approximately 67% of hospitalised burn patients in Taiwan represented men (Chien 
et al, 2003).  
The slight predominance of women in burn injuries is reported from the low- and middle-
income countries (World Health Organization, 2018). People living in low- and 
Page 11 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
middle-income countries are at higher risk for burns than people living in high-income 
countries. Within all countries, however, burn risk correlates with socioeconomic status 
(World Health Organization, 2018). 
  Risk Factors 
Worldwide data show that people living in low- and middle-income countries are at increased 
risk of burn injuries than those living in high-income countries. Risk of burn injuries further 
directly correlates with the socioeconomic status (World Health Organization, 2018). 
There are other general risk factors for burn injuries, including (World Health Organization, 
2018): 
  occupations that increase exposure to fire 
  poverty, overcrowding, and lack of proper safety measures 
  placement of young girls in household roles such as cooking and care of small children 
  cooking pots on the floor, number of cooking pots and abundant use of cooking oils and 
boiling water that are prone to spill over or people can step into them 
  underlying medical conditions, including epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, and physical 
and cognitive disabilities 
  alcohol abuse and smoking 
  easy access to chemicals used for assault (such as in acid violence attacks) 
  use of kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel source for non-electric domestic appliances 
 
inadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas and electricity. 
Social deprivation and child maltreatment has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for 
childhood accidents, including burn injuries, and deaths (Battle et al, 2016; World Health 
Organization, 2018). However, a retrospective study from the UK showed that child 
maltreatment was suspected in only 1% of cases from this region (Battle et al, 2016). 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  
Surgical excision with tangential knives and/or hydro surgery represents the standard of care 
for burn eschar removal in the EU (Hirche et al, 2020). 
Enzymatic debridement with NexoBrid represent an additional tool in the armamentarium and 
a useful alternative to operative eschar removal.  
Enzymatic debridement shows its strength in mid-to-deep dermal burns with mixed patterns 
to preserve as much viable dermis as possible for improved functional outcome. Its 
application in full-thickness (FT) burns can be regarded as a useful indication, to reduce the 
time to complete eschar removal (Hirche et al, 2020). 
The updated European consensus guidelines on eschar removal by NexoBrid identified areas, 
where debridement with NexoBrid can bring advantages over standard of care surgical 
methods, including eschar removal of facial, perineal or genital burns (Hirche et al, 2020). 
The use of NexoBrid on hand burns (including palm) and sole burns might be indicated in 
selected patients. 
Other techniques available for eschar removal include enzymatic debridement with 
streptokinase, streptodornase or bacterial-derived proteases (Heitzmann et al, 2020), autolytic 
methods using hydrocolloids and hydrogels, or biologic methods, based on the use of the 
larvae Lucilia sericata.

Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity:  
Non-fatal burn injuries represent a worldwide leading cause of morbidity, including 
prolonged hospitalisations, disfigurement and permanent disability (World Health 
Organization, 2018). Burn victims are often burdened by rejection or stigmatisation (World 
Health Organization, 2018). 
Children have been shown more prone to accidents, including thermal injury, than adults and 
in many countries constitute the majority of burn victim population (Vloemans et al, 2014). 
Boys under 5 years of age living in low- and middle-income countries of the WHO Eastern 
Mediterranean Region are almost 2 times as likely to die from burns as boys living in the 
WHO European Region (World Health Organization, 2018). 
Burns in children exhibit the same pathophysiological responses as adults but with 
modifications due to several factors. These factors include smaller size, thinner skin, greater 
heat loss, and differences in blood volume (Sheridan et al, 2000), as well as altered emotional 
and psychological responses to injury, including burns. The overall mortality rate among 
patients (adult and paediatric) with burns is approximately 3% to 5% (Meshulam-Derazon et 
al, 2006; Akerlund et al, 2007; Haik et al, 2007; Sanchez et al, 2007). The mortality rate 
among hospitalised patients (adult and paediatric) with severe burn injuries in the EU was 
reported to lie between 1.4% and 18% (maximum 34%) (Brusselaers et al, 2010). 
Increased mortality and/or morbidity has been associated with advancing age, larger TBSA 
(the mortality increases considerably above a TBSA of 20%), diabetes, severe 
immunodeficiency as well as other underlying conditions such as renal or liver disease, or 
pulmonary circulatory disorders (Ryan et al, 1998; Aldemir et al, 2005; Church et al, 2006; 
Haik et al, 2007; Thombs et al, 2007; Brusselaers et al, 2010). The presence of smoke 
inhalation may increase mortality risk 9-fold (Meshulam-Derazon et al, 2006). 
Important Co-Morbidities: 
There is no specific co-morbidity associated with burn injury but pre-existing co-morbidities 
may significantly impact the outcomes of burn injuries, especially in the elderly (Costa Santos 
et al, 2017). 
The most common co-morbidities reported in burn patients in Europe and the US include the 
following (Thombs et al, 2007; Costa Santos et al, 2017): 
  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
  Cardiac disease 
  Hypertension 
  Diabetes 
  Mental disease 
  Neurologic disease 
  Alcohol abuse and smoking 
  Obesity 
  Renal and liver diseases

PART II: Module SII - Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Key Safety Findings from Non-Clinical Studies and Relevance to Human Usage:  
Toxicity 
Single and Repeat-Dose Toxicity 
In a single dose study in minipigs, the effect of delivering the NexoBrid solution (under its 
development code name Debrase1) as a 2-hour infusion (24, 48 or 96 mg/kg) was investigated 
in one animal per sex and dose. The 96 mg/kg dose was associated with death or early 
sacrifice due to haemorrhaging, whereas the lower doses were well tolerated with slight 
transient elevations in coagulation parameters. 
The systemic toxicity of repeat dosing was assessed in a minipig study where 15 minutes 
slow-bolus intravenous doses of up to 12 mg/kg were administered 3 times a week for 
2 weeks. This treatment was well tolerated for the first four injections but clinical signs 
including convulsions, decreased activity, ataxia, salivation, laboured breathing, and 
defecation were first observed beginning on Day 10 in all NexoBrid dose groups and was 
present throughout the remaining period of treatment. Histopathological changes consisted 
primarily of haemorrhage in several tissues.  
Similar findings were also observed in a repeat-dose study conducted in juvenile farm pigs, 
where the animals received doses up to 12 mg/kg, administered 3 times a week for 2 weeks by 
slow-bolus intravenous injection. Following the fifth intravenous dose on Day 10, 
convulsions, reddening of the skin, activity decreased, breathing difficult, and ataxia were 
noted in all NexoBrid dose groups and persisted throughout the remaining period of 
treatment. The possibility of an allergic/anaphylactoid type reaction in the treated animals was 
raised, and the second set of animals was pre-treated with antihistamines to see if the 
symptoms could be averted. Pre-treatment with antihistamines, though slightly decreasing the 
incidence of convulsions in the lower dose groups did not ameliorate the adverse clinical 
findings. Treatment-related histological changes included haemorrhage in multiple tissues, 
pancreatic acinar cell degeneration and single cell necrosis, as well as lymphoid depletion in 
the thymic cortex. Prolongation in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and 
prothrombin time was observed at all dose levels in both sexes relative to controls. The 
haemorrhagic events may be correlated to the changes in the coagulation parameters observed 
(prolongation of prothrombin time and aPTT and decrease in fibrinogen). 
  Relevance to Human Use: The preclinical single and repeat-dose toxicity studies have 
shown a potential of NexoBrid to interfere with the clotting system after intravenous 
administration. The observation that haemorrhage was observed already at 4 mg/kg in this 
repeat dose study whereas higher doses were found to be tolerable after single dosing 
(12 mg/kg with slow bolus and possibly 48 mg/kg with slow infusion) suggests that the 
effect on the clotting system is cumulative when dosing occurs every other to every third 
day. Based on these findings, the increased tendency to bleeding represents an important 
potential risk of NexoBrid and is further discussed in PART II: Module SVII. However, 
there has been no indication of an increased tendency to bleeding due to coagulation 
abnormalities or at the site of debridement during the clinical development of NexoBrid. 
1 Beside the development code name Debrase, NexoBrid was also referred to as Debrase/NexoBrid Gel Dressing or DGD in 
the clinical trials conducted by MediWound. Only NexoBrid is used throughout the document.

Developmental Toxicity 
NexoBrid 
The pivotal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits showed no signs of 
embryo-foetal toxicity of NexoBrid in the absence of clear maternal toxicity.  
It was observed that rabbits were particularly sensitive to systemically administered 
NexoBrid, resulting in maternal no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 0.01 mg/kg. 
However, even the rat study revealed maternal toxicity in the absence of embryo-foetal 
toxicity with the maternal NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day. Thus, the highest doses investigated in 
both the rat and rabbit developmental study were considerably lower than those maximally 
reported in the clinical setting. 
  Relevance to Human Use: The sensitivity of rats/rabbits to systemically administered 
NexoBrid did not allow to investigate the true potential of NexoBrid to interfere with 
embryo-foetal development in humans.  
Genotoxicity 
No mutagenic activity of NexoBrid was observed in the Ames Salmonella assay with or 
without pre-incubation or in the presence or absence of an S9 metabolic activation system. No 
treatment related increase in chromosomal aberrations were observed when investigated in 
Chinese hamster V79 cells in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system. 
Increased frequency of micronuclei in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) was 
observed in in vitro micronuclei assay in oral high dose (2,000 mg/kg) administered mice 
females, statistically significant compared to controls. The micronuclei incidence in control 
females showed a clearly lower mean micronuclei frequency than the recent historical 
controls (3.2 micronucleated PCEs/2,000 PCEs) as well as the control males within the 
NexoBrid study who normally have the same frequency of micronucleated PCEs as the 
female animals. The isolated statistically significant finding is not considered to have any 
biological relevance. 
  Relevance to Human Use: Based on the findings from a standard battery for genotoxicity 
testing, NexoBrid does not show a relevant genotoxic potential.  
Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data  
Interactions 
The in-vitro testing of NexoBrid (mainly consisting of stem bromelain) in human liver 
microsomes showed complete or near complete loss of activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 at all concentrations tested. In human 
hepatocytes, NexoBrid showed little or no evidence of time-dependent and/or 
concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 or CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 
or CYP3A4/5. 
In the second set of experiments using human hepatocytes, there was little to no clear 
evidence of time-dependent and/or concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 by NexoBrid. CYP2C8 and CYP2D9 
time-dependent inhibition with IC50 of 30 μg/mL and 129 μg/mL, respectively, was shown in 
human hepatocytes with and without correlation to the cell viability.  
  Relevance to Human Use: NexoBrid in vitro metabolism inhibition experiments using 
human hepatocytes showed both a direct and a time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8/2C9 
of unknown clinical relevance.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Local Tolerance 
NexoBrid 
Severe irritation and pain were noted following the application of NexoBrid to abraded skin 
of minipigs in the local tolerance studies. The product was applied dermally to the minipigs at 
10%, 20% or 30% concentration (to intact and abraded skin). The concentration 20% and 
30% caused significant behavioural responses interpreted as pain. Irritation and erythema 
were evident at all test concentrations and abrasion and scabbing of intact skin was seen at the 
application site. Microscopic examination indicated bacterial colonies, oedema, 
hyperkeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, subacute inflammation with rare cases of ulceration. 
The changes were reversible.  
The findings from local tolerability studies suggest that there is a potential for reversible local 
reactions when NexoBrid is applied on intact skin and that contact with abraded skin could be 
irritating and painful. 
  Relevance to Human Use: The study in minipigs have shown that NexoBrid has an irritant 
potential when applied to intact or abraded skin. Severe irritation represents an important 
potential risk of NexoBrid, while pain is an important identified risk associated with the 
therapy (refer to PART II: Module SVII).

PART II: Module SIII - Clinical Trial Exposure 
SIII.1 
Adult Population 
The initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) in the EU for NexoBrid in the adult 
population was supported by the data from 3 prospective well-controlled studies 
MW2002-04-01, MW2004-11-02 and MW2005-10-05, and additional data from studies 
MW2001-10-03 and MW2008-09-03, including overall 208 study subjects exposed to 
NexoBrid. Additionally, data from the retrospective data collection 35-98-910 were part of 
the initial MAA, including 154 study subjects. 
The updated pooled safety analysis set in the adult population comprises all patients (adult 
and paediatric) who received study treatment with NexoBrid, standard of care (SOC), or 
placebo (i.e., gel vehicle) in any of the six phase II and III studies (i.e., MW2010-03-02 
[DETECT], MW2004-11-02, MW2002-04-01, MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, and 
MW2001-10-03) (Figure 1). Studies MW2010-03-02 (DETECT), MW2001-10-03, 
MW2002-04-01, and MW2005-10-05 include adult subjects only, while studies 
MW2004-11-02 and MW2008-09-03 include both adult and paediatric subjects. 
The primary focus of the updated pooled safety analysis set in adult population is the phase III 
cohort (Cohort 2), which contains pooled data from the two pivotal phase III studies, 
MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) and MW2004-11-02. Cohort 1 is comprised of all six (phase II 
and III) studies (Figure 1).

The subject exposure to study treatment in the pooled safety analysis set per study cohorts is 
provided in Table 1 and Table 2. These tables include data pertinent to adult population as 
well as paediatric subjects treated in studies MW2008-09-03 (N = 3) and MW2004-11-02 
(N = 17).

SIII.2 
Paediatric Population 
The Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for NexoBrid originally included 3 clinical studies: 
 
follow-up non-interventional study MW2012-01-02 of paediatric patients treated with 
NexoBrid in a phase III study MW2004-11-02 (therefore, no paediatric patient has been 
treated in study MW2012-01-02) 
  pivotal phase III study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) 
  phase III study MW2014-01-01, which was later removed from the PIP and the long-term 
follow-up of at least 2.5 years after wound closure was incorporated in 
study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS). 
Additionally, the retrospective data collection 35-98-910 and phase II study MW2008-09-03 
supporting the initial MAA in adult population included overall 80 paediatric patients. 
Therefore, the clinical development programme for NexoBrid in the paediatric population 
includes data on 166 paediatric patients from 5 clinical studies (MW2012-01-01 [CIDS], 
MW2004-11-02, 35-98-910, MW2008-09-03, and MW2012-01-02 [long-term follow-up 
data]). 
The primary evidence on safety of NexoBrid in paediatric population is based on the data 
from the well-controlled pivotal phase III study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS), with the supporting 
evidence from the pooled paediatric population, across all clinical studies of NexoBrid 
conducted in paediatric subjects (Studies MW2012-01-01 [CIDS], MW2008-09-03, and 
MW2004-11-02), pooled adult population (including data from adult subjects in Studies 
MW2001-10-03, MW2002-04-01, MW2008-09-03, MW2004-11-02, MW2005-10-05, and 
MW2010-03-02 [DETECT]), and overall pooled population (adult and paediatric). 
The subject exposure to study treatment in paediatric population from the pivotal 
study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) is provided in Table 3 and Table 4, while the subject exposure 
to study treatment in pooled paediatric population is provided in Table 5 and Table 6. 
The subject exposure in adult pooled population is provided in Table 7 and Table 8, while the 
overall pooled population (adult and paediatric) is provided in Table 9 and Table 10. 
Full information on the clinical development programme for NexoBrid is provided in the

PART II: Module SIV - Populations not Studied in Clinical Trials 
SIV.1 
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme 
The following significant exclusion criteria are based on the criteria from the phase III studies 
MW2010-03-02 (DETECT), MW2004-11-02, and MW2012-01-01 (CIDS). 
Treatment of facial, perineal, or genital burns 
  Reason for exclusion: 
This criterion was implemented in the clinical development programme, based on the irritant 
potential of NexoBrid showed in the non-clinical studies and the delicate nature of skin in the 
facial, perineal, or genital areas. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? 
No 
  Rationale:  
The safety profile of NexoBrid is not expected to differ in patients with facial, perineal, or 
genital burns as shown by published cases of successful use (Schulz et al, 2017; Hirche et al, 
2020) and such use in clinical practice is at the discretion of treating physician. However, 
NexoBrid must be used with caution in such patients. 
The European consensus guidelines on enzymatic debridement highly recommend enzymatic 
debridement with NexoBrid for facial burns (Hirche et al, 2020). Due to its unique anatomy in 
line with high demands on preservation of dermis due to the functional and aesthetic benefits, 
enzymatic debridement shows its strengths of selective eschar removal in the face. However, 
application of NexoBrid requires significant experience with enzymatic debridement and as 
such, this region should not be chosen by those only beginning their enzymatic debridement 
treatment experience (Hirche et al, 2020). 
The European consensus guidelines on enzymatic debridement recommend enzymatic 
debridement for perineal and genital burns (Hirche et al, 2020) since enzymatic debridement 
in these areas may allow earlier and more selective debridement, promoting spontaneous 
healing and potentially leading to improved outcomes (Schulz et al, 2018). 
Pregnant or lactating women 
  Reason for exclusion: 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from the clinical development according to 
standard ethical reasons.  
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? 
Yes 
  Rationale:  
Not applicable. 
Page 35 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Selected cardiopulmonary disease  
  Reason for exclusion: 
This exclusion criterion was established in phase III studies to minimise potential 
confounding factors for evaluation of study findings and to minimise potential risks to this 
patient sub-population. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? 
No  
  Rationale:  
‘Increased mortality in patients with cardiopulmonary disease’ represented an important 
potential risk of NexoBrid in the initial EU RMP, based on 5 deaths encountered in the initial 
clinical development programme in the NexoBrid treatment group (as opposite to a single 
death that occurred in the SOC treatment group).  
All 5 subjects treated with NexoBrid who died had significant pre-existing co-morbidities, 
including COPD, bronchopneumonia, infection, or smoke inhalation that developed into 
septicaemia, in addition to severe burns. These co-morbidities provided more plausible 
explanation for the cause of death than NexoBrid therapy as burn patients with a history of 
pulmonary circulation disorders or pulmonary disease are at increased risk of death as showed 
in a large US study, analysing the data from patients with acute burn injury (Thombs et al, 
2007). 
Neither the non-clinical and clinical development programme for NexoBrid nor the 
post-marketing experience to date suggest any role of NexoBrid in worsening of 
cardiopulmonary disease in burn patients and as such, this safety concern was removed from 
the safety profile of NexoBrid during EU RMP update. 
The safety profile of NexoBrid is not expected to differ in this patient sub-population to 
general safety profile seen in the NexoBrid development programme. 
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus  
  Reason for exclusion: 
These exclusion criteria were established in phase III studies to minimise potential 
confounding factors for evaluation of study findings and to minimise potential risks to these 
patient sub-populations. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? 
No 
  Rationale:  
Diabetes mellitus is an important factor adversely affecting wound healing in general, 
including burn wounds. The safety profile of NexoBrid is not expected to differ in this patient 
sub-population to general safety profile seen in the NexoBrid development programme. 
However, caution must be exercised when treating burn wounds on diabetic foot, especially 
with diabetic foot wounds (Berner et al, 2018). The use of NexoBrid on diabetic foot burns is 
not recommended.

Important Identified Risk 1: Pain 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
Enzymatic debridement is a painful procedure as pain accompanies both the product 
application and actual debris removal (Hirche et al, 2017; Hirche et al, 2020).  
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
This risk is based on the findings from the non-clinical as well as clinical part of the 
development programme for NexoBrid, where local pain was identified as an accompanying 
symptom of enzymatic debridement.  
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set – Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs)’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical 
studies after the start of treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 
3 months post wound closure of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of 
Study MW2005-10-05, which was 1 month post wound closure. 
Data from the 12- and 24-month follow-up in Study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) are 
presented separately. 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
Acute Phase (Up to 3 Months Post Wound Closure) 
The incidence rates of pain-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)2 in 
NexoBrid treatment group by study cohort are summarised in Table 13. 
2 Preferred terms (PTs) for pain-related events were grouped by clinical inspection of the data and included (if 
reported as local target wound-related events): pain, procedural pain, application site pain, post traumatic pain, 
local target wound-related pain in extremity, and wound complication (referring to wound pain).

One patient (1/20; 5.0%) with pain in Table 13 was a paediatric patient treated in Cohort 1 
studies (MW2004-11-02 and MW2008-09-03; refer to PART II: Module SIII) (N = 20). 
Routine preventive analgesia and general pain management has only been implemented at 
the time of later clinical studies MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, MW2004-11-02, and 
MW2010-03-02 (DETECT), which resulted in higher incidence rate of pain reported from 
the early clinical studies (MW2001-10-03 and MW2002-04-01), where analgesia was

There was a similar frequency of ‘any pain TEAEs’ in the NexoBrid (4.5%) and SOC 
(4.0%) treatment groups of Cohort 2 and there were 2 patients (8.3%) with pain-related 
events in the placebo group (Table 15).  
In Cohort 1, there was a higher frequency of ‘any pain TEAE’2 in the NexoBrid and 
placebo group (9.0% and 8.8%, respectively) compared with the SOC group (4.1%) 
(Table 15), which is expected since Cohort 1 also includes studies from

By MedDRA PT, the frequencies of pain, target wound-related pain in extremity, wound 
complication (verbatim term of target wound-related uncontrolled pain), and 
post-traumatic pain were similar in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups in Cohort 2. 
In Cohort 1, the frequencies of pain in extremity, procedural pain, wound complication, 
and post-traumatic pain were similar across treatment groups (Table 15). 
One patient (0.3%) in the Cohort 1 in NexoBrid treatment group had serious event of paint 
in extremity. No serious pain-related events were reported in the Cohort 2 in NexoBrid 
treatment group.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
The majority of reported events in NexoBrid treatment group were mild to moderate in 
severity. Three patients (1.7%) in Cohort 2 and 11 patients (3.7%) in Cohort 1 had a severe 
TEAE of pain. None of severe events were related to NexoBrid. 
All patients in Cohort 2 experienced pain (by MedDRA PT) during treatment or during the 
first week after treatment. Pain in extremity and wound complication (verbatim term of 
target wound-related uncontrolled pain) were experienced by 1 patient each (both in the 
NexoBrid treatment group of Cohort 2) during week 2 to week 4 after treatment. In 
Cohort 1, one patient in the NexoBrid group experienced pain more than 8 weeks after 
treatment. 
The data from study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) showed that the use of general 
anaesthesia was much higher for patients treated with the SOC, related to surgical eschar 
removal, than for patients treated with NexoBrid after first application (42 patients 
[87.50%] patients treated with the SOC compared with 4 patients [5.19%] treated with 
NexoBrid, respectively). 
12 Months and 24 Months Post Wound Closure (Study MW2010-03-02 [DETECT] 
Follow-Up Data) 
Only a single patient (1.3%) in the NexoBrid treatment group reported an event of pain 
during the time period from 3 to 12 months post wound closure, assessed as non-serious 
and unrelated to NexoBrid. 
No patient had a pain event in the time period from 12 to 24 months post wound closure. 
Clinical Trials (Paediatric Population; SIII.2) 
TEAEs were defined as adverse events that occurred after the start of treatment and up to 
3 months post wound closure (i.e., acute phase). Additionally, the follow-up data for 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) are shown for the period from 12 weeks to 12 months post 
would closure. 
Data are presented in this sub-section for the Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) and pooled

None of these events were assessed as serious. All events were mild or moderate in 
severity. Only 2 events were considered as related to NexoBrid. 
The incidence of ‘any pain TEAE’ was 4.3% in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups 
of this study (Table 16). 
No statistically significant differences in the Face-Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) Scale 
scores for patients above 4 years of age (Hicks et al, 2001) were observed in either age 
group at screening between the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups. 
The FPS-R Scale scores in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups on Day 1 until Day 7 
post eschar removal were not statistically different in either age group with the exception 
of FPS-R Scale scores on Day 5 and Day 6 post eschar removal among patients above 
4 years of age (p-value <0.05). 
Overall, no patients treated with NexoBrid in either age group experienced a shift from a 
normal baseline level to a clinically significant abnormal pain assessment post treatment.

There was no significant difference in the incidence of ‘any pain TEAE’ between the adult 
pooled population post-implementation of corrective procedures and the paediatric 
population in study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) (3.9% and 4.3%, respectively; Table 17 and 
Table 16).  
Although the incidence of ‘any pain TEAE’ in the NexoBrid group in the pooled paediatric 
population was higher in comparison to the incidence seen in NexoBrid group in the adult 
pooled population (7.9% versus 3.9%) (Table 17), the incidence was similar between the 
NexoBrid and the SOC groups in the paediatric population (7.9% and 9.3%, respectively) 
(Table 17). 
There were no noteworthy trends in distribution of pain TEAEs across the age groups in 
the paediatric pooled population. The number of paediatric patients with pain TEAE was 
low across all age groups in either treatment arm. 
No patient in the paediatric pooled population and one patient in the adult pooled 
population had event assessed as serious. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Pain, especially in its severe form, may significantly reduce the quality of patient’s life 
during the burn trauma treatment.  
Patients reported significant pain during and after enzymatic debridement. Therefore, 
adequate analgesia is essential (Hirche et al, 2020). Underestimation of enzymatic 
debridement invasiveness may lead to inappropriate anaesthesia and even for the need for 
rescue analgesia (Galeiras et al, 2018). 
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post-marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information relevant to 
this risk and these data are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the 
development programme. 
Page 46 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 20214, 39 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
of pain were reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in valid individual case 
safety reports. This represents a reporting rate of 0.44%, considering the total 
post-marketing patient exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2).  
Of the patients analysed in the retrospective, non-interventional post-authorisation safety 
study (PASS) MW2013-06-01 (NexoPASS) completed in 2019 (N = 164), only 1 patient 
(0.6%) reported pain5 during the NexoBrid treatment (described as patient’s repeated 
complaints, followed by prescription of pain medication). Study results showed high 
compliance rates with the required pain management before NexoBrid administration 
(93.9%) and before NexoBrid removal from the target wound (79.2%). 
According to worst-case analysis6, 29 patients (17.7%) suffered from pain during 
NexoBrid application (in 28 patients [17.1%] assessed as related to NexoBrid).  
Two events of pain in 2 patients (1.2%) were assessed as related to NexoBrid (but not 
meeting the study definition of pain) were serious and both resolved.  
The majority of events reported within the first 72 hours described post NexoBrid 
treatment-related pain and not the procedural pain during debridement with NexoBrid. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
No risk groups or specific risk factors have been identified for the events of pain associated 
with NexoBrid enzymatic debridement. 
Preventability: 
Enzymatic debridement, including removal of NexoBrid after debridement, is a painful 
procedure and requires adequate analgesia and/or anaesthesia. Pain management must be used 
as commonly practiced for an extensive dressing change. It should be initiated at least 
15 minutes prior to NexoBrid application. 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place, designed to further mitigate the risk of pain in burn patients treated with NexoBrid. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Pain associated with debridement of eschars has a significant impact on burn patients and 
wound healing process and as such, pain associated with NexoBrid therapy represents an 
important identified risk. The highly effective risk minimisation measures in place markedly 
decreased the occurrence of debridement-related pain to minimum, making the overall impact 
of this risk on the product acceptable in the light of the anticipated benefits to burn patients. 
4 The date represents the data lock point for the Addendum to Clinical Overview submitted for the second 
renewal of the marketing authorisation for NexoBrid, providing the most up-to-date post-marketing data for 
NexoBrid.  
5 Pain was defined as ‘at least 2 pain events during the debridement procedure, from start of treatment until end 
of soaking period, 2 hours post-NexoBrid removal with subsequent pain medication.’ 
6 Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of the study results, i.e., best-case analyses with 
subjects treated in compliance with the educational materials and worst-case analyses, based on an incidence rate 
for which each ‘possible’ adverse event of interest is regarded as a definite adverse event of interest. 
Page 47 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Public Health Impact: 
NexoBrid 
It is anticipated that ≥1 in 100 to 1 in 10 patients treated with NexoBrid in the 
post-marketing setting will experience local pain. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk occurring in association with 
NexoBrid therapy is considered low.  
SVII.3.1.2 
Important Identified Risk 2: Pyrexia/Hyperthermia 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
Not yet fully established specifically for NexoBrid.  
Pyrexia is a well-known phenomenon in burn patients as virtually all burn patients have 
elevated core body temperature (Mavrogordato et al, 2009; Bayuo, 2017). The burn patient is 
catabolic (Williams et al, 2009; Williams and Herndon, 2017) with a very high basal 
metabolic rate, often accompanied with elevated body temperature. However, the exact 
mechanism has not been fully understood (Mavrogordato et al, 2009). 
Mild hyperthermia within the first 24 hours post injury is almost always the result of pyrogen 
release. After 72 hours, burn patients develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 
characterised by tachycardia, relative hypotension, and hyperthermia (Jeschke et al, 2007; 
Bayuo, 2017). 
The inflammatory reactions involved in the wound-healing process, as well as wound 
contamination, may contribute to this phenomenon in burn patients. In addition, occlusive 
dressings that do not allow heat dissipation may be a source of pyrexia (D'Avignon and 
Murray; Hirche et al, 2017). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
Pyrexia/hyperthermia were the most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with the 
use of NexoBrid in clinical trials.  
The frequency of the pyrexia/hyperthermia decreased when NexoBrid was used in a regimen, 
introducing antibacterial soaking of the treatment area before and after NexoBrid application 
and administration of preventive analgesia. 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set - Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All TEAEs’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical studies after the start of 
treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 3 months post wound closure 
of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of Study MW2005-10-05, which 
was 1 month post wound closure. 
Data from the 12- and 24-month follow-up in Study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) are 
presented separately.

Four patients (4/20; 20.0%) with pyrexia and 3 patients (15.0%) with hyperthermia in 
Table 18 were paediatric patients treated in Cohort 1 studies (MW2004-11-02 and 
MW2008-09-03; refer to PART II: Module SIII) (N = 20). 
Routine preventive measures introducing soaking with antimicrobial solution to be 
performed for a minimum period of 2 hours before and after NexoBrid application as a 
measure to reduce the occurrence of wound infections and pyrexia has only been 
implemented at the time of later clinical studies MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, 
MW2004-11-02, and MW2010-03-02 (DETECT), which resulted in higher incidence rate 
of pyrexia/hyperthermia-related events reported from the early clinical studies 
(MW2001-10-03 and MW2002-04-01). 
The incidence of pyrexia/hyperthermia-related events by pre- and post-implementation of 
preventive measures in NexoBrid treatment group is presented in Table 19.  
In the NexoBrid and placebo groups, the frequencies of overall fever events by combined 
preferred terms were more than twice as high pre-implementation compared to 
post-implementation of preventive measures, with pyrexia the primary contributor to the 
higher rate. Post-implementation, the frequency of pyrexia was still slightly higher in the 
NexoBrid (12.1%), compared to SOC (8.1%) and placebo (6.1%) treatment groups (ISS, 
Table 14.3.4.1.1.4). 
7 PTs for pyrexia/hyperthermia-related events were grouped by clinical inspection of the data and included 
pyrexia, hyperthermia, and body temperature increased.

pyrexia/hyperthermia-related events in the placebo group (Table 20).  
In Cohort 1, the frequencies of patients with ‘any pyrexia/hyperthermia TEAE’7 in the 
NexoBrid and placebo groups (20.3% and 19.1%, respectively) were approximately double 
the frequency in the SOC group (10.8%), with MedDRA PT pyrexia being the primary 
contributor to the higher rate (Table 20).

By MedDRA PT, the frequencies of pyrexia, hyperthermia, and increased body 
temperature were similar in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups in Cohort 2 
(Table 20). 
No events in NexoBrid treatment group of either Cohort were assessed as serious. 
The majority of reported events in NexoBrid treatment group were mild to moderate in 
severity. One patient (0.3%) in Cohort 1 had a severe TEAE of pyrexia, assessed as not 
related to NexoBrid.  
Of the patients with pyrexia/hyperthermia-related event (all treatment groups) in Cohort 2, 
approximately half experienced pyrexia during the treatment session in all 3 treatment 
groups. All patients in NexoBrid treatment group and almost all patients in all treatment 
groups experienced pyrexia/hyperthermia-related events during treatment or during the 
first week after treatment. Three patients in Cohort 2 experienced pyrexia during the 2 to 
4 weeks after treatment (2 patients in NexoBrid and 1 patient in SOC treatment groups). 
Time to onset of pyrexia/hyperthermia-related TEAEs in Cohort 1 shows a similar pattern 
to Cohort 2.

NexoBrid 
There was no significant difference in the incidence of ‘any pyrexia/hyperthermia TEAE’ 
between the adult pooled population post-implementation of corrective procedures and 
paediatric population in study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) (13.3% and 11.6%, respectively; 
Table 22 and Table 21). Two patients in the paediatric pooled population had severe event 
of pyrexia, of which one was further assessed as serious. No serious event was reported in 
the adult pooled population. 
The incidence of ‘any pyrexia/hyperthermia TEAE’ in the paediatric pooled population 
was higher in the NexoBrid group in comparison to the SOC group (16.9% versus 9.3%) 
and also in comparison to the adult pooled population post-implementation of corrective 
procedures (16.9% versus 13.3%) (Table 22). Since children with burn injury are in 
general more prone to fever than adults (Kim et al, 1998; Gore et al, 2003; Sarginson et al, 
2021), the difference in the incidence rates between paediatric and adult pooled 
populations is not unexpected. 
There were no noteworthy trends in distribution of pyrexia/hyperthermia TEAEs across the 
age groups in paediatric population. The number of paediatric patients with 
pyrexia/hyperthermia TEAEs was moderate across all age groups in either treatment arm.  
Impact on Quality of Life 
Pyrexia/hyperthermia, especially in their severe forms, may significantly reduce the quality 
of patient’s life during the burn trauma treatment. Hyperthermia in burn patients has been 
shown to further heighten the hypermetabolic state (Gore et al, 2003; Bayuo, 2017).  
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information and these data 
are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the development programme. 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 20219, 2 ADRs of pyrexia/hyperthermia 
were reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in valid individual case safety 
reports. This represents a reporting rate of 0.02%, considering the total post-marketing 
patient exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2).  
Of the patients analysed in the retrospective, non-interventional PASS MW2013-06-01 
(NexoPASS) completed in 2019 (N = 164), pyrexia10 within 48 hours from start of 
NexoBrid treatment was reported in 6  patients (3.7%). Same incidence rate was observed 
for the onset of pyrexia within 72 hours post treatment. The compliance rate of 52.7% was 
shown for required antibacterial soaking applied before NexoBrid and 57.8% for 
antibacterial soaking applied after NexoBrid. 
9 The date represents the data lock point for the Addendum to Clinical Overview submitted for the second 
renewal of the marketing authorisation for NexoBrid, providing the most up-to-date post-marketing data for 
NexoBrid.  
10 Pyrexia was defined as ‘temperature > 38.5°C within 48 hours from start of NexoBrid treatment requiring 
fever relief medications prescribed due to high temperature within 1 hour from complaint, consecutive 
measurements of high temperature (> 38.5°C), 4 to 6 hours apart.’

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
According to worst-case analysis11, pyrexia within 48 hours from start of NexoBrid 
treatment was observed in 23 patients (14.0%), of which in 10 patients (6.1%) was 
assessed as related to NexoBrid. 
None of the pyrexia-associated events was assessed as serious.  
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
There are several different risk factors for the development of pyrexia/hyperthermia in burn 
patients, such as wound infection or contaminated wound (Mavrogordato et al, 2009)., and 
other infections, including pneumonia or urinary tract infection (D'Avignon and Murray).  
Children with burn injury are in general more susceptible to fever (Kim et al, 1998; Gore et al, 
2003; Sarginson et al, 2021). 
Preventability: 
The wound must be cleaned thoroughly. Dressing soaked with antibacterial solution must be 
applied for 2 hours prior to administration of NexoBrid and after its removal from the target 
wound. 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place, designed to further mitigate the risk of pyrexia/hyperthermia in burn patients treated 
with NexoBrid. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Considering the significant impact of pyrexia/hyperthermia on burn patients, this risk 
represents an important identified risk of NexoBrid. In general, this risk can be anticipated 
and managed in the clinical setting. The highly effective risk minimisation measures are in 
place, making the overall impact of this risk on the product acceptable in the light of the 
anticipated benefits to burn patients. 
Public Health Impact: 
It is anticipated that more than 1 in 10 patients treated with NexoBrid in the post-marketing 
setting will experience pyrexia/hyperthermia. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk occurring in association with 
NexoBrid therapy is considered low. 
SVII.3.1.3 
Infections)  
Important Identified Risk 3: Wound Complications (Including Wound 
Potential Mechanism(s): 
Wound healing is a complex process in which the burn patient’s immune system plays an 
important role (Markiewicz-Gospodarek et al, 2022). Various wound complication have been 
described in burn patients, including impaired healing, delayed time to complete wound 
closure (TTCWC), or wound infections (Church et al, 2006). 
11 Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of the study results, i.e., best-case analyses with 
subjects treated in compliance with the educational materials and worst-case analyses, based on an incidence rate 
for which each ‘possible’ adverse event of interest is regarded as a definite adverse event of interest.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
The burn wound is susceptible to opportunistic colonisation by organisms of endogenous and 
exogenous origin (Church et al, 2006). Severe burn patients have a high risk for developing 
burn wound sepsis (Norbury et al, 2016). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: 
Various wound complications, including a delay in TTCWC (in certain cases linked to a 
selected wound-care strategy) and wound infections, were reported in early clinical 
development programme for NexoBrid. The implementation of preventive measures later in 
the programme led to a decrease in the incidence of general wound infections. However, 
wound complications (including wound infections) remain an important risk associated with 
NexoBrid treatment. 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set - Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All TEAEs’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical studies after the start of 
treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 3 months post wound closure 
of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of Study MW2005-10-05, which 
was 1 month post wound closure. 
Data from the 12- and 24-month follow-up in Study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) are 
presented separately.

following terms (if reported as local target wound-related events): wound infection, infection, wound infection 
bacterial, staphylococcal infection, burn infection, proteus infection, bacterial infection, staphylococcal skin 
infection, wound infection staphylococcal, localised infection, candida infection, fungal infection, fungal skin 
infection, and wound infection fungal.  
For wound-related complications, various terms associated with the wound, scar, or graft were included in the 
search strategy, if reported as local target wound-related events. Full search strategy for the risk of wound

One patient (1/20; 5.0%) with skin graft failure in Table 23 was a paediatric patient treated 
in Cohort 1 studies (MW2004-11-02 and MW2008-09-03; refer to PART II: Module SIII) 
(N = 20). 
Routine preventive measures introducing soaking with antimicrobial solution to be 
performed for a minimum period of 2 hours before and after NexoBrid application as a 
measure to reduce the occurrence of wound infections and pyrexia has only been 
implemented at the time of later clinical studies MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, 
MW2004-11-02, and MW2010-03-02 (DETECT). Therefore, the incidence of wound 
infection-related events by pre- and post-implementation of preventive measures is 
presented in Table 24.  
In the NexoBrid treatment group, the frequencies of patients with overall wound infection 
events by grouped PTs were slightly higher pre-implementation compared to 
post-implementation of preventive measures (7.8% versus 5.4% for infections excluding 
fungal) (Table 24). 
Post-implementation of preventive measures, the frequencies of patients with infection 
were similar in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups (5.4% and 8.1%, respectively, for 
infections excluding fungal and 1.3% and 0, respectively, for fungal infections) (ISS, 
Table 14.3.4.1.1.4).

Two patients (1.1%) in the NexoBrid treatment group of Cohort 2 (and also Cohort 1) had 
event of wound infection bacterial assessed as serious. No other serious events were 
reported. 
In Cohort 2, 4 patients had wound infection during treatment (1 patients in the NexoBrid 
and 3 patients in the SOC treatment groups), 6 patients had wound infection during week 2 
up to week 8 (2 in the NexoBrid and 4 in the SOC treatment groups). All other patients 
were missing an onset evaluation. In Cohort 1, there was a similar pattern in time to onset 
of wound infections compared with in Cohort 2. 
Time to Wound Closure 
TTCWC was slightly longer in the NexoBrid group than in the SOC group of Cohort 2, 
when estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method (median of 30.0 days versus 25.0 days) or 
calculated using actual data (mean of 31.7 days versus 29.8 days, median of 25.0 days 
versus 24.0 days). According to the non-inferiority analysis, TTCWC was less than 7 days 
longer with NexoBrid than with SOC (p for non-inferiority=0.0006). 
In Cohort 1, TTCWC was slightly longer in the NexoBrid group than in the SOC group, 
when estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method (median of 31.0 days versus 27.0 days) or 
calculated using actual data (mean of 32.5 days versus 30.4 days, median of 28.0 days 
versus 24.0 days). According to the non-inferiority analysis, TTCWC was less than 7 days 
longer with NexoBrid than with SOC (p for non-inferiority=0.0005). 
Altogether, the results of the analysis of TTCWC along with the finding that maintenance 
of complete wound closure was generally similar across the treatment groups demonstrate 
that NexoBrid does not have a deleterious effect on wound closure. 
It is important to note that the time to wound closure is affected by the decision of the 
treating physician who is responsible for making the decision of autografting DPT wounds 
immediately after debridement (which could result in faster wound closure in patients 
treated with NexoBrid due to the earlier debridement) or allowing spontaneous 
epithelisation (which would not require autografting or donor sites sacrifice, but would 
likely result in longer TTCWC with less pain and donor site scarring).

staphylococcal skin infection (target wound-related event) during the time period from 
3 to 12 months post wound closure, assessed as non-serious and unrelated to NexoBrid. 
No patient had a wound complication/wound infection event in the time period from 
12 to 24 months post wound closure. 
Clinical Trials (Paediatric Population; SIII.2) 
TEAEs were defined as adverse events that occurred after the start of treatment and up to 
3 months post wound closure (i.e., acute phase). Additionally, the follow-up data for 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) are shown for the period from 12 weeks to 12 months post

The incidence rate of ‘any wound infection TEAE’ was 1.1% in the NexoBrid group and 
8.1% in the SOC group of the paediatric pooled population (Table 27). The incidence rates 
of wound complications were similar between the paediatric pooled population and the 
adult pooled population post-implementation of corrective procedures, while the incidence 
rates of wound infections were higher in the adult pooled population in comparison to the 
paediatric pooled population (Table 27). 
No patient in the paediatric pooled population had event assessed as serious in comparison 
to 2 patients in the adult pooled population. 
There were no noteworthy trends in distribution of wound infection TEAEs across the age 
groups in paediatric population. The number of paediatric patients with wound infection 
TEAEs was low across all age groups in either treatment arm. 
Time to Wound Closure 
In the main analysis in study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS), the TTCWC on a target wound level 
was comparable in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimated

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
median TTCWC for NexoBrid and SOC on a target wound level (clustered data of target 
wounds in a patient) was 32 days and 41 days, respectively.  
Statistical analysis established the noninferiority of NexoBrid compared with SOC when 
incorporating a 7-day advantage for the SOC treatment group. However, the difference in 
the estimated median time for NexoBrid compared with SOC also exceeded the 7-day 
advantage incorporated for SOC in the statistical analyses.  
In an additional analysis, the Kaplan-Meier estimate TTCWC on a patient level was also 
numerically shorter in the NexoBrid group (32 days) than under the SOC (41 days) 
incorporating a 7-day advantage for SOC; however, the noninferiority in the statistical 
analyses was not established. 
Time to 100% wound closure in NexoBrid and SOC treated patients was comparable 
between the MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) study and paediatric pooled or adult pooled 
populations. 
In the paediatric pooled population, the time to reach 100% wound closure was slightly 
shorter in the NexoBrid group than in the SOC group, when estimated by the 
Kaplan-Meier method: 41 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.0 to 61.0) versus 50 days 
(95% CI: 35.0 to 71.0).  
In the adult pooled population, the time to reach 100% wound closure was slightly longer 
in the NexoBrid group than in the SOC group, when estimated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method: 39 days (95% CI: 34.0 to 43.0) versus 36 days (95% CI: 33.0 to 38.0). 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Severe wound complications may prolong the time and overall success of wound healing 
in burn patients. 
Sepsis due to wound infections can be a life-threatening condition with fatal outcomes. 
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information and these data 
are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the development programme. 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 202114, 7 ADRs of wound complications 
(including wound infections)15 were reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in 
valid individual case safety reports. This represents a reporting rate of 0.08%, considering 
the total post-marketing patient exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2).  
In the retrospective, non-interventional PASS MW2013-06-01 (NexoPASS) completed in 
2019, the median TTCWC was 42.0 days at the patient level. At the wound level, the 
median TTCWC was 39.0 days and results were comparable between wounds treated with 
NexoBrid and SOC procedures. 
Of all patients analysed in this study (N = 164), wound-related complications were 
identified in 2 patients (1.2%), based on events of unknown or at least possible relatedness

renewal of the marketing authorisation for NexoBrid, providing the most up-to-date post-marketing data for

to NexoBrid. Both patients suffered from graft loss assessed by the investigator as possibly 
related to NexoBrid. 
Wound infection16 within 1 week from start of debridement was observed in 12 patients 
(7.3%). However, no wound infection was assessed as related to the NexoBrid treatment. 
According to worst-case analysis17, wound infection within 1 week from start of 
debridement was observed in 51 patients (31.1%). 
Risk Factors and risk Groups: 
Patients with burn area greater than 30% TBSA or old, contaminated burns are at increased 
risk of wound complications, same as burn patients with FT wounds and deep burns that 
cannot spontaneously epithelise and are not autografted immediately after debridement for 
TTCWC. 
Immunosuppressed patients are in general at higher risk of wound infections and sepsis 
(Church et al, 2006). 
Preventability: 
Routine preventive measures include soaking of the target wound with antimicrobial solution 
for a minimum period of 2 hours before and after NexoBrid application. 
As in the case of surgically debrided bed, in order to prevent desiccation and/or formation of 
pseudoeschar and/or infection, the debrided area should be covered immediately by temporary 
or permanent skin substitutes or dressings.  
When applying a permanent skin cover (e.g., autograft) or temporary skin substitute 
(e.g., allograft) to a freshly enzymatically debrided area, care should be taken to clean and 
refresh the debrided bed by brushing or scraping to allow dressing adherence. 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place designed to mitigate this risk in burn patients treated with NexoBrid. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Wound complications, including infections, could impact the treatment in burn patients. The 
risks can be anticipated and managed in the clinical setting. The impact of this risk on the 
benefit-risk balance of NexoBrid is acceptable in the light of the anticipated benefits to burn 
patients.  
Public Health Impact: 
It is anticipated that ≥1 in 100 to 1 in 10 patients treated with NexoBrid in the 
post-marketing setting will experience wound infection or wound complication. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk occurring in association with 
NexoBrid therapy is considered low. 
16 Wound infection was defined as ‘prescription of antibiotics during the first week following debridement with 
NexoBrid to a patient captured with positive swabs and/or positive wound biopsies performed’. 
17 Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of the study results, i.e., best-case analyses with 
subjects treated in compliance with the educational materials and worst-case analyses, based on an incidence rate 
for which each ‘possible’ adverse event of interest is regarded as a definite adverse event of interest.

Reaction) 
Important Identified Risk 4: Allergic Reactions (Including Anaphylactic 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
Bromelain is mostly implicated in IgE-mediated allergies of both the immediate type and the 
late-phase of immediate type (Gailhofer et al, 1988; Kelly, 1996). A skin contact with pure 
allergen can trigger a systemic reaction in susceptible individuals (Gailhofer et al, 1988).  
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
Allergic reactions associated with NexoBrid application, including infrequent events of 
anaphylactic reaction, were reported from the post-marketing experience with NexoBrid. 
Allergic reactions to bromelain have been reported in the literature, mostly related to cases of 
airway sensitisation resulting from occupational exposure (Baur and Fruhmann, 1979; 
Gailhofer et al, 1988; van Kampen et al, 2007) or general pineapple allergy (Knox et al, 2019; 
Kiguchi et al, 2021).  
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set - Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All TEAEs’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical studies after the start of 
treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 3 months post wound closure 
of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of Study MW2005-10-05, which 
was 1 month post wound closure.

Six patients (6/20; 30.0%) with pruritus and 2 patients (10.0%) with rash in Table 28 were 
paediatric patients treated in Cohort 1 studies (MW2004-11-02 and MW2008-09-03; refer 
to PART II: Module SIII) (N = 20). 
No TEAE of anaphylactic reaction related to NexoBrid occurred in the clinical 
development programme in either Cohort. A single patient in Cohort 2 in NexoBrid 
treatment group experienced anaphylactic shock 22 days after NexoBrid treatment, related 
to latex allergy. 
Only 2 events of pruritus were assessed as related to NexoBrid, since pruritus, known as 
post-burn pruritus, is a common complication of burn injury, which severely lowers the 
quality of life of the patient. Post-burn pruritus occurs shortly after burn during the 
rehabilitation and healing process of burn wounds with a very high prevalence (80% to 
100%) (Chung et al, 2020). 
12 Months and 24 Months Post Wound Closure (Study MW2010-03-02 [DETECT] 
Follow-Up Data) 
Four patients (5.2%) had AE of pruritus assessed as not related to NexoBrid during the 
time period from 3 to 12 months post wound closure. 
No patient had allergic reactions-related AE in the time period from 12 to 24 months post 
wound closure.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
No events of anaphylactic reaction or any serious events were reported in paediatric pooled 
population. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Severe allergic reactions can quickly develop into life-threatening conditions with 
potentially fatal outcomes, if not appropriately treated in a timely manner. However, 
serious allergic reactions were reported rarely in association with NexoBrid in the 
post-marketing setting. 
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information and these data 
are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the development programme. 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 202120, 8 ADRs of allergic reactions 
(7 serious and 1 non-serious) were reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in 
valid individual case safety reports. This represents a reporting rate of 0.09%, considering 
the total post-marketing patient exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2).  
No anaphylactic reaction or serious allergic reactions occurred in any of the patients 
analysed in the retrospective, non-interventional PASS MW2013-06-01 (NexoPASS) 
completed in 2019 (N = 164). 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Allergic reactions to bromelain may occur in individuals allergic to pineapple or other 
members of the Bromeliaceae family, or those frequently exposed to bromelain (occupational 
inhalation exposure) (Kelly, 1996; Smolle et al, 2015). 
Cross-sensitivity between bromelain and papain as well as latex proteins (known as latex-fruit 
syndrome), honeybee venom, and olive tree pollen has been reported in the literature (Brehler 
et al, 1997; Ebo et al, 2003; Basch et al, 2007; Casaer et al, 2008). 
Since there are reports of occupational exposure to bromelain leading to sensitisation, the 
healthcare professionals preparing the final product may be at risk of hypersensitivity 
reactions. 
Preventability: 
The healthcare professionals mixing the powder with gel should avoid inhalation of the 
powder. Accidental eye and skin exposure must be avoided. 
Patients with known hypersensitivity to pineapples or papain must not be treated with 
NexoBrid. 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place for this risk. 
20 The date represents the data lock point for the Addendum to Clinical Overview submitted for the second 
renewal of the marketing authorisation for NexoBrid, providing the most up-to-date post-marketing data for 
NexoBrid.  
Page 68 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
The impact is considered acceptable considering the use of NexoBrid in a hospital setting by 
experienced healthcare professionals. 
Public Health Impact: 
The anticipated frequency of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in the 
post-marketing setting cannot be estimated based on available data. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk occurring in association with 
NexoBrid therapy is considered low. 
SVII.3.1.5 
Important Potential Risk 1: Severe Irritation 
Potential Mechanism(s): 
Not yet fully established for NexoBrid. 
Proteolytic activity of bromelain on abraded skin may be the source of potential cutaneous 
irritation. Furthermore, bromelain was reported to function as a signalling molecule and 
activate protease-activated receptors. Activation of these receptors is a potential mechanism 
by which bromelain evokes itching (Reddy and Lerner, 2010).  
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: 
This risk is based on the findings from the non-clinical studies within the development 
programme for NexoBrid, where severe irritation and pain were noted, following the 
application of NexoBrid to abraded skin of minipigs in the local tolerance studies. These 
findings suggest that there is a potential for reversible local reactions when NexoBrid is 
applied on intact skin and that contact with abraded skin could be irritating and painful. 
No reports of any skin irritation following NexoBrid application were reported in the clinical 
development programme for NexoBrid.  
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set – Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All TEAEs’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical studies after the start of 
treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 3 months post wound closure 
of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of Study MW2005-10-05, which 
was 1 month post wound closure. 
Data from the 12- and 24-month follow-up in Study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) are 
presented separately. 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
Acute Phase (Up to 3 Months Post Wound Closure) 
No reports of (severe) skin irritation following administration of NexoBrid were reported 
from the clinical development programme. 
A moderate AE of rash was reported, following a second application of NexoBrid 
(Cohort 2). The aetiology of the rash is unknown and local irritation was hypothesised. 
Page 69 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
However, local hypersensitivity reaction could not have been ruled out and as such, this 
AE is reflected on in Section SVII.3.1.4. 
12 Months and 24 Months Post Wound Closure (Study MW2010-03-02 [DETECT] 
Follow-Up Data) 
No AEs of severe skin irritation were reported in the time period from 3 to 12 month as 
well as 12 to 24 months post wound closure. 
Clinical Trials (Paediatric Population; SIII.2) 
TEAEs were defined as adverse events that occurred after the start of treatment and up to 
3 months post wound closure (i.e., acute phase). Additionally, the follow-up data for 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) are shown for the period from 12 weeks to 12 months post 
would closure. 
Data are presented in this sub-section for the Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) and pooled 
populations (paediatric and adult) from the pooled studies (refer to SIII.2). 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
No reports of severe skin irritation following administration of NexoBrid were reported 
from study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) within the Acute Phase (up to 12 weeks post wound 
closure) or in the time period from 12 weeks to 12 months post wound closure. 
No reports of severe skin irritation associated with NexoBrid were reported in the 
paediatric pooled population or adult pooled population. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
It is not possible to estimate the impact on the individual patient, without further 
characterisation or this risk. 
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information and these data 
are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the development programme. 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 202121, 4 ADRs of skin irritation were 
reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in valid individual case safety reports 
(3 cases reported in off-label use of NexoBrid for treatment of basal cell carcinoma, when 
the product is kept on the target area longer than for 4 hours used for eschar debridement). 
However, the severity of these events was not reported. Taking the conservative approach, 
this represents a reporting rate of 0.05%, considering the total post-marketing patient 
exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2).  
No case of severe irritation was reported in the retrospective, non-interventional PASS 
MW2013-06-01 (NexoPASS), completed in 2019. No severe irritation was observed on

facial, perineal, or genital area in 14 patients (8.5% of 164 patients analysed) treated in 
these areas. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Patients with abraded skin represent a risk group as these patients could be at increased risk of 
experiencing severe irritation. 
Preventability: 
To prevent possible irritation of abraded skin by inadvertent contact with NexoBrid and 
possible bleeding from the wound bed, acute wound areas such as lacerations or escharotomy 
incisions should be protected by a layer of a sterile fatty ointment or fatty dressing 
(e.g., petrolatum gauze). 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place for this risk. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
The impact of this potential risk on NexoBrid is acceptable in the light of anticipated 
treatment effects in burn patients. 
Public Health Impact: 
The anticipated frequency of severe irritation in the post-marketing setting cannot be 
estimated based on available data. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk potentially occurring in association 
with NexoBrid therapy is considered low. 
SVII.3.1.6 
Important Potential Risk 2: Increased Tendency to Bleeding 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
Bromelain consists of various closely-related proteinases, demonstrating anti-inflammatory, 
antithrombotic and fibrinolytic activities in vitro and in vivo (Pavan et al, 2012; Kaur et al, 
2016). 
Systemic exposure to bromelain may result in increased tendency to bleeding since bromelain 
was shown to inhibit blood platelet aggregation. In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that 
bromelain stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in increased 
fibrinolysis by degrading fibrin (Taussig and Batkin, 1988; Lotz-Winter, 1990; Pavan et al, 
2012). Preincubation of isolated human platelets in vitro with bromelain completely prevented 
the thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Metzig et al, 1999). 
In another in-vitro study, bromelain was shown to further inhibit platelet aggregation 
stimulated by adenosine diphosphate or epinephrine as well as by prostaglandin precursors in 
a dose-dependent manner, thus preventing adhesion of platelets to endothelial cells of blood 
vessels (Morita et al, 1979). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
This risk is based on a theoretical possibility associated with topically administered NexoBrid 
and systemic effects of bromelain on blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet coagulation 
in vivo and in vitro (Pavan et al, 2012; Kaur et al, 2016).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Topical administration of NexoBrid was shown to produce a systemic exposure with highly 
variable serum levels (depending on the dose, % TBSA treated, and interindividual factors). 
During the clinical development programme for NexoBrid and post-marketing experience, no 
indication of increased tendency to bleeding was noted. 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials (Pooled Safety Analysis Set – Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Studies; SIII.1) 
‘All TEAEs’ were defined as those events that occurred in clinical studies after the start of 
treatment (NexoBrid, SOC, or placebo [gel vehicle]) and up to 3 months post wound closure 
of all treated wounds (i.e., acute phase) with the exception of Study MW2005-10-05, which 
was 1 month post wound closure. 
Data from the 12- and 24-month follow-up in Study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) are 
presented separately. 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
Acute Phase (Up to 3 Months Post Wound Closure) 
No indication of increased tendency to bleeding was noted in the clinical development 
programme. 
Overall, in Cohort 2 studies, less than a sixth of patients in each group received blood 
transfusion(s) (16.4% of NexoBrid patients versus 14.1% of SOC patients). No blood 
transfusions were given before the start of treatment.  
Blood transfusions were administered more often in the SOC group during and within 
1 week after the eschar removal period but more often in the NexoBrid group later than 
1 week after the eschar removal period.  
The literature shows that oral administration of bromelain to healthy volunteers 
(780 mg/day for 10 days) showed no significant changes in blood coagulation parameters 
(i.e., aPTT) (Eckert et al, 1999). 
Results of aPTT, which was assessed in Cohort 2 studies, showed that aPTT was 
comparable between groups at baseline (mean 30.5 s in NexoBrid and SOC versus 30.9 s 
in placebo treatment group; median 30.1 s in NexoBrid versus 30.2 s in SOC versus 29.7 s 
in placebo treatment group) and up to 24 hours after start of treatment (mean 31.7 s in 
NexoBrid versus 32.3 s in SOC versus 33.3 s in placebo treatment group; median 31.5 s in 
NexoBrid versus 31.0 s in SOC versus 31.2 s in placebo treatment group). 
Blood transfusions were administered in Cohort 2 more often in the MW2004-11-02 study 
(20/100 [20%] NexoBrid patients versus 14/81 [17.3%] SOC patients) than in DETECT 
(9/77 [11.7%] NexoBrid patients versus 7/68 [10.3%] SOC patients).  
12 Months and 24 Months Post Wound Closure (Study MW2010-03-02 [DETECT] 
Follow-Up Data) 
No indication of increased tendency to bleeding was noted in the 3 to 12 months or 
12 to 24 months post wound closure.

NexoBrid 
Clinical Trials (Paediatric Population; SIII.2) 
TEAEs were defined as adverse events that occurred after the start of treatment and up to 
3 months post wound closure (i.e., acute phase). Additionally, the follow-up data for 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) are shown for the period from 12 weeks to 12 months post 
would closure. 
Data are presented in this sub-section for the Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) and pooled 
populations (paediatric and adult) from the pooled studies (refer to SIII.2). 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS): Acute Phase (Up to 12 Weeks Post Wound Closure) 
No indication of increased tendency to bleeding due to coagulation abnormalities was 
noted in study MW2112-01-01 (CIDS). 
Seven patients (10.1%) in the NexoBrid group and 8 patients (11.4%) in the SOC group 
received blood transfusions during hospitalisation. Among these 15 patients, 5 patients 
treated with the SOC received blood transfusion during the eschar removal period, while 
none in the NexoBrid group. Three patients treated with NexoBrid and 1 treated with the 
SOC received a blood transfusion within a week after eschar removal period, and 
4 patients treated with NexoBrid and 2 patients treated with the SOC received a blood 
transfusion later than 1 week after the eschar removal period. 
Three (5.9%) patients in the NexoBrid treatment group (N = 51) had a shift from normal 
baseline international normalised ratio values to abnormal high values.  
Three (3.7%) patients in the NexoBrid treatment group (N = 41) and 3 (13.0%) patients in 
the SOC treatment group had a shift from normal baseline to abnormal low aPTT.  
One (2.4%) patient in the NexoBrid treatment group (N = 41) and 2 (8.7%) patients in the 
SOC treatment group had a shift from normal baseline to abnormal high aPTT. 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS): 12 Weeks to 12 Months Post Wound Closure 
Follow-Up Data 
No indication of increased tendency to bleeding due to coagulation abnormalities was 
noted in the 12 weeks to 12 months post wound closure. 
Pooled Populations (Paediatric and Adult) 
No indication of increased tendency to bleeding due to coagulation abnormalities was 
noted in the paediatric or adult pooled populations. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
It is not possible to estimate the impact on the individual patient without further 
characterisation of this risk. 
Post-Marketing Experience 
Evaluation of data collected from the post marketing experience (spontaneous and solicited 
sources of information) did not identify any new and significant information and these data 
are in line with the safety profile of NexoBrid from the development programme. 
Page 73 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Cumulatively since the IBD until 17 December 202122, 9 ADRs of haemorrhage were 
reported from spontaneous post-marketing sources in valid individual case safety reports. 
This represents a reporting rate of 0.10%, considering the total post-marketing patient 
exposure of 8,828 patients (refer to Section SV.1.2). None of the reported cases suggests 
increased tendency to bleeding, following administration of NexoBrid. 
No increased tendency to bleeding was noted in patients analysed in the retrospective, 
non-interventional PASS MW2013-06-01 (NexoPASS) completed in 2019 (N = 164). 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:  
Clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that systemic exposure to NexoBrid can increase with 
the dose administered (either larger TBSA treated or repeated NexoBrid applications), 
therefore potentially increasing the risk of bleeding.  
General risk factors for increased tendency to bleeding are coagulation abnormalities. 
Preventability: 
NexoBrid should not be applied to more than 15% TBSA (in paediatric patients aged 0 to 
3 years to not more than 10% TBSA). Furthermore, a repeated application of NexoBrid on the 
same wound or in the patient where NexoBrid has already been used is not recommended. 
NexoBrid should not be used in patients with uncontrolled disorders of coagulation. NexoBrid 
should be used with caution in patients under anticoagulant therapy or other drugs affecting 
coagulation, and in patients with low platelet counts and increased risk of bleeding from other 
causes e.g., peptic ulcers and sepsis.  
Patients should be monitored for possible signs of coagulation abnormalities and signs of 
bleeding. 
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of the additional risk minimisation measures in 
place for this risk. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
This potential risk may potentially have a significant impact on benefit-risk balance of 
NexoBrid. However, considering the low systemic exposure to NexoBrid when used 
according to the product information/risk minimisation measures in place, the anticipated 
benefits of the therapy outweigh this risk. 
Public Health Impact: 
The anticipated frequency of bleeding events in the post-marketing setting cannot be 
estimated based on available data. 
Considering the low overall incidence of deep burn injuries and the eligibility criteria to 
NexoBrid treatment, the public health impact of this risk potentially occurring in association 
with NexoBrid therapy is considered low. 
22 The date represents the data lock point for the Addendum to Clinical Overview submitted for the second 
renewal of the marketing authorisation for NexoBrid, providing the most up-to-date post-marketing data for 
NexoBrid.

Presentation of Missing Information 
SVII.3.2.1  Missing Information 1: Use in Pregnancy 
Evidence Source: 
Bromelain is systemically absorbed from burnt wound areas. However, no clinical data on 
pregnancies exposed to bromelain or NexoBrid are available.  
Animal studies do not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects on embryo-foetal 
development, but the relevance of these studies to human risk assessment is considered low 
due to increased sensitivity of rats and rabbits to systematically administered NexoBrid (refer 
to PART II: Module SII). 
Since the safe use of NexoBrid during pregnancy has not yet been established, the use of 
NexoBrid is not recommended. 
Anticipated Risk/Consequence of the Missing Information: 
It is not possible to anticipate the potential impact on individual patient without further 
characterisation of this issue. However, NexoBrid could negatively impact the course of 
pregnancy or unborn child.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
PART VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for NexoBrid 
(concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in 
bromelain) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for NexoBrid. The RMP details important 
risks of NexoBrid, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about NexoBrid’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
NexoBrid’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how NexoBrid should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for NexoBrid should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of NexoBrid’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
NexoBrid is authorised for removal of eschar in patients with deep partial- and full-thickness 
thermal burns (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains concentrate of proteolytic enzymes 
enriched in bromelain as the active substance and it is given by topical route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of NexoBrid’s benefits can be found in NexoBrid’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks 
Important risks of NexoBrid, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about NexoBrid’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of NexoBrid, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of NexoBrid is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of NexoBrid are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of NexoBrid. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Identified risk: Pyrexia/hyperthermia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Pyrexia/hyperthermia were the most commonly 
reported adverse reactions associated with the use of 
NexoBrid in clinical trials.  
The frequency of the pyrexia/hyperthermia decreased 
when NexoBrid was used in a regimen, introducing 
antibacterial soaking of the treatment area before and 
after NexoBrid application and administration of 
preventive analgesia. 
There are several different possible risk factors for 
pyrexia/hyperthermia in burn patients, such as 
infection or contaminated wound.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 
PL sections 2 and 4 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC recommends additional 
monitoring of burn patients for rise in body 
temperature and signs of local and systemic 
inflammatory and infectious processes.

Identified risk: Wound complications (including wound infections)  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Various wound complications, including a delay in time 
to complete wound closure (in certain cases linked to 
a selected wound-care strategy) and wound 
infections, were reported in early clinical development 
programme for NexoBrid. The implementation of 
preventive measures later in the programme led to a 
decrease in the incidence of general wound infections. 
However, wound complications (including wound 
infections) remain an important risk associated with 
NexoBrid treatment.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with burn area greater than 30% TBSA or 
old, contaminated burns are at increased risk of 
wound complications, same as burn patients with 
full-thickness wounds and deep burns that can 
spontaneously epithelise and are not autografted 
immediately after debridement for time to complete 
wound closure. 
Immunosuppressed patients are in general at higher 
risk of wound infections and sepsis. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8 
PL sections 2, 3, and 4 
Detailed description of wound management and 
instructions for preventive measures against 
development of infection are included in sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC and section 3 of the PL.

Identified risk: Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Allergic reactions associated with NexoBrid 
application, including infrequent events of 
anaphylactic reaction, were reported from the 
post-marketing experience with NexoBrid. 
Allergic reactions to bromelain have been reported in 
the literature, mostly related to cases of airway 
sensitisation resulting from occupational exposure or 
general pineapple allergy.  
Allergic reactions to bromelain may occur in 
individuals allergic to pineapple or other members of 
the Bromeliaceae family, or those frequently exposed 
to bromelain (occupational inhalation exposure). 
Cross-sensitivity between bromelain and papain as 
well as latex proteins (known as latex fruit syndrome), 
honeybee venom, and olive tree pollen has been 
reported in the literature. 
Since there are reports of occupational exposure to 
bromelain leading to sensitisation, the healthcare 
professionals preparing the final product may be at 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions.

This risk is based on the findings from the non-clinical 
studies within the development programme for 
NexoBrid, where severe irritation and pain were 
noted, following the application of NexoBrid to 
abraded skin of minipigs in the local tolerance studies. 
These findings suggest that there is a potential for 
reversible local reactions when NexoBrid is applied on 
intact skin and that contact with abraded skin could be 
irritating and painful. 
No reports of any skin irritation following NexoBrid 
application were reported in the clinical development 
programme for NexoBrid. 
Patients with abraded skin represent a risk group as 
these patients could be at increased risk of 
experiencing severe irritation.

Potential risk: Increased tendency to bleeding 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on a theoretical possibility 
associated with topical NexoBrid and systemic effects 
of bromelain on blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and 
platelet coagulation in vivo and in vitro.  
Topical administration of NexoBrid was shown to 
produce a systemic exposure with highly variable 
Page 89 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
NexoBrid 
Risk factors and risk groups 
serum levels (depending on the dose, % TBSA 
treated, and interindividual factors). 
During the clinical development programme for 
NexoBrid and post-marketing experience, no 
indication of increased tendency to bleeding was 
noted. 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that systemic 
exposure to NexoBrid can increase with the dose 
administered (either larger TBSA treated or repeated 
NexoBrid applications), therefore potentially 
increasing the risk of bleeding.  
General risk factors for increased tendency to bleeding 
are coagulation abnormalities. NexoBrid should not be 
used in patients with uncontrolled coagulation 
disorders. NexoBrid should be used with caution in 
patients under anticoagulant therapy or other drugs 
affecting coagulation, and in patients with low platelet 
counts and increased risk of bleeding from other 
causes e.g., peptic ulcers and sepsis.

Annex 6 - Details of Proposed Additional Risk Minimisation Measures 
Approved Key Messages of the Additional Risk Minimisation Measures  
Prior to launch in each Member State, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall agree 
the content and format of the educational programme with the National Competent Authority. 
The MAH should ensure that, at launch, all healthcare professionals in specialist burn centres 
who are expected to use and/or prescribe NexoBrid receive a specific training and are 
provided with an educational pack. 
The MAH should undertake a controlled distribution of NexoBrid to ensure that the product is 
not available for use at a centre until at least one surgeon at the centre has received formal 
training in the use of NexoBrid. This is in addition to the educational material which all 
potential users should receive. 
The educational pack should contain the following:  
  Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet  
  Healthcare Professional Information Pack.  
The Healthcare Professional Information Pack should be a step-by-step treatment guide 
that includes information on the following key elements:  
  Before prescribing NexoBrid 
o  The limitation of the total area than can be treated to 15% TBSA (or 10% 
TBSA in paediatric patients aged 0 to 3 years) 
o  The risk of allergic reaction and of cross reactivity and the contraindication in 
patients allergic to pineapple and papain or to previous application of the 
product  
o  The risk of increased mortality in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases 
  Before applying NexoBrid  
o  The need for pain management 
o  The need for wound cleansing and preparation before treatment with  
  Application of a dressing soaked with an antibacterial solution for two 
hours before NexoBrid application  
  Protection of surrounding skin areas 
o  The method of preparation of NexoBrid and of its application to wound area  
  After applying NexoBrid 
o  The removal of NexoBrid and of dissolved eschar 
o  The wound assessment and the warning against any repeat treatment  
o  The wound management after NexoBrid treatment with  
  Application of a dressing soaked with an antibacterial solution for two 
hours  
  Performance of grafting procedures as soon as possible after 
debridement

o  The fact that NexoBrid may cause an allergic reaction, an increased tendency 
to bleed and severe local irritation and that patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of these 
o  The fact that patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of wound 
and systemic infections

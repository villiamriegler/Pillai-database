Extension of indication (for Isentress 100 mg granules for oral suspension) to include treatment of 
HIV-1 exposed full-term neonates (under the age of 4 weeks) based on safety and PK data from one 
pivotal Phase 1 study, IMPAACT P1110 (Protocol 080), in a total of 42 HIV-1 exposed full-term infants 
(defined as ≥37 weeks gestational age and ≥2000 g), who received either 2 single doses of oral 
suspension, within 48 hours of birth and Day 7-10 of age (Cohort I), or a multiple-dose regimen of 
raltegravir over the first 6 weeks of age (Cohort II). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
The provision of the study (IMPAACT P1110) addresses the final PIP measure, i.e. Study 4, conducted 
to generate PK, safety, and tolerability data in HIV exposed neonates and infants <6 weeks of age 
born to HIV infected mothers.  
Further, the MAH proposed to update the suspension volume from 5 mL to 10 mL for a final suspension 
concentration of 10 mg/mL to facilitate accurate measurement of the smaller doses required for 
neonates. As a consequence, there was a need to replace the 5 mL syringe supplied in the current 
commercial kit with 3 new oral dosing syringes, and sizes (1 mL, 3 mL, and 10 mL), from a different 
(new) supplier. As a consequence, sections 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated and the 
labelling and instructions for use in the Package Leaflet and the Annex A have been updated 
accordingly.  
An updated RMP version 12.0 was submitted as part of the application. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Package Leaflet, Labelling and Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0155/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of 
the application, the PIP P/0155/2016 was completed. The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for 
the PIP P/0155/2016.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This Application supports the use of raltegravir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
exposed full-term neonates, and is based on the results of a single study conducted by the 
International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT), Protocol 1110 (also 
known as MSD Protocol 080; hereafter referred to as IMPAACT P1110).  
Following  completion  of  the  line  extension  application  EMEA/H/C/00680/X/44G,  granules  for  oral 
suspension were added to the already available adult and chewable paediatric tablets. The granules for 
oral suspension were (and currently still are) indicated for use in combination with other anti-retroviral 
medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1)  infection  in  children, 
toddlers and infants from the age of 4 weeks. The recommended doses for infants from 4 weeks and 
children of < 25 kg are as follows: 
Body weight 
(kg) 
3 to less than 4 
4 to less than 6 
6 to less than 8 
8 to less than 11 
11 to less than 14† 
14 to less than 20† 
20 to less than 25 
Volume (dose) of suspension 
Number of chewable tablets 
to be administered 
1 ml (20 mg) twice daily 
1.5 ml (30 mg) twice daily 
2 ml (40 mg) twice daily 
3 ml (60 mg) twice daily 
4 ml (80 mg) twice daily 
3 x 25 mg twice daily 
5 ml (100 mg) twice daily 
1 x 100 mg twice daily 
1.5 x 100 mg‡ twice daily 
*The weight-based dosing recommendation for the chewable tablet and oral suspension is based on approximately 6 mg/kg/dose twice daily (see section 5.2). 
† For weight between 11 and 20 kg either formulation can be used. 
‡ The 100 mg chewable tablet can be divided into equal 50 mg doses. However, breaking the tablets should be avoided whenever possible. 
Each  single-use  sachet  contains  100  mg  of  raltegravir  which  is  suspended  in  5  ml  of  water  giving  a 
final  concentration  of  20  mg  per  ml  and  the  recommended  volumes  are  administered  using  a  5-mL 
syringe, with or without food. 
At the time of completion of EMEA/H/C/00680/X/44G, the SmPCs for the adult (400 mg) and chewable 
paediatric  tablets  (25  mg  or  100  mg)  the  indications  and  posology  sections  were  amended  to  reflect 
extension  of  use  down  to  4  weeks  of  age  and  to  advise  prescribers  of  the  availability  of  alternative 
formulations, including the fact that the adult tablets, chewable tables and GFS are not bioequivalent. 
Data were added to sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 in each SmPC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects  
The scope of this application is to extend the approved indication for Isentress granules for oral 
suspension to include the neonatal population (under the age of 4 weeks). For ease of dosing, as part 
of this variation the MAH proposed to revise the suspension volume so that the 100 mg sachet was to 
be suspended in 10 mL (vs. the current 5 mL) for a final suspension concentration of 10 mg/mL (vs. 
the current 20 mg/mL), to facilitate accurate measurement of the smaller doses required for neonates. 
The recommended doses for the product were therefore amended to fit the neonatal population, and 
consequently new measuring/administration devices must be introduced as the currently approved 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 6/62   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
device is now inadequate for this population. To facilitate both the larger suspension volume and the 
range of dosing including dose recommendations for neonates, the Applicant will replace the 5mL 
syringe supplied in the current commercial kit with 3 new oral dosing syringes sizes (1 mL, 3 mL, and 
10 mL).  
The new syringes will be provided by a new supplier, Comar LLC. Sections 3.2.P.7 and 3.2.R have been 
amended accordingly.   
This consequential change in suspension volume from 5 mL to 10 mL, and the new oral dosing 
syringes, has been incorporated into the dosing instructions in the product information texts, and in 
the revised instructions for use to be supplied with the marketed product in a booklet format, going 
forward. 
The granules for suspension are presented in sachets and co-packaged with the device constituents 
and ancillary components into a kit, which is the commercial presentation – see Table below: 
Table 1.  Components of the Kit 
The dossier has been updated to include supporting data for the new oral dosing syringes and data are 
presented below: 
Mixing Cup 
The granules for suspension are intended to be constituted within the provided mixing cup. 10 mL of 
water that has been measured with the supplied 10 mL oral syringe described in Sec. 3.2.P.7 is added 
to the cup. The sachet contents are then added to the cup. The user is intended to then close the cup 
lid and gently swirl the mixture until a homogeneous mixture has been created. The appropriate dose 
is then drawn into the syringe for administration. The cup is constructed of polypropylene resin that 
meets regulatory and compendial requirements as shown in Sec. 3.2.P.7. In-use stability studies were 
done by transferring the contents of a sachet into a mixing cup, adding 10 mL of water, dispersing the 
powder and holding the suspension in the mixing cup for two hours under ambient room temperature 
conditions as described in Sec. 3.2.P.8.1. 
Change of Mixing Implements from Clinical Trials 
Constitution of ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral suspension performed as part of clinical trials used 
different components than will be included in the commercial kit. The clinical trial implements consisted 
of a mixing cup and a spatula. After the water diluent and contents of the foil laminate sachet were 
placed into the cup, the spatula was used to stir the mixture until a homogeneous suspension is 
formed. The mixing implement that will be included in the commercial kit is a nominal 20 mL 
polypropylene cup with an attached tight-fitting lid that is snapped into place to seal the cup. 
Suspension constitution is carried out by gently swirling the sealed cup until a visually homogeneous 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 7/62   
 
 
  
 
suspension is formed. The mixing cup lid is then opened to allow the oral syringe to be inserted for 
withdrawal of the proper dose volume. 
The combination of the new mixing implement and the new constitution method is an improvement 
from the clinical trials because one less component is handled and washed, the constitution process is 
simpler, and has a lower risk of accidental suspension spillage. 
Switching from the mixing implements is considered acceptable because: 
• 
The cups are made of similar resins that meet compendial and regulatory requirements. 
•  Compatibility of the suspension with the new cup has been established through simulated in-
use testing as part of stability studies, data from which are shown in section 3.2.P.8.1 and 
3.2.P.8.3. 
• 
Extractable assessment of the new mixing cup concluded the materials are safe for patient. 
•  An acceptable homogeneous suspension can be created using either type of implement 
• 
• 
The design of the new cup with a lid allows it to be washed and re-used multiple times, as was 
also the case with the implements employed in the clinical trials 
The mixing cup is not used for dispensing a dose or measuring. Accordingly, there are no 
graduations or measurement markings on the mixing cup. Performance testing confirmed the 
mixing cup can be used up to 60 times. 
•  Withdrawal of the constituted suspension into the dosing syringe is carried out in the same 
manner 
Oral Syringes 
Oral syringes will be supplied as part of the commercially marketed kit. The 10-mL syringe is intended 
to be used both to measure the water that is used to create the suspension and potentially deliver the 
dose. The user will draw water into the barrel to the 10mL mark printed on the syringe barrel. The 
water is expelled into the open mixing cup and the sachet contents are added to the mixing cup. The 
user will then close the cup lid and gently swirl the mixture. After the suspension has been prepared, 
the 1 ml, 3 ml or 10 mL syringe will be used to draw in the prescribed volume of suspension from the 
mixing cup. The details of the oral syringes are provided in section 3.2.P.7 and functional testing in 
3.2.P.2.2. 
Oral Syringe Extractables and Compatibility Assessment 
The instructions for use specify that constituted Raltegravir Granules for Suspension be dosed within 
30 minutes after constitution with water. The suspension comes in contact with the mixing cup during 
the mixing stage of the suspension preparation and with the oral syringe during dosing. The materials 
of construction of the mixing cup and the oral syringes meet food contact regulations (Section 
3.2.P.7). Compatibility and in-use testing have demonstrated acceptable compatibility with both the 
mixing cup and oral syringes used. 
Additionally, an extractable assessment concluded the syringes are safe for patient use demonstrating 
acceptability after 60 uses and washes. 
Following preparation in the mixing cup, the suspension comes in contact with the oral syringe during 
dosing. A 1 mL, 3 mL, or 10 mL syringe may be used for dosing. The suspension was tested for assay 
and degradation products immediately after preparation and after being drawn into and held under 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 8/62   
 
 
  
ambient room temperature conditions in each of the three syringe types for two hours. No change in 
assay or degradation products was observed over the two-hour period. 
The acceptable assay and degradation products results obtained after holding the suspension 
separately in the mixing cup and in each of the oral syringes that may be used for dosing (1 mL, 3 mL, 
10 mL) for two hours under ambient room temperature conditions demonstrates acceptable 
compatibility for the 30-minute in-use period specified in the instructions for use. 
Oral Syringe Dose Accuracy and Uniformity Assessment 
ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral suspension is supplied with dosing syringes (Section 3.2.P.2.7) with 
respective graduations of: 
• 
• 
• 
1 mL = 0.1 mL graduations starting at 0.1 mL to 1 mL 
3 mL = 0.25 mL graduations starting at 0.5 mL to 3 mL 
10 mL = 0.5 mL graduations starting at 1 mL to 10 mL 
A study was performed to demonstrate that the dosing devices comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph 
2.9.27, “Uniformity of mass of delivered doses from multidose containers” and provide acceptable dose 
volume accuracy. 
One lot of each syringe size was used in the test: 
• 
• 
• 
1 mL dosing devices 
3 mL dosing devices 
10 mL dosing devices 
A suspension was prepared using a representative batch of ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral 
suspension. Using this suspension, each of the three syringe sizes was tested at the volumes that may 
be dosed with that syringe type for the recommended dose for ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral 
suspension in neonates and paediatric population. 
Results of the study were provided and met the acceptance criteria stated in Ph. Eur. monograph 
2.9.27. The results also met the acceptance criterion established for volume accuracy that the delivery 
volume accuracy tolerance of the oral dosing syringe must be no greater than ±10% of the intended 
volume. 
The Instructions for Use (IFU) for ISENTRESS OS states that after use in dosing of the oral suspension, 
the syringe barrel and plunger are to be washed with warm water and dish soap, rinsed with water, 
and allowed to air dry. A single syringe may be used and washed up to 60 times over the course of use 
of an ISENTRESS OS Combination Product Kit. Due to this, an additional Dose Accuracy/Uniformity 
study was designed to use washed syringes. The syringes tested were manipulated and washed the 
equivalent of 60 times. The volumes evaluated for each syringe represent the lowest and highest 
volumes that may be dosed with a specific syringe type in accordance with the proposed age and 
weight based dosing table in conjunction with the IFU. Results of the washed syringe study results met 
the acceptance criteria stated in Ph. Eur. monograph 2.9.27 and met the acceptance criterion 
established for volume accuracy that the delivery volume accuracy tolerance of the oral dosing syringe 
must be no greater than ±10% of the intended volume. 
The current shelf life for ISENTRESS Oral Suspension (OS) is 24 months when stored at the specified 
conditions. Thus, a Dose Accuracy/Uniformity study was also performed using representative syringes 
over two years in age in conjunction with a representative batch of ISENTRESS OS of similar age. As 
stated previously, a single syringe may be used and washed up to 60 times over the course of use of 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 9/62   
 
 
  
an ISENTRESS OS Combination Product Kit. Due to this, the aged syringes were manipulated and 
washed the equivalent of 60 times prior to testing. The volumes evaluated for each syringe represent 
the lowest and highest volumes that may be dosed with a specific syringe type in accordance with the 
proposed age and weight based dosing table in conjunction with the IFU. Results of the washed aged 
syringe study were provided. These results met the acceptance criteria stated in Ph. Eur. monograph 
2.9.27 and remained within the specified delivery volume accuracy tolerance of the oral dosing syringe 
studied. 
The results demonstrate acceptable accuracy and uniformity of delivered doses for the oral dosing 
syringes (1 mL, 3 mL, 10 mL) to be included in the ISENTRESS OS Combination Product Kit. 
Acceptable accuracy and uniformity has been demonstrated for syringes when first received from the 
vendor, for syringes that have been subjected to manipulation and washing simulating normal use and 
for syringes over two years in age that have also been subjected to manipulation and washing. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on quality aspects 
The commercial container closure system supported by the development studies described for 
ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral suspension is a heat-sealed foil laminate sachet. 
Control strategies have been put in place to ensure the drug product is maintained within acceptable 
temperature and humidity ranges as defined by the product characterization study. These control 
strategies include drug substance and excipient moisture in-process controls, environmental and 
procedural controls in manufacturing, storage and packaging areas, well defined storage and use 
restrictions, and an appropriate container closure system. No changes in product quality are 
anticipated during long term product storage or short-term excursions from labelled storage conditions 
due to the application of the noted control strategies. 
This is supported by the data reported for the FSS batches in Sec. 3.2.P.8.3. These results clearly 
show that the container closure system is adequate for long-term storage of the drug product. No 
changes in assay, degradation products, dissolution, moisture or appearance were seen at any storage 
temperature for up to 48 months. 
The accessories included with the drug product, that is, the mixing cup and oral syringes, have been 
shown to be appropriate to perform their intended purpose when used according to instructions, 
allowing the user to properly constitute the drug product, measure the appropriate suspension volume, 
and administer the measured dose. 
Device Constituents: Oral Dosing Syringes/Dispensers 
Oral dosing syringes/dispensers from the manufacturer are considered Class I medical device with 
measuring function. These syringes have been assessed with respect to the conformity assessment 
procedure described in Article 11.5 and Annex V (Module D1) of Council Directive 93/42/EEC on 
Medical Devices, as amended, for the aspects of manufacture concerned with the conformity of the 
products with metrological requirements, as amended, and found to comply. The CE certificate and EC 
declaration of conformity (DOC) for all the three syringe sizes are provided in Section 3.2.R. 
Representative schematic drawings and photos for the oral dosing syringe from a typical supplier have 
been provided. 
The new oral syringe barrels are all composed of the same translucent polypropylene which is 
compounded with a polypropylene slip agent. The opaque plunger rods for the 1 mL, 3 mL and 10 mL 
syringes are composed of high density polyethylene; the 1 mL plunger rod has a white colorant; the 3 
mL plunger rod has a green colorant; and the 10 mL plunger rod has a blue colorant.

washed up to 60 times as well as aged syringes with product at end of shelf-life; results presented are 
satisfactory. 
The proposed new oral dosing syringes are considered appropriate for use with the proposed posology. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a nonclinical overview to justify the lack of any new data and to discuss the 
relevance of existing data to the current application for use in the first 4 weeks of life. In summary, the 
application is supported by the completed nonclinical studies, including those conducted in neonatal 
animals, to support use of the raltegravir 400 mg BID regimen.  
The rat, a species recommended in the ICH Nonclinical Testing Guidelines, was chosen as a preclinical 
toxicology species for raltegravir development and was used in juvenile and pre- and post-natal 
studies. The absorption, metabolism, and excretion profiles of raltegravir are similar in rats and 
humans. All pivotal studies with raltegravir were supported by toxicokinetic measurements either 
within the study or from separate studies conducted under the same conditions and using identical 
doses administered in the same vehicle. All pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted 
consistent with ICH Nonclinical Testing Guidelines and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) Regulations. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new nonclinical pharmacodynamics (PD) studies have been conducted to support this application. 
Findings from in-vitro studies previously conducted in support of the raltegravir 400 mg BID regimen 
also pertain to this application as they are independent of the formulation, frequency of its 
administration or developmental age of targeted clinical population. These studies included a 
comprehensive evaluation of the in-vitro antiviral and biochemical properties of raltegravir. In antiviral 
assays, raltegravir demonstrated activity in HIV-1 infected T-lymphoid cells (IC95= 31 ± 20 nM), was 
active against reverse transcriptase and protease resistant viruses and demonstrated additive to 
synergistic activity in combination with other anti-retroviral agents. Raltegravir at 10 μM or greater 
showed no marked off-target inhibitory activities against a counter screen assay panel of 166 human 
proteins including enzymes, transporters and receptor-ligand interactions. The safety pharmacology 
studies demonstrated that raltegravir evoked no meaningful effects when evaluated on a diverse range 
of physiological functions (cardiovascular, neurobehavior, respiratory) in vivo or in vitro. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have been conducted to support this application. The 
nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies provided a comprehensive ADME evaluation in rats and dogs, 
metabolism in CD-1 mice and in-vitro evaluations of raltegravir as a substrate and inhibitor of major 
human P450 (CYP) and UGT) enzymes and as inducer of major CYPs. Protein binding, metabolism and 
excretion of raltegravir in humans were also assessed. In addition, the inhibitory effect of raltegravir 
on major human drug uptake and efflux transporters was evaluated. 
Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by metabolism via UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation, with urinary 
excretion being the minor pathway. The ontogeny of UGT1A1 enzyme in the neonatal and paediatric 
population, and how the maturation of UGT1A1 activity progresses from birth, has been studied by 
quantifying the activity of UGT1A1 in fetal and paediatric liver samples using bilirubin activity assays. 
Results of these studies indicate that UGT1A1 activity toward bilirubin is nearly undetectable in the 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 12/62   
 
 
  
fetal liver and that catalytic activity increases progressively after birth, reaching adult levels sometime 
around 3 to 6 months of age. These findings suggest that maturation of UGT1A1 activity may likely 
influence raltegravir disposition in neonates and therefore it was included as a factor in the population 
PK models used to make dosing recommendations for raltegravir in neonates.  
Co-administration of potent UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers may alter plasma levels of raltegravir. 
Potential effect of the UGT1A1 maturation process on the profile of raltegravir as the victim of DDIs in 
neonates is not known. In vitro, raltegravir does not inhibit (IC50>100 μM) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.  
In addition, raltegravir is not a strong inhibitor (IC50>50 μM) of the UGTs tested (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) 
or the major human drug efflux and uptake transporters in vitro. Raltegravir does not inhibit 
P˗glycoprotein and inhibits only 22% of BCRP-mediated transport at 100 μM. Raltegravir does not 
inhibit OATP1B1, and it shows only 40% inhibition of OATP1B3 and 16% inhibition of OCT1 at 100 μM 
in vitro. Raltegravir also does not inhibit OCT2 and is not a strong inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 (IC50 of 
108 μM and 18.8 μM, respectively) and MATE1 and MATE2-K (52% and 29% inhibition at 100 μM, 
respectively) in vitro. Based on in-vitro data, raltegravir has overall a low propensity to perpetrate 
clinically meaningful DDIs with substrates of major drug metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters at 
plasma concentrations following administration of recommended doses in neonates (mean Cmax of 6.4 
μM following 3 mg/kg BID administration; estimated unbound Cmax of 1.1 μM). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology programme consisted of in-vitro and in-vivo studies to assess genotoxicity, 
acute oral toxicity and toxicokinetic studies in rats, dogs and mice, sub-chronic and chronic studies of 
up to 27 weeks duration in rats and 53 weeks in dogs, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies 
in rats and rabbits (including assessment of placental and lactational transfer and potential for 
neonatal/juvenile toxicity in rats) and two year bioassays in rats and mice for assessment of 
carcinogenicity potential. There was no potential relevant toxicity, specific hazard in developmental or 
reproductive studies, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity identified. Raltegravir was shown to be present in 
the milk of lactating rats orally administered raltegravir.  
In neonatal and juvenile aged rats an initial exploratory dose range-finding study was conducted by 
daily oral administration of raltegravir from Postnatal Day (PND) 5 to Postnatal Week (PNW) 9. The 
rats were randomized into 5 groups of 16 females and 16 males each that received 150, 300, 450, or 
600 mg/kg/day of raltegravir suspended in polyethylene glycol 400 in deionized water vehicle (80:20, 
w/w) or vehicle only. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body 
weights and clinical pathology examinations. The only test article-related change was slightly 
decreased mean serum glucose values in males of the 450 and 600 mg/kg/day groups. Toxicokinetics 
were performed on the study. When considering inter-animal variability across doses, Cmax was 
similar across the dose range and AUC0-24 was approximately dose proportional between 150 and 300 
mg/kg/day and similar between 300 and 600 mg/kg/day (maximum feasible dose). Based on these 
results, a high dose level of 600 mg/kg/day was selected for the subsequent definitive juvenile toxicity 
study in rats. 
In the definitive GLP juvenile toxicity study, the potential effects of raltegravir on growth and 
behaviour in rats, including histomorphology, was assessed following oral administration from PND 5 to 
PNW 8. The reversibility of the potential effects of raltegravir was evaluated in a 6-week treatment-
free period. Plasma concentrations of raltegravir and the glucuronide metabolite (L-001277512) were 
determined in PNW 7. Rats were assigned to 4 groups of 43 or 44 pups per sex (11 fostered litters per 
group) that received 50, 200 or 600 mg/kg/day of raltegravir suspended in polyethylene glycol 400 in 
deionized water (80:20, w/w) or vehicle only, once daily by oral gavage on PND 5 to PNW 8 (PND 52 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 13/62   
 
 
  
to 54). There was no evidence of toxicity based on mortality, physical signs, body weights, 
developmental signs, haematology, serum biochemistry (including glucose values), ophthalmologic 
examination, behavioural assessments and reproductive performance, including embryonic/fetal 
survival. No treatment-related gross findings or organ weight changes were noted at either the interim 
or final (recovery) necropsy.  
Treatment-related histomorphologic changes in the stomach were observed in mid- and high-dose 
animals. Treatment-related vacuolation of the non-glandular stomach epithelium was observed at ≥200 
mg/kg/day in both males and females. This change was confined to non-glandular epithelium adjacent 
to the limiting ridge and was frequently associated with increased numbers of the resident 
inflammatory cell population consisting of neutrophils, eosinophils and lesser numbers of lymphocytes 
and plasma cells.  
Increased inflammation was observed at ≥200 mg/kg/day in males and at 600 mg/kg/day in females, 
which consisted of increased numbers of resident inflammatory cell population (neutrophils, eosinophils 
and lesser numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells) that was most prevalent subjacent to the limiting 
ridge, and often extended into the adjacent mucosa of the glandular stomach. No treatment-related 
gross or histomorphologic changes were observed in the stomach following cessation of treatment for 
approximately 6 weeks (final recovery evaluation), thus indicating complete recovery. Systemic 
exposure (AUC) and Cmax values for raltegravir and the glucuronide metabolite L-001277512 were 
similar for animals in this juvenile toxicity study compared to animals in previous studies with mature 
rats.  
Treatment-related stomach findings consisting of vacuolation of the non-glandular stomach epithelium 
adjacent to the limiting ridge with increased numbers of the resident inflammatory cell population was 
observed and attributed to local irritation effects resulting from the oral raltegravir formulation. The 
no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was ≥600 mg/kg/day (AUC0˗24 67 μM•hr and Cmax 50.1 
μM, approximately 1.5-fold above the AUC0-24 and 12-fold above the Cmax achieved in neonatal 
patients administered raltegravir) based on the local non-glandular stomach irritant effect without 
relevance to humans, as humans do not have a non-glandular stomach region or limiting ridge. 
Findings in juvenile rats were consistent with the stomach irritation effects seen in adult rats and 
juvenile rats were therefore considered to be equally sensitive to the stomach inflammation seen in 
adult rats dosed with raltegravir. There were no additional toxicities noted in juvenile rats indicating 
that, overall, raltegravir effects were similar between juvenile and adult rats. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment for raltegravir was recently evaluated as part of the extension 
application for granules for oral suspension (EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0044/G), using the maximum 
allowable daily dose of 1600 mg/day (adults co-administered with rifampin). 
Using all default values for market penetration and no removal in the environment, the Predicted 
Environmental Concentration (PEC) is determined to be 8 μg/L. The maximum daily dose of raltegravir 
associated with this filing is 300 mg/day which corresponds to a PEC of 1.5 μg/L. 
Therefore, predicted environmental concentrations are anticipated to be equal to or lower than those 
already approved. No significant increase in the environment is expected to occur as a result of this 
application.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No additional nonclinical data are being submitted within this application and none are required. Some 
of the most relevant data have been described above. All other nonclinical data have been fully 
assessed in prior submissions. The nonclinical studies support the use of raltegravir in the neonatal 
population.

Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
1.  To evaluate the safety and tolerability through 6 weeks of age of raltegravir (GFS) when 
administered during the first 6 weeks of life with standard PMTCT antiretroviral prophylaxis to 
HIV-1-exposed infants assessed at high risk of HIV-1 infection. 
2.  To evaluate the PK of raltegravir in the first 6 weeks of life along with standard PMTCT 
antiretroviral therapy prophylaxis. 
3.  To determine an appropriate dose of raltegravir GFS for use in neonates and infants during the 
first 6 weeks of life. 
Secondary Objectives: 
1.  To assess safety and tolerability of raltegravir through 24 weeks of age when administered 
during the first 6 weeks with standard PMTCT antiretroviral prophylaxis. 
2.  To investigate the relationship between neonatal raltegravir elimination and UGT1A1 genotype 
and whether there is an association of UGT1A1 (*28/*28) and SLCO1B3 (rs2117032-C/T) with 
hyperbilirubinaemia. These associations were to be assessed with Fisher’s exact test. The 
power of these statistical tests depended upon the distributions of the variables to be analysed, 
and was extremely limited due to the small sample size. Therefore, the test was not 
performed. 
Study participants 
Maternal Inclusion Criteria 
1. Mother was known to have been HIV-1 infected prior to delivery or in the immediate postpartum 
period. Documentation of HIV-1 infection was defined as positive results from 2 samples (whole blood, 
serum or plasma) collected at different time points, including results in the clinical record from past 
testing. The mother-infant pair was to be enrolled so that the infant received the first raltegravir dose 
within 48 hours of birth. 
Sample #1 could have been tested by non-CAP/CLIA-approved laboratory or non-study public or 
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief programmes. If FDA-approved methods were not available, 
test methods were verified to be in accordance with GCLP and approved by the IMPAACT Central 
Laboratory. Sample #1 was tested using any of the following: 
a. Two rapid antibody tests from different manufacturers or based on different principles and epitopes. 
b. One EIA OR Western Blot OR immunofluorescence OR chemiluminescence 
c. One qPCR or bDNA (>5,000 copies/mL)

Sample #2 was to be performed in a CAP/CLIA-approved laboratory (for US sites) or in a laboratory 
that operated according to GCLP guidelines and participated in an appropriate external quality 
assurance programme (for international sites). Sample #2 was tested using any of the following: 
a. One EIA confirmed by Western Blot OR immunofluorescence OR chemiluminescence 
b. One quantitative HIV RNA PCR or bDNA (>5,000 copies/mL)

f. One total HIV nucleic test 
2. Mother was at high risk of transmitting HIV-1 to infant as evidenced by any of the following: 
a. Mother had not received any ART during the current pregnancy prior to the onset of labour 
b. HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL within 4 weeks before delivery 
c. Receipt of ART for <4 weeks 28 days before delivery 
d. On ART for ≥4 weeks, but had not taken any drug for >7 days prior to delivery 
e. Mother had known documented multi-class drug resistant virus 
Note: Mothers might have received prenatal and/or intrapartum antiretrovirals. 
3. Maternal written informed consent for study participation. 
Maternal Exclusion Criteria 
1. Known maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility 
2. Mother received raltegravir as part of her cART regimen after delivery and intending to breastfeed  
3. Mother received raltegravir prior to and through delivery unless last raltegravir dosing during 
prenatal period was >7 days prior to delivery (Cohort I infants only). By protocol amendment this 
exclusion criterion was modified during the study to allow enrolment in Cohort I of up to 6 mother-
infant pairs in which the mother had received raltegravir during pregnancy and through delivery. 
Therefore, subgroups exposed to raltegravir in utero (raltegravir-exposed neonates) and not exposed 
to raltegravir in utero (raltegravir-unexposed neonates) were to be included in this cohort but not in 
Cohort II.

5. Able to take oral medications 
6. Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent. 
Infant Exclusion Criteria 
1. Bilirubin exceeding the AAP guidelines for phototherapy 
2. Clinical evidence of renal disease such as oedema, ascites, or encephalopathy 
3. Receipt of disallowed medications (phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin) 
Treatments 
All neonates received raltegravir GFS. After reconstitution in 5 mL the suspension concentration was 
20 mg/mL. By protocol amendment #3 the suspension volume was increased to 10 mL for a final 
concentration of 10 mg/mL to facilitate administration of the lower doses required. The raltegravir 
dosing regimens were selected based on meeting PK targets for safety and efficacy. A minimum of 12 
neonates were to be enrolled into Cohort I to provide PK data that would inform raltegravir dose 
selection for Cohort II. Drug regimens, administration, and duration for Cohort I and Cohort I are as 
follows: 
Cohort I: HIV-1-exposed full-term neonates (aged ≤48 hours) initially received: 
• 
Raltegravir GFS 3 mg/kg as a single dose within 48 hours of birth in addition to PMTCT 
prophylaxis 
• 
A second single dose of raltegravir GFS 3 mg/kg on day 7-10 
Modifications of the dosing regimen were made during the study (see above re modified maternal 
inclusion criteria and below for explanation of the dose modifications):  
• 
For raltegravir-unexposed infants, those first enrolled received the 3 mg/kg initial dose but 
subsequently the initial dose was lowered to 2 mg/kg 
• 
For raltegravir-exposed infants the initial dose was 1.5 mg/kg  
The second dose was 3 mg/kg in all Cohort I infants. 
The first dose within 48 hours of birth provided PK data when infant glucuronidation is known to be at 
its nadir while the second dose (7 to 10 days) provided information about changes in metabolism in 
Week 2.  
Since raltegravir clearance was substantially lower in the first days of life based on interim data from 
IMPAACT P1097 (an ongoing study in infants born to HIV-infected pregnant women receiving 
raltegravir 400 mg BID) the 3 mg/kg single dose was selected to minimize potential safety concerns 
and still provide informative PK data. The 3 mg/kg single starting dose of raltegravir represented 25% 
of the total daily dose (6 mg/kg BID) studied in HIV-1-infected infants 4 weeks to <6 months of age in 
IMPAACT P1066 and currently approved for this age range.  
The study was designed to allow raltegravir dosing to be modified in the range of 1.5 mg/kg to 6 
mg/kg per dose. The PK results and safety were assessed through team monitoring at least every 4 
weeks and at full cohort accrual to ensure that the individual raltegravir concentrations did not exceed 
a Cmax of 8724 ng/mL (19.63 μM) and did not exceed an AUC0-12 of 28 mg*hr/L (63.05 μM*hr). 
These targets were based on mean exposure in the raltegravir QTc study 024 in adults.  
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 18/62   
 
 
  
Based on the preliminary PK findings from the first 6 raltegravir-unexposed neonates enrolled in 
Cohort I, the initial dose of 3 mg/kg was lowered to 2 mg/kg for subsequent raltegravir-unexposed 
neonates. Furthermore, because of the efficient transplacental transfer of raltegravir to infants born to 
women receiving raltegravir prior to and during delivery (P1097; see above), the initial dose of 1.5 
mg/kg was selected for the infants exposed to raltegravir in utero. 
Cohort II: HIV-1 exposed full-term neonates (aged ≤48 hours) received raltegravir GFS in addition to 
PMTCT prophylaxis as follows: 
- 1.5 mg/kg once daily during Days 1 to 7 of age (week 1) 
- 3 mg/kg twice daily during Days 8 to 28 of age (weeks 2 to 4) 
- 6 mg/kg twice daily during Days 29 to 42 of age (weeks 5 and 6) 
The weights used to determine dose were obtained entry visit (target within 48 hours of birth), day 6 
to 9 and day 28 to 32. The dose to be used for week 5 and 6 was the approved dose of 6 mg/kg BID.  
The dosing regimen reflected the modelling and simulation analysis, and was revised from the original 
protocol prior to opening of Cohort II in amendment #2.  
The PK targets for Cohort II were those used in P1066, with adjustment for once daily dosing. 
IMPAACT P1066 BID doses were selected such that the PK profile of raltegravir resembled that attained 
in adults dosed with 400 mg BID. In Cohort II, the PK safety target was GM-AUC-based, and depended 
on whether the drug was dosed once (AUC0-24) or twice (AUC0-12) daily. The PK efficacy target was 
GM trough concentration and was the same for once daily and twice daily dosing (GM C24 and C12, 
respectively). The PK targets for Cohort II were: 
• 
Once-daily dosing: GM AUC24 12 to 40 mg*h/L (28 to 90 μM*hr) and an approximate GM 
trough (C24) >33ng/mL (75nM) 
• 
Twice-daily dosing: GM AUC12 6 to 20 mg*h/L (14 to 45 μM*hr) and an approximate GM 
trough (C12) >33ng/mL (75nM) 
Raltegravir was to be provided to infants if needed for treatment of documented HIV-1 infection 
through the protocol for the duration of the study as part of cART. The choice of ART regimen was at 
the discretion of the site investigator.  
Raltegravir Compassionate Use (Cohorts I and II) 
At the end of the study, HIV-1-infected infants who continued to receive raltegravir as part of their 
cART regimen were to have access to the raltegravir through MSD’s Paediatric Compassionate Use 
Program until GFS became commercially available. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Evidence of HIV-1 infection and resistance testing (Cohorts I and II) 
All infants received appropriate testing for evidence of HIV-1 infection within 48 hours of birth (if not 
done  as  per  standard  of  care)  and  at  6  and  24  weeks  of  age.  If  any  infant  was  found  to  be  HIV-1 
infected  during  the  study,  blood  samples  for  viral  resistance  testing  to  raltegravir  and  other 
antiretroviral  therapies  were  to  be  collected  as  soon  as  possible  after  confirmation  of  vertical 
transmission.

Optional genotyping (Cohorts I and II) 
Optional genotyping for UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms was performed in infants undergoing PK 
sampling  to  determine  how  polymorphisms  such  as  UGT1A1  *28/*28  genotype,  associated  with 
decreased  UGT1A1  activity,  impacted  raltegravir  elimination  and  biliary  elimination  of  bilirubin  in  the 
neonate. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in all neonates at birth but increases rapidly over the first weeks 
of  age.  The  effect  of  UGT1A1  polymorphisms  on  the  metabolism  of  raltegravir  during  this  period  is 
unknown.  The  potential  association  of  SLCO1B3  polymorphisms  with  neonatal hyperbilirubinemia  was 
also examined. 
PK sampling 
Blood was collected at the time points shown in the revised study schema and as in Figure 1. 
Figure 1.  P1110 Study Design Schema 
Pharmacokinetic sampling for Cohort I included the following: 
• Dose 1 (within 48 hours of birth) pre-dose, 1 to 2 h post-dose, 4 to 8 h post-dose, 12 (±1) h post-
dose and 24 (±1) h post-dose. 
• Day 3 to 4 one random PK sample was obtained with laboratory evaluations on Day 3 to 4  
• Dose 2 (7 to 10 days) pre-dose, 1-2 h post-dose and 24 (±1) h post-dose 
Pharmacokinetic sampling for Cohort II included the following: 
• Within 1 h pre-first dose, then 1 to 2, 6 to 10 and 20 to 24 h post-dose 
• After second dose one sample obtained 3 to 6 h post-dose with laboratory evaluations 
Then at visits in the following windows: 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 20/62   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• Days 6 to 9 within 1 h pre-dose of initiating 3 mg/kg BID 
• Days 15 to 18 within 1 h pre-dose, then 1 to 2, 4 to 6 and 8 to 12 h post-dose 
• Days 28 to 32 within 1 h pre-dose of initiating 6 mg/kg twice daily 
• Weeks 5 and 6 (days 33 to 42) within 1 hour pre-dose and 3 to 6 h post-dose. 
PK sampling was ideally scheduled after raltegravir had reached steady state (~ 7 to 10 days after the 
dose increase).  
Plasma samples were analysed for raltegravir concentration by UAB using HPLC-MS/MS. Two validated 
procedures  were  used  to  support  this  study,  one  with  a  linear  calibration  range  of  1  to  3,000  ng/mL 
and the other with a linear calibration range of 10 to 10,000 ng/mL.  
Population PK modelling and simulation were conducted after the completion of Cohort I to generate a 
multiple  dosing  scheme  for  Cohort  II.  Data  were  to  be  integrated  from  P1110  Cohort  I,  P1097  and 
P1066 (Cohorts IV 6 months to <24 months and V 4 weeks to 6 months) to construct a population PK 
model  capable  of  describing  raltegravir  PK  in  neonates.  A  two-compartment  model  was  fitted  using 
nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) version VII software, where various population attributes 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  age,  weight,  sex  and  creatinine  clearance  were  examined  to  determine 
their influence on the PK of raltegravir. Following completion of Cohort II, the population PK model was 
updated using the PK data collected at all visits in Cohort II. 
Sample size 
The study was to enroll approximately 50 mother-infant pairs to accrue a minimum of 32 PK-evaluable 
HIV-1-exposed neonates. 
Results 
• 
• 
There  were  16  neonates  enrolled  into  Cohort  I  (10  raltegravir-unexposed  and  6  raltegravir-
exposed  in  utero).  They  all  completed  2  doses  and  safety  follow  up  to  24  weeks  and  14  were 
evaluable for PK.  
There were 26 neonates enrolled in Cohort II, all of whom were unexposed to raltegravir in utero, 
of which 23 completed 6 weeks of treatment, 22 completed safety follow up to 24 weeks and 25 
were evaluable for PK. 
Using  the  IMPAACT  SOP  criteria  there  was  one  reportable  protocol  deviation  that  concerned  one 
neonate  in  Cohort  II  who  did  not  receive  raltegravir  for  4  days  following  the  first  2  doses  that  were 
given in the hospital. Treatment resumed at the day 6 to 9 visit. 
Based  on  the  MAH’s  criteria  there  were  4  major  deviations  concerning  4  neonates  who  received  an 
incorrect dose. None of these 4 neonates was excluded from PK analysis and none had AEs during the 
incorrect dosing period. 
In Cohort I, 68.8% of the mothers were Black or African American and 31.3% were Hispanic or Latino 
with a median age of 24.5 years. In Cohort II, 69.2% of the mothers were Black or African American 
and  73.1%  were  Hispanic  or  Latino  with  a  median  age  of  27  years.  Approximately  half  of  neonates 
enrolled  in  both  Cohorts  were  female  and  80%  were  delivered  by  Caesarean  section.  The  median 
gestational age at birth was 38-39 weeks and the median birth weight was about 3 kg. 
The most commonly reported medical history for the neonates was increased AST (Cohort I 43.8% and 
Cohort II 15.4%). Two in Cohort I and one in Cohort II had neonatal jaundice.

The  most  frequently  used  PMTCT  regimens  consisted  of  NNRTI  +/-  NRTI  (56.3%  in  Cohort  I  and 
96.2%  in  Cohort  II;  mostly  NVP  plus  ZDV).  Zidovudine  was  included  in  all  regimens  except  for  5 
neonates (1 in Cohort I, 4 in Cohort II) who received NVP alone.  
All  16  in  Cohort  I  received  both  observed  single-doses  of  raltegravir.  Adherence  to  study  drug  in 
Cohort II was good, with 92.3% having 100% adherence, none with < 80% adherence and a median 
of 41 (range 1-43) days on raltegravir. 
The two neonates considered non-evaluable had switched samples or incomplete data due to refusing 
further blood draws. 
PK data from raltegravir-unexposed infants in Cohort I 
Three  raltegravir-unexposed  neonates  who  received  a  first  dose  of  3  mg/kg  had  AUC0-12  values  >  28 
hr*mg/L (target).

Interim POPPK model  
An “Interim Population PK Model” was developed using 6 raltegravir-unexposed Cohort 1 neonates, 
enriched by data from 24 HIV-1-infected infants in P022 aged 4 weeks to 2 years. The Interim 
Population PK Model involved 2-compartment linear disposition, first-order oral absorption and body-
weight based allometric correction of clearances and volumes with fixed exponents of 0.75 and 1.0, 
respectively. It also included empirical hyperbolic functions for the increases in clearance and rate 
constant of absorption with age. No additional covariate effects were included in this model. 
The model was used to perform simulations to select a 6-week dose regimen for raltegravir-unexposed 
neonates in Cohort II. Ten dose regimen options (Table 4) were simulated to identify the most 
appropriate regimen.

Note: BW change calculated using BW = 3 + 9.289*(1 – exp(0.983*AGE)), AGE expressed in years. This empirical equation was obtained by fitting the 
actual BW data 
Simulations included 10 candidate dose regimens adhering to the predefined PK targets of Ctrough 
>33.3 ng/mL (75 nM), Cmax <8720 ng/mL (19.63 μM), AUC0-24 <40 hr*mg/L (90 μM*hr) and AUC0-12 
<20 hr*mg/L (45 μM*hr) for a typical neonate. The selected regimen was 1.5 mg/kg QD from birth 
through day 7 followed by 3 mg/kg BID during days 8 through 28 and the approved dose (6 mg/kg 
BID) thereafter.

*Regimens described in Table 4.

Note: Results are expressed as Closest Percentage of Endpoint (Day of Occurrence) 
In all ten scenarios, the Cmax criterion is always met while all but two did not meet the Cmin criterion.  
Regimens 3, 4, 6, 7 and 10 met all PK endpoint criteria but regimens 4 and 6 were considered too 
close (up to 94%) to the AUC0-12 maximum thus were not retained for consideration.  
Regimens 7 and 10 were better than regimen 3 in exceeding the Cmin endpoint, and regimen 10 
appeared superior to regimen 7 for AUC0-24 in the QD period, as it gave the lowest predicted value that 
did not exceed 67% of the pre-specified AUC target. This is consistent with the fact that regimen 10 
contained the lowest proposed dose (1.5 mg/kg) during the first week of life. Regimen 10 was 
considered better than 7 for patient adherence with absolute dosing value simply doubling between 
each change.  
Ultimately, regimen 10 was recommended for Cohort II for P080. This regimen consisted of 1.5 mg/kg 
QD in Week 1, 3.0 mg/kg BID in Weeks 2 to 4 of age and 6.0 mg/kg BID in Weeks 5 and 6.  
PK data from Cohort II 
The selected dosing regimen (see above) was assessed in the first 8 neonates (interim analysis 
population) to confirm if the observed PK parameters were as expected from the simulations and 
within the specified PK targets.  
The geometric mean PK parameters from the first 8 raltegravir-unexposed neonates met the pre-
specified PK targets except for a slightly higher mean AUC0-24 after the first dose at 1.5 mg/kg QD. 
Enrolment proceeded without any dose adjustments. The GM for all 25 raltegravir-unexposed neonates 
achieved the pre-specified PK targets after the first dose of 1.5 mg/kg QD and during 3 mg/kg BID on 
day 15 to 18. 
Individual  values  did  not  always  meet  the  pre-specified  AUC  targets.  As  shown  in  the  figure  below 
there was considerable scatter of values and the tables that follow show that: 
•  AUC0-24 frequently exceeded 40 hr*mg/L (90 μM*hr)

The CSR for P080 states that the distribution of observed concentration values in neonates in 
Cohort II who received the approved dose from 4 weeks of age and infants who received this same 
dose in P1066 Cohorts IV and V overlapped as shown in Figure 5. However, this figure also shows 
that the regimen used from birth resulted in considerably greater exposures at least in the first 2 
weeks of life compared to those achieved with the regimen used from 4 weeks onwards.

Age Receiving 6.0 mg/kg BID in P1110 and P1066 
The  POPPK  report  (04mhp6)  includes  a  very  similar  figure  that  compares  the  observed  Ctrough 
values  and  shows  the  same  pattern  (see  below).  This  report  comments  that  the  median  trough 
level went down from 2330 nM (1035 ng/mL) after the first dose on Day 1 to 156 nM (69.3 ng/mL) 
after one week of 1.5 mg/kg QD dosing in Cohort II due to increased clearance of raltegravir.  
With  institution  of  3  mg/kg  BID  for  the  following  period  from  2  to  4  weeks,  the  median  trough 
levels  decreased  from  734  nM  (326  ng/mL)  in  Week  2  to  184  nM  (82  ng/mL)  in  Week  4  as  the 
result  of  further  maturation  of  the  UGT-1A1  enzyme  complex.  After  institution  of  6  mg/kg  BID  at 
Week  4,  the  median  trough  level  obtained in  Week 5-6  was  233  nM  (104  ng/mL).  For  cohorts  IV 
and V of P022 dosed with 6 mg/kg BID, the median trough was 106 nM (47.1 ng/mL).

The percentages of neonates and infants who experienced plasma trough raltegravir below 75 nM 
(33.3 ng/mL) after Week 1, Week 4 and Weeks 5-6 in Cohort II of P1110 and in Cohorts IV and V 
of P022 varied from 26% to 44%. 
The predicted trough concentrations in the two studies gave similar results to the observed values. 
The median trough after one week was slightly over-predicted by the model.  
The observed AUC0-24 values exceeded 90 μM.hr (40 μg.hr/mL) in 5/10 (50%) raltegravir-
unexposed neonates after the first dose administration on Day 1 compared to 9% of the adult 
population in P292. After about one week of the 3 mg/kg BID dose at Day 14, 3/9 had AUC0-12 >45 
μM.hr (20 μg.hr/mL) compared to 0% and 9% of Cohorts IV and V in P022.

Integrated POPPK model  
An “Integrated Population PK Model” was developed that included data from raltegravir-unexposed 
neonates from Cohorts I and II, raltegravir-exposed neonates from Cohort I, infants in P1066 
Cohorts IV and V and 19 mothers from P1097. The total dataset included 65 neonates or infants 
and 19 mothers.  
To support a dosing recommendation over the first 6 weeks of age for raltegravir-exposed 
neonates, an integrated mother-neonate model was developed, which consisted of two parts: one 
related to raltegravir PK in the mother and one related to the foetus (later neonate). The fitted PK 
for the mother compared reasonably well against reported summary PK data of pregnant women in 
their third trimester while the neonate model was assumed identical for raltegravir-unexposed and 
raltegravir-exposed neonates. The only difference was that the raltegravir concentration in the 
central compartment at birth was determined by prior history of exposure in utero instead of being 
set to zero. 
Simulations were conducted assuming a first dose of raltegravir was given at various times 
postpartum. Using the same predefined PK targets, the final recommendation was made that a 
raltegravir-exposed neonate should receive the first dose between 24 and 48 hours postpartum so 
that the trough is predicted to remain above 33 ng/mL and AUC0-24 is predicted to stay below 40 
mg*hr/mL.  
Figure 9.  Simulated Daily AUC and Ctrough Values for a Typical Individual Receiving the 6-week 
Dosing Regimen Recommended; Ctrough, AUC0-24 and AUC0-12 Targets are Met 
Furthermore, if the first dose in an exposed neonate is administered at 36 h post-partum, the 
trough concentration should stay above 75 nM and the AUC0-24 should stay below 90 μM*hr. If the 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report

first dose in an exposed neonate is given at 12 h post-partum the AUC0-24 would likely exceed 90 
μM*hr by at most 20% for not more than 2 days.

hours post-partum (top) and 12 hours post-partum (bottom) 
Birth at TIME=0 (day). First dose administration 36 hours after birth of raltegravir-exposed (yellow area) and 12 hours after birth of raltegravir-
unexposed (blue solid line) neonates. The yellow area represents the range of simulated concentrations of raltegravir-exposed neonates immediately 
after birth and after subsequent dose administrations, which depends on the time of administration of the last dose to the mother (between 2 to 24 
hours before delivery). 
The MAH concluded that the recommended regimen in raltegravir-exposed neonates should be the 
same as that for unexposed neonates with the modification that if the mother received raltegravir 
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 38/62   
 
 
  
 
 
within 2 to 24 h prior to delivery, the first infant dose should be given between 24 to 48 hours after 
birth.  
The POPPK report provides some relevant simulations. The first figure shows that if the time since 
last maternal dose was < 6 h the neonatal profile was predicted to decline but if > 6 h had elapsed 
then there was an initial rise predicted due to back flow from the neonatal peripheral compartment.

Dosing tables for neonates 
During the conduct of IMPAACT P1110, a letter of amendment was issued to increase the volume 
for reconstitution of GFS from 5 mL to 10 mL, which gives a concentration of 10 mg/mL. In 
addition, the GFS dosing tables were simplified to include three weight bands (2 to <3 kg, 3 to <4 
kg and 4 to <5 kg). This amendment was implemented at one site and for a single neonate.  
The use of these fixed doses was assessed by simulations of raltegravir-unexposed neonates with 
body weights corresponding to the lower and upper limits of each weight band using the integrated 
POPPK model. In all cases the trough concentrations remained above 33 ng/mL (75 nM). Neonates 
at the lower end of the weight bands were predicted to have raltegravir exposures that exceeded 
the AUC target after the first dose and at each regimen change to a higher daily dose. The most 
extreme case was a low weight neonate of predicted to achieve 1.3-fold the AUC0-24 criterion for 2 
days in Week 1 and 1.2-fold the AUC0-12 criterion for 13.5 days.

in subsets with the mutant ((TA)5/(TA)6, (TA)6/(TA)7 and (TA)7/(TA)7) and wildtype 
((TA)6/(TA)6) genotype of UGT1A1 largely overlapped, suggesting that the genotype grouping did 
not impact on the disposition of raltegravir in neonates.

General study design and PK targets 
To generate safety and PK data to support selection of a dosing schema for neonates (i.e. infants in 
the first 4 weeks of life) study P080 enrolled neonates at high risk of HIV acquisition via MTCT and 
they all received raltegravir in addition to standard PMCTC regimens.  
In the absence of prior data in neonates and based on what is known about maturation of UGT1A1, 
Cohort I of the study was given two single doses to generate sufficient PK data to select daily or 
BID dosing regimens that were to commence within 48 h of birth in Cohort II. Since some mothers 
had received raltegravir as part of their HIV treatment regimen, the data from neonates in Cohort I 
who had and had not been exposed to raltegravir in utero were analysed separately. All infants in 
Cohort II had not been exposed to raltegravir in utero. Therefore, modelling and simulations were 
conducted to account for neonatal plasma levels resulting from maternal treatment and determine 
the most appropriate time after birth to commence daily dosing depending on whether the neonate 
was exposed in utero.  
The PK targets set for P080 were based on the targets applied in study P022, in which HIV-1 
infected infants and toddlers (4 weeks to <2 years of age) in Cohorts IV and V were dosed using 
the GFS at 6 mg/kg BID. These targets were previously discussed in detail in the report on X44G. 
The initial protocol for P022 set a target minimum exposure for each cohort comprising a GM AUC0-
12 14-25 μM·hr and concurrent GM C12 >33 nM (i.e. the IC95). Additionally, for safety reasons, the 
maximum AUC0-12 was to be <45 μM·hr, which represents half the AUC0-24 observed when 1600 
mg was administered in Phase I adult studies. Subsequently, the importance of C12 for efficacy of 
raltegravir became clear from study 071, which compared 400 mg BID vs. 800 mg QD in adults 
and failed to show non-inferiority for QD vs. BID dosing. Therefore, the targets in Cohorts IV and V 
were modified to GM AUC0-12 14-45 μM·hr and GM C12 ≥75 nM.  
The actual values achieved in P022 were:

•  Cohort V GM AUC0-12 22.3 uM.hr (40% CV) and GM C12 116.6 nM (68% CV)  
In  P080  the  PK  targets  for  safety  in  Cohort  I  were  for  individual  concentrations  to  not  exceed  a 
Cmax  of  8724  ng/mL  (19.63  μM;  based  on  the  TQT  study  maximum)  and  AUC12  of  28  hr*mg/L 
(63.05  μM*hr).  In  Cohort  II,  the  PK  targets  were  also  designed  to  address  efficacy  and  were 
aligned with those in P022, i.e.: 
•  GM AUC24 12 to 40 hr*mg/L (28 to 90 μM*hr) and Ctrough >33 ng/mL (75 nM) for QD dosing 
•  GM AUC12 6 to 20 hr*mg/L (14 to 45 μM*hr) and Ctrough >33 ng/mL (75 nM) for BID dosing 
Based on the previous assessment and the safety, efficacy and PK data observed in Cohorts IV and 
V  of  P022,  the  targets  used  in  P080  are  appropriate.  Since  Cohort  I  infants  were  receiving  a  full 
PMTCT regimen with other agents, and considering what is known about maturation of UGT1a1, it 
was also appropriate that the initial dose tested was less than that recommended from the age of 4 
weeks. 
Derivation of the dose regimen for neonates 
In Cohort II, the mg/kg doses were derived from simulations using a POPPK model that included 
data from 6 unexposed infants in Cohort I as well as data from Cohorts IV and V in P022 and 
infants born to mothers in P1097. Based on observed PK data from 25 unexposed neonates in 
Cohort II who received 1.5 mg/kg for 7 days (with a first dose within 48 h of birth) the post-first 
dose GM Ctrough and AUC24 values met the pre-specified targets. The GM Ctrough greatly exceeded 
the target (947.9 ng/mL) while the GM AUC0-24 (38.20 hr*mg/L) was near to the upper limit. 
Individual AUC0-24 values frequently exceeded 40 hr*mg/L (in 11 individuals; maximum observed 
was 78 hr*mg/L). In contrast, the POPPK report shows that median Ctrough decreased >10-fold 
between day 1 and day 7 of dosing with 1.5 mg/kg QD. 
After switching to 3 mg/kg BID the day 15 to 18 GM values were much lower (Ctrough 557.99 ng/mL 
and AUC0-12 14.30 hr*mg/L) than observed after the first 1.5 mg/kg dose, indicating the 
importance of increasing raltegravir clearance in the first 2 weeks of life. After about one week of 
the 3 mg/kg BID dose at Day 14, 3/9 had AUC0-12 above the target (>20 μg.hr/mL) compared to 
0% and 9% of Cohorts IV and V in P022. In contrast, up to 27% had trough levels below the target 
between weeks 2 and 4 while receiving 3 mg/kg BID. Nevertheless, the median Ctrough values at 
the end of 1.5 mg/kg QD and during 3 mg/kg BID dosing were higher than those documented in 
Cohorts IV and V of P022.  
In infants dosed with 6 mg/kg from 4 weeks of age the Ctrough in infants in Cohort II of P080 was 
about twice the values previously observed in Cohorts IV and V of P022. The model-predicted 
AUC0-12 values indicated that 41% in P080 would exceed the AUC0-12 criterion in weeks 5-6 
compared to none in Cohorts IV and V of P022.  
The dose regimen used in Cohort II of P080 potentially over-exposes neonates during initial dosing 
with 1.5 mg/kg QD and again during dosing with 3 mg/kg BID and 6 mg/kg BID. There is a 
dramatic drop in Ctrough in the first week of life, supporting a change in regimen at least by day 7 of 
life. The 3 mg/kg BID dose from weeks 1 to 4 of life results in a predicted 41% over-exposed 
based on AUC0-12 but at the same time up to 27% are under-exposed based on Ctrough. It seems 
there is very considerable inter-individual variation and it may not be possible to overcome the 
impact of variable and rapidly changing raltegravir clearance in the first month of life. The CHMP 
accepted that the overall proposed regimen is likely to be the best that can be achieved whilst still 
being practical.

Time of the first dose in raltegravir-exposed neonates 
Raltegravir is indicated only for treatment of HIV-1. It is not indicated for use in PMTCT regimens. 
Very few neonates are likely to be confirmed to have acquired HIV and be started on treatment 
within 1-2 days of birth. Nevertheless, it is acceptable that recommendations are provided in case 
raltegravir is considered for inclusion in the neonatal primary treatment regimen. 
The SmPC additions in section 4.2 for dosing neonates do not make any statement about the 
minimum time from birth that treatment could start except in case of neonates exposed to 
raltegravir in utero, in which case the first dose is to be given between 24 and 48 h after birth if 
the mother took raltegravir 2 to 24 hours before delivery. This minimum 24 h limit post-birth for 
starting raltegravir in exposed neonates was not imposed in P080 but has been derived from 
modelling. 
The actual data from Cohort I neonates who had been exposed to raltegravir in utero and received 
a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg within 22-45 h of birth showed that 4/6 exceeded the AUC0-12 <28 
hr*mg/L target, although not by much (maximum value was 34.66 hr*mg/L) while Ctrough varied 
hugely from 12-1324 ng/mL. The final recommendation to give the first dose of 1.5 mg/kg 
between 24 and 48 hours postpartum is based on predicted Ctrough > 33 ng/mL and AUC0-24 < 40 
mg*hr/mL. The simulations generally support this advice and suggest that there is sufficient 
forgiveness in the modelling that it is not necessary to impose a specific 36-h minimum time limit. 
Simplified dosing table in 4.2 
The MAH’s proposals for the SmPC for neonates are: 
•  Based on weight bands and not on mg/kg dosing as used in Cohort II of P080 
•  Separated depending on weight band dosing from birth to week 1 or from 1-4 weeks 
At the time of approval of the GFS for use from 4 weeks of age the EU SmPC was aligned with that 
of the US FDA in using a simplified dosing table by weight band that closely approximated to 6 
mg/kg but avoided the need to calculate the dose once the infant weight was known. The MAH is 
proposing a similar weight banding approach for neonates based on simulations. It appears that 
the simulations predict 100% of values exceeding the required trough value and only modest 
increases over the AUC criteria.  
POPPK models 
The interim model is complex and is considered useful to support the proposed posology.  The 
overall fit to the model is reasonable for the infants unexposed in utero. The diagnostic plots for 
the integrated model in infants exposed to raltegravir in utero show (see run205) evidence of 
model misspecification and residuals do not appear to be distributed around zero. This initially 
raised doubt on the reliability of the model to support dosing in exposed individuals; however it 
should be noted that the deviations are at extreme values and are suggested to be due to the 
limitations of the sparse data available. Other plots suggest that the model is robust.

Doubling the administration volume 
At the same time as introducing posology for neonates, the MAH is amending the existing table for 
dosing of infants from 4 weeks of age to double the volumes to be administered, reflecting a 
change in the volume into which the GFS are suspended. The idea is to make it easier to measure 
out the required dose and to use the same dilution instructions for dosing infants < and > 4 weeks.  
Isentress II64G 
Assessment report  
Page 48/62   
 
 
  
 
 
In support of the use in neonates the MAH proposed an update to the packaging and kit 
components (including the suspension volume) to facilitate accurate measurement of the smaller 
doses required for neonates, the proposed kit is based upon the existing configuration, for which 
there have been no adverse event reports related to its use. Usability studies were carried out.  
Initially, the CHMP raised the issue about transition to the new kit, as there is the concern that (i) 
treatment centres that already use the GFS in infants from 4 weeks of age could fail to appreciate 
that the new (replacement) dosing table for this age group reflects new dilution instructions, which 
could inadvertently lead to administering twice the recommended dose, (ii) Treatment centres that 
start to treat neonates could fail to appreciate the new dilution instructions so that neonates could 
be inadvertently overdosed due to administration of the recommended volumes but using the 
current dilution strategy. Both errors could result in administration of twice the recommended 
dose. For that reason, a booklet, containing step-by-step instructions for use, colored pictograms 
and understandable text is included along with the package leaflet within the product packaging of 
the granules for oral suspension. Furthermore, the inclusion of 3 different syringes of different 
colours in the pack (10ml is blue, 3ml is green and 1ml is white) will allow correct measurement of 
the dose. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The dosing regimens in neonates are based on weight band dosing from birth to week 1 or from 1-
4 weeks. The proposed dose regimens used in Cohort II of P080 might be the best that can be 
achieved whilst still being practical.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The study was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of raltegravir as a component of prophylaxis or 
treatment in HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. Neonates and 
infants in this study were tested for evidence of HIV-1 infection, as part of standard clinical 
monitoring of HIV-1 exposed neonates. None had a positive HIV-1 test when assessed at birth, 6 
or 24 weeks of age.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 42 neonates received at least 1 dose of raltegravir (16 in Cohort I and 26 in Cohort II). In 
Cohort II neonates received 1.5 mg/kg once daily for a mean of 6 days, 3 mg/kg twice daily for 
mean of 22 days and 6 mg/kg twice daily for a mean of 13.13 days. The maximum duration did not 
exceed 43 days. 
In Cohort I, the most frequently reported (≥10%) clinical AEs through 6 weeks were vomiting (3), 
nasal congestion (2) and pallor (2). In Cohort II, the most frequently reported (≥10%) AEs through 
6 weeks were oral candidiasis (6), jaundice neonatal (4), congenital umbilical hernia (3), cough (3) 
and nasal congestion (3).  
Most clinical AEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. In Cohort I, Grade 3 or greater clinical AEs were 
reported in 2 neonates but both occurred after completion of dosing. One had Grade 4 neonatal 
anaemia (SAE). In Cohort II, Grade 3 or greater clinical AEs were reported in 2 infants. One had 
Grade 3 and one had Grade 3 weight decreased, which were SAEs.

Table 16.  All Laboratory Adverse Events through 6 Weeks of Life - All Treated Neonates 
In Cohort I, one neonate had a drug-related laboratory AE of neutrophil count decreased. The 
investigator considered this non-serious AE as possibly related to all antiretroviral agents in the 
regimen (raltegravir, 3TC, NVP and ZDV). The neutrophil count decreased was Grade 3 on day 8 (day 
of the second dose), increased to Grade 4 on day 13 and decreased to Grade 1 at day 20. In Cohort II, 
2 infants had drug-related non-serious laboratory AEs of blood bilirubin increased, which were < Grade 
3. 
Through 24 Weeks 
The table summarises the safety profile observed. There were no drug-related clinical AEs reported 
through 24 weeks of age in Cohort I or Cohort II.

In Cohorts I and II, the reported clinical AEs were generally similar to those seen through 6 weeks. In 
Cohort II, the most frequently reported AEs through 24 weeks were oral candidiasis (8), cough (8), 
pyrexia (7), URTI (5), nasal congestion (5), jaundice neonatal (4), seborrheic dermatitis (4), 
congenital umbilical hernia (3), vomiting (3) and rash (3). 
Most clinical AEs were either Grade 1 or Grade 2. In Cohort I, there were no additional subjects with a 
Grade 3 or greater clinical AE reported. In Cohort II, Grade 3 or greater clinical AEs were reported in 6 
infants by 24 weeks. Of the additional AEs reported between weeks 6 and 24, bacterial pneumonia, 
bronchiolitis, cellulitis and craniocerebral injury were also reported as SAEs. 
There were no additional drug-related laboratory AEs reported between 6 weeks and 24 weeks in 
either Cohort. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Hyperbilirubinemia 
In Cohort I, bilirubin elevations included 1 Grade 1 and 1 Grade 2. The Grade 1 bilirubin elevation 
occurred on day 39 and the Grade 2 bilirubin elevation occurred on day 35. Both had onset after last 
dose of raltegravir and resolved. The infant with Grade 2 bilirubin elevation also had bilirubin values 
≥10 and <16 mg/dL on days 3, 5, 7 and 9. Both had normal bilirubin values at 24 weeks of age.  
In Cohort II, bilirubin elevations included 4 Grade 1, 1 Grade 2 and 1 Grade 4, all of which resolved. 
The onset of graded bilirubin elevations was prior to or at 14 days of age in 3/6 cases. The Grade 4 
bilirubin elevation occurred on day 16 in a neonate who discontinued study therapy due to a clinical 
AE. Neither phototherapy nor exchange transfusion was used in any cases and there was no 
association with Grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT or AST because there were no such events reported. 
In evaluating the potential association between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and genotype, the 
assessment from birth through 14 days was considered the most clinically relevant. Despite a 
reasonable distribution of non-wild type genotypes, the low incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia meant 
that the data could not support an assessment of any association between hyperbilirubinemia and 
UGT1A1 or SLCO1B3 genotype. 
Metabolic Disorders 
There were no AEs in the system organ class of metabolism and nutrition disorders reported through 6 
weeks of age but by 24 weeks there were AEs of dehydration (Grade 2), failure to thrive (Grade 3) and 
malnutrition (Grade 4) reported for an infant in Cohort II who had previously discontinued study 
therapy and was noted to have weight loss, early vomiting and gastroesophageal reflux. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
AEs in the SOC gastrointestinal disorders in the first 6weeks were primarily vomiting in Cohort I (3) 
and Cohort II (2), which were Grade 1 or 2 and were not treatment-limiting. No AEs of gastritis were 
reported. AEs in this SOC by 24 weeks of age were generally similar to those reported by 6 weeks. 
Rash 
AEs of rash were reported in 2 infants in Cohort II through 6 weeks of age. Both were Grade 1. There 
were also single reports of dermatitis allergic (Grade 2) and dermatitis atopic (Grade 1) in Cohort II. 
None was serious, drug-related or resulted in discontinuation of study therapy. There were 2 additional 
cases of rash reported by 24 weeks and an additional case of dermatitis allergic. These were Grade 1 
or 2, non-serious and not drug-related. 
Congenital anomalies 
There  were  no  congenital  anomalies  reported  for  the  6  Cohort  I  neonates  who  were  exposed  to 
raltegravir in utero.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the study. SAEs were based on data entered by the site/investigator onto a 
DAIDS Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) form, which was submitted to the DAIDS Regulatory 
Compliance Center (RCC), and subsequently provided to the IMPAACT Statistical Data Analysis Center 
for reporting purposes. The tables only include SAEs that met the criteria in the DAIDS EAE reporting 
manual.  
Through 6 Weeks 
In Cohort I, 2 neonates had SAEs of Grade 4 neonatal anaemia on day 22, which decreased in severity 
and ended on day 170, and Grade 1 vomiting on days 2 through 3 of age.  
In Cohort II, 2 infants had serious clinical AEs reported through 6 weeks. None was drug-related. 
Grade 3 weight decreased was reported from day 29 through day 86 and led to discontinuation of 
study therapy. One had a SAE of blood glucose decreased, which was Grade 3 AE was not drug-
related. 
Through 24 Weeks 
In Cohort I, there were no additional serious clinical AEs reported through 24 weeks of age. In Cohort 
II, 4 infants had SAEs with onset between 6 and 24 weeks, including bronchiolitis (2), cellulitis (1; also 
had bronchiolitis), pneumonia (1) and craniocerebral injury (1). All SAEs were Grade 3 in severity and 
none was drug-related. The cellulitis was ongoing at the final study visit but the others had resolved. 
There were no additional serious laboratory AEs reported. 
Laboratory findings 
The review of all laboratory values out of normal limits and changes from baseline did not add to the 
information provided above on laboratory abnormalities that were reported as AEs. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Cohort I, there were no clinical AEs that led to discontinuation of study therapy. In Cohort II, one 
infant had a clinical SAE of Grade 3 weight decreased (see above) that led to discontinuation of study 
therapy on day 31. This infant had vomiting reported on day 7. Grade 1 jaundice was reported on days 
8 through 29 with the laboratory AE of Grade 4 blood bilirubin increased reported on day 16. Grade 2 
weight decreased was reported on days 16 through 29 and Grade 3 weight decreased was reported on 
days 29 through 86. After discontinuing study therapy, the infant was diagnosed with malnutrition 
(Grade 4) and failure to thrive (Grade 3) on day 53 and with GERD on day 80. These AEs resolved and 
none was drug-related.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data to support neonatal use are limited to 26 neonates/infants who received 1-43 (mean 38 
days) raltegravir in Cohort II plus 16 neonates who received 2 separated single doses in Cohort I. The 
safety data should also be viewed against the background variable PMTCT regimens and the lack of a 
placebo control group. There were no drug-related clinical AEs and few drug-related laboratory AEs. There 
is a theoretical risk that raltegravir could exacerbate neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and appropriate 
wording is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There are no new major concerns arising from the safety data reported from study P080. All adverse drug 
reactions are included in section 4.8. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

A statement on the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been 
submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
Raltegravir was shown to be effective for the treatment of HIV-1 in adults. Subject to identification of 
suitable dose regimens for children it could be expected that raltegravir would contribute to the overall 
efficacy of a regimen to the same extent as observed in adults. In this regard, it is relevant to note that 
the virological responses observed in study 022, including the two youngest age groups (Cohorts IV and 
V), were in line with data obtained in treatment-experienced adults. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study 080 did not enrol HIV-1-infected neonates and P022 was not designed to provide definitive efficacy 
data. The expectation of efficacy is based on pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that age and weight-
specific dose regimens maintain plasma levels above the target Ctrough derived from study 071 in adults. 
The actual data and the predicted values in P080 indicate that most neonates should achieve and 
maintain values above the target Ctrough criterion subject to adequate adherence.  
It seems there is very considerable inter-individual variation and it may not be possible to overcome the 
impact of variable and rapidly changing raltegravir clearance in the first month of life. The CHMP accepted 
that the overall proposed regimen is likely to be the best that may be achieved whilst still being practical. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
At present the data suggest a comparable safety profile in children aged < 2 years as has been observed 
in older children, adolescents and adults. There are no new concerns raised. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The numbers of subjects aged < 18 years exposed to raltegravir are very limited and the duration of 
reporting is relatively short for the subjects aged < 2 years. There were only 26 neonates exposed to 
multiple dosing in P080 and there is no control group that received PMTCT alone. The longer-term data 
from the older children in P022 do not currently suggest the onset of new AEs emerging with time but the 
maximum duration of dosing in P080 was 6 weeks because none of the neonates enrolled was found to 
have acquired HIV. 
3.5.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.5.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects for raltegravir use in infants have not been directly studied but the PK data 
suggest that adequate trough concentrations are likely to be reached in the majority to infer that 
raltegravir will contribute when used as part of an appropriate treatment regimen in this age group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/163887/2018 
Page 61/62 
 
  
  
 
There is no indication of any new or special concerns pertinent to use of raltegravir in neonates but the 
data are very limited and a possible increase in hyperbilirubinaemia cannot be dismissed. 
3.5.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance for use of raltegravir in neonates is favourable and the proposed dose regimens 
are considered adequate for the small population that could benefit in the EU.   
3.6.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Isentress is positive.

on safety and PK data from one pivotal Phase 1 study, IMPAACT P1110 (Protocol 080), in a total of 42 
HIV-1 exposed full-term infants (defined as ≥37 weeks gestational age and ≥2000 g), who received 
either 2 single doses of oral suspension, within 48 hours of birth and Day 7-10 of age (Cohort I), or a 
multiple-dose regimen of raltegravir over the first 6 weeks of age (Cohort II). As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. Further, the suspension volume has been updated from 5 mL to 10 mL for a final suspension 
concentration of 10 mg/mL to facilitate accurate measurement of the smaller doses required for 
neonates. As a consequence, the 5 mL syringe previously supplied  in the presentation for granules for 
oral suspension is replaced with 3 new oral dosing syringes of various sizes (1 mL, 3 mL, and 10 mL), 
from a different (new) supplier. As a consequence, sections 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated 
and the labelling and instructions for use in the Package Leaflet and the Annex A have been updated 
accordingly. An updated RMP version 14.0 was agreed during the procedure. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0155/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

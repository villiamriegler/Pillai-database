Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH submitted a clinical study report on the paediatric Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Study 
MI0-240 (R&D/11/1153) and the pharmacokinetic report of the same study (R&D/I0/1036).  
2. Clinical study 
Study M10-240: A Multicenter, Open-label Study of the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics 
of the Human Anti- TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab in Children With Polyarticular 
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis 
  Description 
Study M10-240 was a single-arm, open-label safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous adalimumab 20 mg or 40 mg every other 
week (eow), dependent on body weight below or above/equal to 30 kg (20 mg adalimumab eow 
in subjects weighing < 30 kg or 40 mg adalimumab eow in subjects weighing ≥ 30 kg), in 
Japanese paediatric subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 (inclusive) years with active 
polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. In addition the study was designed to confirm the 
similarity between the data obtained from this study and those from study DE038 conducted in 
Western subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study drug administration was to be 
completed on the approval day, and the study was to be completed after 70 days follow-up 
period. 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics 
including immunogenicity (measured as anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) of fixed dose 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab eow in Japanese subjects with polyarticular JRA. The secondary objective of this 
study was to confirm the similarity between the data obtained from this study and those from 
study DE038 conducted in western subjects with JRA. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Subjects were enrolled who could not control disease activity by conventional therapy including 
methotrexate (MTX) or lost response/were intolerant to conventional therapy Active disease was 
defined as ≥ 5 swollen joints (not due to deformity) and ≥ 3 joints with limitation of passive 
motion (LOM) with pain by passive motion or/and pain by pressure (tenderness). Planned 
number of subjects was MTX 20, non-MTX 5, total 25. 
  Treatments 
Subjects weighing less than 30 kg were to be injected with 20 mg of adalimumab every other 
week (eow). Subjects weighing 30 kg or more were to be injected with 40 mg of adalimumab 
eow. Adalimumab dose was not changed from Day1 to Week 14 regardless of body weight gain 
or loss. After Week 16, it was to be administered, based on body weight measured at Week 16 
and every 12 weeks. 
Study drug was to be administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, upper arms, or thighs.  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary variable: ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 16 
Secondary variables: 
1. ACR Pedi 50, ACR Pedi 70 and ACR Pedi 90 response rates at Week 16, and ACR Pedi 30, 
ACR Pedi 50, ACR Pedi 70 and ACR Pedi 90 response rates at Week 2, 4, 8, 24 and every 12 
weeks after Week 24. 
2. Tender Joint Count (TJC) 
3. Swollen Joint Count (SJC) 
4. Pain on Passive Motion Joint Count (POM) 
5. Limitation of Passive Motion Joint Count (LOM) 
6. Active Joint Count (AJC) 
7. CRP 
8. CHAQ 
ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 16 in study M10-240 was to be compared to that in open-
label lead-in phase of study DE038 (detailed results were reported in 24-week CSR 
[R&D/10/099]). 
The primary efficacy variable was to be evaluated at Week 16, and the study data for 24 weeks 
was to be summarized to apply the approval from MHLW. 
  Pharmacokinetic sampling 
Blood samples for serum adalimumab and AAA analysis were to be collected at Baseline, Week 
2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 60. 
  Analytical methods 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adalimumab serum samples were analyzed using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) method.  
Samples for anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) were analyzed using a validated ELISA method.  
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed  
25 subjects in total (MTX: 20 subjects, non-MTX: 5 subjects) were enrolled to the study and 
received treatment with the study drug. Twenty-four subjects (MTX: 19 subjects, non-MTX: 5 
subjects) completed Week 24. 
  Baseline data 
The majority of subjects were female (80%). The mean age in total was 13 years (range: 7 - 17 
years), and 3 (12%) subjects were 4 to 8 years, 9 (36%) subjects were 9 to 12 years, and 13 
(52%) subjects were 13 to 17 years. The mean duration of JRA was 4.7 years, and the majority 
of subjects (96%, 24/25 subjects) had polyarticular JRA. 
CHMP’s comment: It is unclear what disease the 25th subject had. However, this does not 
change the assessment of the report. 
  Efficacy results 
Efficacy analyses were performed in the Full-Analysis-Set (FAS) population (MTX: 20 subjects, 
non-MTX: 5 subjects, Total: 25 subjects). Because no major protocol deviation was observed 
and the Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was same as the FAS, the PPS population was not used for any 
analyses. Safety analyses (25 subjects) were performed in the Safety Analysis Set which was 
the same as the FAS. 
The primary efficacy variable; ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 16 was 90% (18/20) in the 
MTX stratum, 100% (5/5) in the non-MTX stratum, and 92% (23/25) in the total population. 
In the MTX stratum, the improvements in ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70 
response rates seen at Week 24 were maintained until study completion. In addition, further 
improvement in ACR Pedi 90 response rate was observed after Week 24 and maintained 
throughout. In the non-MTX stratum, the improvements in ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, ACR Pedi 
70, and ACR Pedi 90 response rates seen at Week 24 were maintained until study completion.  
  Safety results 
Six subjects (24%) reported 11 SAEs (all subjects were in the MTX stratum). The SAEs were 
pyrexia (2 events), hepatitis B, pharyngitis, pneumonia, dehydration, arthralgia, juvenile arthritis, 
and pharyngolaryngeal pain (1 event, respectively), and herpes zoster and amnesia  were 
reported after Week 60. Four subjects reported 4 serious infectious AEs. Seven SAEs were 
moderate and 4 SAEs were mild in severity. Seven SAEs were assessed as at least “possibly 
related” to the study drug, and 6 of them were moderate in severity. All SAEs were resolved as 
of the final visit with the exception of 2 events (one hepatitis B, one amnesia). One subject (4%) 
reported 1 AE leading to discontinuation of the study drug. Twenty-four subjects (96%) reported 
136 infectious AEs, 3 subjects (12%) reported 3 hepatic related AEs, and 6 subjects (24%) 
reported 8 injection site reaction related AEs. No hepatic related AEs and injection site reaction 
related AEs were reported after Week 60. No deaths, malignant AEs, opportunistic infection 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related AEs excluding TB, congestive heart failure related AEs, demyelinating disease related 
AEs, allergic reaction related AEs, Lupus-like syndrome AEs, and hematologic related AEs were 
reported. 
No clinically significant changes were observed in laboratory parameters and vital signs through 
Week 60. There were 20/25 subjects (80%) who switched to self-injection. There were no safety 
concerns in administering the study drug by self-injection. 
  Pharmacokinetic results 
Adalimumab serum concentrations  
Out of 25 subjects (age 7 to 17 years) enrolled in Study M10-240, 8 subjects were in the 
20 mg eow treatment with body weight < 30 kg at Baseline. Two subjects had body weight 
increased to ≥ 30 kg at Week 16. Therefore, their dose was increased to 40 mg eow starting at 
Week 16. After Week 24, two additional subjects had dose increase from 20 mg eow to 40 mg 
eow due to body weight increase.  
Summary statistics for serum adalimumab concentrations from Japanese JRA subjects 
stratified by concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) and adalimumab doses in Study M10-240 
are presented in the table below:  
^ Since there were only 2 subjects, summary calculations presented as Mean (individual results), Nnmiss. 
* Two subjects had body weight increase form < 30 kg to ≥ 30 kg at Week 16. Their dose was increased from 20 mg eow to 40 mg 
eow. 
$ Two subject had dose increase from 20 mg eow to 40 mg eow at Week 48 and Week 36 due to body weight increase, respectively. 
One of the objectives of this study was to compare adalimumab serum concentrations observed 
at Week 36 and 48 to those reported in the Western juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) study 
(DE038). No data were available at Week 60 in Study DE038. In the Western study body size-
adjusted doses were used (24 mg/m2) with a maximum of 40 mg. The doses administered in the 
Western study range from 10 to 40 mg. The age range in this study was 4 to 17 years of age.  
A comparison of mean serum adalimumab concentrations (μg/ml) observed in the two studies is 
shown in the table below. Only data for subjects with concomitant MTX are shown as the 
number of subjects without MTX was very small in the Japanese study and a comparison is 
therefore difficult to make.

CHMP’s comment: The comparison of PK in Japanese and Western paediatric subjects should 
be made with some caution as different doses were used and as it is a between-study 
comparison. In addition, the data from the Japanese study is very limited. Nevertheless, the data 
do not indicate substantial differences.  
It is agreed that the new pharmacokinetic data do not warrant further regulatory action.  
Anti-adalimumab antibodies 
At Week 60 AAA positive rates were generally lower for subjects on adalimumab with 
concomitant MTX than for subjects on adalimumab mono-therapy. The number of AAA positive 
subjects in this study was too small to make definitive conclusion on the impact of 
immunogenicity on efficacy or safety. 
3. Summary of MAH´s Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of study M10-240 demonstrated that adalimumab was effective in reducing disease 
activity in Japanese subjects with JRA. Adalimumab treatment with 20 mg  or 40 mg eow was 
generally safe and well tolerated in Japanese patients with JIA. The adverse event profile and 
frequency of AEs reported in this study were consistent with previous clinical studies of 
adalimumab (patients with RA, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis) 
conducted in Japan. No new safety signals were observed. 
III. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The MAH submitted a clinical study report on a study performed in Japanese paediatric 
subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 (inclusive) years with active polyarticular Juvenile 
Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the pharmacokinetic report of the same study. The open label 
study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous adalimumab and 
to confirm the similarity between the data obtained from this study and those from study 
DE038 conducted in Western subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).  
The MAH concluded that the results of the study demonstrate that adalimumab treatment 
was generally safe and well tolerated in Japanese patients with JIA, and that they do not 
influence the benefit risk for Humira. 
The conclusion of the MAH is endorsed, although it is not possible to assess efficacy by 
this study design. No consequential regulatory action is needed. 
  Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –   No further action required

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers. An estimated 85294 people will 
be diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 in the EU, and approximately 16630 people are expected to die 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015

of the disease annually1. The survival for stage IV melanoma patients has been historically poor, with a 
5 year survival rate of approximately 10% and a median survival of 6-10 months2. 
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (i.e., the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway) is a 
critical pathway involved in the proliferation of normal cells as well as in many human cancers. The 
pathway affects many cancers, in particular melanoma where approximately 50% of cutaneous 
malignant melanomas have specific mutations of the BRAF-oncogene which constitutively activate 
MEK 3 . The BRAF mutation most frequently found in melanoma was shown to be V600 (74-90%)4. This 
oncogenic mutation at the V600 site in BRAF leads to constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
pathway. 
There are currently two small molecule inhibitors of BRAFV600, vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and dabrafenib 
(Tafinlar), and one small molecule inhibitor of MEK, trametinib (Mekinist) that have been approved as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that 
harbour the BRAF V600 mutation. More recently, the combination of trametinib (Mekinist) and 
dabrafenib (Tafinlar) has been authorised in the same indication. 
The approval of vemurafenib was based on a pivotal phase III study (BRIM3) which demonstrated 
clinical benefit with regard to overall survival (OS) (HR=0.37; p<0.001) and progression free survival 
(PFS) (HR=0.26; p<0.001) as compared with DTIC in patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF 
V600E mutation5.  
The approval of dabrafenib was based on the pivotal phase III BRF113683 study in which the efficacy 
and safety of dabrafenib was compared with DTIC. In this study, a statistically significant improvement 
in PFS (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.24, 0.58; p<0.0001) was seen where median PFS for dabrafenib was 6.9 
months compared to 2.7 months with DTIC. The median OS for dabrafenib was 20.0 months in 
comparison to 15.6 months for DTIC (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.52, 1.13). 
The pivotal study for the approval of trametinib was a phase III study MEK114267 where the median 
PFS was 4.8 months for patients treated with trametinib and 1.5 months for patients treated with 
chemotherapy (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.33, 0.63; p<0.0001). The median OS was 15.6 and 11.3 months 
for patients in the trametinib and chemotherapy arms respectively (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.57,1.06).  
Other treatment options have been approved for melanoma in recent times, namely treatments that 
target the immune system instead of targeting the cancer itself. In 2011, the anti-CTLA-4 antibody 
ipilimumab (Yervoy) was approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma in adults. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen CTLA-4, has demonstrated a significant improvement (hazard ratio [HR]=0.68, p<0.001) in 
overall survival (OS) compared with gp100 peptide vaccine in previously treated patients with 
metastatic melanoma6. More recently, additional immunotherapeutic options available include the 
monoclonal antibodies nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
As observed in the pivotal studies, the clinical benefit of monotherapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
appears to be limited by the development of resistance, with approximately 50% of the patients 
treated with BRAF inhibitors progress within 5 to 7 months after starting treatment and the vast 
majority of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma eventually will die from the disease in in less than 
18 months5, 7, 8 , 9, 10.  Although several mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
that have been proposed11, 12, the main pathway for resistance is thought to be the reactivation of the 
MAPK pathway through alternative activation of downstream MEK13, 14 . Thus, cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib combination would inhibit the same pathway but at different levels, MEK and BRAF, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 10/139 
 
 
 
 
 
provide concomitant inhibition of the same pathway. It is suggested that inhibiting both MEK and BRAF 
simultaneously could postpone or possibly prevent the development of resistance15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  
Cobimetinib is a reversible, selective, allosteric, oral inhibitor that blocks the mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPK) pathway by targeting the mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 
(MEK) 1 and MEK 2 which results in inhibition of phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related 
kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2. Therefore, cobimetinib blocks the cell proliferation induced by the MAPK 
pathway through inhibition of the MEK1/2 signalling node. 
In the preclinical models, the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib showed that by 
simultaneously targeting mutated BRAF V600 proteins and MEK proteins in melanoma cells, the 
combination of the two products inhibits MAPK pathway reactivation through MEK1/2, resulting in a 
stronger inhibition of intracellular signalling and decreased tumour cell proliferation  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Cobimetinib is indicated for use in combination with Zelboraf (vemurafenib) for the treatment of adult 
patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma (see section 5.1). 
The final approved indication is as follows: 
Cotellic is indicated for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Treatment with Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib should only be initiated and supervised by a 
qualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.  
Before starting this treatment, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma tumour 
status confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Posology 
The recommended dose of Cotellic is 60 mg (3 tablets of 20 mg) once daily.  
Cotellic is taken on a 28 day cycle. Each dose consists of three 20 mg tablets (60 mg) and should be 
taken once daily for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to 21-treatment period); followed by a 7-day break 
(Days 22 to 28-treatment break). Each subsequent Cotellic treatment cycle should start after the 7-
day treatment break has elapsed (SmPC section 4.2).  
For information on the posology of vemurafenib, please refer to its SmPC. 
Treatment with Cotellic should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or until the 
development of unacceptable toxicity. If a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 12 hours prior to the 
next dose to maintain the once-daily regimen. In case of vomiting after administration of Cotellic, the 
patient should not take an additional dose on that day and treatment should be continued as 
prescribed the following day (SmPC section 4.2).  
Cotellic is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. They can be taken with or 
without food (SmPC section 4.2).

Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 11/139 
 
 
 
 
 
Other ingredients are for tablet core: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose (E460), 
croscarmellose sodium (E468), magnesium stearate (E470b) and for film coating: polyvinyl alcohol, 
titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 3350, talc (E553b). 
The product is available in transparent PVC/PVDC blisters containing 21 tablets as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cobimetinib hemifumarate is (S)-[3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-
iodophenylamino)phenyl] [3-hydroxy-3-(piperidin-2-yl)azetidin-1-yl]methanone hemifumarate and it 
has the following structure: 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white solid. The solubility is high over the pH 
range 1 to 7.5.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is sourced from one supplier involving two manufacturing sites.  
The active substance is synthesized in seven steps with a telescoped part of five non-isolated steps. 
The last step is salt formation.  An optional re-working procedure is described and is considered 
acceptable. The synthesis uses commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The active substance has one chiral centre which has the (S)-configuration. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled by the manufacturing process and starting material specifications. In 
addition enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC control in the active substance 
specifications. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The same synthetic route has been used throughout the development from toxicological studies to the 
commercial batches. Changes introduced during development of active substance manufacturing 
process have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The development of the 
manufacturing process is based on the combination of a traditional and enhanced approach (ICHQ11, 
ICHQ8, ICHQ9). 
The active substance Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) are 
described.  
Moreover, critical material attributes have been defined for starting material and intermediates. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DoE) studies. Based on these 
studies, proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for several steps of the manufacturing 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 12/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and 
batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. Confirmation is 
provided that no design space is claimed. 
The chemical structure of cobimetinib is confirmed by using elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, 
NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C & 13C solid-state), mass spectrometry, single crystal X-ray diffraction and 
UV spectroscopy. Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Cobimetinib exists in two 
solid forms. The same polymorphic form is consistently produced by the manufacturing process. 
Polymorphic form of the active substance is also controlled in the active substance specifications. A 
comprehensive list of impurities that may arise from the synthesis (starting materials, solvents, 
reagents, intermediates, by-products, genotoxic impurities) or from degradation is discussed. The 
characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
The active substance is packaged in closed, double low-density polyethylene bags within a closed steel 
drum. The low-density polyethylene bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
fumaric acid content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric content (HPLC), genotoxic impurities 
(GC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (USP), palladium (USP), particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction), residue on ignition (USP) and polymorphic form (X-ray powder 
diffraction). 
The control strategy for genotoxic impurities was discussed in a recent scientific advice, 
EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/210707/2014, and the applicant has followed the advice. The control strategy is 
thus considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on ten pilot scale batches of active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided on five batches of active substance (three primary stability batches, 
including one production scale batch, and two supportive stability batches) manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturer according to earlier development manufacturing process. The differences 
between the manufacturing process for the three primary stability batches and that of the commercial 
manufacturing process are considered not to be relevant in terms of potential impact on the stability 
profile. Stability batches were stored in the intended commercial package for up 24 to months under 
long term conditions at 30 °C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance; water content; assay; impurities; enantiomeric 
purity; particle size; polymorphic form. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
are stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Forced degradation 
studies have also been performed. Results demonstrate that the active substance in the solid state is 
not sensitive to light, elevated temperature or humidity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 13/139 
 
 
 
 
 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months below 30 °C in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate-release film-coated tablet 
containing cobimetinib. 
The composition of the finished product is provided. 
The pharmaceutical development includes elements of science and risk-based approaches such as 
described in ICH Q8(R2) and ICH Q9. 
A QTPP was established which forms the basis for the finished product development. CQAs were 
identified. Finished product CQAs are appearance, cobimetinib content, degradation products, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial limits. 
The hemifumarate salt of cobimetinib was selected since it exists in only one crystalline form with a 
high melting point and low hygroscopicity. Conversion to the amorphous state during tablet production 
is very unlikely due to the high melting point. 
Appropriate active substance particle size distribution criteria are defined to ensure satisfactory 
finished product processability and performance. 
A number of standard excipients were examined for their compatibility with the active substance by 
testing binary mixtures of active substance and excipient in accelerated/stressed stability studies. 
Suitable excipients were further investigated for compatibility between excipients themselves. All 
excipients selected are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The amount of 
each excipient is justified as well. 
An assessment of the benefits of dry and wet granulation was made initially and due to the simplicity 
of the process (reduced number of unit operations), dry granulation by roller compaction was chosen 
for development. 
The formulation development used risk assessment and DoE studies to find an appropriate phase III 
and commercial formulation.  
Two tablet formulations have been used during clinical development. The proposed commercial 
formulation was already used for phase III studies. Based on bioequivalence studies against the phase 
I formulation bridging between the prototype and the commercial tablet can be accepted. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and DoE studies. A risk analysis was performed using 
the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process 
parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The critical process 
parameters have been adequately identified.  
Description of the development of the dissolution method is provided. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method developed for quality control has been demonstrated. However, based on the high 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 14/139 
 
 
 
 
 
solubility of the active substance and rapid dissolution, a correlation with in vivo exposure is not 
possible. 
The primary packaging is a transparent PVC/PVDC blister. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending, screening, dry-granulation (roller 
compaction), tablet compression, film-coating, packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on seven batches including three 
production scale batches produced at the proposed manufacturing site. It has been demonstrated that 
the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. PARs have been defined for several steps of the medicinal product manufacture. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
Formal validation will be performed post-approval on commercial batches. An acceptable validation 
plan has been presented. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (USP, Ph. Eur.). 
The absence of tests for water content has been acceptably justified by the applicant. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several batches including fourteen production scale batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 11 batches of finished product (six primary stability batches, including 
two production scale batches, and five supportive stability batches) stored under long term conditions 
for up to 24 months at 30 °C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C / 
75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those 
proposed for marketing and 3 stability batches were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Differences between stability batches and commercial batches are the debossing which is 
not considered likely to impact the stability profile. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbial quality. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. In addition, 
water content, hardness, disintegration time, chiral purity, water activity and friability were monitored 
for better characterization of the finished product stability. A limit test is used for chiral purity and the 
method description has been provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 15/139 
 
 
 
 
 
All parameters remained within specification during the stability testing at all storage conditions. No 
significant changes have been observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Results demonstrated that the finished product is not light 
sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing the new active substance 
cobimetinib hemifumarate. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active 
substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied 
QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for several steps of the active 
substance manufacture and the medicinal product manufacture. However, no design spaces were 
claimed. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical pharmacology, ADME/PK, and toxicology studies submitted were performed in a variety of 
species. These include mouse, rats and dogs. Pharmacology studies to evaluate the effect of 
cobimetinib on cancer cells included in vitro biochemical and anti-proliferative studies and in vivo in 
mouse xenograph models. PK studies were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed in vitro in hERG cells and in vivo in rats and dogs. 
Toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs.

Primary and secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not performed under GLP as well as for the 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. However, safety pharmacology studies genotoxicity, 
embryo-foetal development, juvenile studies, local tolerance study and the phototoxicity studies were 
performed under GLP.  There was no indication of the GLP status of the absorption studies. Single-dose 
toxicity studies included GLP and non-GLP studies. Non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were non-
GLP, whereas pivotal studies were GLP.

The apoptotic activity of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib was evaluated in the parental 
cell line (A375) and one vemurafenib-resistant cell line (A375R1) using the Annexin V/7-AAD assay 48 
and 72 hours after treatment with cobimetinib (GDC-0973) and vemurafenib (RO5185426). The results 
are presented in Figure 1 and show that the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was able to 
overcome the resistance observed with either of the compounds alone.

The pharmacodynamic and phenotypic effects of cobimetinib and vemurafenib were tested in A375 
BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines (Figure 2). The results showed that the combination of vemurafenib and 
cobimetinib inhibited pERK as well as cyclin D1 but increased expression of the BH3-only protein Bcl-2 
interacting mediator of cell death, which promotes apoptosis.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Cobimetinib was evaluated for potential adverse effects on neurobehavioral, cardiovascular, and 
respiratory system functions in safety pharmacology studies conducted in compliance with GLP 
regulations. Cobimetinib was also evaluated in studies for the effects on hERG channel activity (GLP) in 
vitro and for inhibitory potential of a broad class of pharmacologically active receptors, enzymes, and 
channels in vitro (non-GLP). The results are presented in Table 4.

In the eye uveal tract, the highest concentration was observed at 8 hours postdose (39500 ng 
equivalents/g). By the final sampling time of 672 hours postdose, the uveal tract concentration had 
declined to 4460 ng equivalents/g. The radioactivity concentration in eye uveal tract at 672 hours 
postdose represented an approximately 9-fold decrease in radioactivity concentration from the 
observed peak concentration at 8 hours postdose. The highest concentrations in pigmented skin and 
non-pigmented skin (5200 and 4440 ng equivalents 14C-GDC-0973/g, respectively) were observed at 
4 hours postdose. The radioactivity concentrations in pigmented skin generally declined and dropped to 
a concentration of 501 ng equivalents/g at 672 hours postdose. The radioactivity concentrations in 
non-pigmented skin generally declined and dropped to non-detectable levels (ND) by 72 hours 
postdose.

Excretion 
Excretion Mass Balance and Pharmacokinetics of Radioactivity Following a Single Oral Dose 
of [14C]GDC-0973 to Male and Female Sprague Dawley Rats (Study 09-0344) 
There were four groups of male and female Sprague Dawley rats. All groups were administered a 
single oral dose of [14C]GDC-0973. Group 1 consisted of 3 male and 3 female rats, and was used for 
evaluation of excretion mass balance. Group 2 was comprised of 3 male and 3 female bile duct 
cannulated (BDC) rats, and was used to characterize the excretion of radioactivity in bile, urine, and 
faeces. Group 3 consisted of 3 male and 3 female rats in which the pharmacokinetics of plasma total 
radioactivity was evaluated. The results are presented in Table 12.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The toxicity of single administration and repeat dose administration of cobimetinib was investigated in 
the rat and dog species. Genotoxicity was investigated using the general battery of tests. Reproductive 
and developmental toxicity was investigated by oral gavage in rats and in a 28-day juvenile rat study. 
Local tolerance was investigated in rats and phototoxicity was investigated in vitro using 3T3 mouse 
fibroblasts and in vivo in a single dose study in rats.

Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit studies on carcinogenicity (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
The data show that cobimetinib induces degenerative changes in the reproductive organs on rats and 
dogs. In single-dose toxicity studies, increased apoptosis/necrosis was present in rats (300 mg/kg: 
corpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epididymal, and vaginal epithelial cells) and dogs (30 and 60 
mg/kg: epididymal epithelial cells) euthanized in moribund condition on Days 2 and 3. In repeat-dose 
studies, increased corporeal apoptosis/necrosis and mineralization of the corpora lutea and larger 
follicular cysts were present in rats at the non-tolerated 10-mg/kg/day dose. The findings were present 
at non-tolerated dose levels (300 mg/kg in rat, 30/60 mg/kg in dog and ≥10 mg/kg/day in rat). The 
findings in rats dosed 10 mg/kg/day (0.7 times clinical exposure) were fully recovered after 28 days.  
Embryofoetal development 
Pregnant female rats (10 animals/group) were administered daily oral doses of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg cobimetinib or vehicle alone on day of gestation (DG) 7 through 17. The findings of the study 
are presented in Table 18.

Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are evaluated were performed.  The study was to 
evaluate the potential toxicity and determine the toxicokinetic profile of cobimetinib on juvenile rats 
when administered once daily via oral gavage beginning on Postnatal Day 10 (PND10 or Study Day 1) 
and continuing for 28 days.

following administration of the vehicle or cobimetinib. 
Other toxicity studies 
In vitro phototoxicity studies 
Cobimetinib absorbed UV light significantly between 300 and 400 nm.  Therefore, cobimetinib was 
assessed for possible phototoxic potential in vitro by the 3T3 mouse fibroblast neutral red uptake assay 
and in vivo by a phototoxicity study in pigmented rats.

Based on the data provided by the applicant for phase I and II studies, cobimetinib is not a PBT 
substance. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cobimetinib has demonstrated selectivity for MEK1/2 in in vitro and in vivo models. Cobimetinib 
inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the proliferation and induction of apoptosis in BRAF-
mutant melanoma cell lines. This was also shown in cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. 
Therefore, the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib appears to have a more profound effect on 
inhibiting the MAPK pathway and tumour growth in vivo than either compound alone. 
Pharmacology and toxicology studies were carried out with cobimetinib HCL or hemifumarate salts by 
the oral route of administration as this is the proposed therapeutic route in humans. The animal 
species and strains used in these investigations are considered adequate based on the similarities in 
the pharmacokinetic and metabolic handling of cobimetinib between the selected species and human.  
Cobimetinib was characterized by low to moderate CL and moderate to high volumes of distribution in 
animals. Cobimetinib was well absorbed in rat and dog. Of the cobimetinib-related radioactivity in 
plasma of rat and dog the major circulating exposure was from unchanged cobimetinib. The 
metabolism of cobimetinib was extensive with less than 10% of the dose excreted as unchanged 
cobimetinib in urine, feces, or bile. Biliary excretion of cobimetinib-related metabolites into feces was 
the major pathway for cobimetinib elimination. 
In both rat and dog cobimetinib induced death a mid- and high doses. Major clinical target organs were 
hematopoiesis, liver, skin, GI, coagulation, lymphopoiesis and phosphorus metabolism. Microscopic 
degenerative, necrotic, and/or apoptotic changes were found in high dose animals in the liver, kidney, 
gastrointestinal tract tissues, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, reproductive tract tissues (ovary, 
seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vagina), and adrenal cortex. The nonclinical toxicology findings 
associated with cobimetinib administration to rats and dogs were consistent with pharmacologically 
mediated changes as a result of MEK1/MEK2 inhibition and disruption of MAPK signalling pathways. 
Toxicity in the GI tract lead to decreased food consumption and body weight, emesis, mucoid 
discoloured faeces and hypoactivity. Thus, diarrhoea has been included as an important identified risk 
in the RMP and will be managed through routine pharmacovigilance. The toxicokinetic data from the 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed under sub-clinical exposure in animals dosed for 
the full length of the study in order to be able to acquire safety for the required 4-week and 13-week 
studies. This is considered acceptable considering the high toxicity and mortality rate observed at 
clinical exposure although very little information on the toxicity of cobimetinib after long-term 
treatment can be derived from these studies.  As a consequence, the NOEAL in the pivotal toxicity 
studies at sub-clinical exposures were 0.05/0.15 times the clinical exposure in the rat 4 week and 13 
week studies, respectively. In dog the same exposures were 1/0.1 times the clinical exposure in the 4 
week and 13 week studies, respectively.  
Toxicity studies in rats and dogs identified generally reversible degenerative changes in the bone 
marrow, gastrointestinal tract, skin, thymus, adrenal gland, liver, spleen, lymph node, kidney, heart, 
ovary, and vagina at plasma exposures below clinical efficacious levels.  Dose limiting toxicities 
included skin ulcerations, surface exudates, and acanthosis in the rat and chronic active inflammation 
and degeneration of the oesophagus associated with varying degrees of gastroenteropathy in dogs 
(SmPC section 5.3).

In a repeat dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, cobimetinib systemic exposures were 2 to 11 fold 
higher on post-natal day 10 than on post-natal day 38 when exposures were similar to those in adult 
rats. In juvenile rats, cobimetinib administration resulted in similar changes as seen in the pivotal 
toxicity studies in adults, including reversible degenerative changes in the thymus and liver, decreased 
spleen and thyroid/parathyroid weights, increased phosphorus, bilirubin and red cell mass and 
decreased triglycerides. Mortality occurred in juvenile animals at a dose (3 mg/kg) which did not lead 
to mortalities in adult animals (SmPC section 5.3) 
Based on the in vitro data hERG assay, cobimetinib appeared to increase the potency of vemurafenib. 
However, the in vivo ECG study in dogs with cobimetinib did not show any effect. It is noteworthy that 
the study was undertaken at lower than clinical exposures and is therefore of limited value. 
Cardiovascular safety of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib has not been evaluated in vivo. 
In vitro, cobimetinib produced moderate hERG ion channel inhibition (IC50꞊ 0.5 µM [266 ng/mL]), 
which is approximately 18 fold higher than peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) at the 60 mg to be 
marketed dose (unbound Cmax꞊14 ng/mL [0.03 µM]) (SmPC section 5.3).  
Cobimetinib was found to be non-mutagenic when tested in bacterial cell (Ames) assay, human 
lymphoma assay or rat micronucleus test. The lack of dedicated carcinogenicity studies is acceptable in 
accordance with the ICH S9 guide line.  Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with 
cobimetinib. Standard genotoxicity studies with cobimetinib were negative (SmPC section 5.3). 
The applicant did not submit dedicated fertility and early embryonic development studies. This is 
acceptable in accordance with the ICH S9 guideline.  No dedicated fertility studies in animals have 
been performed with cobimetinib. In the repeat-dose toxicology studies, degenerative changes were 
observed in reproductive tissues including increased apoptosis/necrosis of corpora lutea and seminal 
vesicle, epididymal and vaginal epithelial cells in rats, and epididymal epithelial cells in dogs. The 
clinical relevance of this is unknown (SmPC section 5.3). The findings were present in rat at sub-
clinical exposure levels (0.7 times clinical exposure). The findings were reversible after recovery. Thus, 
impaired female fertility has been included in the RMP as an important identified risk and will be 
managed through routine pharmacovigilance (SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3).   Reproduction toxicity was 
evaluated in a study in rat in the high dose group (10 mg/kg/day) dams which showed severe clinical 
conditions in terms of body weight gain and food consumption. Foetuses from these dams also showed 
malformations of the great vessels and skull. The high dose was equivalent to a 1.4-times the clinical 
exposure. Thus, it can be concluded that cobimetinib is teratogenic at clinically relevant levels. When 
administered to pregnant rats, cobimetinib caused embryolethality and foetal malformations of the 
great vessels and skull at systemic exposures similar to human exposure at recommended dose (SmPC 
section 5.3).  Therefore, the risk of teratogenicity and developmental toxicity has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
Cobimetinib did not induce local toxicity at the injection site in the rat study. However, clinical data 
show that many patients experience skin toxicities, especially phototoxicity. Cobimetinib treated UV-
exposed rats did not show signs of increased skin/eye toxicity compared to vehicle treated animals. 
The exposures in the high dose group were about 7 times the clinical exposure.  Nevertheless, 
although no evidence was observed in the non-clinical studies, based on clinical safety data 
photosensitivity was included as an important identified risk (SmPC section 4.2 and 4.8). 
The batches used during pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies show a high degree of purity and no 
impurity were above the 0.15% qualification level. All specified impurities are set below the 0.15% 
qualification level.  
Cobimetinib is not a PBT substance and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for cobimetinib in 
combination with vemurafenib were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of the 
non-clinical aspects. Cobimetinib is considered to have teratogenic potential with developmental 
toxicity for the foetus. This potential risk is being managed through routine pharmacovigilance.

Absorption  
Cobimetinib is characterised as highly soluble and moderate to highly permeable compound and is a 
Pgp, but not a BCRP, substrate. The estimated fraction absorbed is 88% while the absolute 
bioavailability is calculated to be approximately 46% indicating extensive first pass metabolism. A high 
fat meal did not influence the systemic exposure compared to fasted condition. Results are shown in 
Table 25.

The commercial formulation has not been used in the food and DDI studies. Comparable exposure was 
seen between the formulation used in the studies between the prototype tablet and the capsule (AUC 
ratio 105 [90%CI 93-118]) and between the commercial tablet and the capsule (AUC ratio 101 [90%CI 
94-107]). The commercial tablet was used in the pivotal phase 3 study. 
The maximum plasma concentration of cobimetinib, following oral treatment in patients, was reached 
at median a tmax of 2h (range 1-24h), as shown in Table 26.

Distribution 
The in vitro protein binding of cobimetinib was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 1-10 µM (about 
500 – 5500 ng/ml). The mean unbound fraction (fu) was calculated to be 5.8% and was independent of 
the plasma concentration of cobimetinib. The mean fraction cobimetinib bound (fb) to isolated human 
serum albumin (HSA; 40 mg/ml) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG ; 1 mg/ml) was 57.1% and 95.4%, 
respectively, at all concentration tested 1-10 µM. 
The in vitro partitioning of cobimetinib between human blood and plasma was independent of 
concentration, in the concentration range tested 1-10 µM, and was determined to approximately 1 
(0.93-1.05). 
The Vss was calculated to 1050 L following an iv dose of 2mg in the study determining the absolute F of 
cobimetinib.

Elimination 
Cobimetinib has a long half-life, mean of 43.6 h with individual half-lives ranging between 23-70h. 
Once daily dosing resulted in an accumulation of about 2-3 times higher exposure at steady state 
compared to after a single dose. 
The total plasma CL was calculated to 178 ml/min and CLR to 7 ml/min. 
The terminal t1/2 of cobimetinib was calculated to about 60-70h in the bioavailability studies in healthy 
subjects. A shorter t1/2 was determined in patients, approx 50h. Once daily dosing, as proposed the 
dosing regimen, resulted in an accumulation of about 2-3 times higher exposure at steady state 
compared after a single dose. The total plasma CL was calculated to be 178 ml/min and the CLR to 7 
ml/min (Study MEK4952). Results are reported in Table 27.

Metabolism 
The metabolism of cobimetinib by human liver microsomes (HLM) was NADPH dependent. The 
metabolism was CYP450 mediated since incubation with HLM pre-treated with ABT (non-selective 
CYP450 inhibitor) resulted in no metabolism of cobimetinib i.e. 101% of the compound remained 
unchanged compared to 45% when incubated with non-ABT-pre-treated HLM. 
HLM incubations with cobimetinib in the presence and absence of CYP inhibitors showed that 
cobimetinib appeared to be metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5. 
Following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled cobimetinib, the compound was extensively metabolised 
with about 2 and 7% of the dose excreted as parent compound in urine and faeces, respectively. In 
total, approximately 75% of the administered dose was excreted in faeces and about 18% in the urine. 
More than 20 metabolites were identified in faeces, of which four individually accounted for 5-10% of 
the dose given. Three major metabolites, with plasma levels comparable to the exposure of the parent 
compound, were identified following a single oral 14C-labelled dose of cobimetinib. More than 20% of 
the radioactivity in plasma remained unextractable, with the percentage unextracted increasing with 
time. However, no active metabolites have been identified in circulation and two of the 3 circulating 
metabolites were identified as phase-2 metabolites.

In vitro incubations of cobimetinib and human recombinant CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, 3A4 AND 3A5 showed CYP3A to be the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of 
cobimetinib. This was confirmed by an in vivo DDI study where the total exposure of cobimetinib 
increased about 7-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. This 7-fold 
increase in exposure suggests that CYP3A metabolism represents 85% of the total elimination. CYP3A4 
and CYP3A5 were shown to be involved in the metabolism with about 10% and 65% of cobimetinib 
remaining, respectively, after 60-min incubations. Following incubations with CYP2D6 and 2C19, 80 
and 85% of cobimetinib remained, respectively, while after incubations with the others >95% 
remained. 
UGT2B7 was identified as involved in the formation of one of the major metabolites M15.

The formation of M15 (glucuronide) was investigated, using human major recombinant UGT isozymes 
(1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10. 2B4, 2B7, 2B15 and 2B17), showed UGT2B7 to be the 
major UGT involved in the metabolism of cobimetinib. This was also confirmed with HLM incubations 
with cobimetinib in the presence and absence of fluconazole. 
Excretion 
Cobimetinib was not classified as an OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1 substrate in vitro in transporter 
overexpressed CHO cells, respectively. 
The mass-balance of excretion was studied in healthy subjects (n=6) following an oral solution of 
20 mg (200 µCi) cobimetinib in an open non-randomized design. Blood/plasma, urine and faeces 
samples were collected regularly up to 29 days post dose based on exposure, excretion rate and 
recovery of total radioactivity. 
About 60% of the radioactive dose was excreted within the first four days after dosing. The mean total 
recovery of radioactivity was 94(2)% with 18(2)% of the radioactive dose excreted in the urine and 
77(2)% in faeces  (Table 29). The fraction absorbed was estimated to 88% based on the recovery of 
total radioactivity and the excretion of unchanged compound and metabolites in urine and faeces. 
Cobimetinib was extensively metabolised with about 2 and 7% of the dose excreted as parent 
compound in urine and faeces, respectively. The majority of the identified metabolites individually 
accounted for <5% of the administered dose. 
Following the oral dose of 20 mg (200 µCi) cobimetinib in the mass-balance study (GP28369) 18% of 
the dose was excreted in the urine, about 2% was excreted as parent compound. The two main urine 
metabolites were M14 (oxidation) and M15 (glucuronide conjugate) representing about 1 and 2% of 
the dose, respectively. Excreted identified metabolites that individually accounted for <1% but ≥0.5% 
accounted for about 12% of the administered dose. The urinary elimination of cobimetinib in healthy 
subjects, following both an oral dose of 20 mg and an iv dose of 2 mg, was <5%. 
About 77% of the administered dose was excreted in faeces, approximately 7% as parent compound. 
More than 20 metabolites have been identified of which four, M5, M10, M29/M62 and M56 individually 
accounted for 5-10% of the dose given. The average sum of metabolites accounting for ≥2% of the 
administered dose was calculated to 69%.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A dose escalation study to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was performed in patients with 
solid tumours in Study MEK4592. The PK of cobimetinib was dose proportional in the clinical relevant 
dose range i.e. up to 100 mg. The exposure was about 2-3 times higher at steady state compared to a 
single dose (MEK4592, NO25395). The inter-individual variability in total exposure at steady state was 
21-165%. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The comparison of cobimetinib CL/F in patients with different renal functions, defined according to their 
estimated CRCL (Normal: CRCL ≥ 90 mL/min, Mild: CRCL ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min, Moderate: CRCL ≥ 
30 and <60 mL/min, and Severe: CRCL <30 mL/min) is illustrated in Figure 4. There is limited data 
(n=2) in patients with severe renal impairment.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Cobimetinib as inhibitor or inducer of CYP enzymes and transporters 
The PK interaction potential of cobimetinib as perpetrator has been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. 
In vitro cobimetinib showed signals on CYP1A2 and 3A4 induction as well as on inhibition of CYP3A. 
The in vivo DDI study investigating cobimetinib as a CYP3A inhibitor or inducer, did not show any 
differences in systemic exposure of midazolam (CYP3A substrate) when co-administered with 
cobimetinib compared to when dosed alone.  
In vitro cobimetinib was characterized as a CYP2D6 inhibitor, however, in vivo the systemic exposure 
of  dextromethorphan  was  comparable  when  administered  alone  and  when  co-administered  with 
cobimetinib. 
Cobimetinib was characterised as a BCRP inhibitor with an IC50 value of 3 µM and an inhibitor of 
OATP1B1, 1B3 and OCT1 at IC50 values >49 µM. Cobimetinib is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and 
OCT2. Cobimetinib was not classified as a substrate of the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
OCT1. Co-administration with the PPI rabeprazole did not alter the PK of cobimetinib.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Two studies mainly contributed to PD assessment MEK4592g (cobimetinib single agent) and NO25395 
(cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib). 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 46/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 30:  
Studies that contributed to PD assessment 
Evaluations  of  PK/pharmacodynamic  (PD)  relationships  were  conducted  to  quantitatively  understand 
the exposure response (ER) relationship between cobimetinib and molecular biomarkers of drug effects 
(pERK,  pS6,  Ki-67)  and  18F  fluorodeoxyglucose  [FDG]  PET,  QTc  interval  and  efficacy/exposure 
relationship.  
Mechanism of action 
Cobimetinib is an orally available small molecule and selective allosteric inhibitor of the mitogen-
activated protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2, also known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Functional mediation of this pathway is 
dependent upon activity of ERK1/2 that phosphorylate protein targets in the cytoplasm and nucleus 
and thus induce cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, survival and migration. ERK1/2 are the only 
known substrates of MEK1/2, which in turn are inhibited by cobimetinib. 
Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are found in approximately 50% of malignant melanoma tumours and 
result in constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in the absence of typical growth factors 
leading to excessive cell proliferation, and survival3. 
Cobimetinib has shown high inhibitory potency in biochemical and cell based assays, as well as broad 
anti-tumour activity in vivo in xenograft tumour models, including those that are mutated for BRAF and 
KRAS. Of note, cobimetinib has a specific mechanism of binding and inhibition of MEK1/2 21, which is 
suggested to be more effective for targeting BRAFV600-mediated activation of MEK, and less effective 
to mitigate activation of MEK by other mechanisms.  
By simultaneously targeting BRAF and MEK the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib results in 
stronger inhibition of ERK signalling, greater tumour cell apoptosis and enhanced tumour responses in 
pre-clinical models than vemurafenib alone.  
As shown in the efficacy sections below, reversal of pre-formed resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy 
only occurred in a minority of cases, however. Proposed mechanisms for this finding are e.g. re-
activation or re-configuration of MAPK pathway, activation of parallel signalling pathways and/or 
genomic diversification after disease progression on BRAF inhibitor. These mechanisms are consistent 
with currently known main mechanisms of resistance to BRAFi therapy14,22, 23, 24, 25. 
Pharmacodynamic effects on molecular biomarkers  
In 6 patients, the PD effects of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib were assessed at baseline 
and on Cycle 1 Day 14 of combination therapy (steady-state of cobimetinib) based on paired tumour 
biopsies samples from both vemurafenib-PD and BRAFi-naive patients and showed reduction in pERK 
and pS6 levels and reduction in the number of Ki-67 positive tumour nuclei (Figure 5).

In patients who developed lesions presumed or suspected to be SCC or second primary melanomas, 
formalin-fixed tissue embedded in paraffin blocks was collected. Normal skin punch biopsies were 
obtained under local anaesthesia from all patients who developed SCC. FFPE samples from paired 
biopsies of SCC (or suspicious neoplasms) and normal skin were used to perform IHC analyses of 
pathway markers (pERK, pMEK, p53). 
A total of 12 patients experienced SCC of any grade. pERK and potentially pS6 expression was high in 
the cuSCC specimens; Ki67 and p53 expression was low.

In the phase Ib study NO25395, the PD effect of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib was 
assessed by measuring changes in FDG uptake as characterized by the lean body mass corrected 
(LBM) maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) measurement (see Table below).

On average, disease measured at baseline was more FDG-avid in vemurafenib-PD patients compared 
to BRAFi-naive patients. 
QTc Assessment 
The effects on QTc interval were assessed following administration of cobimetinib as monotherapy or in 
combination with vemurafenib in Study MEK4592g (in patients with advanced solid tumours) and in 
Study NO25395 (in patients with advanced BRAF V600-mutated melanoma), respectively. No 
dedicated thorough QTc study has been conducted. A summary of the data is shown in Table 31. 
The number of patients with grade ≥3 QTc prolongation was 3 out of 129 safety evaluable subjects in 
Study NO25395 and 1 vemurafenib-PD patient and 2 BRAFi-naive patients.

Exposure-QTc relationship 
The concentration-response relationship for QTc (C-QTc) interval was assessed on combined data from 
Study MEK4592g and Study NO25395 with the use of the linear mixed-effects modelling approach as 
implemented within the linear mixed-effects function in R Version 2.15.1.  
QTc interval data was available from 57 subjects that received cobimetinib alone (60 mg to 125 mg; 
Study MEK4592g) and 126 subjects that received cobimetinib (60 mg to 100 mg) in combination with 
vemurafenib (720 mg or 960 mg BID; Study NO25395). An interaction between cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib concentrations was tested and was not statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05. 
There was no association between cobimetinib concentrations and ∆QTcF when cobimetinib was 
administered alone in Study MEK4592g (slope, −0.00128 ms per ng/mL). Vemurafenib was found to 
prolong the ∆QTcF interval (slope, 0.207 ms per µg/mL) in BRAFi-naive subjects (see Figure below, 
Panel A) consistent with known vemurafenib effect on QTc interval (slope, 0.1891 ms per µg/mL). 
Vemurafenib-PD patients were at vemurafenib steady-state at baseline and no further increases in the 
QTcF interval (slope, -0.023 ms per ∆g/mL) were observed. 
However, when cobimetinib was co-administered with vemurafenib in Study NO25395, a 
concentration-dependent increase in ∆QTcF was detected (slope, 0.0217 ms per ng/mL) after adjusting 
for vemurafenib effect in the model (see Figure below, Panel B). Similar results were obtained when 
data from Study NO25395 were analysed separately.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Cobimetinib is characterized as highly soluble and moderate to highly permeable compound. The 
absorption was almost complete with an estimated fraction absorbed of 88% although the absolute 
bioavailability was calculated to be 46%. A high fat meal did not influence the systemic exposure 
compared to under fasted condition. Following oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer patients, cobimetinib 
showed a moderate rate of absorption with a median Tmax of 2.4 hours. The mean steady-state Cmax 
and AUC0-24 were 273 ng/mL and 4340 ng.h/mL respectively. The mean accumulation ratio at steady 
state was approximately 2.4-fold. 
Cobimetinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of ~3.5 mg to 100 mg. The absolute 
bioavailability of cobimetinib was 45.9% (90% CI: 39.7%, 53.1%) in healthy subjects. A human mass 
balance study was conducted in healthy subjects, and showed that cobimetinib was extensively 
metabolised and eliminated in faeces. The fraction absorbed was ~88% indicating high absorption and 
first pass metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib are not altered when administered in the 
fed state (high-fat meal) compared with the fasted state in healthy subjects. Since food does not alter 
the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib, it can be administered with or without food (SmPC section 5.2).   
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 51/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cobimetinib is 94.8% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. No preferential binding to human red 
blood cells was observed (blood to plasma ratio 0.93).  
The volume of distribution was 1050 L in healthy subjects given an intravenous dose of 2 mg. The 
apparent volume of distribution was 806 L in cancer patients based on population pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  
Cobimetinib and its metabolites were characterised in a mass balance study in healthy subjects. On 
average, 94% of the dose was recovered within 17 days. Cobimetinib was extensively metabolised and 
eliminated in faeces. Following intravenous administration of a 2 mg dose of cobimetinib, the mean 
plasma clearance (CL) was 10.7 L/hr. The mean apparent CL following oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer 
patients was 13.8 L/hr. 
The mean elimination half-life following oral dosing of cobimetinib was 43.6 hours (range: 23.1 to 
69.6 hours). Therefore, it may take up to 2 weeks following treatment cessation for cobimetinib to be 
completely removed from systemic circulation (SmPC section 5.2).    
Following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled cobimetinib, cobimetinib was extensively metabolised with 
about 2 and 7% of dose excreted as parent compound in the urine and faeces, respectively. About 
75% of dose administered was excreted in faeces.. Three metabolites were identified in plasma with 
individual plasma levels of >10% of total radioactivity at some time-points up to 48h post dose. 
Cobimetinib is eliminated primarily via metabolism in the liver. Oxidation by CYP3A and glucuronidation 
by UGT2B7 appear to be the major pathways of cobimetinib metabolism. Cobimetinib is the 
predominant moiety in plasma. No oxidative metabolites greater than 10% of total circulating 
radioactivity or human specific metabolites were observed in plasma. Unchanged medicinal product in 
faeces and urine accounted for 6.6% and 1.6% of the administered dose, respectively, indicating that 
cobimetinib is primarily metabolised with minimal renal elimination (SmPC section 5.2). Serious 
hepatotoxicity has been added as an important potential risk. Safety in patients with moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment has been included as missing information in the RMP. The risk will be 
monitored through dose reduction and treatment discontinuation guidance for hepatic impairment and 
liver laboratory abnormalities as described in the SmPC  Section 4.2 (Posology and method of 
administration). As the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in subjects with different degrees of hepatic 
function has not been investigated, the CHMP has requested the applicant to submit the results of a 
post-authorisation study GP29342, a Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of cobimetinib in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment compared to healthy subjects (deadline: 31 December 2015). This study has been included 
in the RMP. 
 In vitro investigations characterized CYP3A to be the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of 
cobimetinib. This was confirmed an in vivo DDI study where the total exposure of cobimetinib 
increased about 7-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A 7-fold 
increase in exposure when inhibiting CYP3A means that CYP3A metabolism represents 85% of the total 
elimination. Therefore, concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Cotellic should 
be avoided. Caution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with 
Cotellic. If concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should 
be carefully monitored for safety and dose modifications applied if clinically indicated (see Table 1 in 
section 4.2 and section 4.4).  
CYP3A inhibitors 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 52/139 
 
 
 
 
 
Cobimetinib is metabolized by CYP3A and cobimetinib AUC increased approximately 7- fold in the 
presence of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) in healthy subjects. The magnitude of interaction 
could potentially be lower in patients.  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4.): Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during 
treatment with cobimetinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, ritonavir, 
cobicistat, telaprevir, lopinavir, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, posaconazole 
and nefazodone. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be 
carefully monitored for safety. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (7 days or less), consider 
interrupting cobimetinib therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4.): Caution should be exercised if cobimetinib is co-
administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited 
to, amiodarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, miconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, amprenavir, 
fosamprenavir, imatinib. When cobimetinib is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, 
patients should be carefully monitored for safety.  
Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors: Cobimetinib can be co-administered with mild inhibitors of CYP3A without dose 
adjustment. 
When co-administered with vemurafenib, a CYP3A4 inducer, lower mean steady state concentration of 
cobimetinib was seen, compared to when administered alone. No conclusions can be drawn on a 
potential DDI effect due to few patients treated alone with cobimetinib in comparison with the 
combination. The steady state exposure of vemurafenib was slightly lower when co-administered with 
cobimetinib compared when administered alone meaning that a potential DDI between cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib cannot be ruled out when co-treated. In vitro cobimetinib showed a potential of both 
CYP3A induction and inhibition, however, the in vivo DDI study with midazolam did not show any 
difference in exposure if co-administered with cobimetinib. Co-administration of cobimetinib with a 
strong CYP3A inducer was not assessed in a clinical study, however, a reduction in cobimetinib 
exposure is likely. Therefore, concomitant use of moderate and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. 
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided. Alternative agents with 
no or minimal CYP3A induction should be considered. Given that cobimetinib concentrations are likely 
to be significantly reduced when co-administered with moderate to strong CYP3A inducers, patient’s 
efficacy may be compromised..  
P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Cobimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors such 
as ciclosporin and verapamil may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of cobimetinib. 
Effects of cobimetinib on other medicinal products   
CYP3A and CYP2D6 substrates 
A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) and dextromethorphan (a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate) were 
not altered in the presence of cobimetinib. 
CYP1A2 substrates 
In vitro, cobimetinib is a potential inducer of CYP1A2.  No clinical DDI studies have been conducted to 
assess the clinical relevance of this finding. The drug-drug interactions (with CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYPC19 and CYP2D6) have been included in the RMP as missing information. The 
potential of cobimetinib to act as a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 53/139 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 will be evaluated in an in vitro Study 15-1983 to determine if cobimetinib is a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP genes. The CHMP has requested the submission of the results of this 
study as a post-authorisation measure in the RMP (deadline: 31 December 2015). It is therefore 
recommended that women of childbearing potential should be advised to use two effective 
contraceptive methods, such as a condom or other barrier method (with spermicide, if available) 
during treatment with Cotellic and for at least three months following treatment discontinuation. 
BCRP substrates 
In vitro, cobimetinib is a moderate inhibitor of BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein). No clinical 
DDI studies have been conducted to assess these finding, and relevant BCRP inhibition at intestinal 
level cannot be ruled out. 
In vitro studies show that cobimetinib is not a substrate of the liver uptake transporters OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and OCT1, however, it weakly inhibits these transporters. The clinical relevance of these 
findings has not been investigated. Cobimetinib is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2.  It is 
unlikely that cobimetinib would alter the hepatic uptake or renal excretion of drugs that are substrates 
of these transporters (SmPC section 4.5). 
As renal clearance plays a minimal role in the elimination of cobimetinib, a significant effect of renal 
function on the exposure is not expected. However, even if the drug is eliminated mainly by 
metabolism, PK characterization in severe renal impairment should always be considered as severe 
renal impairment may affect the PK by diverse mechanisms. Based on preclinical data and the human 
mass balance study, cobimetinib is mainly metabolised, with minimal renal elimination. No formal 
pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment.  A population 
pharmacokinetic analysis using data from 151 patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CRCL) 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 48 patients with moderate renal impairment (CRCL 30 to 
less than 60 mL/min), and 286 patients with normal renal function (CRCL greater than or equal to 
90 mL/min), showed that CRCL had no meaningful influence on exposure of cobimetinib (SmPC section 
5.2). 
Mild to moderate renal impairment does not influence cobimetinib exposure based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis.  There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal 
impairment.  
No pharmacokinetic data in subjects with hepatic impairment are available.  
No significant covariates necessitating dose-adjustment were identified in the population 
pharmacokinetic model. Gender does not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis including 210 women and 277 men (SmPC section 5.2). Age does 
not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis 
including 133 patients ≥ 65 years of age (SmPC section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is required in patients aged ≥65 years old (SmPC section 4.2). No dose 
adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients 
with severe renal impairment. Cotellic should be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment. The safety and efficacy of Cotellic has not been established in patients with hepatic 
impairment (SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). There are no pharmacokinetic data in patients with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment.  Cotellic should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment.

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline ECOG, mild and 
moderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetic of cobimetinib. Baseline age and 
baseline body weight were identified as statistically significant covariates on cobimetinib clearance and 
volume of distribution respectively. However, sensitivity analysis suggests neither of these covariates 
had clinically significant impact on steady state exposure (SmPC section 5.2). 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults (SmPC section 4.5). No studies have been 
conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in paediatric patients (SmPC section 
5.2). 
There is no evidence of any clinically significant drug-drug interaction between cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients and therefore no dose adjustments is 
recommended (SmPC section 4.4). 
Several biomarkers were tested in an attempt to assess their predictive value. The biomarkers pERK, 
pS6, PTEN, and Ki67 were measured at baseline, however there was not a clear marker to distinguish 
responders from non-responders.  
Pharmacodynamic effects of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a limited 
number of paired samples by changes in biomarker levels (pERK, pS6, Ki67) between baseline and 
Cycle 1 Day 14. These changes indicated a reduction of signalling within pathway translated into 
reduction in ERK phosphorylation.  
Cutaneous SCC were characterized using molecular analyses in few cuSCC samples. With the samples 
available in this study, pERK was higher in the cuSCC specimens and p53 expression was lower. 
However, the small sample size did not allow the conclusive investigation.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The studies submitted as part of the clinical pharmacology were considered acceptable to investigate 
the PK and PD aspects of the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
• 
The PK interaction potential of cobimetinib has not been completely evaluated. According to the EU

The single-agent MEK4592g study (a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of Cobimetinib Administered Orally Daily to Subjects with Solid Tumors) established 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cobimetinib at 100 mg daily when delivered on a 14/14 
schedule and 60 mg daily when delivered on a 21/7 schedule. Exposures (as measured by Cmax and 
AUC parameters) increased proportionally with dose up to a dose of 100 mg QD and supported the use 
of either the 14/14 or the 21/7 regimen. 
Study NO25395 (BRIM7) determined the MTD and the recommended Phase 3 dose and schedule of the 
combination as vemurafenib 960 mg BID and cobimetinib 60 mg daily 21/7. At that dose and schedule 
of the combination, both drugs were delivered at their respective single agent MTDs and at the highest 
dose of both agents delivered concurrently. Furthermore, the 21/7 dosing schedule allowed for a more 
prolonged exposure of cobimetinib during a treatment cycle.

• Arm B (investigational arm): vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID on Days 1−28 and cobimetinib 60 mg PO 
QD on Days 1−21 of each 28-day treatment cycle 
Figure 9:  
Study design 
Treatment was supposed to continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred earliest. Patients in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm were 
not eligible to cross over to the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. 
Objectives 
Efficacy objectives (primary and secondary) 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with 
cobimetinib, compared with vemurafenib and placebo, in previously untreated BRAFV600 mutation-
positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. 
The key secondary objectives were as follows: to evaluate the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination 
with cobimetinib, compared with vemurafenib and placebo, in previously untreated BRAFV600 
mutation-positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, as measured 
by overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and PFS as 
assessed by independent review; to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients receiving 
vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and placebo, as measured by the European 
Organization for Research and Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the 
EuroQol 5 dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. 
Safety Objective 
To characterise the toxicity profile of patients receiving vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus 
vemurafenib and placebo.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Investigator assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease 
progression (as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, 
whichever came first. 
Secondary endpoint 
Overall survival (OS, defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause), 
objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR, defined as the time from first occurrence of 
a documented confirmed objective response until the time of disease progression, as determined by 
investigator review of tumour assessments with use of RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause during 
the study), Time to objective response (TTR, defined as the time from randomization to the date of the 
first CR or PR, confirmed), and independent review facility (IRF)--assessed PFS. 
ORR was determined as the Investigator-based (confirmed) Best Overall Response Rate (BORR), 
defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v 1.1. The best overall 
response of CR or PR were determined by two consecutive investigator assessments that were 4 or 
more weeks apart. In the case of stable disease, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after study entry (randomisation) at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks. Evaluable 
patients who did not meet these criteria were considered non-responders; this includes patients who 
never received study treatment and treated patients for whom post-baseline tumour assessment was 
not performed. No formal hypothesis testing was performed for DoR and Time to response, which were 
based on non-randomised patient subsets. 
Efficacy exploratory endpoints 
Efficacy exploratory analyses included PFS rates and OS rates at fixed time-points (e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12 
months), as well as time to response. 
Safety endpoints 
Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), graded 
according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) (see safety section). Changes 
in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory results during the course of study. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to provide > 95% power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 6 
months in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm to 11 months in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, 
corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55. Approximately 500 patients were to be randomized; the 
final analysis of PFS was to take place when approximately 206 PFS events had occurred. The Type 1 
error for the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS was 0.05 (2-sided). No interim analyses of the 
primary endpoint (PFS) and the secondary endpoint BORR were to be performed. 
Three OS analyses (two interim analyses and one final analysis) were originally planned as following: 
the first OS interim analysis at the time of the primary PFS analysis (projected to occur approximately 
16 months after the first patient was randomised), the second OS interim analysis after the occurrence 
of 256 events (projected to occur at approximately 27 months after the first patient was randomised), 
and the final analysis of OS after the occurrence of 385 deaths (projected to occur at approximately 46 
months after the first patient was randomised). A total of 385 deaths provides approximately 80% 
power to detect an improvement in median OS from 15 months in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm to 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 60/139 
 
 
 
 
 
20 months in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (corresponding to a HR for death of 0.75) at an 
overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05 significance. This original plan was changed (after SAP 
Amendment v3) and the final OS analysis was performed after the occurrence of 250 events (projected 
to occur at approximately 31 months after the first patient was randomised). A total of 250 deaths 
provided approximately 80% power to detect an improvement in median OS from 15 months in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm to 21.4 months in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (corresponding 
to a HR for death of 0.70) at an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05 significance. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to one of the two treatment arms through use of an interactive voice 
response system (IVRS). Randomization was stratified by metastatic classification (unresectable Stage 
IIIc, M1a, and M1b or Stage M1c) and geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia/New 
Zealand/others). A stratified permuted block randomisation scheme was used to obtain approximately 
a 1:1 allocation between the two treatment groups. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double blinded study.  
Statistical methods 
The statistical hypothesis of this study was as follows: 
H0: PFS(Arm A) =PFS(Arm B) 
H1: PFS(Arm A) ≠ PFS(Arm B) 
The primary analysis was a comparison of PFS between the two treatment arms with use of a stratified 
log-rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (2-sided). The hazard ratio for PFS was estimated 
using a stratified Cox model. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio was provided. 
The stratified analyses will incorporate 2 stratification factors: geographic region and metastatic 
classification (see Randomisation above). Results from an unstratified log-rank test and the unstratified 
hazard ratio will be presented. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate median PFS for each 
treatment arm. P-values for ORR were calculated using chi-square with Schouten correction. 
The study was designed to provide greater than 95% power to detect an improvement in median PFS 
from 6 months in the vemurafenib + placebo arm to 11 months in the vemurafenib + cobimetinib arm, 
corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55. Patients continued to be followed until death after the 
primary analysis of PFS. Three OS analyses (two interim analyses and one final analysis) were 
planned, the final analysis of OS will be performed after the occurrence of approximately 250 OS 
events (after SAP Amendment v3) i.e. after the death of approximately 50% of patients.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The original protocol was issued on 3 August 2012 and 3 amendments were made to it. The key 
changes are reported below. 
- Protocol Version 3 (24 April 2013), to include the following changes: added PFS as assessed by 
independent review as a secondary endpoint; clarified exclusion criteria 4 to allow patients with 
previously resected early stage melanoma into the study; added cardiac events/Grade ≥ 2 LVEF 
reduction as AESIs; revised guidelines for cases of emergency unblinding to allow investigators the 
ability to unblind without the Sponsor’s approval; change in reporting windows for pregnancy and 
pregnant partners, for LVEF, dermatology, and ophthalmology exams after Cycle 2; revised guidelines 
on corrected QT interval (QTc) monitoring/cardiac consult to be more conservative; updated safety 
information on the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib combination; further clarified procedures described in 
the protocol to enhance readability and understanding. 
- Protocol Version 4 (12 September 2013) to include the following changes: updated safety information 
for consistency with the vemurafenib Investigator’s Brochure; updated and further clarified procedures 
described in the protocol to enhance readability and understanding. 
- Protocol Version 4 Addendum 1 (17 March 2014), to include lipase and amylase testing to confirm 
diagnosis in suspected cases of pancreatitis. 
No changes were made to planned data analyses, with the following exceptions:  
-  Repeated measures mixed-effects models for PRO were not performed, as no clinically 
meaningful changes were observed from the descriptive statistics and the analyses of change 
from baseline. 
-  The sensitivity analysis of PFS censored for missing visits was not performed as the number of 
patients with missing visits was very low  
-  Unstratified and stratified analyses of OS censored for use of subsequent anti-cancer therapy 
were performed but were not included in the report, as the quantity of available data (i.e. 
number of censored patients) was not sufficient for a meaningful analysis 
-  A post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the magnitude of the best target lesion 
response 
Study GO28141 SAP Amendments: 
- SAP Version 2 (22 June 2014), the definition of the analysis population for best overall response rate 
was changed from the definition in the original SAP. The former definition specified that patients who 
were randomized at least 18 weeks before the data cutoff date were to be included in the analysis. The 
revised definition specified that all randomized patients, regardless of whether or not study treatment 
was received, would be included in the analysis. Additionally, the subgroup analysis for time since 
metastatic disease diagnosis (< 6 months, ≥ 6 months) was deleted because the information required 
for this analysis (the date of metastatic diagnosis) was not collected. 
- SAP Version 3 (23 February 2015), the final OS analysis plan was changed to perform the final OS 
analysis after the occurrence of 250 deaths from the initial plan of 385 deaths. 
Protocol violations

A total of 26 patients, 12 (4.9%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 14 (5.6%) in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm) had at least one violation of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. The 
most common deviations from entry criteria were history of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction 
(exclusion criterion 8: 12 patients, 6 (2.4%) in each arm); and risk factors for RVO (exclusion criterion 
7: 4 patients, 1 and 3 in the respective arms). 
Another 36 patients had procedural deviations during the course of the study. The most common of 
these was lack of patient compliance with the dosing regimen (e.g., off treatment longer than 28 days, 
more than 7 days off between treatment cycles; 13 patients), followed by deviations in the ECG 
procedures (e.g. ECGs not done at two consecutive visits; 8 patients).

Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary analysis (cut-off 9 May 2014), the median duration of follow-up for all patients in the 
study was 7.3 months (range, 0.5–16.5 months). Patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm 
had a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range, 1.4–14.7 months) while patients in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm had a median follow-up of 7.2 months (range, 0.5–16.5 months). 
Primary endpoint - Progression-free survival  
The PFS analysis (data cut-off date 16 January 2015) showed a median follow up of 14.2 months 
(placebo plus vemurafenib 13.6 month (0.5-24.8); cobimetinib plus vemurafenib 14.9 months (1.4-
22.5). The results of the updated analysis are shown in Table 37 and Figure 10. The concordance rates 
(concordance of event + concordance of censored) between investigator- and IRF-based assessments 
was 89.0% (27.1% + 61.9%) for the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 82.6% (40.7% + 41.9%) 
for the placebo plus vemurafenib arm.

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
Global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptom severity, and functional 
interference of symptoms by patient report were measured for each treatment arm using the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The completion rate of the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline for both treatment 
arms was 96.7%. Completion rates were consistently high among all cycles for both treatment arms (≥ 
88%), through the final study visit (Table 42). 
Table 42:  
Completion of EORTC QLQ-C30 Assessment - Study GO28141 
Absolute scores for the EOTRTC QLQ-C30 scales and change from baseline were analysed at each 
assessment time point for each treatment arm. Assessments were conducted at Days 1 and 15 in 
Cycles 1 and 2, and every other cycle thereafter (Cycle 4, 6, 8, etc.) until patient withdrawal or end of 
study. Assessments up to Cycle 8 Day 1 were included in the analysis. At the time of the data cut, few 
patients in the study had received treatment past that time point. 
An exploratory analysis was performed, in which patients were considered to have had a clinically 
meaningful improvement in EORTC QLQ-C30 score if they had at least a 10-point improvement in the 
score at one or more post-baseline assessments; this had to be an increase in the global health status 
and function scales and a decrease in the symptom scales26. 
Descriptive results (no formal statistical comparisons were conducted) are reported in Table 43.

Supportive studies 
Study NO25395 (BRIM7)  
Study NO25395 was a Phase Ib, open label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib in combination with GDC-0973 (cobimetinib) when administered 
in BRAFV600E mutation–positive patients previously treated (but without prior exposure to BRAF or 
MEK inhibitor therapy) or previously untreated for locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma or those who have progressed after treatment with vemurafenib. 
Study NO25395 (BRIM7), was an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib, and to determine 
the recommended cobimetinib dose and schedule to be used in Phase 3. The study was conducted at 9 
sites in the US and 1 site in Australia. 
The following patient populations with BRAF V600E mutation-positive (as detected by the cobas 4800 
BRAF V600 Mutation Test), locally-advanced, and unresectable or metastatic melanoma were eligible 
for Study NO25395 (BRIM7): 
Assessment report

1. BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-naïve patients, either: 
a) Previously untreated patients 
b) Previously treated patients who were naïve to BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy. 
2. Patients who progressed on vemurafenib monotherapy immediately prior to enrolment on Study 
NO25395 (BRIM7). 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
1. Patients with the BRAF mutation detected by the cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test in 
melanoma tumour tissue. 
2. Patients with histologically confirmed melanoma, either unresectable Stage IIIc or Stage IV 
metastatic melanoma, as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
3. Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 
4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1. 
There were two stages: a dose-escalation stage and a cohort expansion stage. 
The dose-escalation stage consisted of 9 dose-escalation cohorts of 3 to 6 patients. Dose-escalation 
proceeded in standard 3+3 design.  Please refer to section 3.3 ‘Dose-response studies’ for the study 
outcomes.

Cohort Assignment of Patients in Study NO25395 
Assessment report

Page 79/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the cohort expansion stage, 2 selected cohorts were expanded after being declared safe and 
tolerable in the dose-escalation stage. Twenty BRAFi-naïve patients and 19 vemurafenib-PD patients, 
were accrued into the expansion cohort corresponding to the proposed commercial dose/schedule that 
were chosen for the phase III study. In the dose-escalation 1B stage, 19 BRAFi-naive AND 8 
vemurafenib-PD patients were exposed to these dose and schedule. Expansion cohorts allowed for the 
establishment of the safety profile, PK and efficacy of the combination in relatively large and 
homogenous patient populations with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma receiving a uniform dose 
and schedule of the combination.

Efficacy outcomes 
The efficacy data presented include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and 
progression-free survival (PFS), on the basis of investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1, and overall 
survival (OS). All efficacy data analyses used the treated population, defined as all patients who 
received at least one of study drug. 
The efficacy data have been pooled across dose/regimen cohorts from the dose-escalation and cohort-
expansion stages and analysed separately for BRAFi-naïve and vemurafenib-PD patients who received 
both cobimetinib and vemurafenib.

Methods 
This was a Phase I, non-randomised, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) dose-escalation 
study. The study consisted of 4 treatment stages listed below. A conventional 3+3 design was used for 
Stage I and IA, with each cohort consisting of 3 to 6 subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 85/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stage I: Dose-escalation cohorts were treated on a 21-days-on, 7-days-off (21/7) schedule to 
determine the MTD.  
Stage IA: Dose-escalation cohorts, starting at the MTD of the 21-days-on, 7-days-off (21/7) schedule, 
were treated on a 14-days-on, 14-days-off (14/14) schedule to determine the MTD on an alternate 
dosing regimen. 
Stage II: Expansion cohort with the MTD determined in Stage I in approximately 20 patients with FDG-
PET-avid tumours harbouring a BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation and with FDG-PET-avid disease. 
Stage IIA: Expansion cohort with the MTD determined in Stage IA in approximately 20 patients with 
FDG-PET-avid tumours harbouring a BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation. 
Information collected during the first 28 day cycle of treatment period was used to determine the MTD 
and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Confirmation of objective responses was applied. 
Number of Patients (Planned and Analysed) 
Approximately 90 patients were planned for enrolment. A total of 99 patients were enrolled, 97 of 
whom received at least 1 dose of study drug and are included in the analyses. 
Of the 146 patients screened, 47 patients were screen failures and 99 patients were enrolled in the 
study: 36 patients in Stage I, 20 patients in Stage IA, 21 patients in Stage II, 22 patients in Stage IIA. 
Main eligibility criteria 
Stage I: The patient had a histologically confirmed solid tumour that was metastatic or unresectable, 
and for which standard curative or palliative measures did not exist or were no longer effective, and 
there were no therapies known to prolong survival. The patient had disease that was assessable by 
tumour marker, physical, or radiologic means. 
Stages IA, II, IIA: As above + No prior GDC-0973/XL518 (cobimetinib) + measureable disease (by 
RECIST criteria).  
Stages II and IIA: As above + The patient’s current cancer, for which he or she was enrolled in this 
study, must have harboured a known BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation + Patients must have had FDG-
PET-avid disease: At least 1 target lesion on computed tomography (CT) scans must have also been a 
FDG-PET-avid region of interest.  
Treatments 
The study drug was supplied as GDC-0973/XL518 drug substance powder in an amber glass bottle 
(powder-in-bottle [PIB]) and as a powder-in-capsule. GDC-0973/XL518 was administered orally, either 
via solution or capsule, once daily for Days 1-21 (Stages I and II) or Days 1-14 (Stages IA and IIA) of 
each 28-day cycle.  
The dose cohorts ranged between 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight– 0.20 mg/kg, and 20mg – 80 mg in the 
21/7 day dosing regimen, and 60-125 mg in the 14/14 day regimen. The solution was given at the 
doses: 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics: 11 /97 (11%) patients in Study MEK4592g had melanoma. In addition there 
was 1 patient with ocular melanoma and 1 with choroidal mixed-type melanoma, categorised as 
tumour type “other”. The most common primary cancer sites in this study were colorectal (33 
patients), other (26 patients), melanoma (11 patients), and colon (6 patients). Four of the 11

melanoma patients were included in the dose regimen 60 mg 21/7, and 7 in cohorts with 100 mg 
14/14. 
DLT: Six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, including 2 patients with Grade 3 rash (21/7 
regimen at 60 mg and 80mg, respectively), 1 patient with Grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy (40 mg 
21/7), Grade 3 acneiform dermatitis (60 mg 21/7), Grade 3 diarrhoea (80 mg 21/7), and 1 patient 
with Grade 3 blurred vision due to serous macular detachment (125 mg 14/14 – this dose was 
determined to exceed the MTD) 
Table 51 :  
Dose-limiting Toxicities in Phase I study MEK4592g 
MTD: The MTD for the 21/7 QD schedule was found to be 60 mg and the MTD for the 14/14 QD 
schedule was found to be 100 mg.  
QTc: Overall, during Stages IA, II, and IIA, 5 patients (8.2%) and 2 patients (3.3%) experienced QTcB 
and QTcF prolongation, respectively; all these patients were in Cohort 03A (100 mg, escalation cohort, 
14/14 schedule) and Cohort 30 (100 mg, expansion cohort, 14/14 schedule). 
Tumour activity: Overall, 6 patients with melanoma had a confirmed partial response, 28 patients had 
stable disease, and 40 patients had disease progression (Table 52). Three patients, who were ongoing 
in the study at the time of database lock, were responding to the study drug: 1 patient with prolonged 
stable disease and 2 patients with partial responses.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted a pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial 
GO28141, “coBRIM”, comparing vemurafenib plus placebo versus vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in 
previously untreated BRAF V600-mutation positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic melanoma. The single-arm, open-label Phase 1b trial NO25395, “BRIM7” and the Phase 1a 
trial MEK4592g, are considered supportive. 
In general, the pivotal study was well conducted, the treatment arms were well balanced and there 
were no major protocol deviations that affected the robustness of the data.  A routine GCP inspection 
found critical findings with regard to the cleaning of data affecting ORR data in one of the inspected 
sites. The inspection report concluded that the deviations are generally not considered to be of concern 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 88/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the context of the marketing authorisation application. Even the deviations concerning the efficacy 
parameters seem to have not affected the primary efficacy parameter Progression Free Survival. 
The pivotal study compared two treatment arms, a vemurafenib plus cobimetinib arm versus 
vemurafenib plus placebo and therefore did not contain a third arm of cobimetinib plus placebo. The 
CHMP expressed some concern over the lack of a cobimetinib only treatment arm. It was considered 
that the clinical efficacy of cobimetinib monotherapy had not been thoroughly investigated in 
melanoma patients as only 45 patients with different types of cancer were treated with the same 
dose/schedule as intended for melanoma patients. The lack of information on the efficacy of 
cobimetinib monotherapy results in a situation where the efficacy contribution of each of the 
components in the combination therapy cannot be formally assessed and as a result it is not known 
whether the added toxicity of vemurafenib could have been avoided. However, there is support from 
non-clinical data for a stronger effect of combination therapy in BRAF sensitive xenograft tumours. In 
addition, cross-study comparison of published phase 3 monotherapy data of the BRAF inhibitors 
vemurafenib5 and dabrafenib10 and MEK inhibitor trametinib9 provided clinical support for a superior 
efficacy of the combination therapy over the MEK or BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Therefore, the lack 
of a cobimetinib only treatment arm was considered acceptable.  
The dose schedule for the pivotal study is considered justified based on the data from the single arm 
study MEK4592g study and NO25395 study.  In study NO25395 the evaluation of a 14/14 schedule 
showed tumour regrowth in some patients during off-drug period whereas a 21/7 schedule showed no 
tumour regrowth during the off-drug period. Therefore, the current posology is considered acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase III study GO28141 - coBRIM 
Primary efficacy endpoint – Investigator-assessed Progression-free survival (PFS)  
In the planned primary analysis, the investigator-based PFS (with stratifications) hazard ratio (HR) was 
0.51 (95%CI 0.39, 0.68; log-rank p<0.0001) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, thus 
reaching and surpassing the HR of 0.55 aimed for in the design of the study.  
In the updated PFS analysis, performed at an event rate of 65% and with data cut-off 8 months after 
the primary analysis, the HR was 0.58 (95%CI: 0:46; 0.72), the difference in medians across arms 
was 5.0 months (12.25 vs. 7.2 months). 
The pre-planned unstratified PFS analysis (HR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.39, 0.68; log-rank p<0.0001) was 
consistent with the stratified analysis, indicating robustness of the data. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
IRF-assessed PFS (not updated) 
The HR for IRF-assessed PFS (with stratifications) was 0.60 (95%CI 0.45, 0.79; log-rank; p=0.0003; 
stratified analysis) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. The PFS improvement when 
assessed by the IRF was consistent with investigator assessment. 
The median PFS was 11.3 months (95%CI: 8.5 months, not evaluable) in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm compared with 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.6, 7.5 months) in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm. The unstratified analysis of IRF-assessed PFS was consistent with the stratified 
analysis (HR =0.61; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.81; p=0.0006).

Overall survival (OS) 
Due to the low overall event rate of 85/495 = 17%, an updated OS analysis was requested, which was 
performed at an event rate of 188/495 = 38%. This is still considered immature. In the planned 
interim analysis of OS HR=0.645 (stratified) and 0.62 (unstratified), in favour of the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm.  
In the updated analysis, the OS analysis was consistent: 0.650 (stratified) with a median OS of 17 
months in the vemurafenib plus placebo arm, but had not yet been reached for the combination arm. 
It was noted that the estimate for the lower 95% interval was 5 months apart in the two treatment 
arms. Thus, these preliminary results from OS analysis are considered supportive of the primary 
efficacy analysis, investigator–assessed PFS.  
Objective response rate (ORR)  
In the planned primary analysis based on investigator assessments, the difference in confirmed ORR 
was 67.6% versus 44.8% for patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib vs. patients treated 
with vemurafenib and placebo (p < 0.0001 by chi-square with Schouten correction). In the IRF 
analysis of ORR, a total of 56.3% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm attained an 
objective response compared to 40.7% of patients in the vemurafenib plus placebo arm. 
The updated analysis showed a confirmed ORR of 69.6% (95% CI:  63.5%, 75.3%) versus 50.0% 
(95% CI: 43.6%, 56.4%), respectively. Complete response was observed in 16% of patients in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 11% of patients in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
Duration of Response (DoR) 
The median duration of confirmed response, as assessed by investigators, was 7.3 months (95% CI: 
5.8 months, not estimable) in the 111 responders in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm and not 
reached at the time of the clinical cut-off in May 2014 in the 167 patient responders in the cobimetinib 
plus vemurafenib arm (95% CI: 9.3 months, not estimable). In the IRF analysis, the median duration 
of confirmed response for the 101 responders in the control arm was 8.2 months (95% CI: 7.5, not 
estimable) and not reached for the 139 responders in the cobimetinib-containing arm (95% CI: 9.5, 
not estimable). The proportions with event following response were similar, 17% vs 18%, respectively.  
Time to response (TTR) 
Swimlane plots gives the impression of similar time-to-response patterns, with a majority of responses 
reported at two months (i.e. at first tumour assessment) although numerically more responses in the 
experimental arm. No numerals were presented. 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
Global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptom severity, and functional 
interference of symptoms by patient report were measured for each treatment arm using the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Completion rates were consistently high among all cycles for both treatment 
arms (≥ 88%). Patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm experienced either clinically 
meaningful improvement or marginal improvement in insomnia in time points in 4 treatment cycles, 
and clinically meaningful worsening of diarrhoea from baseline at Day 15 in the two first treatment 
cycles. For global health status, as well as most functioning and symptom scales, the difference in 
proportion of responders was small, indicating similarity in HRQoL between the two treatment arms. 
Larger differences were seen for insomnia and social functioning, and to a lesser extent, pain and 
fatigue; all favoured the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm.

Summary of primary vs. updated analyses 
The primary analysis of PFS and ORR showed statistically significant differences between arms (p< 
0.0001 for both). The results in the updated analyses were consistent with the primary analyses, with 
similar or narrower confidence intervals: PFS HR 0.51 and 0.58, OS HR 0.65 and 0.65, (95% CI: 0.49-
0.87 for the updated analysis), and difference in ORR 23% and 20%, in the earlier and updated 
analyses, respectively. It is noted that the CIs for ORR in the two study arms are not overlapping. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results, with nearly all HR point estimates below 
1.0 and near the overall HR of 0.51. For the two subgroups with very few subjects, Non-white or 
unknown race (n=33) and Prior treatment of brain metastasis (n=3), the HR point estimates were 
>1.0 with wide confidence intervals. Thus, efficacy in these subgroups is considered unknown.  
Some differences between subgroups were noted and the relative efficacy appears generally higher in 
some subgroups of poorer prognosis (e.g. disease stage M1c, and performance status ECOG 1) 
compared with their better prognosis counterparts. One of the main causes of mortality in melanoma 
patients is the development of brain metastases. In the phase 3 study, only 3 patients with brain 
metastases were treated (2 in combination group, 1 in control group). Therefore, efficacy of 
combination therapy in treatment of brain metastases is not established. Therefore, the safety and 
long-term efficacy in patients with brain (CNS) involvement has been included in the RMP as missing 
information. In addition, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that “The safety and 
efficacy of the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib have not been evaluated in patients with a 
BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma which has metastasised to the brain. The intracranial activity 
of cobimetinib is currently unknown “, and in section 5.1 where there are no data on the safety or 
efficacy of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in patients with central nervous system 
metastasis or in patients with non-cutaneous malignant melanoma. The CHMP has requested the 
applicant to submit the results of a post-authorisation study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in patients with CNS involvement (RMP). Therefore, the 
applicant is requested to submit the results of the Study ML29155: Phase 2 Study of Cobimetinib in 
Combination with Vemurafenib in Active Melanoma Brain Metastases (coBRIM-B). Deadline: 31 
December 2019. 
Phase 1b study, NO25395 - BRIM7 
In the dose-escalation combination study NO25395/BRIM7, the highest tested dose regimen was the 
single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for both agents, i.e. cobimetinib 60 mg QD Days 1-21 
and vemurafenib 960 mg BID Days 1-28 in a 28-day cycle. This was considered tolerable and selected 
as the recommended Phase II/III dose. 
In patients that had not been previously treated with vemurafenib (BRAFi-naïve patients) (all doses, 
n꞊63), the confirmed objective response rate was 87%, including a complete response in 10% of 
patients. The median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median PFS for BRAFi naïve patients 
was 13.7 months, with median follow-up time of 12.7 months, which is considered clinically significant. 
In the subgroup of patients who received 60 mg cobimetinib once daily for 21 days (n꞊39) the efficacy 
results were similar to the overall BRAFi naïve patients with an objective response rate of 85%. The 
median duration of response in this group was 11.3 months and the median PFS was 12.7 months.  
In patients that progressed after vemurafenib treatment (BRAFi-PD patients), the objective response 
rate (all doses) was low at 15% (95% CI: 7.5, 25.5); although the median duration of response was of 
a relevant magnitude in those who had responses, 6.7 months. Median PFS in vemurafenib-PD patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 91/139 
 
 
 
 
 
was 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.63, 3.45). In the subgroup of patients who received 60 mg cobimetinib 
once daily for 21 days (n꞊27), the objective response rate was 26 %, while median duration of 
response was not estimable, and median PFS was 2.8 months.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
BRAF mutation V600E and V600K  
In the phase III study GO28141/coBRIM a lower HR estimate (trend of better relative efficacy) for the 
vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) combination arm vs. the vemurafenib + 
placebo arm was seen in the subgroup with BRAFV600K mutation (HR 0.27, n= 56) compared with the 
complementary subgroup with BRAFV600E mutation (HR 0.57, n=344). In the updated analysis the 
difference in PFS HR between patients with V600E and V600K had decreased substantially, however, 
(HRs 0.64 and 0.52, respectively).  
Trends of better relative efficacy for the V600K compared with the V600E subtype have also been seen 
in the two trametinib registration studies comparing monotherapy dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) with 
combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib (MEK inhibitor). In both the phase II study 
BRF113122 part C (n=108), and in the phase III study MEK115306 (n=423), lower HR point estimates 
(trends of better relative efficacy) for the combination therapy was seen for V600K mutation.  
In the Phase III vemurafenib monotherapy trial NO25026, which compared vemurafenib 960 mg orally 
twice daily with dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated unresectable Stage IIIC or IV 
melanoma, the response rate in patients with V600Emutation was 59% and the median PFS 6.9 
months, compared with 45% and 5.9 months in patients with V600K mutation8. 
Published results from both the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Melanoma Institute of Australia 
retrospective studies suggest that the BRAF V600K tumour genotype may be associated with a more 
aggressive clinical phenotype including a shorter interval between the time of initial melanoma 
diagnosis to the diagnosis of stage IV disease. However, in the metastatic setting, these associations 
were not consistently observed27, 28.  
Other V600 mutation subtypes 
With regard to other, rarer, V600 subtypes, some support of activity of vemurafenib/cobimetinib 
therapy is provided by preclinical data. Thus, data from biochemical assays, in silico protein structure 
modelling, and in vitro studies on melanoma cell lines have been presented by the Applicant that 
support the activity of vemurafenib monotherapy in V600 subtypes such as R, D, G, M as well as other 
BRAF mutations. In vitro data showing a similar sensitivity of BRAF V600E and V600D mutated 
melanoma cell lines to single-agent cobimetinib is also available (not shown). 
Clinical support for activity of BRAFi with single-agent vemurafenib in patients with non-E, non-K V600 
mutated tumours comes from an ongoing single-arm phase II study ML27763 investigating efficacy in 
non-E activating mutations, showing similar ORR and median PFS for non-E/non-K (n=17) as for 
V600K (n=12) mutations at interim analysis. A number of published case reports/series also describe 
responses to vemurafenib in BRAF mutations of other types thanV600E and V600K (not shown). In 
addition, the phase 1b study NO25395/BRIM7 included one patient with V600M mutation who 
responded with PR to the vemurafenib + cobimetinib combination treatment. 
BRAF mutation test 
The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) used in the 
present trials is a clinically validated qualitative test to determine the presence or absence of a BRAF 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 92/139 
 
 
 
 
 
V600 mutation in melanoma tumour tissue. The cobas test was clinically validated in Study NO25026 
the registrational study for Zelboraf (vemurafenib). Although specifically designed to detect the BRAF 
V600E mutation, the test also cross-reacts with BRAF V600K and other BRAF V600 mutations to yield a 
mutation-positive call (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test CE package insert).  The ability of the 
cobas test to detect non-E BRAF V600 mutations has been described by Anderson et al.29 and McArthur 
et al.8. Sanger sequencing of tumour samples from vemurafenib clinical trials confirmed the inclusion 
of patients whose tumours carried V600K and V600D mutations.  
In response to questions the applicant has shown that all V600 mutant alleles detected above the 
sensitivity cut-off of 5% appeared to be clinically relevant, since when applying different cut-offs, 
patients with low and high BRAF variant frequencies within each treatment arm had similar PFS. In 
addition, for all tested cut-offs combination therapy with cobimetinib + vemurafenib was consistently 
associated with higher PFS than vemurafenib + placebo.  
General comments 
The CHMP highlighted that in patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor therapy, there was the 
possibility of a loss of chance of patients receiving potentially other treatment options that could 
provide a better efficacy for this line of therapy. There was the concern that awaiting progression on 
BRAFi + MEKi after failure on BRAFi, even if only for a few months, could therefore be detrimental to 
the possibility of response on subsequent therapies such as immunotherapy. The available evidence 
from the literature suggests that patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor have a reactivated 
MAPK pathway and that their tumours may still respond to downstream targeting of MEK. As a 
consequence, patients may still derive benefit from further downstream targeting with a MEK inhibitor. 
There were no clinical or biological markers that could be identified based on the limited data available 
from biological samples to identify patients with high likelihood of response. Therefore, the CHMP did 
not restrict the indication to a BRAF inhibitor-naive patient population. The indication includes patients 
that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor treatment, with a reference to a warning in section 4.4 that 
patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor will derive lower efficacy and that other treatment 
options could be considered for this patient population. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The overall efficacy results in the pivotal Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM were consistent across all 
outcome parameters and subgroups analysed. The PFS results were statistically significant and 
clinically relevant. The results of the Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM showed a clinically relevant 
efficacy for the combination treatment of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in terms of PFS and ORR in 
BRAF naive patients and in patients that progressed with BRAF inhibitor therapy. The OS results 
support the clinical benefit observed in melanoma patients although the magnitude of the treatment 
effect is yet unknown as the data is still considered immature. As a follow up, the CHMP would 
recommend to the applicant to submit the results of the final OS analysis of study GO28141. The 
supportive study NO25395 also showed a clinically relevant efficacy in BRAFi-naive patients as well as 
for patients whom had previously progressed on vemurafenib (BRAFi-PD), acknowledging that data in 
this patient population is limited and that the clinical benefit observed in the study indicated that it was 
lower in these patients. Therefore, other treatment options should be considered before treatment with 
the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequencing of treatments following 
progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established. A recommendation has been 
included in the SmPC in section 4.4 for patients that have progressed following BRAF inhibitor therapy. 
The safety and efficacy of Cotellic in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available (SmPC section 4.2). The treatment in patients < 18 years of age has

been included as missing information and CHMP has requested, as part of the PIP, the submission of 
the results from two paediatric studies in patients 6 months to 18 years of age (GO29665). The studies 
will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy dose finding study 
and confirmatory safety and efficacy trial in patients 6 months to < 18 years of age.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
The safety and efficacy of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in patients with CNS 
involvement is unknown. Therefore, the applicant is requested to submit the results of the 
Study ML29155: Phase 2 Study of Cobimetinib in Combination with Vemurafenib in Active 
Melanoma Brain Metastases (coBRIM-B). Deadline: 31 December 2019.

The causal relationship of a reported adverse event to cobimetinib was based on the comparative 
incidence of adverse events in patients treated with cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib 
(active arm) and vemurafenib plus placebo (control arm).  The criteria by which cobimetinib ADRs 
were defined are adverse events (all grades) that occurred with a ≥ 5% incidence over the control arm 
or Grades 3-4 adverse events with an incidence of ≥ 2% over the control arm were assessed as

causally related with cobimetinib. Thus, these are considered ADRs for the product. Adverse events 
that did not meet the ADR criteria of a ≥ 5% incidence over the control arm for all Grades or Grades 3-
4 adverse events with an incidence of ≥ 2% over the control arm, or occurred at the same or lower 
frequency in the active arm compared to the control arm (e.g., fatigue, cough, dysgeusia, headache, 
and arthralgia) were not considered as causally related to cobimetinib. Amongst all adverse events 
reported in study GO28141, causality was not assessed for both cobimetinib and vemurafenib as a 
combination together because of the lack of a pure placebo treatment arm, and therefore no ADRs are 
considered as combination ADRs. The exception to the above criteria were events of cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), keratoacanthomas and other hyperkeratotic skin lesions, which are 
well-recognised toxicities associated with BRAF inhibitors, including vemurafenib and, therefore, were 
considered ADRs with cobimetinib. The list of ADRs for cobimetinib treatment is displayed in Table 57.

RVO = Retinal Vein Occlusion 
Ocular events 
This broader term has been introduced and include AESIs of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), serous 
retinopathy, and other Grade ≥ 2 visual disturbances. 
One patient in each arm experienced an event that fell in the retinal vein occlusion (RVO) group terms 
between the clinical cut-off dates: one Grade 3 event of retinal ischemia in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm which resulted in discontinuation of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib, and one 
Grade 1 event of retinal vascular disorder in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm which did not result in 
any dose modification or discontinuation of either placebo or vemurafenib. 
The frequency of serous retinopathy AEs in Study GO28141 was similar between the two clinical cut-
offs, and remained higher in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm than in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm. The majority of these events remained Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Regarding Grade ≥ 2 Visual Disturbances (not including RVO or serous retinopathy events), the 
preferred terms included 1 event each of visual impairment, uveitis, cataract, iridocyclitis, diplopia, eye

irritation, maculopathy, retinal degeneration, and corneal edema. All of the new events were Grade 2, 
and were not suggestive of serous retinopathy or RVO. 
Grade ≥ 3 Photosensitivity 
In Study GO28141, Grade ≥ 3 photosensitivity events were reported only in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm. Review of photosensitivity events included the preferred terms of photosensitivity 
reaction, solar dermatitis, and sunburn.  These events were reported, respectively, in 6 patients 
(2.4%), 1 patient (0.4%), and 1 patient (0.4%). The overall pattern of Grade ≥ 3 photosensitivity 
events in the safety update is consistent with data originally reported. 
Grade ≥ 2 reduction in LVEF 
In Study GO28141, all reported AEs of reduction in LVEF were Grade 2 or Grade 3. The frequency of  
Grade ≥ 2 reduction in LVEF events was higher in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (17 [6.7%] 
patients) than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (7 [2.9%] patients). 
As a result of these AEs in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, 2 patients discontinued cobimetinib, 
3 patients had dose interruptions of cobimetinib, 4 patients had dose reductions of cobimetinib, and 
one patient had dose interruption of vemurafenib. The events were considered resolved in 15 of 17 
patients at the clinical cutoff. 
As a result of the AEs in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, 2 patients discontinued from placebo, 2 
had dose interruptions of placebo, 1 had a dose reduction of placebo, and 1 had a dose interruption of 
vemurafenib. The events were considered resolved in 3 out of 7 patients at the clinical cutoff date. 
Grade ≥ 3 Liver Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
Elevations in liver laboratory tests and liver injury have been associated with vemurafenib use (see 
vemurafenib SmPC). Therefore , Study GO28141 considers Grade ≥ 3 liver laboratory test 
abnormalities an adverse event of special interest. 
Liver laboratory test abnormalities (Grade ≥ 3) were reported more frequently in patients who received 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than in patients who received placebo plus vemurafenib (20.5% vs. 
15.1%). The Grade ≥ 3 liver laboratory test abnormalities that occurred at a ≥ 2% frequency in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm were ALT increased (11.4% vs 6.3%), AST increased (8.3% vs 
2.1%), and alkaline phosphatase increased (4.3% vs 1.7%). There was a <2% difference between the 
two arms for the events of GGT increased, bilirubin increased, liver function test abnormal, and 
transaminase increased. A patient who received cobimetinib plus vemurafenib was reported to have an 
AE of drug induced liver injury. 
The overall pattern of elevations in liver laboratory tests in the safety update is consistent with data 
originally reported. 
Grade ≥ 3 QTc Interval Prolongation 
In Study GO28141, the incidence of potential Grade ≥ 3 QTc prolongation group term events was 
comparable between the two arms, with events occurring in 1.6% of patients in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm and 1.7% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. One patient from each study arm 
discontinued both study drugs because of Grade ≥ 3 QTc prolongation. Additionally, two events of 
syncope and one report of cardiac arrest were reported in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, and 1 
report of syncope was reported in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. None of the patients with reports 
of syncope or Grade 5 cardiac arrest had concurrent AEs of QTc prolongation reported. 0.4% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 104/139 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 1.3% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm had 
events reported with the specific preferred term “electrocardiogram QT prolonged”.  
Any Cutaneous Malignancy 
At the original cut-off date (09 May 2014), all cutaneous primary malignancy events in Study GO28141 
were reported as Grade 3, as directed in the study protocol. The incidence of any cutaneous primary 
malignancy was lower in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (8.3%) than in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm (19.7%). The most common cutaneous malignancies observed were squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin and keratoacanthoma, reported at lower frequencies among patients treated with 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (2.8% and 0.8%, respectively) than among patients treated with placebo 
plus vemurafenib (11.3% and 8.4%, respectively). No patients in either treatment arm discontinued 
the study or cobimetinib or vemurafenib treatment due to a cutaneous malignancy adverse event. As 
of the clinical cut-off date for the safety update, time to first incidence of cuSCC or KA events 
continued to be delayed in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm compared with the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm, with medians of 4.3 months vs. 1.9 months, respectively, compared with 3.3 vs. 1.8 
months. In Study GO28141, the frequency of basal cell carcinoma BCC remained higher in patients in 
the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (4.5% vs. 2.4%). 
Grade ≥ 3 Rash 
The frequency of rash in Study GO28141 was similar in both treatment arms, with Grade ≥ 3 rash 
reported in 16.1% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and in 15.9% of the placebo 
plus vemurafenib arm (cut-off 09 May 2014). The incidences of individual preferred terms, including 
(most commonly) maculo-papular rash and rash, were also similar between the two treatment arms. 
Diarrhea 
At the safety update cut-off date, diarrhoea (preferred term) remained as the most commonly reported 
AE in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm: sixteen patients (6.5%) in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm experienced Grade 3 diarrhoea vs. 2 patients (0.8%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib 
arm. The number of SAEs of diarrhoea remained unchanged between the cut-off dates.  
The events of diarrhoea (all grades) occurred earlier during treatment in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm when compared to the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. The median time to first event 
of diarrhoea was 0.4 month in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 2.0 months in the placebo 
plus vemurafenib arm. 
Haemorrhage 
The incidence  of hemorrhagic events was higher in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (13.0%) 
than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (7.3%) in study GO28141. In both treatment arms, the 
majority of the hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious. 
Pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease 
In all, there were 5 cases of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease reported in study GO28141. A causal 
relation to cobimetinib and vemurafenib was suspected in 2 serious cases. No new pneumonitis events 
occurred in either arm in Study GO28141 or in Study NO25395. 
Hypertension 
At the safety update cut-off date, events of hypertension were reported in 39 patients (15.8%) in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and in 20 patients (8.1%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm in 
study GO28141. One new SAE of hypertensive crisis (baseline blood pressure 126/77 mmHg) was 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 105/139 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, which resolved with treatment (medications), and 
the study drug doses were not changed. The majority of hypertension events were Grade 1 or 2, with a 
higher proportion of these occurring in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (10.5% vs. 5.7%), and 
there were no Grade 4 or 5 events in either group. Upon analysis, there was no apparent correlation 
between cases of hypertension and those of LVEF reduction. 
Hyperglycemia 
At the safety update, 11 patients (4.5%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 3 patients 
(1.2%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm of study GO28141 reported events of hyperglycemia. The 
majority of events in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm were non-serious and Grade 1 or 2 and no 
new Grade ≥ 3 events were reported between the two clinical cut-off dates.

Laboratory findings 
At the original data cut-off date (09 May 2014), in patients with normal alkaline phosphatase values at 
baseline, elevation of alkaline phosphatase above the normal range occurred 63.0 % vs. 44.6 % in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm vs. the placebo arm, respectively; the proportion who had a worst 
grade of ≥ 3 during treatment was 15/248 (6%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 7/232 
(3%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
In patients with normal ALT values at baseline, elevation of ALT above the normal range occurred in 
more patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (63.4% vs. 50.5%); the proportion with a 
worst grade of ≥ 3 during treatment was 23/248 (9%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 
12/234 (5%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
Elevation of AST above the normal range occurred in a greater proportion of patients in the cobimetinib 
plus vemurafenib arm (66.8% vs. 41.3%); the proportion with a worst grade of ≥ 3 during treatment 
was 14/244 (5.7%) patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 5/230 (2.2%) in the placebo 
plus vemurafenib arm. 
In patients with normal bilirubin values at baseline, elevation of bilirubin above the normal range was 
less common in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (29.2%) than in the placebo plus vemurafenib

arm (40.5%); subjects with a worst grade of ≥ 3 were 5/249 (2%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib 
arm and 2/234 (0.9%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
In patients with normal GGT levels at baseline, elevation of GGT above the normal range occurred with 
similar frequency in the two arms (48.8% and 47.7% in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm, respectively); the proportion with a worst grade of ≥ 3 during treatment 
was 47/244 (19.2%) and 36/227 (15.8%) patients in the respective arms. 
For patients with normal CPK values at baseline, elevations of CPK above the normal range occurred in 
a greater proportion of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (64.8%) than in the placebo 
plus vemurafenib arm (9.9%). 
Reductions of lymphocytes below the normal range at some time during the study occurred in 55.6% 
of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm  and 35.0% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm; 
events of Grade ≥ 3 occurred in 18/191 (9.4%) and 11/175 (6.2%) of patients in the respective arms. 
Reductions in neutrophils occurred 6.4% on the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 7.9% in the 
control arm. 
In patients with normal creatinine levels at baseline, elevation of creatinine above normal range 
occurred in 45.3% of subjects in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 42.5% in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm: grade 3 elevations occurred in 7/250 (2.8%) and 2/236 (0.8%) patients in the 
respective arms. There were no Grade 4 elevations of creatinine. 
Mean changes from baseline for QTcF at the Cycle 6 assessment ranged from 13.0 ms in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm to 14.0 ms in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. The maximum 
change from baseline QTcF exceeded 60 ms for 6 patients (2.4%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib 
arm and 1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. QTcF prolongation of > 500 ms 
occurred in 4 patients (1.6%) and in 1 patient (0.4%) in the respective arms. None of the patients with 
a mean QTcF value > 500 ms at any post-baseline assessment or with a maximum change in mean 
QTcF value > 60 ms from baseline at any post-baseline assessment had a reported adverse event of 
QTc prolongation Grade ≥ 3. Based on the criteria listed in the NCI CTCAE version 4 for ECG QT 
prolongation, the incidence of patients with Grade 1 − 3 ECG QT prolongation was: for Grade 1 (QTcF 
450 − 480 ms), 30 patients (11.8%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 20 (8.4%) in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm; for Grade 2 (QTcF 481 − 500 ms), 3 patients (0.8%) in the cobimetinib 
plus vemurafenib arm and 6 (2.5%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm; for Grade 3 QTcF (> 501 ms 
on at least two separate ECGs), 1 patient (0.4%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, no patients 
in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
Regarding the median LVEF values, the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm had a median decrease of 
3% from baseline and no change was reported in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. For 82.8% of 
patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 88.7% of patients in the placebo plus 
vemurafenib arm, the worst change from baseline in LVEF value was < 10%. Of the patients in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm who experienced a decrease from baseline of > 10%, the worst 
absolute value of LVEF remained ≥ 50% for 28 patients (11.7%). In addition, 4.2% of subjects in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm experienced both a > 10% decrease from baseline and a worst 
absolute LVEF value < 50% vs. 1.7% of the placebo plus vemurafenib arm; no patient in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm experienced a worst absolute LVEF value lower than 40% vs 2 
patients of the placebo plus vemurafenib arm.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A drug-drug interaction study (GP28620, a Phase 1, Open-Label Study) was conducted to investigate 
the effect of itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) on cobimetinib pharmacokinetics in healthy 
subjects. The following cobimetinib PK parameters were altered with co-administration of itraconazole 
(QD oral dose of 200 mg itraconazole on Days 4 to 14) with cobimetinib (single dose oral 
administration of 10 mg): median tmax was delayed by 2 hours; t1/2 was prolonged from 54.1 to 118 
hours; Cmax increased by 3.2-fold; AUC0-∞ increased by 6.6-fold (see pharmacology section).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety assessment of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib is based on 376 patients from 2 
studies, i.e. the phase Ib NO25395 (n=129) and the phase III GO28141 (n=247) studies. In the 
updated safety report (submitted as an Appendix to Response to Q 56, D120 LoQ), mean/median 
exposure to cobimetinib in the 2 studies was 313/211 days (NO25395) and 243/267 days (GO28141). 
Mean exposure in the phase 1 MEK4592 cobimetinib monotherapy study was ~2 months (67 days). 
In the original report, the most common AEs that occurred with higher frequency in the cobimetinib 
plus vemurafenib arm, compared with the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, include diarrhoea (56.7% vs. 
28.0%), nausea (39.0% vs. 23.8%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (29.9% vs. 2.9%), 
photosensitivity reaction (28.3% vs. 15.9%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (22.0% vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 112/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.6%), and vomiting (21.3% vs. 12.1%). This pattern was unchanged in the Safety Update Report, 
although the incidences were now somewhat higher (probably due to the longer exposure). 
Common AEs that occurred with higher frequency in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm than in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm include arthralgia (40.2% vs. 32.7%), alopecia (29.3% vs. 13.8%), 
and hyperkeratosis (28.5% vs. 10.2%). 
In the cobimetinib monotherapy study MEK4592g  the most frequent AEs among all subjects were 
diarrhoea (67.0%), fatigue (50.4%), rash (49.6%), nausea, vomiting (33.9% each), oedema 
peripheral (28.7%), abdominal pain (24%) and constipation (21%). 
The temporal pattern in relation to treatment start of the most common AEs and grade ≥3 AEs in the 
two arms of study GO28141 and the BRAFi-naïve patients in study NO25395 was further analysed. 
The majority of common AEs and Grade ≥3 AEs reported in BRAFi-naïve patients dosing with 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in the GO28141 and NO25395 studies had highest incidence in the first 1 
– 3 Cycles on treatment and decreased to low levels thereafter. This patterns was seen in diarrhoea, 
nausea and vomiting, serous retinopathy/retinal detachment, photosensitivity, blood creatinine 
phosphokinase (CPK) increased, ALT increased, AST increased, pyrexia, rash, arthralgia, and fatigue. 
In most of the AEs (underlined), the increase in incidence during early cycles was clearly more 
pronounced in the cobimetinib + vemurafenib arm compared to the placebo + vemurafenib arm, and a 
similar pattern was found in BRAFi-naïve patients in study NO25395. Cases of serous retinopathy have 
been reported in patients treated with Cotellic (see section 4.4.) For patients reporting new or 
worsening visual disturbances, an ophthalmologic examination is recommended. Serous retinopathy 
can be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see 
Table 1 in section 4.2) (SmPC section 4.8). Therefore ocular events related to serous retinopathy (e.g. 
retinal detachment) have been included in the RMP as an important identified risk. The safety risk in 
patients with pre-existing retinal pathology or risk factors for retinal vein occlusion has been described 
as missing information. The risk will be monitored through PSURs and a recommendation was 
highlighted in the PL for patients to discuss with their HCP if they have eye problems. Diarrhoea has 
also been included as an important identified risk and will be managed through a warning included in 
section 4.4. Cases of Grade ≥3 and serious diarrhoea have been reported in patients treated with 
Cotellic. Diarrhoea should be managed with antidiarrhoeal agents and supportive care. For Grade ≥3 
diarrhoea that occurs despite supportive care, Cotellic and vemurafenib should be withheld until 
diarrhoea has improved to Grade ≤1. If Grade ≥3 diarrhoea recurs, the dose of Cotellic and 
vemurafenib should be reduced (see section 4.2). 
Bleeding events have been reported more frequently in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm than in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all types and Grades: 10% vs 6%). Higher frequencies in the Cotellic 
plus vemurafenib arm were observed for cerebral haemorrhage (1% vs 0%), gastrointestinal tract 
haemorrhage (3% vs 1%), reproductive system haemorrhage (2% vs 1%) and haematuria (2% vs 
1%). The majority of events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious (9% of patients in the Cotellic plus 
vemurafenib arm vs 5% patients in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm). Grade 3-5 events were 
experienced by 1% and 0.4% of patients, respectively. The median time to first onset was 2.8 months 
(range 0.0 to 12.7 months) in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm (SmPC section 4.8).  
No clear temporal pattern was seen for the common AEs alopecia, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) 
Increased, Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin, Keratoacanthoma (KA) and Hyperkeratosis. These 
AEs, with the notable exception of Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Increased, were clearly more 
common in the placebo + vemurafenib arm in study GO28141.  
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 113/139 
 
 
 
 
 
In the originally submitted data, the most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs that occurred at higher frequency 
(≥ 2% difference) in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, compared with patients 
treated with placebo plus vemurafenib, were, respectively, ALT increased (11.4% vs. 6.3% of 
patients), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (10.2% vs. 0%), AST increased (8.3% v 2.1%), 
diarrhoea (6.3% vs. 0%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (4.3% vs. 1.7%), hyponatremia (2.4% 
vs. 0.4%), photosensitivity reaction (2.4% vs. 0%), and retinal detachment (2.4% vs. 0%). Liver 
laboratory abnormalities, specifically ALT, AST, and ALP have been observed in patients treated with 
Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib (see section 4.4).  Liver laboratory tests should be monitored 
before initiation of combination treatment and monthly during treatment, or more frequently if 
clinically indicated (see section 4.2). Photosensitivity has been observed with a higher frequency in the 
Cotellic plus vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (41% vs 31%).  The majority of events 
were Grades 1 or 2, with Grade ≥3 events occurring in 3% of patients in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib 
arm vs 0% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm.  There were no apparent trends in the time of onset 
of Grade ≥3 events. Grade ≥3 photosensitivity events in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm were 
treated with primary topical medicinal products in conjunction with dose interruptions of both 
cobimetinib and vemurafenib (see section 4.2). No evidence of phototoxicity was observed with Cotellic 
as a single agent (SmPC section 4.8). Therefore, photosensitivity has been included in the RMP as an 
important identified risk. 
Decrease in LVEF from baseline has been reported in patients receiving Cotellic (see section 4.4). LVEF 
should be evaluated before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, then after the first 
month of treatment and at least every 3 months or as clinically indicated until treatment 
discontinuation.  Decrease in LVEF from baseline can be managed using treatment interruption, dose 
reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2) (SmPC section 4.8). Therefore, left 
ventricular dysfunction (including decreased LVEF and cardiomyopathy) has been included in the RMP 
as an important identified risk. 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs that occurred at a higher frequency in patients treated with placebo 
plus vemurafenib, compared with patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, were, 
respectively, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (11.3% vs. 2.4%), keratoacanthoma (7.5% vs. 
0.8%), arthralgia (5.0% vs. 2.4%), myalgia (2.5% vs. 0.4%), and hyperkeratosis (2.1% vs. 0%). 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with a lower frequency in the Cotellic plus 
vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all Grade: 3% vs 11%).  Keratoacanthoma has been 
reported with a lower frequency in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all 
Grade: 1% vs 8%). Hyperkeratosis has been reported with a lower frequency in the Cotellic plus 
vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all Grade: 10% vs 29%) (SmPC section 4.8). 
These patterns were largely unchanged in the Safety Update Report, with the exception of grade ≥3 
hypertension, increased blood ALP, and BCC, where the incidence in the cobimetinib + vemurafenib 
arm were now ≥2 % higher than in the placebo arm. 
A significant difference in the incidence of elevated Blood Creatine Phosphokinase Increased between 
the two treatment arms in study GO28141. There were 2 cases of rhabdomyolysis observed in study 
GO28141 (1 in each treatment arm) and no cases were reported in Study NO25395. Asymptomatic 
increases in blood CPK levels were observed with a higher frequency in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib 
arm vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm in Study GO28141 (see section 4.2). One event of 
rhabdomyolysis was observed in each treatment arm of the Study with concurrent increases in blood 
CPK (SmPC section 4.8). Therefore, rhabdomyolysis has been included as an important potential risk in 
the RMP.

The majority of deaths were due to PD and there were no patterns with respect to the type of Grade 5 
events reported, and for majority of these events, the patient’s underlying disease was considered to 
contribute to the cause of the event. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (SmPC section 
4.3). Cotellic has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have 
been reported in some patients treated with cobimetinib during clinical trials (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or 
any other adverse effects that may affect their ability (SmPC section 4.7). 
The majority of patients in Study GO28141 were below 65 years of age. Patients aged 65-74, 75-84, 
and 85+ accounted for 17.3%, 6.7%, and 1.6% of patients, respectively in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm, and 18.8%, 8.8%, and 0.4%, respectively in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. 
Thus there were small sample sizes in each subgroup. In general, safety findings were consistent with 
the findings reported in the GO28141 CSR for the overall study population but the frequencies of 
serious AEs in both study arms were higher among older patients (above 65 years). Frequencies of AEs 
leading to discontinuation of cobimetinib/placebo, hospitalization, and Sum of the [incidence of] AEs 
postural hypotension, falls, black outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, and fractures were also higher in 
cobimetinib-treated older patients than in age-matched patients in the control arm. In addition, a 
numerically greater percentage of patients aged 65-74 and 75-84, compared to patients below 65 
years of age, reported a clinically meaningful decrease in global health status, in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm.  In the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, there were no trends in decrease in global 
health status by age group. Thus, although the experience in patients ≥65 years is limited, tolerability 
seems to be more restricted in this age group. In the Phase III study with Cotellic in combination with 
vemurafenib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (n=254), 189 patients (74%) were 
<65 years of age, and 44 patients (17%) were age 65-74 years of age, 17 (7%) were 75-84 years of 
age, and 4 patients (2%) were aged ≥85 years   The proportion of patients experiencing adverse 
events (AE) was similar in the patients aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years.  Patients ≥65 years 
were more likely to experience serious adverse events (SAEs) and experience AEs leading to 
discontinuation of cobimetinib than those <65 years (SmPC section 4.8). 
Based on the results from population PK analysis, exposure-response analysis for efficacy and safety, 
and physiologically-based PK simulations, cobimetinib may be administered with mild CYP3A inhibitors 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 115/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
without any dose adjustment. Caution should be exercised when cobimetinib is administered with 
moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A.  Co-administration of strong inhibitors or strong inducers 
with cobimetinib should be avoided. 
No pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with renal impairment has been conducted. Dose adjustment is 
not recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment based on the results of the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Cotellic should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (SmPC section 4.8). 
No pharmacokinetic data in subjects with hepatic impairment are available (SmPC section 4.8). Thus, 
the CHMP has requested that the applicant submits the results of study GP29342, a Phase I, open 
label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of cobimetinib in subjects with 
mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. 
The safety and efficacy of Cotellic in non-Caucasian patients have not been established (SmPC section 
4.2). 
There are no data from the use of Cotellic in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
embryolethality and foetal malformations of the great vessel and skull (see section 5.3). Cotellic should 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful consideration of the needs of 
the mother and the risk to the foetus (SmPC section 4.6).  It is not known whether cobimetinib is 
excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision should 
be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue Cotellic therapy, taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman (SmPC section 4.6). 
There are no data in humans for cobimetinib. In animals, no fertility studies have been performed, but 
adverse effects were seen on female reproductive organs (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of 
this is unknown (SmPC section 4.6). The use of the cobimetinib and vemurafenib in pregnancy and 
lactation has been included as missing information in the RMP. 
Discontinuations for adverse events (AEs) in Study GO28141, and AEs leading to dose interruptions 
and reductions in both studies GO28141 and NO25395, had highest incidence in the first 1-3 cycles 
and were of lower frequency thereafter. The discontinuation rates for AE for both study treatments, 
were higher for the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (15.0%) than for the vemurafenib plus placebo 
arm (8.1%), compared with discontinuation rates of 12.6% and 11.7%, respectively. Likewise, the 
frequency of dose modification or interruption of cobimetinib or placebo, of vemurafenib, or of both 
drugs in the respective regimens was higher in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (54.7%, 58.3%, 
44.5%, respectively) than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (37.0%, 49.2%, 35.4%, respectively). 
In study NO25395 among the BRAFi-naïve patients (at the safety update), the frequencies of AEs 
leading to reduction or interruption of cobimetinib, of vemurafenib, or of both study drugs were 63.5%, 
76.2% and 60.3%, respectively. 
The rather high frequency of discontinuations and the remarkably high rate of dose 
interruptions/reductions due to AEs clearly indicate a limited tolerability of cobimetinib in combination 
with vemurafenib. The nature of the AEs that led to either drug interruptions/dose reductions or drug 
discontinuations appear to be largely overlapping in preferred terms/SOC and also showed a 
preference to occur during the early treatment cycles. Although most of these AEs were reversible and 
could be clinically managed, i.e. by dose interruption, dose reductions, and standard clinical measures, 
close monitoring during especially early cycles and in certain sub-groups, e.g. elderly, seems to be 
justified. 
The decision on whether to reduce the dose for either or both treatments should be based on the  
prescriber’s assessment of individual patient safety or tolerability. Dose modification of Cotellic is 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 116/139 
 
 
 
 
 
independent of vemurafenib dose modification. If doses are omitted for toxicity, these doses should not 
be replaced (SmPC section 4.2). Once the dose has been reduced, it should not be increased at a later 
time. Table 1 in the SmPC section 4.2 gives general Cotellic dose modification guidance (SmPC section 
4.2). 
Permanent discontinuation of Cotellic treatment should be considered if cardiac symptoms are 
attributed to Cotellic and do not improve after temporary interruption (SmPC section 4.2). Table 2 of 
the SmPC provides recommendation on dose modifications for Cotellic in patients with left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease from baseline (SmPC section 4.2). The risk of safety in patients with 
cardiac impairment (including congestive heart failure, current unstable angina, or left ventricular 
ejection fraction < 50%) has been included in the RMP as missing information. The risk will be 
managed through recommendations for dose reduction and treatment discontinuation guidance for left 
ventricular dysfunction as described in section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration) and a 
warning has been included in section 4.4. 
Vemurafenib treatment can be continued when Cotellic treatment is modified, if clinically indicated 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
Dose modification advice for Cotellic when used with vemurafenib (SmPC section 4.2) 
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
For Grade 1 and 2 liver laboratory abnormalities, Cotellic and vemurafenib should be continued at the 
prescribed dose. 
Grade 3: Cotellic should be continued at the prescribed dose.  The dose of vemurafenib may be 
reduced as clinically appropriate.  Please refer to the vemurafenib SmPC. 
Grade 4: 
Cotellic treatment and vemurafenib treatment should be interrupted. If liver laboratory abnormalities 
improve to Grade ≤1 within 4 weeks, Cotellic should be restarted at a dose reduced by 20 mg and 
vemurafenib at a clinically appropriate dose, per its SmPC.   
Cotellic treatment and vemurafenib treatment should be discontinued if liver laboratory abnormalities 
do not resolve to Grade ≤1 within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 liver laboratory abnormalities recur after initial 
improvement. 
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations 
Cotellic dosing does not need to be modified or interrupted to manage asymptomatic CPK elevations.  
Photosensitivity 
Grade ≤2 (tolerable) photosensitivity should be managed with supportive care.   
Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 photosensitivity: Cotellic and vemurafenib should be interrupted 
until resolution to Grade ≤1. Treatment can be restarted with no change in Cotellic dose. Vemurafenib 
dosing should be reduced as clinically appropriate, please refer to its SmPC for further information.  
Rash 
Rash events may occur with either Cotellic or vemurafenib treatment.  The dose of Cotellic and/or 
vemurafenib may be either temporarily interrupted and/or reduced as clinically indicated.   
Additionally, for: 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015

–  Grade ≤2 (tolerable) rash should be managed with supportive care. Cotellic dosing can be 
continued without modification. 
–  Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 acneiform rash: General dose modification recommendations in 
Table 1 for Cotellic should be followed. Vemurafenib dosing can be continued when Cotellic 
treatment is modified (if clinically indicated).  
–  Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 non-acneiform or maculopapular rash: Cotellic dosing can be 
continued without modification if clinically indicated. Vemurafenib dosing may be either temporarily 
interrupted and/or reduced, please refer to its SmPC for further information. 
There is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. In case of suspected overdose, 
cobimetinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. There is no specific antidote for 
overdosage with cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.8). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V (SmPC section 4.8). 
Long-term safety has been identified as missing information in the RMP. The safety will be monitored 
through regular PSURs. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety assessment of cobimetinib in metastatic melanoma rests mainly upon clinical data on 376 
patients subjected to combined treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib. Common side effects 
encountered in the studies are e.g. diarrhoea, rash, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, arthralgia, pyrexia, 
photosensitivity reactions. Elevations of laboratory parameters e.g. LFT (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP) and 
blood creatine phosphokinase are also very often seen. While many of these occur frequently during 
monotherapy with vemurafenib, the net effect of the addition of cobimetinib varies between an 
increase (e.g. for diarrhoea, nausea, and photosensitivity reactions) and a decrease in frequency (e.g. 
for arthralgia, hyperkeratosis, and alopecia). In a few cases, e.g. ocular events, grade ≥3 
photosensitivity reactions, elevation in blood creatine phosphokinase, the AE seems preferentially 
associated with cobimetinib. 
There appears to be an increased incidence of ADRs in the first 1 – 3 cycles on treatment compared to 
later cycles. This pattern was observed in diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, serous retinopathy/retinal 
detachment, photosensitivity, blood creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, ALT increased, AST 
increased, pyrexia, rash, arthralgia, and fatigue.  The frequent discontinuations (almost 20 % in the 
cobimetinib + vemurafenib arm) discontinued at least one study drug due to AEs) and very frequent 
dose interruptions/reductions (≥60 % interrupted dose or reduced the dose of at least 1 study drug) in 
the pivotal study GO28141, reflected this temporal pattern of the incidence of ADRs. Reduced doses of 
cobimetinib or vemurafenib may have contributed to the decreased incidence of AEs in later treatment 
cycles. Thus, close monitoring of patients and implementation of dose interruptions/reductions is 
included as recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
In conclusion, safety and tolerability of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment 
of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma appears acceptable and clinically manageable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Cotellic (COBIMETINIB) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
The pivotal study for the present application is for all practical purposes the randomised, placebo-
controlled Phase III trial GO28141, “coBRIM”. The final CSR from this study was submitted on Day 
121. Updated efficacy and safety analyses were also provided in responses to questions; no p-values 
were provided due to the exploratory nature of these analyses.  
Cobimetinib is an orally available and selective small molecule inhibitor of the mitogen-activated 
protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2, central components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction 
pathway. The clinical development was based on the observation that resistance to BRAF inhibition 
therapy is often caused by reactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway through activation of downstream 
MEK. Combination of a BRAF inhibitor, such as vemurafenib, and a MEK inhibitor, such as cobimetinib, 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 132/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could therefore potentially address major mechanisms of resistance. However, the results indicate that 
while the occurrence of vemurafenib resistance is significantly delayed by the upfront addition of 
cobimetinib, preformed vemurafenib-resistance can in most cases not be overcome by the subsequent 
addition of cobimetinib. 
Beneficial effects 
The Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM was a I:I-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
vemurafenib plus placebo vs. vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in BRAF V600-mutation positive patients 
with unresectable melanoma previously untreated for locally advanced or metastatic disease. The 
study met its primary endpoint with a hazard ratio (HR) for investigator-based PFS (with 
stratifications) of 0.51 (95% CI 0.39, 0.68; log-rank p<0.0001) in favour of the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm. An updated PFS analysis performed at an event rate of 65% and with data cut-off 8 
months after the primary analysis showed a HR= 0.58 (95% CI: 0:46; 0.72), with a difference in 
medians PFS across treatment arms of 5.0 months (12.25 vs. 7.2 months) in favour of the 
combination therapy.  
The planned interim analysis showed OS HR=0.645 (stratified analysis, p=0.05) and 0.62 (unstratified 
analysis, p=0.03) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. The event rate at the time of the 
pre-planned interim analysis was 17%. However, the results did not cross the pre-specified boundary 
for statistical significance. A consistent HR was observed in the updated OS analysis: 0.650 (stratified), 
with narrower confidence intervals than in the primary analysis. This analysis was performed at an 
event rate of 38%, and is considered supportive but still immature at this stage. 
The confirmed ORR was 69.6% (95% CI:  63.5%, 75.3%) versus 50.0% (95% CI: 43.6%, 56.4%), 
respectively, i.e. a difference of 20%. Complete response was observed in 16% of patients in the 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 11% of patients in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. The 
median duration of response in patients treated with cobimetinib + vemurafenib was not reached at 
the time of the clinical cut-off in May 2014, (95% CI: 9.3 months, not estimable) and an updated 
analysis has not been provided. In the placebo + vemurafenib arm, the median duration of response 
was 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.8 months, not estimable). It should be noted that the median duration of 
follow-up for all patients in the study was 7.3 months. 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) indicated no detrimental impact by cobimetinib plus vemurafenib 
treatment on global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Generally numerically higher 
responder rates were observed for cobimetinib plus vemurafenib compared with placebo plus 
vemurafenib, but differences were generally small, indicating similarity in HRQoL between the two 
treatment arms. 
Subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results, with nearly all HR point estimates below 
1.0 and near the overall HR of 0.51. 
In the Phase 1b study NO25395/BRIM7 of cobimetinib + vemurafenib, the median follow-up time was 
9.5 months. In the BRAFi-naïve patient group (n꞊63), the (confirmed) objective response rate was 
87%, including a complete response in 10% of patients. The median duration of response was 12.5 
months. The objective response rate in the vemurafenib-progressed patients was 15% (95% CI: 7.5, 
25.5); with median duration of response in responding patients at 6.7 months whereas for BRAFi-naive 
patients, ORR was 84.6% (95%CI: 69.9, 93.1) with a median duration of response of 11.3 months. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the phase III study GO28141/coBRIM, the efficacy of cobimetinib was primarily investigated in 
patients that were naïve to BRAF inhibitor treatment. Therefore, most of the data in patients previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/685908/2015  
Page 133/139 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with BRAF inhibitors is derived from the phase 1b study NO25395/BRIM7, where half of the 
patients enrolled had progressed after vemurafenib treatment. The activity of the cobimetinib + 
vemurafenib combination in patients who had progressed on prior vemurafenib therapy was low, with 
ORR around 15% overall (n=66), and 26% in patients receiving the intended dose (n=27). Thus, it 
appears that the combination treatment did not overcome the resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy as 
the response was low. Therefore, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that there is 
limited data in patients that have progressed following BRAF inhibitor therapy and that other treatment 
options should be considered before treatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated 
population. The sequence of treatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been 
established.  
A key exclusion criterion for study GO28141 was the exclusion of patients with active CNS metastasis. 
Patients with treated CNS lesions and no evidence of progression could be included. As a result, only 3 
patients with CNS lesions were treated (2 in combination group, 1 in control group). A warning that the 
efficacy and safety of combination therapy in the treatment of brain metastases has not been studied 
and that the intracranial activity of cobimetinib is currently unknown has been included in section 4.4.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs that occurred with higher frequency in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm of 
the pivotal study GO28141, compared with the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, include diarrhoea 
(56.7% vs. 28.0%), nausea (39.0% vs. 23.8%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (29.9% vs. 
2.9%), photosensitivity reaction (28.3% vs. 15.9%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased 
(22.0% vs. 12.6%), and vomiting (21.3% vs. 12.1%). Common AEs that occurred with higher 
frequency in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm than in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm include 
arthralgia (40.2% vs. 32.7%), alopecia (29.3% vs. 13.8%), and hyperkeratosis (28.5% vs. 10.2%). 
In the cobimetinib monotherapy study MEK4592g  the most frequent AEs among all subjects were 
diarrhoea (67.0%), fatigue (50.4%), rash (49.6%), nausea, vomiting (33.9% each), oedema 
peripheral (28.7%), abdominal pain (24%) and constipation (21%). 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs that occurred at a higher frequency in patients treated with placebo 
plus vemurafenib, compared with patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, were, 
respectively, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (11.3% vs. 2.4%), keratoacanthoma (7.5% vs. 
0.8%), arthralgia (5.0% vs. 2.4%), myalgia (2.5% vs. 0.4%), and hyperkeratosis (2.1% vs. 0%). 
Several important identified risks have been identified. Cases of serous retinopathy have been reported 
in patients treated with cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.4.) For patients reporting new or worsening visual 
disturbances, an ophthalmologic examination is recommended. Serous retinopathy can be managed 
with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (SmPC section 4.2) 
(SmPC section 4.8).  Decrease in LVEF from baseline has been reported in patients receiving 
cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.4). LVEF should be evaluated before initiation of treatment to establish 
baseline values, then after the first month of treatment and at least every 3 months or as clinically 
indicated until treatment discontinuation.  Decrease in LVEF from baseline can be managed using 
treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Photosensitivity has been observed with a higher frequency in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib vs 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm (41% vs 31%).  The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2, with Grade 
≥3 events occurring in 3% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm vs 0% in the placebo 
plus vemurafenib arm.  This risk will be managed through recommendations in the SmPC section 4.2 
for dose interruptions of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib.

Cases of Grade ≥3 and serious diarrhoea have been reported in patients treated with Cotellic. 
Diarrhoea should be managed with antidiarrhoeal agents and supportive care (SmPC section 4.4). 
There were several important potential risks (rhabdomyolysis, serious hepatotoxicity, impaired female 
fertility, teratogenicity and developmental toxicity) that have been identified in the RMP. These will be 
managed through SmPC recommendations in the SmPC (section 4.2, 4.6 and 4.8) and through routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There were several missing information that have been included as part of the RMP. The long term 
safety of cobimetinib will be evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the PSURs.  
Further information on safety in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment will be 
provided by the submission of PK/ Safety study GP29342, in subjects with mild, moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects, (See RMP). Currently, the risk will be managed 
through dose reduction and treatment discontinuation guidance as described in the SmPC Section 4.2.  
The safety in patients with cardiac impairment (including congestive heart failure, current unstable 
angina, or left ventricular ejection fraction <50%) will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance 
(SmPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). The safety in patients with pre-existing retinal pathology or risk 
factors for retinal vein occlusion will be also be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.  
The safety and long-term efficacy in patients with CNS involvement will be followed up in study 
ML29155, a phase 2 study of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in active melanoma brain 
metastases (coBRIM-B) to determine the safety and efficacy of cobimetinib in combination with 
vemurafenib in patients with active melanoma brain metastases (See RMP).  
Drug-drug interactions (with CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYPC19 and CYP2D6) will be 
evaluated in the in vitro CYP time-dependent inhibition study (15-1983), (See RMP).  
The use of cobimetinib in patients < 18 years of age will be evaluated in two pediatric studies in 
patients 6 months to 18 years of age, which are part of the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMEA-
001425- PIP01-13-M01 and have also been included as part of the RMP. The missing data on the use 
of cobimetinib in pregnancy and lactation will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance with 
appropriate wording in the SmPC section 4.6. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The clinical benefit of cobimetinib plus vemurafenib has been demonstrated with a prolongation of PFS 
of approximately 5 months in locally advanced or metastatic malignant melanoma. This is considered 
clinically relevant for the patient. Tumour responses (70% for combination therapy vs. 50% for 
vemurafenib monotherapy) and the duration of response, median 12.5-13 months in BRAF inhibitor-
naïve patients (in both the phase III and the Phase 1b study) and 6.7 months in the smaller fraction of 
BRAFi-progressed patients who responded (in the Phase 1b study), were also considered of clinical 
importance. 
The safety of cobimetinib plus vemurafenib is considered acceptable and manageable. In addition, the 
percentage of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and keratoacanthoma 
appeared to be lower than that observed with vemurafenib treatment. The risk and the actual 
occurrence of cuSCC is an important additive burden for patients. Therefore the decreased incidence of 
such squamous cell carcinoma is considered a benefit of the combination therapy.

Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the benefits of cobimetinib and vemurafenib combination therapy in adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation outweigh the risks. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib is supported by non-clinical and 
clinical data that suggest that targeting the MAPK kinase pathway at two separate levels is expected to 
improve efficacy.  The main pivotal study, GO28141, has demonstrated a clinically relevant 
improvement in PFS and ORR, with supportive evidence from OS analysis. The study included patients 
that had not been previously treated with BRAF inhibitors. For patients that had been previously 
treated with a BRAF inhibitor, study NO25395 included a number of patients that had progressed 
following vemurafenib-treatment and showed that efficacy in terms of ORR and duration of response 
was lower in patients that progressed following BRAF inhibitor treatment compared to in BRAF-naive 
treated patients. Taking into account that in clinical practice, a proportion of patients will have been 
previously treated with other BRAF inhibitors, the CHMP highlighted that the combination treatment 
may not provide the same clinical benefit in those patients as what has been observed in naïve 
patients enrolled in the clinical trials not previously treated with MAPK kinase pathway inhibitors and 
that clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in this patient population. Nevertheless, the indication 
was not restricted as it was considered that patients previously treated with BRAF inhibitors could still 
derive some benefit from the combination therapy. 
New therapeutic options have been approved recently for melanoma, some targeting the immune 
system instead of the melanoma cancer cells. Immunotherapeutic agents such as ipilimumab, 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab are not thought to interfere with the RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK signalling 
pathway and with the BRAF mutation status. However, based on the current data and information 
available, no recommendation can be given over the sequencing of therapies.  
The safety and tolerability of the combination therapy appears to be acceptable and manageable 
through SmPC recommendations, routine pharmacovigilance and implementation of RMP measures. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Cotellic in the treatment “for use in combination with vemurafenib for

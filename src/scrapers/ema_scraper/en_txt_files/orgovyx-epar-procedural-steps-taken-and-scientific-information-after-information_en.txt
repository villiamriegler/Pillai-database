1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

result from study MVT-601-057. This is a Phase I, 
two-part, open-label, fixed (single)-sequence, two-
treatment, two-period crossover study to assess the 
effects of relugolix on the pharmacokinetics of total 
dabigatran upon co-administration of relugolix and 
the P-gp substrate dabigatran etexilate in healthy 
adult men and women. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
Upon co-administration of a single 150 mg dose of 
dabigatran etexilate, a P-gp substrate, with a single 120 
mg dose of relugolix, the AUC0-inf and Cmax of total 
dabigatran was increased by 17% and 18%, respectively, 
which is not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Therefore, clinically meaningful effects of a 120 mg dose 
relugolix on other P gp substrates are not expected. 
Considering that the 360 mg loading dose of relugolix has 
not been tested, dose separation of the loading dose of 
relugolix from administration of other P-gp substrates is 
advised.

Upon co-administration of a 120 mg dose of relugolix and a 
result from study MVT-601-055; this is an open-
label, fixed (single)-sequence crossover phase 1 
study to assess the sufficiency of dose separation to 
mitigate absorption-mediated increases in exposure 
to relugolix resulting from inhibition of intestinal P-gp 
by azithromycin in healthy adult men.

single 500 mg dose of azithromycin the AUC and Cmax of 
relugolix were increased by 1.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively, 
although in the median concentration-time curves increases 
in relugolix exposure up to 5-fold were observed 1-3 hours 
after dosing. When the single dose of azithromycin was 
administered 6 hours after the 120 mg relugolix dose, the 
AUC and Cmax of relugolix were increased by 1.4- and 1.3-
fold, respectively; the increase in relugolix exposure in the 
median concentration-time curves was maximally 1.6-fold 
in the window 1-3 hours after dosing. Due to limited 
number of subjects (n=18) and high PK variability, 
confidence intervals around these increases were wide (for 
AUC from 1.0- to 2.1-fold).

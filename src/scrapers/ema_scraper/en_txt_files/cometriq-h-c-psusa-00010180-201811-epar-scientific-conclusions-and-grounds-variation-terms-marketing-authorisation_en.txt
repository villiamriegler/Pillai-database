Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cabozantinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A search in Eudravigilance was performed for cabozantinib and the preferred term ‘pain in extremity’. A 
total of 29 cases were reported with PT ‘pain in extremity’ and suspected drug ‘Cometriq’. Time to onset 
is indicative of a causal association and varied between 1 day and 9 days. Furthermore, ‘pain in 
extremity’ is a known adverse drug reaction for Cabometyx (cabozantinib). Therefore, section 4.8 of the 
Summary of Products Characteristics should be updated to include “Pain in extremity” with a very 
common frequency, in line with the Product Information for Cabometyx. Furthermore, the Package 
Leaflet should be updated accordingly, to include “pain in the arms, hands, legs or feet’. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cabozantinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product Cometriq containing cabozantinib is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

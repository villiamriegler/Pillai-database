Qtern can be used in patients with mild renal impairment.   
Qtern should not be initiated in patients with a glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min and should be 
discontinued at GFR persistently below 45 mL/min. It 
should also not be used in patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Please refer to the SmPC for further details. 
The PL has been updated accordingly.

The RMP version 4.1 has also been submitted. 
In addition, the MAH  took the opportunity to update  
SmPC section 2, 4.8, 5.2 and Annex II to include the 
required excipient information in relation to sodium 
levels and lactose following the update to the Annex 
to the European Commission guideline on “Excipients

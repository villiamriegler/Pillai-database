Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for VEYVONDI® (Vonicog alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for VEYVONDI. The RMP details important risks 
of VEYVONDI, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
VEYVONDI’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
VEYVONDI’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how VEYVONDI should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for VEYVONDI should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of VEYVONDI’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
VEYVONDI  is  authorised  for  von  Willebrand  disease  (vWD)  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It 
contains vonicog alfa as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of VEYVONDI’s benefits can be found in VEYVONDI’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/veyvondi. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of VEYVONDI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about VEYVONDI’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that  immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  VEYVONDI  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  VEYVONDI  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of VEYVONDI. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term 
use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk: Hypersensitivity reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Clinical trials, potential mechanism of action of risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Patients with previous history of hypersensitivity to vonicog alfa or 
any  other  constituents  of  the  product.  VWD  patients  who  have 
developed antibodies against VWF are at increased risk to develop 
anaphylactic reactions after re-exposure to VWF. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance activities

Important Identified Risk: Thromboembolic events (particularly in patients with low 
ADAMTS13 levels as well as other risk factors, and concomitant overuse of FVIII) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Clinical trials, potential mechanism of action of risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Thromboembolic  events  can  occur,  particularly  in  patients  with 
known  clinical  or  laboratory  risk  factors  including  low  ADAMTS13 
levels. Administration of vonicog alfa with a FVIII product containing 
VWF  would  pose  an  additional  risk  of  thrombotic  events.  Patients 
with sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma levels may be at increased 
risk of thrombotic events. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures:

Important Potential Risk: Inhibitor formation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Potential mechanism of action of risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups  VWD  patients  who  have  developed  antibodies  against  VWF  are  at 
risk  to  develop  anaphylactic  reactions  after  re-exposure  to  VWF. 
Inhibitor development in patients with VWD is a rare complication of 
treatment and mainly occurs in patients with severe inherited type 
3 VWD. The risk for VWD patients to develop antibodies in response 
to  exogenously  administered  VWF  is  highly  variable  in  individual 
patients  and  can  only  partially  be  explained  by  genetic  factors. 
Mutations  in  the  VWF  gene  which  have  been  reported  to  be 
associated with VWD are very heterogeneous. 
The development of neutralizing antibodies against VWF is frequently 
reported in patients with partial or complete VWF gene deletions but 
also in patients carrying nonsense or frameshift mutations. 
Since not all cases of type 3 VWD caused by large gene deletions are 
associated with the development of anti- VWF antibodies, it is highly 
probable that additional genetic or environmental factors contribute 
to the risk of developing antibodies against VWF. A positive family 
history of anti-VWF antibodies is considered as a major risk factor. 
Patients previously treated with pdVWF concentrates may be at risk 
to express binding antibodies against VWF prior to first exposure to 
vonicog alfa.

There  are  no  studies  which  are  conditions  of  the  marketing  authorisation  or  specific  obligation  of 
VEYVONDI. 
II.C.2. Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Study name: VON (BAX0111) VWF-500 COL (ATHN9 study) 
Purpose of the study: To collect and summarize safety and efficacy data of various VWF-containing 
products and to have targeted safety monitoring/follow-up information on the AESIs (hypersensitivity 
reactions,  thromboembolic  events,  inhibitor  formation)  for  this  population  while  on  treatment  with 
VWF-containing products. 
Study name: TAK-577-4005 
Purpose of the study: To estimate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, thromboembolic events, and 
VWF  inhibitor  or  FVIII  inhibitor  formation  after  treatment  with  VEYVONDI  in  the  study  population 
prescribed VEYVONDI for the treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding and the prevention of 
surgical  bleeding  when  DDAVP  treatment  alone  is  ineffective  or  not  indicated;  and  to  describe  the 
association of thromboembolic events with use of FVIII concomitantly with VEYVONDI. 
Study name: EUHASS registry 
Purpose of the study: The EUHASS registry serve to collect further safety information in patients with 
vWD.

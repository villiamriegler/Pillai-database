1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax 
C.I.4 (Type II): Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 
5.1 of the SmPC to update the safety information 
regarding the administration of Spikevax to 
individuals at least 18 years of age who have 
undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are 
diagnosed with conditions that are considered to 
have an equivalent level of immunocompromise, 
based on updated clinical literature and internal 
data; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.Z (Type IB): To update section 6.6 of the SmPC 
in order to clarify the handling instructions for the 
pre-filled syringes; the Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
(original) were evaluated in a two-part Phase 3b open-label 
study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, 
including kidney and liver transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). 
A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which 
was the dose authorised at the time of study conduct. In 
Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of 
Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT recipients received 
a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth 
dose for mRNA vaccines and third dose for non-mRNA 
vaccines). Reactogenicity was consistent with the known 
profile of Spikevax (original). There were no unexpected 
safety findings.

Product Characteristics.

Eligible participants, who received 2 doses of Spikevax at 
indicate the possibility of co-administration of 
Spikevax with a high-dose quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine, based on the interim results from study 
QHD00028 (NCT04969276), a Phase II, open-label 
study aimed to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of a high-dose quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (2021-2022 formulation) and a 
third dose of Spikevax administered either 
concomitantly or singly in adults 65 years of age and 
older previously primed with Spikevax. 
The MAH is taking the opportunity to include as 
editorial updates in sections 5.1 and 6.6 of the 
SmPC, Annex II and package leaflet, corrections 
from procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0075.

least 5 months before enrolment in the study, were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 vaccination groups: i) 
concomitant administration of the high-dose influenza and 
Spikevax vaccines, ii) administration of high-dose influenza 
vaccine alone, and iii) administration of Spikevax vaccine 
alone. The immunogenicity responses against influenza 
were in general comparable between the concomitant 
group and the vaccine group that received high-dose 
influenza alone, with only a minimal, if any, trend towards 
higher results in the high-dose influenza alone vaccine 
group. This trend was not considered of clinical relevance. 
The immunogenicity responses against SARS-CoV-2 were 
also comparable with a minimal trend towards higher 
geometric mean titres in the Spikevax alone vaccine group 
as compared to the concomitant group, which was not 
deemed of clinical relevance. No evidence of an adverse 
impact on the safety profile after concomitant 
administration of high-dose influenza and Spikevax 
vaccines was observed. The study was carried out with a 
100 µg dose of Spikevax, instead of 50 µg as approved. 
Nevertheless the study design per se was deemed 
adequate to investigate an impairment of the immune 
response after co-administration, independent of the dose, 
while creating a considerable safety margin when following 
the current booster recommendation.

Pre-boost and post-boost neutralising antibody against the 
B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in adults 
Results of the pseudovirus neutralisation assay (PsVNA) 
against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant determined pre-
booster and on Day 29 post booster showed that 
administration of a booster dose of Spikevax (0.25 mL, 50 
micrograms) in adults induced a 17 fold rise in neutralising 
antibodies against the Delta variant compared with pre-
booster levels (GMFR = 17.28; 95% CI: 14.38, 20.77; 
n=295).   
Neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant 
in children 6 through 11 years of age  
Serum samples of the per-protocol immunogenicity subset 
(n=134) of the ongoing paediatric study obtained at 
baseline and on Day 57 were tested in a PsVNA based on 
the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.   
In children 6 through 11 years of age, the GMFR from 
baseline to D57 was 81.77 (95% CI: 70.38, 95.00) for the 
Delta variant (measured by PsVNA). Furthermore, 99.3% of 
children met the definition of seroresponse.

vaccination series with any authorised COVID-19

dosing (mRNA-1273 booster) study of the various 
vaccines authorized in the US under Emergency Use 
Authorisation in participants ≥ 18 years old 
(NCT04889209). In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement the WHO-approved INN 
‘elasomeran’ and make minor editorial 
changes/corrections throughout the product

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

after completion of the primary series.  
Spikevax may be used to boost adults who have received a 
primary series with Spikevax or a primary series comprised 
of another mRNA vaccine or adenoviral vector vaccine.  
Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous booster with 
Spikevax were studied in an investigator-initiated trial with 
154 participants. The minimum time interval between 
primary series using a vector based or RNA-based COVID-
19 vaccine and booster injection with Spikevax was 12 
weeks (range: 12 weeks to 20.9 weeks). The dose used for 
boosting in this study was 100 micrograms. Neutralising 
antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation 
assay were assessed on Day 1 prior to administration and 
at Day 15 and Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster 
response was demonstrated regardless of primary 
vaccination. Only short-term immunogenicity data are 
available; long-term protection and immunological memory 
are currently unknown. 
COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 
investigator-initiated trial of third dose booster vaccination 
against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed 
immunology. Participants were adults aged 30 years or 
older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well-
controlled co-morbidities were permitted), who had 
received two doses of either Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–
AstraZeneca (first dose in December 2020, January 2021 or 
February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second 
dose by the time of enrolment. Spikevax boosted antibody 
and neutralising responses and was well tolerated 
regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting 
in this study was 100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody 
titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay

administered intramuscularly at least 6 months after the 
second dose in individuals 18 years of age and older. The 
decision when and for whom to implement a third dose of 
Spikevax should be made based on available vaccine 
effectiveness data, taking into account limited safety data. 
The risk of myocarditis after a third dose (0.5 mL, 100 
micrograms) or booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) of 
Spikevax has not yet been characterised. 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a 
booster dose of Spikevax are evaluated in an ongoing 
Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, 
dose-confirmation study in participants 18 years of age and 
older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants 
received two doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month 
apart) of the Spikevax vaccine primary series. In an open-
label phase of this study, participants received a single 
booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months 
after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The 
solicited adverse reaction profile for the booster dose was 
similar to that after the second dose in the primary series. 
A single booster dose was shown to result in a geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in 
neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 28 
days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising 
antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) when compared 
28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the 
booster dose.

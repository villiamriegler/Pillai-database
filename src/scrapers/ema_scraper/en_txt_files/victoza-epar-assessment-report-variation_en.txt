2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this submission is two-fold: 
• 
• 
To extend the current indication for Victoza (liraglutide) to include monotherapy use “when diet 
and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of 
metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications”  
To update the current text in the Victoza product information concerning patients with hepatic 
impairment to state that “no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment” 
To support these label updates, data from clinical trials with Victoza as well as data from post-marketing 
sources are included herein. These data have been previously reviewed by the CHMP and no new clinical 
trial data are included in this submission.  
The marketing authorisation for Victoza was originally granted in June 2009. The marketing authorisation 
application included data from a large, randomised, double-blind, 52-week pivotal phase 3a monotherapy 
trial (NN2211-1573) comparing liraglutide against the active comparator glimepiride. However, a 
monotherapy indication for Victoza was not granted at the time of the approval. The main reasons cited 
by the CHMP for non-approval of the monotherapy indication included the lack of long-term efficacy and 
safety data for Victoza and the lack of data on the use of Victoza in sensitive populations contraindicated 
for metformin (e.g., patients with renal or hepatic impairment, recent myocardial infarction or heart 
failure). A head-to-head comparison of liraglutide monotherapy against metformin monotherapy in a 
pivotal phase 3a trial was also lacking. 
In the six years since Victoza marketing authorisation approval, long-term efficacy and safety data have 
been collected in clinical trials as well as in the post-marketing setting. In addition to the reduction in 
HbA1c with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, Victoza has also been shown to improve body weight and systolic 
blood pressure (MAA Module 2.5, Clinical Overview). In the past few years, several new incretin-based 
therapies (i.e., DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists) have been approved, providing additional 
medical/scientific data (including long-term cardiovascular outcome trial data) for these classes of drugs 
in the management of T2DM.i,ii, iii, iv,v,vi,vii,viii, ix,x,xi,xii 
More data and argumentation on the benefit/risk of Victoza in sensitive populations have also become 
available since 2009. A dedicated trial (NN2211-3916) demonstrated that liraglutide treatment was 
efficacious in subjects with T2DM and moderate renal impairment and did not raise any safety 
concerns.xiii A meta-analysis of intermediate and long-term Victoza trials that included subjects with NYHA 
class I and II heart failure showed no increase in cardiovascular risk with liraglutide vs. active 
comparators (metformin, glimepiride, rosiglitazone and insulin glargine) or placebo 
(EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0024).xiv  
Liraglutide is metabolised in a manner similar to large proteins (i.e., catabolised by widely distributed 
proteolytic enzymes) without a specific organ having been identified as a major route of elimination.xv 
The elimination of liraglutide is therefore unlikely to be influenced by changes in hepatic function. A trial 
(NN2211-1328) examining single dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide in patients with hepatic impairment 
showed that liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13−23% in patients with mild-to-moderate and by 
44% in patients with severe impairment (Trial 1328 [M 5.3.3.3]). No safety concerns were raised during 
the trial; liraglutide was well tolerated in all hepatic impairment groups.

The ADA/EASD position statement on the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM advocates early 
optimisation of glycaemic control and an individualised approach to treatment.xvi,xvii In alignment with 
these recommendations, several therapeutic drugs in the GLP-1 receptor agonist, DPP-4 inhibitor and 
SGLT-2 inhibitor classes recently received marketing approvals that included second-line (restricted) 
monotherapy indications for patients contraindicated/intolerant to metformin (e.g. Eperzan (EPAR 2014), 
Trulicity (EPAR 2014)).  
Outside the EU, Victoza is approved as first-line monotherapy for T2DM in several countries (including 
Colombia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Brazil) or as second-line monotherapy (U.S. 
only). No postmarketing safety issues relating to the use of Victoza in monotherapy have been identified 
by the marketing authorisation holder.   
The following data are included in this submission to address: the initial (2009) CHMP concerns regarding 
the use of Victoza in monotherapy; the CHMP T2DM drug development guideline requirements; the 
proposed text concerning patients with hepatic impairment for the Victoza product information. 
Monotherapy data from the pivotal phase 3a NN2211-1573 trial evaluating non-inferiority of 
liraglutide (doses up to 1.8 mg) against the active comparator glimepiride after 52 weeks of treatment 
(Trial 1573) 
Supportive monotherapy data from three dose-ranging phase 2 trials with liraglutide:  
• 
• 
• 
Trial NN2211-1571 (a 14-week trial evaluating the efficacy/safety of liraglutide doses up to 1.9 mg 
against placebo); Trial 1571 
Trial NN2211-1310 (a 12-week trial evaluating the efficacy/safety of liraglutide doses up to 0.75 mg 
against placebo); Trial 1310 
Trial NN2211-2072 (a 12-week trial evaluating the efficacy/safety of liraglutide doses up to 0.75 mg 
against metformin); Trial 2072

Phase 2 Trial 1571 
Trial design and methods 
The primary objective of this monotherapy trial was to assess and compare the efficacy of three doses of 
liraglutide vs. placebo on glycaemic control (as assessed by HbA1c). Secondary objectives included 
assessments of other glycaemic control parameters, cardiometabolic parameters, beta-cell function and 
safety/tolerability. 
In this randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, multi-national phase 2 trial, subjects with T2DM 
previously treated with either diet or OAD monotherapy were randomised 1:1:1:1 to 14 weeks of 
monotherapy with either s.c. liraglutide (0.65, 1.25 or 1.9 mg/day) or s.c. placebo. The doses of 
liraglutide investigated in this dose-ranging phase 2 trial helped to guide dose selection for the phase 3 
clinical development programme. The trial doses differ from the maintenance doses evaluated in the 
phase 3 programme and subsequently approved for marketed use as Victoza(1.2 and 1.8 mg).  
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline after 14 weeks of treatment. The primary and 
continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (e.g., FPG and body weight) were analysed using an ANOVA 
model, with treatment and previous anti-diabetic treatment (diet or monotherapy) as explanatory 
variables and baseline parameter value as a covariate. In this approach, missing data were imputed using 
the LOCF method. To evaluate the impact of early trial withdrawal, additional repeated measurements 
analyses were conducted for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, which used all available post-
baseline measurements for a given parameter. 
Of the total 165 randomised subjects, 163 were exposed to trial products and 140 subjects (86%) 
completed the trial. Trial withdrawal was more common in the placebo group (27.5% of subjects) 
compared to the liraglutide groups (14.6%, 7.1% and 12.5% of subjects withdrew in the liraglutide 
1.9 mg, 1.25 mg and 0.65 mg groups, respectively). The reason behind the higher attrition rate in the 
placebo group was ‘ineffective therapy’ (17.5% of subjects). The ITT analysis set (defined as all 
randomised subjects exposed to ≥1 dose of the trial product) contained a total of 163 subjects. 
The four treatment arms were well matched with respect to baseline characteristics except for the 
male/female ratio, which was generally higher in the active treatment groups (male subjects: 55−73%)

than in the placebo group (male subjects: 48%). Mean subject age ranged 53.8−57.7 years across the 
four treatment groups. Most subjects were White (98−100%). Mean diabetes duration ranged 5.5−6.9 
years; 17−23% of subjects were previously treated with diet while the rest were treated with OAD 
monotherapy (i.e., sulphonylurea, repaglinide or metformin).  
Overview of primary and selected secondary endpoints 
In all three liraglutide groups, mean HbA1c decreased by week 8 and remained relatively stable thereafter 
until week 14 (Figure 1). Throughout the treatment period, the decrease was more pronounced in the 
liraglutide 1.9 mg and 1.25 mg groups compared to the 0.65 mg group. A gradual increase in mean 
HbA1c was seen during 14 weeks of treatment with placebo. After 14 weeks of treatment, the change in 
HbA1c was statistically significantly different between each liraglutide dose group and placebo (Table 2). 
Consistent with the results seen for HbA1c, FPG decreased from baseline in all liraglutide groups but 
increased in the placebo group after 14 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, the change in FPG 
was statistically significantly different between each liraglutide dose group and placebo (Table 2). 
A reduction in body weight from baseline was seen in all four treatment groups. The treatment difference 
between liraglutide and placebo was statistically significant only for the highest liraglutide dose group 
(1.9 mg); (Table 2). 
The repeated measurements analyses of changes in HbA1c, FPG and body weight after 14 weeks of 
treatment produced results similar to those obtained with the ANOVA analyses.

No safety issues were raised during the trial. In line with previous observations, the most frequent AEs in 
the liraglutide groups were of gastrointestinal nature (nausea, diarrhoea and constipation). The safety 
profile of liraglutide doses up to 1.9 mg in this trial was consistent with the drug safety profile observed 
across the T2DM development programme. 
Phase 2 Trial 1310 
Trial design and methods 
The primary objective of this monotherapy trial was to establish the dose-response relationship on 
glycaemic control of five dose levels of liraglutide (referred to in the CTR as NNC 90-1170) and placebo. 
Secondary trial objectives focused on the comparison of efficacy and safety of liraglutide against 
glimepiride and the assessment of liraglutide’s safety profile. 
In this randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label 
active comparator arm, subjects with T2DM previously treated with either diet or OAD monotherapy were 
randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to 12 weeks of monotherapy with either s.c. liraglutide (0.045, 0.225, 0.45, 
0.60 or 0.75 mg), s.c. placebo or p.o. glimepiride. The doses of liraglutide investigated in this dose-
ranging phase 2 trial helped to guide dose selection for the phase 3 clinical development programme. The 
trial doses were relevantly lower than the maintenance doses evaluated in the phase 3 programme and 
subsequently approved for marketed use as Victoza(1.2 and 1.8 mg).

The primary endpoint (change in HbA1c after 12 weeks of treatment) as well as most continuous 
secondary endpoints were analysed using a repeated measurements ANOVA, with treatment, visit, and 
centre as fixed effects and the interaction term (i.e., baseline parameter value by visit) as a covariate. 
A total of 193 subjects were randomised into the seven treatment groups and 190 were exposed to 
treatment. In total, 168 (88%) of subjects completed the trial. The proportion of subject withdrawals was 
similar between the liraglutide and placebo groups; no subjects withdrew from the glimepiride group. The 
ITT analysis set (defined as all randomised subjects exposed to ≥1 dose of the trial product) contained a 
total of 190 subjects. 
There were no major differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. Approximately 
two thirds of subjects in each group were males. Mean age ranged approximately 53−58 years across the 
groups. Most subjects were Caucasian (96−100% across groups). The majority of subjects were 
previously treated with OADs (54−93% across groups), while the rest were treated with diet. Mean 
duration of diabetes ranged 3.4−6.1 years. 
As this trial is included here to support the findings of Trial 1571, only the comparison of liraglutide 
against placebo is discussed below. Also, efficacy data for the two highest doses of liraglutide (0.60 and 
0.75 mg) are presented. 
Overview of primary and selected pre-specified secondary endpoints 
From a baseline of approximately 7.4% in the liraglutide 0.75 mg, 0.60 mg and placebo groups, mean 
HbA1c decreased in both liraglutide groups, but remained relatively unchanged in the placebo group after 
12 weeks of treatment (Table 3 and Figure 2). The changes in HbA1c after 12 weeks of treatment were 
statistically significantly different between either dose of liraglutide and placebo. 
After one week of treatment, reductions in mean FSG levels were seen in the liraglutide 0.75 mg and 
liraglutide 0.60 mg groups (Figure 2). These reductions were generally sustained up to 12 weeks of 
treatment. In contrast, FSG remained relatively unchanged during 12 weeks of treatment with placebo. 
The changes in FSG after 12 weeks of treatment were statistically significantly different between either 
dose of liraglutide and placebo (Table 3). 
No safety issues were raised during the trial. The safety profile of liraglutide doses up to 0.75 mg in this 
trial was consistent with the drug safety profile observed across the T2DM development programme.

Phase 2 Trial 2072 
Trial design and methods 
This was a 12-week, randomised, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, double-dummy trial which 
investigated the dose-response, efficacy, and safety of five doses of liraglutide in subjects with obesity 
and T2DM who were previously treated with oral hypoglycaemic monotherapy. The trial had an initial 
screening visit and a four-week metformin run-in period. Subjects were then randomised to receive once 
daily dosing of liraglutide (0.75 mg, 0.60 mg, 0.45 mg, 0.225 mg, or 0.045 mg s.c.) or metformin 
1000 mg p.o. twice daily for 12 weeks. Subjects received liraglutide placebo or metformin placebo to 
maintain blinding. The doses of liraglutide investigated in this dose-ranging phase 2 trial helped to guide 
dose selection for the phase 3 clinical development programme. The trial doses differ relevantly from the 
maintenance doses evaluated in the phase 3 programme and subsequently approved for marketed use as 
Victoza(1.2 and 1.8 mg).  
The primary objective of the trial was to determine the dose-response relationship for body weight of five 
escalating doses of liraglutide. Secondary objectives included the determination of dose-response with 
respect to glycaemic parameters (e.g., HbA1c and FPG) and an assessment of safety/tolerability. 
Continuous efficacy endpoints were analysed using an ANCOVA with treatment (all six arms) effect and 
corresponding baseline value as a covariate. The PP analysis set (all randomised subjects who received 
the trial products and had efficacy data at week 12) was the main analysis set used for efficacy endpoint 
analyses. 
Overview of selected secondary endpoints 
No statistically significant differences in HbA1c or FPG after 12 weeks of treatment were found between 
liraglutide and metformin groups at the three highest liraglutide dose levels (0.75 mg, 0.60 mg, and 
0.45 mg); (Table 4). No safety issues were raised during the trial. The safety profile of liraglutide doses 
up to 0.75 mg in this trial was consistent with the drug safety profile observed across the T2DM 
development programme.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Pivotal Phase 3a Trial 1573 (LEAD-3) 
Trial NN2211-1573 was a dedicated monotherapy trial undertaken as part of the pivotal phase 3a 
development programme for liraglutide in T2DM and was included in the initial MAA. 
The purpose of NN2211-1573 was to obtain long-term data on the efficacy and safety of monotherapy 
with liraglutide in comparison to the sulphonylurea glimepiride. Glimepiride monotherapy is indicated for 
first-line therapy and is widely used to treat patients with T2DM. The dose of glimepiride was the 
maximum FDA-approved therapeutic dose at the time of the trial and was considered to be the maximum 
therapeutic dose for glycaemic control. 
Trial design 
In this multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled trial 
conducted in the U.S. and Mexico, subjects with T2DM previously treated with diet/exercise or with not 
more than half-maximal OAD monotherapy for at least 2 months were randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to 
receive liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg or glimepiride 8 mg treatment for 52 weeks (Figure 3). The 
52-week double-blind period was followed by a 52-week open-label extension period, which will not be 
discussed further here. Liraglutide was started at the once-daily dose of 0.6 mg (s.c. injection) during the 
first week and the dose was escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg to either 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. 
Glimepiride was started at a daily dose of 2 mg (p.o.) during the first week and the dose was escalated 
weekly by 2 mg to a final dose of 8 mg. Placebo products were administered concurrently in a manner 
mimicking the titration of active compounds to ensure blinding. Subjects were stratified with respect to 
baseline diabetes treatment (diet/exercise treated vs. OAD monotherapy) and participation in a trial 
substudy (not discussed further here).

The primary objective of this trial was to assess and compare the efficacy of liraglutide monotherapy 
versus glimepiride monotherapy on glycaemic control (as assessed by change in HbA1c) after 52 weeks. 
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline at week 52. Secondary objectives included 
an assessment/comparison of body weight, beta-cell function parameters, cardiometabolic parameters, 
incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes and safety/tolerability parameters between the three treatment 
groups.  
Statistical Methods 
Sample size 
Samples size calculation was based on the following assumptions for the primary endpoint (change from 
baseline to week 52 in HbA1c): a non-inferiority margin of 0.4%-point and a SD of 1.2%. Assuming a 
subject dropout of 30%, 234 subjects needed to be enrolled in each treatment arm and 163 subjects 
needed to complete treatment in each arm in order to have an 85% power to detect a treatment 
difference between liraglutide and glimepiride at alpha 0.05. This samples size was also judged to be 
sufficient to detect a difference between liraglutide and glimepiride with respect to body weight (3% of 
difference in percent change from baseline). 
Analysis sets 
The ITT and safety analyses sets were identical in this trial and comprised all randomised subjects who 
were exposed to at least one dose of the trial product. 
In addition, the PP analysis set was used for the analysis of the primary endpoint and comprised all 
exposed subjects who completed the 52-week treatment period with an evaluable HbA1c measurement at 
weeks 0 and 52. The subjects in the analysis set also had to comply with the following: 
•  Meet these inclusion criteria: 1) informed consent before any trial-related activities, 2) subjects 
diagnosed with T2DM and treated with OAD(s) for at least 2 months and 3) inclusion criterion 
defining limits of HbA1c. For inclusion criterion regarding HbA1c level at screening, an extended 
range of ± 0.25% was allowed. 
•  Not meet any withdrawal criteria and meet all randomisation criteria (an extended range of ±0.5 
mmol/L was allowed for the FPG randomisation criterion)  
Analyses of efficacy and safety endpoints 
Consistent with the primary hypothesis of non-inferiority between liraglutide and glimepiride in terms of 
glycaemic control after 52 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint of change in HbA1c after 52 weeks 
was first tested for non-inferiority and then for superiority as a one-sided hypothesis with a significance 
level of 2.5%.  
The change from baseline in HbA1c (%) was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, country 
and previous anti-diabetic treatment (strata) as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. The 
primary endpoint was analysed for both the ITT and the PP set; for comparison of superiority, the PP 
analysis was considered to be supportive. Post-baseline missing values were imputed using the LOCF 
approach in the ITT analysis. 
Non-inferiority of liraglutide to glimepiride was to be concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the 
difference between treatments was below 0.4%; superiority was to be concluded if the upper bound of 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/351673/2016 
Page 18/47 
 
  
  
 
the 95% CI was below 0%. To protect against the family-wise type I error, a hierarchical testing scheme 
was used: 
• 
Initially, non-inferiority of liraglutide 1.8 mg compared to glimepiride was tested. Superiority of 
liraglutide 1.8 mg over glimepiride was only tested after non-inferiority has been confirmed 
•  Once non-inferiority of the 1.8 mg dose to glimepiride was confirmed, then non-inferiority of the 
1.2 mg dose was evaluated. Superiority of the 1.2 mg dose over glimepiride was only tested if 
both doses were non-inferior to glimepiride and the 1.8 mg dose was superior  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed with an ANCOVA model similar to that used for 
the analysis of the primary endpoint, with the baseline value of the parameter in question as a covariate. 
Missing values were imputed using the LOCF approach. 
HbA1c target responder endpoints were analysed by logistic regression with treatment as a fixed effect 
and baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Missing values were imputed using the LOCF approach. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes were analysed using a generalised linear model, assuming that the number of 
hypoglycaemic episodes per subject follows a negative-binomial distribution. The model included 
treatment and country as fixed effects. 
Adverse events were summarised using descriptive statistics. 
Subject Disposition 
A total of 746 subjects were randomised in this trial (Table 5). Overall, one subject (in the liraglutide 
1.8 mg group) was not exposed to treatment and was therefore excluded from the ITT analysis set. The 
percentages of subjects who completed the 52-week trial were higher in the liraglutide treatment groups 
(liraglutide 1.8 mg: 70.0%, liraglutide 1.2 mg: 64.5%) compared to the glimepiride treatment group 
(61.3%). The primary reasons for trial withdrawal in the liraglutide treatment groups were ‘other’ reasons 
and ‘adverse events’. In the glimepiride treatment group, the primary reasons for trial withdrawal were 
‘other’ reasons and ‘ineffective therapy’.

Exposure 
The number of subjects and exposure to trial products is summarised in Table 6. Consistent with the 
higher withdrawal in the glimepiride group, total exposure and duration of treatment were shorter in the 
glimepiride group compared to both liraglutide groups.

Demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Screening/baseline demographics and characteristics were generally comparable between the three 
treatment groups (Table 7). In total, ~50% of trial subjects were male and the mean subject age was 
53.0 years. The majority of randomised subjects were White (77.5%) and of non-Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity (65.0%). Mean BMI was in the obese range (33.1 kg/m2). At baseline, approximately one-third 
of the subjects had been previously treated for T2DM with diet/exercise and the rest with OAD 
monotherapy. The average duration of diabetes was 5.4 years.

Efficacy endpoints 
HbA1c – primary endpoint 
Mean HbA1c levels decreased during the initial 8 weeks of treatment and remained relatively stable 
thereafter in all three treatment groups up to week 52 (Figure 4). Throughout the treatment period, the 
reduction in HbA1c was more pronounced in the liraglutide groups than in the glimepiride group. 
From a baseline of approximately 8.2% in each treatment group, mean HbA1c decreased by 1.14% with 
liraglutide 1.8 mg, 0.84% with liraglutide 1.2 mg and by 0.51% with glimepiride after 52 weeks of 
treatment (Table 8). ITT analysis results demonstrated that treatment with either dose of liraglutide (1.2 
or 1.8 mg) was superior to treatment with glimepiride, and there was also a significantly greater decrease 
in HbA1c values for liraglutide 1.8 mg compared to liraglutide 1.2 mg. PP analysis’ results were similar to 
those seen in the ITT analysis.

Percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c <7% (secondary endpoint) 
After 52 weeks of treatment, greater proportions of subjects treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg or 1.2 mg 
reached the ADA/EASD HbA1c < 7% target compared to subjects treated with glimepiride (50.9%, 42.8% 
and 27.8%, respectively); (Table 9). The odds of reaching the above-mentioned glycaemic target were 
statistically significantly higher with liraglutide treatment (both doses) than glimepiride treatment.

Fasting plasma glucose (secondary endpoint) 
Mean FPG levels decreased during the initial 2−4 weeks of treatment and remained relatively stable 
thereafter in all three treatment groups up to week 52 (Figure 5). Throughout the 52-week treatment 
period, the reduction in FPG was more pronounced in both liraglutide groups compared to the glimepiride 
group. 
Figure 5.  Plot of mean FPG over time by treatment – ITT population 
From a baseline of approximately 9.4 mmol/L across the three groups, mean FPG decreased by 
1.42 mmol/L with liraglutide 1.8 mg, 0.84 mmol/L with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 0.29 mmol/L with 
glimepiride after 52 weeks of treatment (Table 10). The reduction in mean FPG was statistically 
significantly greater with either dose of liraglutide (1.8 or 1.2 mg) compared with glimepiride. In addition, 
the decrease in FPG was statistically significantly greater with liraglutide 1.8 mg than liraglutide 1.2 mg.

2.4.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide (Victoza) were evaluated in subjects with varying degrees of 
renal impairment (classified based on estimated CrCL) in Trial 1329: mild (> 50 - ≤80 mL/min), moderate 
(> 30− ≤ 50 mL/min), severe (≤ 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis). Compared to 
subjects with normal renal function, liraglutide exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate and 
severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease was lower by 33%, 14%, 27% and 26%, 
respectively. 
Since the submission of the Victoza MAA a pooled patient-level analysis of the six phase 3 LEAD trials in 
subjects with T2DM evaluating the effect of mild renal impairment on the efficacy/safety of liraglutide  and 
a dedicated clinical trial (3916) evaluating the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in subjects with T2DM and 
moderate renal impairment have become available.   
The pooled patient-level analysis of the LEAD programme showed that mild renal impairment (CrCL: 60 − 
≤89 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation) had no relevant effect on the efficacy and 
safety of liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg.

Trial 3916 data were submitted to the CHMP in June 2014 and supported a label update of liraglutide’s 
use in patients with T2DM and moderate renal impairment (EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0028). This was a 
randomised, double-blind, two-armed, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial evaluating and 
comparing the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg against placebo over 26 weeks of treatment in 
subjects with T2DM and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 - 59 mL/min/1.73m2 per MDRD formula) 
inadequately controlled with OAD(s) and/or basal or premix insulin. The trial excluded subjects with NYHA 
class IV, but permitted the enrolment of subjects with NYHA class ≤3. The primary objective of the trial 
was to confirm the superiority of liraglutide vs. placebo, both as add on to existing OAD and/or insulin 
therapy, on glycaemic control after 26 weeks of treatment. Consistent with this objective, the primary 
endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. Secondary trial objectives included an 
evaluation and comparison of the effect of liraglutide vs. placebo after 26 weeks of treatment on 
safety/tolerability and cardiovascular risk factors. 
A total of 279 subjects were randomised to treatment with liraglutide (140) or placebo (139), 277 were 
exposed to trial products (2 subjects in the placebo group were not exposed) and 210 (~75% in both 
groups) completed the trial. A brief overview of subject baseline characteristics is shown in Table 12. Trial 
subjects were generally older and frailer compared to subjects in other trials of the Victoza development 
programme. Mean age was approximately 67 years and duration of diabetes was approximately 15 years. 
Approximately 50% of trial subjects had a history of cardiac disorders and 2 subjects with NYHA class III 
heart failure were enrolled in the trial. Diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy and 
retinopathy were present in approximately 45−58% of trial subjects, while one-third of subjects had 
macro-angiopathy.

Treatment with liraglutide was superior to treatment with placebo in terms of reductions from baseline in 
HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment. In addition, liraglutide produced greater improvements compared to 
placebo in other measures of glycaemic control (FPG, 7-point SMPG, HbA1c target response) and selected 
cardiovascular risk factors (including body weight and BMI) (Table 13).  
Treatment with liraglutide had no notable effect on renal function compared to treatment with placebo. 
The overall incidence of AEs was higher in this trial compared to that seen in other trials in the Victoza 
development programme, but consistent with the frailer population included. The AEs reported in this trial 
were similar in nature to those generally observed in the Victoza development programme; no 
unexpected safety or tolerability issues relating to the treatment of patients with moderate renal 
impairment with liraglutide were identified.

The primary and continuous secondary endpoints were analysed using MMRM with treatment, country, stratification 
groups as factors and baseline parameter value (log transformed if not normally distributed) as a covariate, all nested 
within week. Responder endpoints were analysed by logistic regression model with treatment, country and product of 
renal function category and background diabetes treatment category as fixed effects and baseline HbA 1c value as a 
covariate. BL = baseline; BW = body weight; BMI = body mass index; eGRF = estimated glomerular filtration rate;

Post hoc analyses showed that HbA1c reductions after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg were 
similar in magnitude between eGFR subgroups corresponding to Stage 3a CKD (45−59 mL/min/1.73m2) 
and Stage 3b CKD (30 - <45 mL/min/1.73m2) or between the age subgroups of 18−64 years, 
65−74 years, ≥75 years (Table 14 and Table 15).xviii,xix The reductions in HbA1c were larger with 
liraglutide vs. placebo across the eGFR subgroups and across the age subgroups.

Hepatic impairment 
Liraglutide is metabolised in a similar manner to large proteins, without a specific organ having been 
identified as a major route of elimination. Liraglutide is fully metabolised in the body by cleavage into 
small peptide fragments and amino acids, a process that involves neutral endopeptidase and DPP-4 
enzymes.  
Single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic 
impairment (based on Child-Pugh classification score) in Trial 1328: mild (5−6 score, N=6), moderate 
(7−9 score, N=6), severe (>9 score, N=6). Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=6), 
liraglutide exposure (AUC) was lower by 13−23% in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment 
and by 44% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Trial 1328). No clear association was seen 
between the unbound fraction of liraglutide and different degrees of hepatic impairment. No safety 
concerns were raised during the trial; a single dose of liraglutide was well tolerated by all hepatic 
impairment groups.  
The safety experience with liraglutide in patients with liver abnormalities is discussed in (safety) section 
2.5.2. 
Cardiovascular disease 
No specific data regarding efficacy in cardiovascular disease are discussed. 
2.4.4.  Post-marketing data 
The renewal application for Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026/R/025) included data from all sources, including 
clinical trials, post-marketing experience and available literature. The Victoza renewal application included 
previously submitted data from five large randomised phase 3a (LEAD 1−5) trials that formed the basis of 
the original marketing authorisation, as well as data from three additional completed large phase 3b trials 
(LEAD 6, 1860 and 1842); these results are summarised in Table 16.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the current application for restricted monotherapy, the MAH has summarised previously 
submitted data from one phase 3 trial (1573) and three phase 2 trials (1571, 1310, 2072). These trials 
have been extensively discussed in the EPAR for the original MAA; this discussion will not be repeated 
here. 
In the original assessment, the dose of 8mg/day glimepiride that was used as a comparator for Trial 1573 
was discussed. In Europe usually 4 mg daily (6 mg is the maximum approved dose) is recommended. 
Therefore, the safety of liraglutide (especially hypoglycaemic events) may be overestimated by this high 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/351673/2016 
Page 28/47 
 
  
  
 
dose (see Safety section). A comparison with metformin would have been preferred as metformin is 
currently the first choice in T2DM. However, from an efficacy point of view, the comparator is acceptable. 
Many health care professionals will prescribe an SU if metformin is not appropriate. 
Of the phase 2 trials, only 1571 employed a dose that is close to the current recommendation in the 
SmPC. The other trials (1310, 2072) tested a maximum dose of 0.75 mg liraglutide, which makes these 
trials less relevant. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Used as monotherapy (trial 1573), liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg was more effective than glimepiride 8 mg 
daily. Compared to glimepiride, the treatment differences on HbA1c after 52 weeks were -0.623 [-0.826; 
-0.421] for Lira 1.8 mg and -0.329 [-0.531; -0.127] for Lira1.2 mg. Thus, for both doses, not only non-
inferiority but superiority to the chosen active comparator was shown. Most of the decrease in mean 
HbA1c with liraglutide occurred by week 8. 
Based on phase 2 trial 1571, an estimate can be made for performance of liraglutide against placebo. For 
both dose levels, the end-of-treatment (14 week) difference was close to -1.7 (-2.2; -1.2). 
Overall, the trial populations were representative of the general population of patients with T2DM at an 
early stage of disease progression and for whom monotherapy treatment would be indicated. In current 
regulatory practice, such data can be used to support an application in a population for which metformin 
is inappropriate. 
Liraglutide treatment also decreased mean FPG/FSG levels. Most of the reduction in mean FPG/FSG with 
liraglutide occurred after 1−2 weeks of treatment and was maintained up to 52 weeks of treatment (in 
Trial 1573). Liraglutide treatment at doses ≥1.2 mg also reduced mean body weight by 1−3 kg in Trials 
1573 (after 52 weeks) and 1571 (after 14 weeks). 
The MAH has also provided some efficacy data on the use of Victoza in sensitive populations (e.g., in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment). 
Based on liraglutide’s mechanism of action, data from the LEAD programme as well as Trials 1329 and 
3916, treatment with liraglutide doses up to 1.8 mg was shown to be efficacious in subjects with T2DM 
and mild to moderate renal impairment; no safety concerns were identified. This was assessed and 
approved in variation EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0028, to extend the use of Victoza in patients with T2DM and 
moderate renal impairment.  
Regarding subjects with hepatic impairment, the MAH provided single-dose pharmacokinetics from Trial 
1328, which showed that liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13−23% in patients with mild-to-
moderate and by 44% in patients with severe impairment. Therefore, the main concern regarding use of 
Victoza in these patients may be lack of efficacy, for which no further data are discussed. Section 4.2 in 
the Saxenda label recommends no dose adjustment for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment.xxvii Saxenda is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 
should be used cautiously in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (referencing sections 4.4 
and 5.2). Furthermore, Saxenda users are protected against lack of efficacy by a stopping rule, which is 
not in place for Victoza.  
In the recent renewal procedure for Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026/R/025), no new concerns regarding 
efficacy (or safety) were identified on the basis of the totality of data.

2.4.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH has provided adequate data to show efficacy of liraglutide as monotherapy, in subjects for 
whom metformin is inappropriate. However, no data supporting the efficacy of liraglutide with respect to 
glycaemic control in hepatic impairment were discussed, while exposure is markedly reduced. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Trial 1573 
In the context of this application, the description of safety is based upon the active-controlled 
monotherapy trial 1573. 
Exposure data are summarised in Table 6 above. 
Adverse events 
A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event that either occurred before randomisation and 
increased in severity during the treatment period or had an onset date on or after the first day of 
randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of treatment. Only treatment-emergent 
AEs are discussed below. 
A summary of AEs in the three treatment groups is presented in Table 17. More subjects reported AEs in 
the liraglutide groups (liraglutide 1.8 mg: 79.3%, liraglutide 1.2 mg: 82.5%) as compared to the 
glimepiride group (71.4%). The majority of AEs were mild in severity. The proportions of subjects 
reporting severe adverse events were similar between the liraglutide 1.8 mg and the glimepiride 
treatment groups (13.4% and 12.9%, respectively) and higher in the liraglutide 1.2 mg treatment group 
(17.1%). The majority of AEs in all three treatment groups were assessed as ’unlikely related to trial 
product’ by the investigator. The proportion of subjects with AEs as well as the number of AEs assessed 
as probably or possibly related to treatment by the investigator was higher in each liraglutide group 
compared to the glimepiride group.

AEs reported by >5% of subjects in any one treatment group are summarised by system organ class and 
preferred term in Table 18. The most frequently-reported AEs by preferred term in the liraglutide 1.8 mg 
and liraglutide 1.2 mg groups were events related to the gastrointestinal system (nausea [29.3% and 
27.5% of subjects, respectively] and diarrhoea [18.7% and 15.5% of subjects, respectively]). In general, 
nausea experienced with liraglutide was transient and declined after the initial several weeks of 
treatment. In the glimepiride group, the most frequently reported AEs by preferred term were headache 
(9.3% of subjects) and diarrhoea (8.9% of subjects).

N: Number of subjects with adverse events. %: Proportion of subjects in analysis set having adverse event. E: Number 
of adverse events. A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event is defined as an event occurring between first drug date and 
last drug date+7 days or starting before first drug date with increasing severity during this period. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
One death (due to a motor vehicle accident) was reported in this trial for a subject in the glimepiride 
treatment group. The proportions of subjects experiencing SAEs were low and similar between treatments 
(liraglutide 1.8 mg: 3.3% [9 events], liraglutide 1.2 mg: 6.4% [18 events], glimepiride: 5.2% [17 
events]). Most of the SAEs were classified as ‘unlikely related to treatment’ by the investigator. No SAEs 
were considered to have a ’probable’ causality relationship to the trial products, while the following 
7 SAEs were considered to have a ’possible’ relationship:  
hypoaesthesia (left arm numbness); liraglutide 1.8 mg 
appendicitis perforated (liraglutide 1.8 mg) 
• 
•  myocardial infarction (liraglutide 1.8 mg)

Discontinuations 
Across the three treatment groups, a total of 54 subjects discontinued from the trial early due to AEs. The 
proportion of subjects discontinuing from the trial as well as the number of events leading to 
discontinuation were higher in the liraglutide groups (liraglutide 1.8 mg: 7.3% [38 events], liraglutide 
1.2 mg: 9.2% [50 events]) compared to the glimepiride group (5.2% [15 events]). Subjects in the 
liraglutide treatment groups who withdrew from the trial early due to AEs, mainly withdrew due to GI 
AEs. 
Hypoglycaemia 
When symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia were present, trial subjects were asked to measure their 
PG levels. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, availability of PG measurement and PG level, the 
reported episodes in the clinical trial database were classified as shown below (Figure 7). The same 
definition of treatment emergence as for AEs was used for hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Figure 7.  Classification of hypoglycaemic episodes 
No major hypoglycaemic episodes were reported during the trial. The percentage of subjects reporting 
minor hypoglycaemia, as well as the number of episodes, was higher in the glimepiride group than in 
either liraglutide treatment group (Table 19).

2.5.2.  Clinical safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Overall, there was no clinically-relevant difference in the safety profile of liraglutide vs. placebo across 
either the eGFR subgroups or the age subgroups based trial 3916 in moderate renal impairment 
(Table 15). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety of 26-week liraglutide treatment and efficacy on liver parameters was assessed in an 
individual patient data meta-analysis of six large randomised phase 3 trials from the liraglutide T2DM 
development programme (LEAD 1−6).  The meta-analysis provided a descriptive overview of the safety 
profile of liraglutide in T2DM patients (N=4442) with and without abnormal blood liver enzymes prior 
to treatment (baseline ALT: >ULN to <2.5 times ULN in ~50% of patients). Even though the long-term 
adverse events remain unknown, this study provided reassurance on the safe short-term use of 
liraglutide in the presence of mild-to-moderate liver injury (baseline ALT: >ULN to <2.5 times ULN).  
In addition, the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. placebo after 48 weeks of treatment was 
assessed in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH, with or without T2DM, in the Liraglutide Efficacy and 
Action in NASH (LEAN) randomised, double-blind phase 2 trial.  Liraglutide met the primary endpoint of 
histological clearance of NASH and reduction in the progression of fibrosis.  There were no serious AEs in 
patients treated with liraglutide, which was well tolerated with only 2 (8%) of patients withdrawing from 
treatment due to drug-related AEs (of a gastrointestinal nature). The liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio was 
assessed by CT in a substudy of the LEAD-2 trial, which compared three doses of liraglutide (0.6, 1.2, 
1.8 mg) against glimepiride 4 mg and placebo, all added to metformin.  The ratio increased from baseline 
(0.10) with liraglutide 1.8 mg, possibly indicating reduced hepatic steatosis. This increased ratio was 
significantly different from the unchanged ratio in the glimepiride group (p = 0.0451).  
A prospective pilot study (N=43) examined the effect of liraglutide 1.2 mg on liver fat content after 6 
months of treatment in patients with T2DM, with (35 [81.3%]) and without hepatic steatosis as assessed 
by 1H-MRS. Six months of treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg resulted in a 33.3% relative reduction in 
mean liver fat content (from 19.1% to 12.7%, p<0.001), demonstrating liraglutide’s efficacy in reducing 
hepatic steatosis.  Liraglutide-induced weight loss appeared to be an important promoter of hepatic fat 
reduction. 
Three out of four phase 3a trials (NN8022-1839, -1922 and -3970) in the liraglutide weight management 
programme (liraglutide 3.0 mg, Saxenda) had no restriction on the enrolment of subjects with abnormal 
liver function tests (i.e., liver enzyme levels), but did not classify hepatic function according to the 
Child-Pugh score. An analysis of AEs by ALT and AST levels at baseline (AST or ALT < 75th percentile 
compared to ≥75th percentile) was performed in the Saxenda MAA. No indication of adverse effects of 
Saxenda in these patients was seen in the analysis; there were no differences in AE or SAE patterns in 
patients with low vs. high ALT and AST levels. No safety signal has emerged from the use of Saxenda in 
subjects with elevated liver enzymes at baseline; treatment with Saxenda was associated with decreases 
in ALT and AST levels in these subjects.  
Cardiovascular disease 
The cardiovascular safety of liraglutide with respect to MACE was evaluated in a post hoc meta-analysis of 
intermediate and long-term phase 2 and 3 trials with liraglutide in subjects with T2DM. The inclusion 
criteria of these trials allowed the enrolment of subjects with NYHA class I and II heart failure. The main 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/351673/2016 
Page 33/47 
 
  
  
 
analysis included 13 trials (5,607 subjects, 3,651 of which were exposed to liraglutide) ranging in 
duration from 26 to 100 weeks and focused on serious MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction 
and stroke). No increased risk in serious MACE (incidence ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.35; 1.63]) was seen with 
liraglutide vs. comparators (metformin, glimepiride, rosiglitazone, insulin glargine, placebo). The results 
of MACE analyses conducted in a number of different subject populations and using various MACE 
definitions (e.g., broad, narrow, custom) were robust and consistent; most of the point estimates for the 
incidence ratios of MACE with liraglutide were below 1, with the upper bound below 1.8. Additional 
analyses based on independently post hoc adjudicated events provided results consistent with those 
described above.  The limitations of the MACE meta-analysis include its post hoc nature, inclusion of low 
risk patients and duration of included trials (≤100 weeks). The results of this analysis were submitted to 
the CHMP in the Victoza type 2 variation (EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0024).  
Consistent with the above-mentioned findings, no increase in the risk of adjudicated MACE with liraglutide 
versus comparator (pooled active and placebo) was identified in a pre-specified pooled analysis of 27 
trials from the T2DM and weight management clinical development programmes, which included five 
phase 2/3 weight management trials with liraglutide doses up to 3.0 mg (WM trials: liraglutide: N=3,872; 
comparator: N=2,036).  Based on the total of 69 events, the MACE hazard ratio (95% CI) for 
liraglutide/comparator was 0.57 [0.35, 0.94].  
No safety concerns have been detected in the post-marketing setting (PSUR/PBRER 18 August 2015), 
providing further reassurance regarding the cardiovascular safety of Victoza. 
The cardiovascular safety of liraglutide in subjects with T2DM at high risk for cardiovascular disease is 
under investigation in the LEADER trial. Trial results will become available in 2016. 
2.5.3.  Post-marketing data 
The recent renewal application for Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026/R/025) is used as reference source for the 
post-marketing data. No specific safety issues have emerged from this analysis. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For this monotherapy application, the primary source of safety data is the active-controlled monotherapy 
trial 1573. This trial was assessed in the original MAA for Victoza and above in Section 2.4.2. 
In the previous assessment, the dose of 8mg/day glimepiride that was used as a comparator for Trial 
1573 was discussed. In Europe usually 4 mg daily (6 mg is the maximum approved dose) is 
recommended. Therefore, the safety of liraglutide (especially hypoglycaemic events) might be 
overestimated by this high dose. The percentage of subjects experiencing minor hypoglycaemic episodes 
during the trial was lower in the 2 liraglutide groups (liraglutide 1.2 mg: 11.2% and liraglutide 1.8 mg, 
7.7%) than in the glimepiride group (glimepiride, 24.2%). Although only speculation if based on trial 
1573, it seemed unlikely that the difference in hypoglycaemia rates between the 4mg dose and the 8mg 
dose would have been so large as to reverse the favourable safety profile of liraglutide with regard to 
hypoglycaemic event compared to glimepiride. The general experience with liraglutide (both from the 
add-on setting as Victoza and from weight management as Saxenda) confirms that liraglutide is unlikely 
to cause hypoglycaemias. 
More subjects reported AEs in the liraglutide groups compared to glimepiride. Most AEs were mild and 
related to the gastrointestinal system. This is consistent with the safety profiles of Victoza and also 
Saxenda. The safety profile is adequately described in the SmPC. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/351673/2016 
Page 34/47 
 
  
  
 
Both hepatic and renal impairment are associated with lower exposures than in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, the primary concern is efficacy and not safety. Safety of Victoza in renal impairment was 
recently reviewed in the context of variation EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0028 and appears similar to subjects 
with normal renal function.  
For subjects with hepatic impairment, data are sparse. The MAH references data in subjects with 
abnormal liver enzymes, which are not considered representative for the hepatically impaired population. 
The data in NASH patients are discussed referencing abstracts and no separate analysis is discussed for 
the diabetes patients included.  
The cardiovascular meta-analysis was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0024. The population 
studied was relatively young and with a relatively short diabetes duration, without active cardiovascular 
disease, relatively low-risk cardiovascular subjects. The results from these specific populations could 
therefore not be extrapolated to patients with longstanding diabetes and at particular high cardiovascular 
risk as reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
For the GLP-1 agonists as a class, results of the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome 
(ELIXA) trial, in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, are reassuring. In this trial, 
lixisenatide did not increase or decrease the rate of cardiovascular (CV) events compared to placebo. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The Victoza safety profile is adequately described in the current SmPC. Safety data regarding patients 
with renal impairment have been recently reviewed. Safety data regarding patients with hepatic 
impairment are sparse; however, because of the lower exposure no major issues are expected. 
2.5.6.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The MAH implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC. The PRAC considered that the risk 
management plan version 25.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 
25.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.  
Additionally, new information with regard to the use of liraglutide in patients with hepatic impairment has 
been added to the product information (SmPC section 4.2):  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Victoza is 
not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
and information regarding renally impaired patients has been updated in the section 5.3 of the SmPC: 
Liraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with normal 
renal function. Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, 27% and 28 26% in patients with mild 
(creatinine clearance, CrCl 50-80 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30-50 ml/min), and severe (CrCl <30 ml/min) 
renal impairment and in end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, respectively. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
The changes to the patient leaflet are not significant (ref. Guideline on the readability of the 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use, January 2009) 
•  A user consultation was made for liraglutide during the marketing authorization application 
approved in January 2009 
•  QRD test was performed by EMA as part of the renewal procedure approved in April 2014. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
With the current variation, the MAH intends to include restricted monotherapy (in patients for whom 
metformin is inappropriate) in the indication for Victoza. At the same time, changes are proposed 
regarding the posology in hepatic impairment. No new data are included in this variation.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy of liraglutide monotherapy is primarily shown in the 52-week, glimepiride-controlled trial 
1573. In this trial, both doses of liraglutide provided superior reduction of the primary endpoint HbA1c 
compared to glimepiride (treatment benefit: Lira 1.8 mg -0.623 [-0.826; -0.421]; Lira 1.2 mg -0.329 
[-0.531; -0.127]). Also, percentage responders (HbA1c <7) was significantly better than with control. 
Based on phase 2 trial 1571, an estimate can be made for performance of liraglutide against placebo. For 
both dose levels, the end-of-treatment (14 week) difference in HbA1cwas close to -1.7 (-2.2; -1.2). 
Liraglutide treatment also decreased mean FPG/FSG levels. Most of the reduction in mean FPG/FSG with 
liraglutide occurred after 1−2 weeks of treatment and was maintained up to 52 weeks of treatment (in 
Trial 1573). Liraglutide treatment at doses ≥1.2 mg also reduced mean body weight by 1−3 kg in Trials 
1573 (after 52 weeks) and 1571 (after 14 weeks). 
Based on liraglutide’s mechanism of action, data from the LEAD programme as well as Trials 1329 and 
3916, treatment with liraglutide doses up to 1.8 mg was shown to be efficacious in subjects with T2DM 
and mild to moderate renal impairment. This was assessed and approved in variation 
EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0028, to extend the use of Victoza in patients with T2DM and moderate renal 
impairment  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The exposure of liraglutide in hepatic impairment is documented by the results of single-dose 
pharmacokinetic trial 1328: Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=6), liraglutide 
exposure (AUC) was lower by 13−23% in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and by 
44% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. The MAH has discussed safety data in subjects with 
abnormal liver enzymes and effects on liver fat in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), but no specific results for glycaemic control. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of liraglutide monotherapy is primarily based on the glimepiride-controlled trial 1573. 
AEs occurred in more patients than with glimepiride (lira 1.8 mg: 79.3%; lira 1.2 mg: 82.5%; glim: 
71.4%). The most frequent AEs were gastro-intestinal (nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, 
flatulence). Serious AEs were comparable between groups (3.3, 6.4 and 5.2% respectively). Withdrawals 
due to AEs were more frequent with liraglutide (9.3, 13.5 and 6.9% respectively). 
The safety profile is in line with combination therapy as already described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Symptomatic hypoglycaemias were less frequent with liraglutide compared to glimepiride (11.0, 14.7, 
29.0%). However, the dose of glimepiride was higher than recommended in Europe, which may have 
caused excess hypoglycaemias in the control group.

trials (ranging from 26 to 100 weeks) in subjects with T2DM examining the incidence of MACE 
(cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke) with liraglutide versus active comparators and 
placebo was provided earlier (EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0024) and its description included in the SmPC. The 
analysis included 5,607 patients (3,651 exposed to liraglutide) and showed no increase in cardiovascular 
risk (incidence ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.35; 1.63) for the composite endpoint for liraglutide versus all 
comparators (metformin, glimepiride, rosiglitazone, insulin glargine, placebo). High-risk cardiovascular 
patients were excluded from the trials and the incidence rates of serious major cardiovascular events in 
the trials were low (6.02 per 1,000 patient years in liraglutide-treated patients and 10.45 in all-
comparator-treated patients).

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Regarding restricted monotherapy, the efficacy and safety of liraglutide are supported by pivotal trial 
1573 (52 weeks, comparator glimepiride) and phase 2 trial 1571 (14 weeks, placebo controlled). Based

on the extensive clinical trial program for Victoza in the add-on setting, the efficacy and safety as 
determined during the initial application for marketing authorisation has been confirmed by the data 
obtained post-approval.  
There is still uncertainty around the potential risks in patients with advanced cardiac disease (that might 
have contra-indications for metformin). More information will be provided in the course of 2016, with the 
results of the LEADER trial. Current, but limited data indicate no specific CV risk for liraglutide and CV risk 
factors show improvement. Also, patients who are candidates for diabetes monotherapy may have lower 
CV risk than patients who are candidates for combination therapy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance for Victoza as restricted monotherapy is positive. The efficacy of Victoza in 
subjects with hepatic impairment has not been established. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The marketing authorisation for Victoza was originally granted in June 2009. The marketing authorisation 
application included data from a large, randomised, double-blind, 52-week pivotal phase 3a monotherapy 
trial (NN2211-1573) comparing liraglutide against the active comparator glimepiride. However, a 
monotherapy indication for Victoza was not granted at the time of the approval. The main reasons cited 
by CHMP for non-approval of the monotherapy indication included the lack of long-term efficacy and 
safety data for Victoza and the lack of data on the use of Victoza in sensitive populations contraindicated 
for metformin (e.g., patients with renal or hepatic impairment, recent myocardial infarction or heart 
failure). A head-to-head comparison of liraglutide monotherapy against metformin monotherapy in a 
pivotal phase 3a trial was also lacking.  
Since 2009, the experience with liraglutide and the class of GLP-1 receptor agonists has increased 
importantly.  Liraglutide has a large safety database, especially in the add-on setting. The recent renewal 
is used as reference source for the post-marketing data. No specific issues have emerged from this 
analysis.  
Regarding a monotherapy indication, requirements for Phase 3 can be distilled from the current diabetes 
guideline (Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of 
diabetes mellitus, CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1). 
For this assessment regarding monotherapy, the add-on studies from the LEAD program are of limited 
value. These are not further discussed, but their value in the general knowledge about GLP-1 receptor 
agonists and in particular liraglutide is acknowledged.  
Superiority over placebo in a monotherapy setting has been evaluated in phase 2 only, with trial 
1571 meeting the 3-months criterion and investigating liraglutide at a dose that was similar to the 
proposed dose (1.9 instead of 1.8 mg). The treatment effect on HbA1c was documented as: Liraglutide 
1.9 mg: -1.45%; Placebo +0.29%; Thus, the genuine glucose lowering effect of liraglutide in this study 
was 1.74%. Taking into account that also superiority was achieved in the monotherapy trial with 
glimepiride, this was considered sufficiently documented for authorisation of an add-on indication. In an 
evaluation for monotherapy authorisation, the documentation of effect compared to placebo may be 
weighed more heavily; the limited size of the trial and the different dose are limitations, which in the end 
do not prevent authorisation. 
Trial 1573 was an active-controlled monotherapy study of 1 year duration, which was in line with 
requirements from the guideline. Although the data were obtained outside the EU, extrapolation of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/351673/2016

data to the EU is justifiable as baseline characteristics and demographics of the included patients mostly 
can be considered representative for a European type 2 diabetes mellitus population. Comparison to 
another non-hypoglycaemic agent would have been advantageous, which currently is not available, but 
this is not a firm requirement. 
As stated in the guideline, a monotherapy study comparing the test drug to metformin is always needed if 
an indication for first line (unrestricted) monotherapy is intended. Such a trial is not available, and the 
MAH did not apply for a first-line monotherapy indication.  
A second line monotherapy indication (in patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate) 
is approvable, in line with other products which have been approved since Victoza’s original MAA, where 
such an indication was approved based on similar data as presented here. 
By the initial assessment (in 2009), it was of concern that ”the most essential contraindications for 
metformin (moderate and severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, heart failure and recent 
myocardial infarction) are conditions for which there is limited experience for liraglutide”.  
The MAH recently addressed the clinical (efficacy and safety) experiences in use of liraglutide in patients 
with renal impairment in variation EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0028, based on Trial 3916 in patients with 
T2DM and moderate renal impairment. In this trial, liraglutide was administrated as add-on to existing 
OAD and/or insulin therapy, but it is still considered sufficient in this (monotherapy) context. 
There is currently no recommendation for treatment of patients with hepatic insufficiency. The current 
SmPC states that “the therapeutic experience in patients with all degrees of hepatic impairment is 
currently too limited to recommend the use in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 5.2).” The MAH refers to Trial 1328, investigating the pharmacokinetics and safety profile 
after a single dose of liraglutide in subjects with hepatic impairment. In this trial, liraglutide exposure was 
found to be decreased by 13-23% in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to 
health subjects. Exposure was significantly lower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Based on these results the Rapporteur recommended to the MAH to document a clinically relevant effect 
of liraglutide monotherapy in this subgroup of patients, but no such data were discussed and the MAH 
only emphasized that the lower exposure is unlikely associated with safety issues. While the MAH points 
to albiglutide and dulaglutide as a justification for not discussing efficacy data, for these substances, a 
44% decrease in exposure was not documented. 
Long-term cardiovascular, safety of liraglutide is currently supported by a meta-analysis of clinical trial 
data. Although these results are important, more robust data are expected this year from the company’s 
CV outcome trial (LEADER). It is not clear how much of these data concern monotherapy. This trial will 
address the safety of liraglutide when used in a patient population with already existing cardiovascular 
disease (e.g. recent myocardial infarction or heart failure) mimicking the populations with 
contraindications for use of metformin, the usual first line treatment of T2DM.  For the GLP-1 agonists as 
a class, results of the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) trial, in patients 
with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, are reassuring. In this trial, lixisenatide did not 
increase or decrease the rate of cardiovascular (CV) events compared to placebo. 
Data from the Saxenda program contribute to the overall knowledge about GLP-1 agonists and especially 
liraglutide. The dossier includes extensive placebo-controlled data. However, these data are obtained at a 
different dose and in a different population. In occasional cases where weight loss is seen as an essential 
aspect of therapy, Saxenda may be more suitable than Victoza. Moreover, Saxenda would usually be 
indicated already in such patients.

additionally, the MAH updated information related to the hepatic and renal impairment. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated with new efficacy and safety 
information. The Package Leaflet and RMP (v. 25.1) are updated in accordance. Furthermore, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to align the PI with the QRD template version 
9.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

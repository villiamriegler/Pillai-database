2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a broad term that describes a clinically heterogeneous group of 
arthritides of unknown cause, which begin before 16 years of age. This term encompasses several 
disease categories, with distinct clinical signs and symptoms, immune-pathogenesis, age at onset, 
gender predominance, and, in some cases, genetic background. 
The MAH’s initially claimed therapeutic indication was: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients 2 years and 
older whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy. 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active juvenile psoriatic arthritis in patients 2 years and 
older whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy. 
Epidemiology  
JIA is the most common rheumatic disease reported in the paediatric population (children and 
adolescents) in Europe and North America. A systematic review of 33 studies based on the ACR, 
EULAR, and ILAR classifications for JIA reported a pooled JIA incidence of 8.3 (95% CI 8.1-8.7) per 
100,000 Caucasian children and adolescents. Oligoarthritis was the most frequent form (pooled 
incidence rate 3.7; 95% CI 3.5-3.9). The pooled incidence estimates for the other individual JIA 
categories were 0.4, 1.0, 0.6, 2.0 and 0.5 per 100,000 children and adolescents for RF-positive and 
RF-negative polyarthritis, SJIA, and the spondyloarthropathies ERA and JPsA, respectively. Gender 
differences are recognised in JIA, with females generally more commonly affected than males, 
although not in all categories. In particular, JPsA affects females slightly more frequently than males, 
while ERA mainly affects males. 
Biologic features  
Various classifications of juvenile arthritis have been proposed and used in the past. The now widely 
accepted ILAR classification criteria classifies JIA into 7 categories, based on predominant clinical and 
laboratory features, including number of joints involved, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and 
association with psoriasis, enthesitis and other findings. The 7 JIA categories are: enthesitis-related 
arthritis (ERA), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA), systemic arthritis, oligoarthritis, RF positive 
polyarthritis, RF negative polyarthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 9/107 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Of the 7 JIA categories, ERA and JPsA represent signs and symptoms of spondyloarthropathy similar to 
the conditions of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA), and 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), for which secukinumab is authorised in adults. 
ERA is a clinically heterogeneous group that includes children and adolescents with predominantly 
enthesitis, both enthesitis and arthritis, juvenile AS, anterior uveitis, or inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD)-associated arthropathy. Similar to adult AS, hallmarks of the disease are pain, stiffness, and 
eventual loss of mobility of the back. Peripheral arthritis, also similar to adult AS, usually affects fewer 
joints of the lower extremities and precedes axial involvement, and arthritis of the sacroiliac joints may 
take years to develop. Like in adult disease, radiographic changes of the sacroiliac joint include joint 
space narrowing, erosions, sclerosis, osteoporosis of the pelvis, and fusion (a late finding). ERA has a 
strong genetic predisposition as evidenced by a positive family history and the presence of HLA-B27 in 
a large proportion of patients. ERA should be suspected in any child with chronic arthritis of the axial 
and peripheral skeleton, enthesitis, and rheumatoid factor and ANA seronegativity. 
ERA accounts for approximately 3 to 11% of JIA and is more common in boys than girls. Age at onset 
is typically late childhood or adolescence, but some children present at a much younger age. 
JPsA is an inflammatory arthritis that presents with or without psoriasis skin involvement. The current 
ILAR classification criteria for JPsA includes patients clinically similar to adult PsA. These children 
usually present with lower extremity arthritis, enthesitis, and some have axial involvement. 
JPsA accounts for approximately 2 to 11% of JIA and is slightly more common in girls than boys. Age 
at onset has a biphasic distribution, with an early peak at 2–4 years and a later peak at 9–11 years. 
Management 
JIA treatment guidelines applicable to all JIA categories, including ERA and JPsA, were established by 
the ACR in 2011 and updated in 2019. Similar to the 2011 recommendations, the updated guidelines 
defined patient populations by clinical phenotype, rather than ILAR categories. 
The guidelines aim to quickly control active inflammation and disease symptoms, and to 
prevent/minimise disease and/or treatment-related morbidities (e.g., growth disturbances, joint 
damage, and functional limitations). In general, the treatment goal is to control the inflammation with 
NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroid intra-articular injections, biologic agents (either as monotherapy or in 
combination with other therapies), and physical and occupational therapy in patients at risk for 
functional limitation. 
For patients with ERA and JPsA who have active enthesitis and/or sacroiliitis despite NSAID therapy, 
treatment options are limited. Conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate are not effective in axial 
disease. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are recommended for patients with enthesitis and 
sacroiliitis if NSAIDs are not tolerated or ineffective. However, many children do not achieve disease 
control with currently available treatment options, including biologics. In addition, only few biologics 
are labelled for the use in ERA or JPsA. In the EU, etanercept is indicated for JPsA and ERA for patients 
aged 12 years or older, and adalimumab is indicated in ERA patients aged 6 years or older. An unmet 
medical need for effective treatment options exists for patients with ERA or JPsA who do not achieve 
disease control on currently available treatment options.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Secukinumab (AIN457) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 antibody that selectively binds to and 
neutralises the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) was initially authorised in 
the EU on 15 Jan 2015 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis (PsO) in adult patients. New indications 
for psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients, non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and PsO in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years were then 
approved. According to the MAH, secukinumab is currently authorised in over 100 countries worldwide. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The current approved PIP for secukinumab for the treatment of chronic idiopathic arthritis (including 
rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) is EMEA-
000380-PIP02-09-M04 (PIP decision number P/0372/2018, dated 07 December 2018).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a monoclonal antibody, secukinumab is exempt from testing in accordance with the current CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) on environmental risk assessment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. During the procedure, the MAH was requested to provide an appropriate literature review from a 
mechanism  of  action  viewpoint  to  support  the  safety  of  anti-IL-17A  therapy  in  young  children  (2-<6 
years),  with  a  focus  on  e.g.,  immune  function  and  the  developing  immune  system,  growth  and 
maturation considering the very limited number of patients enrolled in the clinical trial and the fact that 
anti-IL-17 therapy are not currently indicated in this age group. The MAH has provided the requested 
systematic literature review of the currently available data on the immune development in children with 
regards to the role and function of IL-17 in the developing immune function, both from the non-clinical 
and clinical point of view, to further support the overall safety claims. However, the MAH withdrew their 
indication claim in the 2-<6 years during the procedure. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available non-clinical data do not raise concern in the indication from 6-18 years.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The supplied material does not contain any dedicated pharmacokinetic studies; however, the paediatric 
efficacy  study  F2304  contained  a  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  sub  study  based  on  sparse  sampling. 
Furthermore, the sparsely sampled PK were included into a population PK model of secukinumab which 
included both paediatric and adult data from several indications. For this, see section 2.3.3. on population 
PK model. 
The study treatment was secukinumab 75 mg (< 50 kg, 0.5 mL PFS) or 150 mg (≥ 50 kg, 1 mL PFS) 
s.c. which was the dose predicted to achieve secukinumab serum levels equivalent to adults administered 
a 150 mg dose regimen. All eligible subjects entered treatment phase 1 (TP1) to receive 12-weeks of 
open-label  secukinumab.  Secukinumab  was  administered  s.c.  weekly  for  the  first  4  weeks  (Baseline, 
Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4) and then every 4 weeks thereafter. Subjects who were a responder (JIA ACR 30) at 
Week  12  entered  the  double-blind  withdrawal  treatment  phase  2  (TP2)  and  were  randomized  1:1  to 
either secukinumab or placebo on that visit and then every 4 weeks, until either experiencing a disease 
flare or completion of TP2. Subjects experiencing a disease flare in TP2 immediately entered treatment 
phase 3 (TP3) to receive open-label secukinumab every 4 weeks until total study duration of 104 weeks 
for that subject was achieved. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1.

PK  samples  were  obtained  for  all  subjects,  and  secukinumab  concentrations  were  assessed  in  serum. 
The PK samples were collected pre-dose at scheduled visits/ time points as indicated in the assessment 
schedule (Table 1). All blood samples were drawn by direct venipuncture in a forearm vein. An ELISA 
(enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay)  method  was  used  for  bioanalytical  analysis  of  secukinumab  in 
serum, with LLOQs of 80 and 500 ng/mL in the two bioanalytical CRO’s involved in this study.

Serum concentrations of secukinumab in the two different body weight categories are given in Table 2 
and are visualized in Figure 2. At most time points, similar exposure was observed with the 75 mg dose 
level for body weights < 50 kg compared with exposure for subjects with the 150 mg dose level for body 
weights  ≥  50  kg.  Subjects  who  received  placebo  after  Week  12  until  Week  104  had  declining  serum 
concentrations from Week 12 onwards with concentrations below LOQ from Week 52 onwards. Subjects

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
The dose selection for secukinumab in the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA was based on the assumption 
that the clinical response in paediatric patients would be similar to adult patients with similar conditions 
(AS and PsA) and similar exposure to secukinumab. The pediatric JIA regimen was determined to achieve 
similar  exposure  as  achieved  in  AS  and  PsA  adults  treated  with  the  secukinumab  150  mg.  This 
determination was made by means of a population PK model, which predicted that the pediatric dose of 
75 mg for children weighing <50 kg, and 150 mg for those weighing ≥50 kg, would achieve similar or 
slightly higher exposure to that achieved in adults receiving the 150 mg dose regimen. The popPK model 
used  for  the  determination  of  the  JIA  regimen  was  developed  on  pooled  adult  RA  study  data  over  a 
bodyweight range of 40 to 159 kg and was considered appropriate for prediction in JIA patients given 
the similarity of secukinumab PK across indications. 
The objectives of the current population PK analysis were  
• 
• 
• 
To compare drug concentrations between JIA and pediatric psoriasis patients. 
To characterize the secukinumab PK in JIA patients. 
To  compare  the  exposure  levels  expected  in  JIA  pediatric  patients  receiving  the  proposed 
secukinumab regimen (75 mg s.c. < 50 kg; 150 mg s.c. ≥50 kg) with those in adult AS and PsA 
patients treated with the adult regimens. 
The secukinumab concentrations in JIA patients in four body weight categories at Week 4 and at steady-
state (Week 24, 52 and 104) from study F2304 were graphically compared to those of pediatric psoriasis 
patients under the same dosing regimen (studies A2310 and A2311) as well as to those of adult PsA and 
AS patients under the 150 and 300 mg Q4W regimens (PsA: studies F2312, F2318, F2336, and F2342; 
AS: study F2310). A recent population PK analysis in another pediatric population (pediatric psoriasis) 
indicated that pediatric patients may have higher bioavailability as compared to adults, which was not 
accounted for in the predicted exposure from the population PK model developed in adult RA patients. 
To  further  characterize  secukinumab  pharmacokinetics  across  five  indications,  including  pediatric 
psoriasis and JIA, the entire pooled dataset was used to fit alternative models including a model with a 
pediatric  effect  on  bioavailability  (base  model),  a  model  with  fixed  allometric  exponents  to  their 
theoretical values and a model with a population effect (rheumatoid arthritis) on systemic clearance.

Data from studies A2101, F2201, F2206, F2208, F2309, A2102, A2103, A2211, A2212, A2220, A2302, 
A2303,  A2304,  A2308,  A2309,  A2206,  F2306,  F2312,  F2318,  F2336,  F2342,  A2209,  F2305,  F2310, 
F2314, A2310, A2311 and F2304 were used to fit the population PK model.  
The base model is the population PK model in psoriasis based on observations from adult and pediatric 
patients, that was originally built using observations from studies A2102, A2103, A2211, A2212, A2220, 
A2302, A2310, and A2311. Note that for the purpose of the current report, this model was re-estimated 
on those same (psoriasis) studies, and this re-estimated version of this model is referred to as “Model 
0”.  
In  Model  0,  the  disposition  kinetics  was  modeled  using  a  parameterization  involving  clearance  (CL), 
central  volume  of  distribution  (V1),  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q),  and  peripheral  volume  of 
distribution (V2). A first order absorption rate constant (Ka) and bioavailability term (F) were used to 
characterize the rate and extent of the absorption process of the s.c.  administration. 
Inter-individual variabilities were included on Ka, CL, V1 and V2. Correlations between CL~V1, CL~V2 
and  V1~V2  were  included.  Body  weight  on  CL,  V1,  Q,  and  V2  was  included  and  estimated.  Lastly,  a 
bioavailability effect for the pediatric psoriasis population was included in the model that suggested that 
bioavailability was approximately 21% higher in pediatric patients. 
There is no clear evidence that the development (expression, efficacy, IgG affinity, etc.) of the binding 
to  FcRn  in  the  various  cell  types  in  pediatric  patients  differs  compared  with  adults  and  if  there  are 
potential differences, how they could affect the clearance of secukinumab. For this reason, no maturation 
process was included in Model 0. 
Model 0 was re-estimated on the pool combining data from adults PsA, AS, PsO, and RA patients, as well 
as  pediatric  PsO  and  JIA  patients.  This  new  model,  structurally  identical  to  Model  0,  is  referred  to  as 
Model 1 in this report. The objective of this re-estimation was to assess the robustness of the results 
with respect to a wider range of weights for patients as young as 2 years of age, by incorporating a large 
sample size spanning across five disease populations. Model 1, like Model 0, estimated the allometric 
exponent coefficients. 
Model 2 is similar as Model 1, but uses the theoretical allometric exponent coefficients, on the ground 
that those values, which are considered to have physiological basis, often provide better explanation for 
body weight relationships in pediatric patients.  
Models  with  disease  population  effects  in  clearance  were  also  assessed,  in  order  to  explore  potential 
systematic differences across disease population types. For this analysis, only effects on clearance were 
considered, due to the typically large shrinkage observed for the other structural parameter in previous 
secukinumab popPK reports.  This model is referred to as Model 3 in this report. 
A total of 45235 secukinumab concentrations from 7391 PsA, AS, PsO, RA, pediatric PsO and JIA patients 
were included in the population PK analyses. The number of concentrations by disease population and 
the  proportion  of  samples  below  the  LLOQ  was  less  than  10%  (Table  3).  Figure  3  presents  the  505 
secukinumab concentrations above LLOQ over time in JIA study F2304.

The proposed SmPC contained no population PK-derived information. The aim of the current population 
PK modelling exercise is to justify that the proposed dose leads to a both safe and effect concentration 
range, i.e. that the paediatric doses are within the therapeutic window if the exposure-efficacy-safety 
relationships  are  assumed  to  be  same  for  children  and  adults.  The  NPDE  versus  time  in  JIA  patients 
(Study F2304) for the final population PK model (Model 3) are presented in Figure 4. Overall, the model 
captured  the  observed  concentrations  adequately.  The  distributions  of  individual  CL,  Ka,  V1  and  V2 
random effects by disease population type are presented in Figure 5, respectively. The EBEs for CL, Ka, 
V1 and V2 were generally symmetrically distributed around zero across disease populations.  Regarding 
the JIA population specifically, the EBE distribution for CL, Ka, V1 and V2 was symmetrically distributed 
around zero, both overall, and when stratified across the ERA and JPsA categories.

Model simulations were performed using Model 3 to assess the expected distribution of the trough (Cmin) 
and average concentration at steady state (Cavg,ss) in pediatric subjects treated with secukinumab 75 
mg s.c. (<50 kg) or 150 mg s.c. (≥ 50 kg), for specific weights relevant to the 2 to 18 years old children.  
For comparison purpose, additional simulations were performed for AS and PSA adults treated with 150 
mg  Q4W  and  300  mg  Q4W,  both  for  specific  adult  weights  as  well  as  averaged  across  the  empirical 
weight distribution of the AS and PsA studies. Similar simulations were performed for heavy weight (≥ 
90  kg)  adult  PsO  patients  treated  with  300  mg  Q2W.  Model  simulations  (Figure  8)  suggest  that  the 
current pediatric regimen will maintain exposure levels similar to those observed in adults at the 150 mg 
dose for JIA patients weighting 25 kg or above. In an RSI response, the MAH also provided a figure of 
Cmax predictions for paediatric subjects and adult subjects (Figure 9).

MAH  interpretation  of  the  PK  results  in  terms  of  adequateness  of  the  selected  pediatric 
regimen 
The secukinumab dosing regimen that was administered in Study F2304 was determined based on the 
population PK model developed on pooled adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study data over a bodyweight 
range of 40 to 159 kg, such that the pediatric concentrations would be in the range of that of ≤ 90 kg 
adults treated with the 150 or the 300 mg regimens. 
In  presence  of  a  pediatric  population-specific  bioavailability,  originally  identified  in  a  population  PK 
analysis  incorporating  data  from  adult  and  pediatric  PsO  patients,  that  was  not  accounted  for  in  the 
popPK  RA  model,  the  expected  steady-state  concentrations  were  higher  as  compared  to  the  original 
predictions. The pediatric effect, in combination with a disease specific effect indicating an approximately 
21% higher  clearance for adult RA patients as compared to other disease  populations included in the 
Assessment report

Page 26/107 
 
 
 
 
analysis, led to expected concentrations that are higher than the original predictions, especially for low 
weight pediatric JIA patients. 
One explanation for this higher bioavailability could be the difference in body composition between adults 
and  children.  Indeed,  it  has  been  seen  in  healthy  volunteers  that  secukinumab  systemic  exposure  is 
higher  after  administration  in  the  thigh  than  in  the  less  lean,  more  adipose  abdominal  region.  This 
difference  increases  with  bodyweight.  Therefore,  one  can  hypothesize  that  children,  having  relatively 
less  adipose  tissue  than  adults,  show  somewhat  higher  exposure  due  to  higher  absorption  into  the 
systemic circulation after s.c. administration in “leaner” subcutaneous tissue. 
Model simulations suggest that dose adjustments for body weights < 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg pediatric patients 
are expected to maintain exposure levels similar to those in adults at the 150 mg dose for JIA patients 
weighting 25 kg or above. Higher exposure levels are expected for JIA patients with body weight below 
25 kg, which are in the range of those in adult AS and PsA patients weighing between 45-100 kg and 
treated  with  the  efficacious  and  safe  secukinumab  300  mg  Q4W  regimen,  which  has  already  been 
approved, as well as of those in heavy weight adult PsO patients treated with the 300 mg Q2W regimen, 
which showed a safety profile consistent with the known safety profile of secukinumab. 
The  MAH  states  that  overall,  the  selected  secukinumab  dosing  regimen  in  JIA  is  expected  to  lead  to 
adequate exposure to ensure efficacious treatment across all weights relevant for pediatric development, 
while maintaining exposure levels within those expected in previously treated adult populations where 
secukinumab was found to be well tolerated, thus supporting the dosing recommendation in JIA patients. 
The MAH concluded that: 
• 
• 
The secukinumab concentrations of the JIA patients from Study F2304 were similar across the 
two  JIA  categories  ERA  and  JPsA,  and  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  pediatric  psoriasis 
patients of same weight and treated with the same pediatric regimen. 
The  secukinumab  concentrations  were  well  characterized  by  a  2-compartment  population  PK 
model  based  on  a  large  patient  pool  including  adult  ankylosing  spondylitis,  psoriatic  arthritis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis patients, as well as pediatric psoriasis and JIA patients. There 
was  a  tendency  for  slightly  increased  concentrations  in  both  pediatric  indications  (pediatric 
psoriasis and JIA) as compared to adults, which could be attributed to an approximately 15% 
higher bioavailability in pediatric patients as compared to adults.  
• 
The pediatric concentrations in JIA patients were generally consistent with the predictions from 
the population PK model based on adult and pediatric psoriasis data, regardless of the patient 
weight.  
•  Model simulations suggest that JIA patients weighting 25 kg or above and treated with the F2304 
regimen would achieve exposure levels at steady-state similar to those achieved in PsA and AS 
adults  treated  with  the  150  mg  regimen.  The  expected  distribution  of  average  secukinumab 
concentration at steady-state in patients weighing 10 to 25 kg and receiving 75 mg Q4W was in 
the  range  of  those  achieved  in  adult  AS  and  PsA  patients  weighing  between  45-100  kg  and 
treated  with  the  efficacious  and  safe  secukinumab  300  mg  Q4W  regimen,  which  has  already 
been approved. 
•  Overall, the selected JIA dosing regimen (75 mg s.c. < 50 kg; 150 mg s.c. ≥ 50 kg) is expected 
to  lead  to  adequate  exposure  to  ensure  efficacious  treatment  across  all  weights  relevant  for 
pediatric  development,  while  maintaining  exposure  levels  within  those  expected  in  previously 
treated adult and pediatric populations where secukinumab was found to be safe, thus supporting 
the dosing recommendation in JIA patients.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has taken sparse PK samples within the clinical efficacy study F2304. A separate analysis and 
discussion of raw PK data was provided, and the PK data from JIA patients has also been combined 
with a very large set of secukinumab PK data in both adults and children. After the population PK 
model was fitted, it was used to predict secukinumab exposure by bodyweight, and this is indeed a 
relevant application of the model; because of sample size limitations and the presence of between-
subject variability, the raw data alone do not very well inform about secukinumab exposure in the 
smallest children. PK modelling is used to fill this gap in knowledge.  
Study F2304 PK data consists of trough PK samples taken over the study duration of two years. Trough 
samples are mainly informative of bioavailability and clearance, and these two parameters determine 
the average secukinumab concentration at steady state. Trough PK samples are not informative of 
absorption rate, and slightly informative of distribution processes. Thus, trough PK samples will mainly 
inform about secukinumab steady-state concentrations, and they will not necessarily inform much 
about Cmax.  
Population PK modelling has been conducted on the basis of 27 secukinumab clinical studies; an 
extensive PK dataset. A change in parameter estimates has been noted when expanding the PK model 
from psoriasis data to cover multiple indications (Model 0 versus Models 1 to 3, Table 4). Most 
importantly, the absorption rate increases, peripheral volume decreases, between-subject variability of 
peripheral volume greatly increases, the negative correlation between individual estimates of clearance 
and peripheral volume increases, and the correlation between central and peripheral volume of 
distribution is reversed from positive to negative. No physiological reason could be identified for these 
changes in parameter values. If the population PK model on the whole would be necessary to support 
the current type II variation, then the MAH would likely need to investigate what is the cause of the 
discrepant results. However, for the purposes of the current type II variation, it is sufficient that the 
model predicts accurately for JIA patient population, and no issues have been raised with regard to the 
parameter value discrepancies, unless they are supplemented by inaccurate PK predictions for JIA 
patients. The model diagnostics suggest that the population PK model predicts accurately for JIA 
patients on average (Figure 4 to Figure 6) and therefore the CHMP considered the model fit for the 
purpose of predicting secukinumab exposures in the JIA patient population. 
The current model suggests a higher bioavailability for children versus adults. One could further 
speculate that not only the extent, but also the rate of absorption differs between adults and children. 
If this is true, then children will have a higher Cmax due to faster absorption of secukinumab, and it is 
possible that this trend would not be captured by the population PK model due to trough samples not 
being informative of absorption rate. In an RSI response, the MAH acknowledged that a difference in 
absorption rate between children and adults is indeed possible; however, any reasonable change in 
absorption rate constant will have negligible effects on the Cmax. The CHMP considered that this issue 
is solved. 
The population PK model predicts the highest exposures for the smallest children (Figure 8 and Figure 
9) which may present a problem for the extrapolation of safety from adults to children. In a second 
RSI, the MAH was requested to further justify that the amount of available adult safety data contains 
sufficient information to support extrapolation of safety from adults. In their response, the MAH 
restricted the indication to children aged six years and older; hence, this issue is solved.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has characterized the PK of secukinumab in JIA patients by PK sampling of trough 
concentrations in paediatric clinical efficacy study F2304. The trough concentrations have been 
combined into an extensive population PK dataset, and a population PK analysis has been conducted.  
ERA and JPsA patients (2 to less than 18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the 
recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At week 24, patients weighing <50 kg, and weighing ≥50 kg 
had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 25.2±5.45 µg/ml (n=10) and 27.9±9.57 µg/ml 
(n=19), respectively. 
The CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology package was sufficient to support the following 
dosing recommendations in JIA patients 6 years of age and older: 
The recommended dose is based on body weight and administered by subcutaneous injection at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 75 mg dose is given as one 
subcutaneous injection of 75 mg. Each 150 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 150 mg.

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No separate dose response studies were conducted for secukinumab in JIA patients. Based on the 
expectation that paediatric patients with JIA (ERA and JPsA) would respond similarly to adults with 
similar conditions (AS, nr-axSpA and PsA) and similar exposure to secukinumab, dose selection for the 
main study was based on a population PK model that utilised trial data from adult indications to predict 
exposure of secukinumab according to body weight in children. Model simulations suggested that 
dosing based on weight categories < 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg would maintain exposure levels similar to 
those observed in adults at the 150 mg dose. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study F2304: Three-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study to investigate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab treatment in 
Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis subtypes of psoriatic and enthesitis-related 
arthritis 
Methods 
Study  F2304  was  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  event-driven  randomised  withdrawal  study, 
consisting of a screening period of up to 8 weeks, 3 treatment periods plus a post-treatment follow-up 
period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 29/107 
 
 
 
In Treatment Period 1 (TP1), all subjects received open-label secukinumab at baseline and every week 
for the first 4 weeks (loading dose period) and at Week 8. Subjects who were responders (minimum JIA 
ACR 30 response) at the end of TP1 (Week 12) received a dose of secukinumab or placebo and advanced 
to TP2; non-responders were not dosed and entered the post-treatment follow-up period. 
A  randomised,  double-blind,  withdrawal  design  was  used  for  Treatment  Period  2  (TP2).  Responding 
subjects were randomised 1:1 to either continue secukinumab or switch to placebo in a blinded fashion, 
with randomisation stratified by JIA category (ERA and JPsA). Subjects who experienced a disease flare 
(as per JIA ACR flare definition) entered Treatment Period 3 (TP3) to receive open-label secukinumab 
until end of study (last dose at Week 100). Subjects who did not experience a flare could continue in 
TP2 until end of study, without entering TP3. 
TP2 was event-driven. Per protocol, TP2 was to end either when 33 subjects had experienced a disease 
flare, or when all subjects had reached end of study (Week 104) or discontinued, whichever occurred 
first. The study closed after all subjects had reached Week 104 or discontinued, with a total of 31 flare 
events observed. 
The key elements of study F2304 are outlined in Table 5, and the study design is graphically depicted in 
Figure 10.

the  study  site  for  the  whole  study  duration  (104  weeks);  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic/epidemic, shipment of IMP and home administration was permitted in contingency situations 
from June 2020 (Protocol Amendment 2). 
Treatment arms: 
•  TP1 open-label: Secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg based on the body weight (< 50 kg or ≥ 50 
kg) was administered s.c. at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. The end of TP1 visit at Week 12 
was determined based on subject’s response to the study drug administered (responders entered 
TP2 and non-responders entered post-treatment follow-up). 
•  TP2 treatment withdrawal: Subjects who were responders (minimum JIA ACR 30) at the end 
of TP1 visit at Week 12, entered into TP2 at the same visit and were randomized 1:1 to receive 
blinded secukinumab (75 mg/ 0.5 mL or 150 mg/ 1.0 mL, based on body weight) or matching 
placebo. Subjects then continued to receive secukinumab or placebo every 4 weeks until either 
experiencing a disease flare or completion of TP2 (i.e. 33 disease flares observed in the overall 
study population) or completion of 104 weeks of total study duration in TP2. 
•  TP3 open-label: All subjects who experienced a flare in TP2 entered TP3 at the visit where the 
flare was confirmed. In TP3, secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg s.c. (based on body weight) was 
administered every 4 weeks until Week 100 was reached. 
Concomitant treatments: 
The  use  of  other  JIA  medications  during  the  study  was  restricted  to  stable  doses  of  methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine (ERA patients only), oral corticosteroids and no more than one NSAID. Other therapies for 
JIA  had  to  be  discontinued  prior  to  randomisation,  and  wash-out  periods  for  different  classes  were 
defined in the study protocol. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The purpose of study F2304 was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab treatment in 
paediatric patients ≥ 2 to < 18 years with active JPsA and ERA and to demonstrate the sustained efficacy 
of  secukinumab  by  using  a  flare  prevention  design  in  the  double-blind  placebo-controlled  treatment 
withdrawal part of the trial. The stated objectives of study F2304 along with their associated endpoints 
are listed in Table 6.

JIA ACR response criteria 
Standard  ACR  paediatric  Criteria  (JIA  ACR  criteria)  consists  of  6  core  components.  JIA  ACR 
30/50/70/90/100  were  defined  as  30%,  50%,  70%,  90%  and  100%  improvement  from  baseline 
respectively in a minimum of three variables in the core set with no more than one variable worsening 
more than 30% as defined in the JIA ACR criteria. 
The 6 core components variables are: 
• 
• 
• 
Physician global assessment of disease activity on a 0 - 100 mm VAS from 0 mm = no disease 
activity to 100 mm = very severe disease activity 
Parent or subject’s (if appropriate in age) Global Assessment of Subject’s overall wellbeing on a 
0-100 mm VAS from 0 mm = very well to 100 mm = very poor. 
Functional ability: Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ; an instrument completed 
by the parent (for subjects 18 years and older, completed by the subject and parent together), 
consisting  of  multiple  choice  and  VAS items  concerning  difficulty  in  performing  eight  common 
activities  of  daily  living;  dressing  and  grooming,  arising,  eating,  walking,  reaching,  personal 
hygiene, gripping and activities). 
•  Number  of  active  joints  using  the  ACR  definition  (any  joint  with  swelling  or  in  the  absence  of 
swelling, limitation of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness not due to 
deformity) 
•  Number of joints with limited range of motion 
• 
Laboratory measure of inflammation: C-reactive Protein (CRP) 
The core components were used to determine ACR Paediatric response, Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity 
Score (JADAS) and inactive disease status. JIA ACR response, responder status at Week 12, and flare 
occurrence in TP2 were determined by a central vendor. 
Clinical  inactive  disease  definition  was  adapted  from  the  JIA  ACR  criteria.  All  of  the  following  were 
required to be met: 
•  No joints with active arthritis 
•  No uveitis 
•  CRP value within normal limits for the laboratory where tested or, if elevated, not attributable to 
JIA 
• 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity score ≤ 10mm 
•  Duration of morning stiffness attributable to JIA ≤15 min 
Clinical  remission  on  medication  was  defined  as  ≥  6  consecutive  months  of  inactive  disease  while  the 
subject was on medication. 
Flare definition 
Both criteria 1 and 2 must be fulfilled to meet the definition of a disease flare. Criteria changes described 
are relative to the End of TP1 (Week 12 visit). 
1.  ≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 ACR response variables 
• 
• 
Physician global assessment of overall disease activity 
Parent or patient global assessment of overall well-being 
Assessment report

• 
Functional ability (CHAQ) 
•  Number of joints with active arthritis 
•  Number of joints with limited range of motion 
• 
Index of inflammation: CRP 
2.  ≥ 30% improvement in no more than 1 of the 6 ACR response variables 
Contingencies: 
• 
• 
• 
if the Physician or Parent Global Assessment is one of the 3 response variables used to define 
flare, worsening of ≥ 20 mm (1-100mm visual analogue scale) must be present; 
if the number of active joints or joints with limitation of motion is one of the 3 response variables 
used to define flare, worsening in ≥ 2 joints must be present; 
if CRP is one of the 3 response variables to define flare it must be above normal range 
Joint and enthesitis counts 
Tender joint counts were based on assessment of 75 joints, swollen joint counts on 68 joints, and counts 
of joints with limitation of motion on 69 joints. Enthesitis count was based on assessment of tenderness 
in 16 entheseal sites. 
Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) 
Juvenile  Arthritis  Disease  Activity  Score  (JADAS)  is  a  composite  disease  activity  score  consisting  of  4 
components: 
• 
• 
• 
Physician global assessment of disease activity 
parent/subject global assessment of overall well-being 
active joint count 
•  CRP 
JADAS-27  (Juvenile  Arthritis  Disease  Activity  Score  in  27  joints)  ranges  from  0  to  57  and  JADAS-71 
ranges from 0 to 101, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. 
Sample size 
For  the  sample  size  calculation,  the  MAH  assumed  that  the  Flare-free  time  follows  an  exponential 
distribution with a constant hazard ratio. 
The hazard ratio of flare events for the secukinumab group relative to placebo group was estimated to 
be 0.32 in TP2. The hazard ratio of 0.32 was used to establish the sample size necessary in TP2 and 
consequently TP1 (derived from the median time to disease flare for etanercept and placebo in children 
with polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, as reported in a publication by Lovell et. al. 2000). 
With the hazard ratio assumed to be 0.32, 33 flares were necessary to detect a statistically significant 
difference between secukinumab and placebo, assuming 90% power and a 1-sided significance level of 
0.025.  No  data  were  available  to  estimate  the  placebo  hazard  rate  beyond  6-months.  Given  that 
uncertainty and a maximum 21-month follow-up in TP2, the total sample size necessary to achieve 33 
flares in TP2 was estimated to be at least 60 and at most 80 subjects. Assuming approximately 70% to 
85%  of  subjects  responded  in  TP1,  the  estimated  minimum  number  of  subjects  treated  in  TP1  was 
between 70 and 86. Under the assumption of 12 months of accrual duration, the total maximum expected 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 37/107 
 
 
 
study  duration  is  33  months.  The  expected  number  of  flare  events  was  12  and  21  respectively,  for 
secukinumab and placebo group in TP2. 
Randomisation 
At  the  Week  12  visit,  all  responders  were  eligible  to  enter  TP2  where  they  were  randomised  via 
Interactive  Response  Technology  (IRT)  to  one  of  the  two  treatment  arms  in  a  1:1  ratio:  active  as 
secukinumab 75 or 150 mg based on their weight at that visit, or matching placebo. 
The randomisation was stratified by each JIA category (strata: JPsA and ERA) so that approximately an 
equal number from each category were to receive either active or placebo. 
In terms of the IRT process, the Investigator or his/her delegate contacted the IRT after confirming that 
the subject fulfilled the response criteria. The IRT assigned a randomisation number to the subject, which 
was used to link the subject to a treatment arm and specified a unique medication number for the first 
package of study drug to be dispensed to the subject. The randomisation number was not communicated 
to the caller. 
The  randomisation  numbers  were  generated  using  the  following  procedure  to  ensure  that  treatment 
assignment  was  unbiased  and  concealed  from  subjects/parents  and  Investigator  staff.  A  subject 
randomisation list was produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random 
assignment of subject numbers to randomisation numbers. These randomisation numbers were linked 
to the different treatment arms and to study strata, which in turn were linked to medication numbers. A 
separate  medication  list  was  produced  by  or  under  the  responsibility  of  the  MAH’s  Drug  Supply 
Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers 
to packs containing the investigational drug(s). 
Blinding (masking) 
Subjects/parents, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained 
blinded to the identity of the treatment (TP2) from the time of randomisation until the primary endpoint 
analysis/final analysis database lock, using the following methods: 
1.  Randomisation  data  were  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  were  not 
accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the exception of the bioanalyst, independent 
statistician, programmer and DMC members. 
2.  The  identity  of  the  treatments  was  concealed  by  use  of  study  drug  with  identical  packaging, 
labeling, schedule of administration, administration route and appearance for both secukinumab 
and placebo. 
Unblinding only occurred in the case of subject emergencies and after the primary efficacy analysis/final 
analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis set were used for the efficacy summaries: 
• 
• 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for Treatment Period 1 (Full Analysis Set 1) will consist of all patients 
who received at least one dose of study drug in Treatment Period 1. 
The FAS for Treatment Period 2 (Full Analysis Set 2) will consist of all randomized patients who 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  in  Treatment  Period  2.  Following  the  intent-to-treat 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 38/107 
 
 
 
principle,  patients  will  be  analysed  according  to  the  treatment  they  were  assigned  to  at 
randomization in Treatment Period 2. 
• 
The FAS for Treatment Period 3 (Full Analysis Set 3) will consist of all patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug in Treatment Period 3. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: time to flare 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to disease flare in TP2, defined as the interval between the date 
of randomization to the date of first occurrence of a disease flare event. Subjects who did not experience 
a flare event at the end of TP2 or discontinued prematurely before the end of TP2 for reasons other than 
experiencing a disease flare were censored at the date of the last efficacy evaluation in TP2. The two 
treatment groups were compared using a one-sided stratified log-rank test with the stratification factor 
of JIA category (ERA or JPsA) and MTX use at baseline (yes/no) at the 2.5% level of significance. Hazard 
ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals were estimated based on a Cox proportional hazards 
model  with  treatment  and  analysis  factors  JIA  category  (ERA  or  JPsA)  and  MTX  use  at  baseline    as 
explanatory variables. Of note, the plan to stratify the analysis by MTX use at baseline or as an additional 
explanatory variable in the model represents a change in the protocol-defined analysis plan but was pre-
planned in the SAP. 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  planned  e.g.  to  consider  a  scenario  where  patients  discontinuing  the  study 
treatment prematurely for any reason will be considered as having flared at the time of study treatment 
discontinuation. 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint evaluated the consistency of the effect by JIA 
category (ERA and JPsA), and methotrexate use at baseline. Additional subgroup analyses of the primary 
endpoint were conducted by age, gender and weight categories. 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints 
The secondary and exploratory efficacy objectives and respective endpoints are listed in Table 6. The 
secondary variables were summarised descriptively only using FAS of the respective treatment period 
using observed data only. The analyses were done to evaluate 
• 
effect of secukinumab treatment in Treatment Period 1 up to Week 12 (end of Treatment period 
1) 
•  withdrawal effect of secukinumab treatment during and at the end of Treatment Period 2 
on the efficacy measures for all patients and each JIA category. 
The  analysis  of  exploratory  endpoints  included  descriptive  evaluation  of  the  effect  of  secukinumab 
treatment in Treatment Period 3 after a patient experiences a disease flare in Treatment Period 2.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  97  subjects  were  screened,  of  which  86  were  enrolled  into  TP1.  Of  these  86  subjects,  83 
completed  TP1,  and  75  were  deemed  responders  eligible  for  randomisation  into  TP2.  A  total  of  67 
subjects completed TP2, and 61 subjects completed the entire study. 
Subject disposition in study F2034 is outlined in Figure 11, and reasons for discontinuation are displayed 
in Table 7.

*The 32 patients who entered into TP3 included 2 patients (Patient  and Patient ) who were erroneously 
switched into TP# but had not experienced any flare at TP2. These 2 patients were considered as not 
having flared for efficacy analysis. 
One  other  patient  (Patient)  experienced  a  flare  at  the  discontinuation  visit  in  TP2.  The  patient  was 
discontinued  due  to  SAE  and  did  not  enter  TP3.  For  correct  reporting,  this  patient  was  considered  as 
having flared for efficacy analysis for time to flare. 
As a result, 32 flare events are included in the efficacy analysis for time to flare.

Recruitment 
The  study  was  conducted  in  32  Investigator  sites  across  10  countries:  3  centres  in  Belgium  (n=4),  4 
centres  in  Germany  (n=16),  2  centres  in  Italy  (n=2),  1  centre  in  Poland  (n=4),  5  centres  in  Russia 
(n=18), 2 centres in South Africa (n=5), 2 centres in Spain (n=6), 4 centres in Turkey (n=17), 5 centres 
in the United Kingdom (n=8), and 4 centres in the United States (n=6). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for the study had an effective date of 24 October 2016; first subject first visit took 
place on 23 May 2017, and last subject last visit took place on 09 November 2020. 
The  protocol  was  amended  on  two  occasions.  In  Amendment  1,  dated  06  April  2017  (i.e.,  before 
enrolment of the first subject), some clarifications and corrections were made into the ILAR diagnostic 
criteria; it was also clarified that subjects discontinuing prior to Week 12 visit may be replaced. Study 
completion,  post-study  treatment  and  eligibility  to  enter  into  extension  study  was  clarified,  and  the 
suggested order of assessments was amended in order to minimise delays during visits. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 41/107 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 2, dated 04 June 2020, was issued to adapt the protocol to COVID-19 -related challenges, 
most importantly permitting shipment of IMP to the subjects as well as its administration at home (under 
caregiver supervision, as appropriate). Study visits were also permitted to be replaced with phone calls 
or virtual contacts in contingency situations. 
Overall,  64.0%  (55/86)  subjects  had  at  least  one  protocol  deviation,  among  them  64.6%  (31/48) 
subjects in secukinumab group and 63.2% (24/38) subjects in the placebo group. The most common 
cause of protocol deviation was ‘prohibited concomitant medication’ reported in 25.6% subjects overall 
(25.0%  in  secukinumab  group  and  26.3%  in  placebo  in  TP2  group).  This  includes  protocol  deviations 
attributed  to  prohibited  medications,  incorrect  dose  of  a  concomitant  medication  or  use  of  biologics 
during the study follow-up period. According to the MAH, the majority of such protocol deviations were 
related  to  the  dose  of  a  corticosteroid,  oral  DMARD  or  NSAID  that  was  not  maintained  stable  since 
baseline, with most of these deviations representing discontinuations or dose reductions. The deviations 
were balanced between TP2 treatment groups. 
Protocol deviation ‘selection criteria not met’ was reported in 23.3% subjects overall. The majority of 
these protocol deviations were related to missing lab results or lab results that were not available before 
randomisation, or were related to the use of second line concomitant medications either not listed in the 
protocol as acceptable or  not at a stable dose per  protocol. Within the category ‘treatment deviation’ 
(20.9%), the majority was associated with subjects missing a visit and therefore missing a dose. 
The categories of protocol deviations  were generally balanced  between the treatment groups and are 
displayed in Table 8. 
Table 8 Protocol deviations by deviation category – Entire treatment period (Safety Set) 
In total, 9 subjects had protocol deviations, mostly missed doses and/or missed assessments, related to 
COVID-19 pandemic. According to the MAH, due to the limited number of protocol deviations related to 
COVID-19 pandemic and as judged from the results of sensitivity analyses for COVID-19 impact, there 
seemed to be at most a minimal impact on the primary efficacy results. 
In September 2020, the MAH was informed by one of its service providers of a cyber security attack that 
mandated a shutdown of the provider’s entire network. However, a subsequent incident analysis by the 
MAH indicated no impact with respect to study F2304. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects enrolled in the study was 13.1 years (range: 2 to 17 years). There were 3 
subjects (1 ERA, 2 JPsA) in the 2-<6 years age group, 22 subjects in the 6-<12 years age group, and 
61  subjects  in  the  12-<18  years  age  group.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  male  (66.3%)  and 
Assessment report

predominantly White (95.3%), with mean weight and height of 56.0 kg and 158.0 cm, respectively. The 
mean  BMI  was  approximately  21.7  kg/m2.  There  were  6  subjects  with  a  body  weight  of  <25  kg,  24 
subjects with a body weight of 25 to <50 kg, and 56 subjects with a body weight of 50 kg or higher at 
baseline. Among subjects enrolled, 52 subjects (60.5%) had ERA and 34 subjects (39.5%) had JPsA. 
Apart from a different gender distribution for subjects with ERA and JPsA (ERA: male 78.8%; JPsA: male 
47.1%), the demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects were generally comparable between 
the treatment groups and by JIA category. The demographic characteristics are summarised in Table 9.

At baseline, mean JADAS-27 score was 15.072 (SD 7.129, range 3.3 – 35.3), mean total enthesitis 
count was 2.6 (SD 2.51, range 0 – 13), and mean total dactylitis count was 1.0 (SD 2.15, range 0 – 
11). Baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the TP2 treatment groups as 
well as between JIA subtypes; mean total enthesitis count was slightly higher in subjects with ERA 
than subjects with JPsA (2.7 vs. 2.3), whereas mean total dactylitis count was higher in subjects with 
JPsA than subjects with ERA (1.8 vs. 0.4). Mean CRP at baseline was 23.96 mg/l (SD 38.76, range 0 – 
185.16) in subjects with ERA, compared to 10.52 mg/l (SD 13.97, range 0.34 – 55.24) in subjects with 
JPsA. 
Some 65% of subjects with either subtype in TP1 was using methotrexate at baseline; within the two 
subtypes, MTX was used by 33/52 (63%) of ERA subjects in TP1 (15/22 (68%) for secukinumab in TP2 
and 14/22 (64%) for placebo in TP2), and by 23/34 (68%) of JPsA subjects in TP1 (11/15 (73%) for 
secukinumab in TP2 and 11/16 (69%) for placebo in TP2). Among ERA subjects, concomitant use of 
sulfasalazine was reported for 12/52 (23%) subjects enrolled in TP1 and 8/44 (18%) subjects 
randomised in TP2, with 5 on secukinumab and 3 on placebo. Baseline disease characteristics are

Numbers analysed 
The overall Full Analysis Set (FAS; all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug) and 
overall Safety Set (all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in the study) were 
identical and comprised all 86 subjects enrolled into the study (Table 11). No subjects were excluded 
from the analysis sets. 
In TP2, subjects were randomised via a 1:1 stratified randomisation design to either secukinumab or 
placebo treatment. As a result in TP2, there were 22 subjects with ERA receiving treatment with

secukinumab, 22 subjects with ERA receiving treatment with placebo, 15 subjects with JPsA receiving 
treatment with secukinumab (40.5%), and 16 subjects with JPsA receiving treatment with placebo.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint – time to flare in TP2 
Study F2304 met its primary endpoint: for the combined ERA and JPsA categories, the time to flare in 
TP2 was statistically significantly longer in the secukinumab group compared to the placebo group 
(hazard ratio of flare event, HR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, p<0.001). The risk of flare was reduced 
by 72% for subjects on secukinumab compared with subjects on placebo in TP2. 
During TP2, there were a total of 21 flare events in the placebo group compared to 10 flare events in 
the secukinumab group. At 1 year, the flare-free rate was 76.7% (95% CI: 58.7, 87.6) in the 
secukinumab group and 54.3% (95% CI: 37.1, 68.7) in the placebo group. By the end of TP2, median 
time to disease flare was not reached in the secukinumab group and was 453 days in the placebo 
group. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to disease flare are graphically depicted in Figure 12, and the survival 
analysis is summarised in Table 12.

Table 12 
Survival analysis of time to disease flare – TP2 (FAS2) 
A tipping point analysis with a worst-case scenario was conducted to examine the potential effects of 
missing data on the results of the primary endpoint. For the worst-case scenario, subjects in the 
secukinumab arm who discontinued prematurely in TP2 for any reason were considered as having a 
flare at the date of TP discontinuation, while subjects in the placebo arm in TP2 were considered as 
censored at 645 days. Results of this sensitivity analysis estimated a 51% relative reduction in risk of 
disease flare for subjects treated with secukinumab compared to placebo in TP2 (HR=0.49, 95% CI: 
0.25 to 0.97, p=0.021). 
Prolongation in time to disease flare in TP2 was observed in both JIA categories for subjects treated 
with secukinumab compared to placebo. In the ERA subgroup, there was an estimated 55% relative 
reduction in risk of disease flare for subjects treated with secukinumab compared to placebo in TP2 
(HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.16 to 1.28), and the estimated flare-free rate at 1-year post randomisation was 
75.6% (95% CI: 50.9, 89.1) for secukinumab vs. 63.0% (95% CI: 39.4, 79.5) for placebo. In the JPsA 
subgroup, there was an estimated 85% relative reduction in risk of disease flare for subjects treated 
with secukinumab compared to placebo in TP2 (HR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.57), and the estimated 
flare-free rate at 1-year post randomisation was 77.5% (95% CI: 44.8, 92.3) for secukinumab vs 
42.2% (95% CI: 18.1, 64.6) for placebo. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to disease flare for the subtypes are shown in Figure 13, and the 
survival analyses for the subtypes are summarised in Table 13.

In descriptive subgroup analyses based on age, weight, gender and methotrexate use at baseline, 
point estimates for hazard ratios were in favour of secukinumab across all subgroups (Figure 14).

Secondary endpoints – TP1 (open-label secukinumab) 
During open-label secukinumab treatment in TP1, disease activity improvements were observed 
already during the first weeks. At Week 12, a JIA ACR 30 response was achieved by 75/83 subjects 
(90.4%) completing TP1, and they were thereby eligible for randomisation into TP2. A JIA ACR 70 
response was achieved by 58/83 subjects (69.9%), and inactive disease status was achieved by 30/83 
subjects (36.1%). JIA ACR responses during TP1 for all subjects are shown in Figure 15, and Week 12 
responses by disease subtype are shown in Table 14. 
Improvements were seen across all JIA ACR core components, with the largest improvements seen on 
active joint count (79.3%) and physician’s global assessment (77.4%), and the smallest improvement 
(13.6%) seen on median CRP.

Decreases in JADAS scores, indicating decreasing disease activity, were seen in TP1 starting from the 
first weeks of treatment, with a well established effect being observed from Week 4. For all subjects in 
TP1, the mean JADAS-27 score decreased from a baseline score of 15.07 (SD 7.13) to 4.64 (SD 4.72) 
at Week 12 (Figure 16); mean decrease from baseline to Week 12 was -10.49 (SD 7.23). Total 
enthesitis and dactylitis counts decreased from baseline to Week 12 among subjects with either 
disease subtype (Table 15).

In descriptive subgroup analyses based on age and weight group, gender and methotrexate use at 
baseline, JIA ACR 30 response rates ranging from 82.8% to 100%, and JIA ACR 50 response rates 
ranging from 79.3% to 100% were seen across the different subgroups (Table 16). Notably, all 6 
subjects in the <25 kg weight band were also JIA ACR 70 responders at Week 12; this group includes 
all 3 subjects aged <6 years.

Secondary endpoints – TP2 and TP3 
The proportion of subjects who, at the end of TP2, had a JIA ACR response or met the criteria for 
inactive disease was higher among subjects randomised to continue secukinumab compared to those 
randomised to placebo in TP2 (Figure 17). Of note, due to the event-driven design of the study, the 
end of TP2 is based on each individual subject’s last visit for TP2.

To further elucidate the time course of disease activity in a population for whom the treatment 
strategy would correspond to “treatment withdrawal followed by retreatment as needed” as compared 
to chronic continuous treatment, and consequently to enable an informal comparison of these longer-
term treatment strategies, the MAH was requested to provide a summary of JIA ACR responses and 
mean JADAS-27 in the entire study population through Week 104, i.e. combining subjects with and 
without a flare. The results are summarised in Figure 19 through Figure 23.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven randomised withdrawal study 
(study F2304) evaluating the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in 86 paediatric patients aged 2 to < 
18 years with JIA subtypes of ERA or JPsA. 
According  to  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of 
juvenile 
idiopathic  arthritis  (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014  Rev.  2),  randomised  placebo-controlled 
withdrawal design trials can be considered acceptable in JIA for products where efficacy and safety have 
been established in adults. Furthermore, an event driven approach is recommended to be considered to

avoid the risk that the withdrawal part is too short to show a difference in the flare rate between the 
placebo and the new drug. Considering the extensive clinical experience accumulated with secukinumab 
to date, the general design of the study is considered consistent with the Guideline. The responder and 
flare definitions used in the study are well established. The study was also compliant with the Key Binding 
Elements of the respective Paediatric Investigation Plan for secukinumab. 
In principle, the eligibility criteria were consistent with the proposed indication. However, the inclusion 
criteria  required  an  inadequate  response  (≥  1  month)  or  intolerance  to  ≥  1  NSAID,  as  well  as  an 
inadequate response (≥ 2 months) or intolerance to ≥ 1 DMARD, whereas the MAH’s initially proposed 
indication only stated that secukinumab would be indicated for ERA or JPsA patients who have responded 
inadequately to, or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (which could be understood as implying 
NSAIDs  only).  At  the  CHMP’s  request,  the  MAH  added  a  cross-reference  to  Section  5.1  where  the 
population enrolled into study F2304 is described in sufficient detail. The indication was also amended 
to specify that secukinumab may be used with or without MTX which was considered acceptable to the 
CHMP.  
The secukinumab dosing regimen was based on modelling and simulation from adult studies; separate 
dose response studies in paediatric patients were not performed. The weight-tiered regimen is the same 
as the one that has already been authorised for paediatric psoriasis. 
The assessment instruments used in the study are in accordance with relevant guidance, and the selected 
endpoints permit a comprehensive characterisation of the efficacy of secukinumab in patients with the 
applicable subtypes of JIA. According to the CHMP Guideline, given the well-known bias of the withdrawal 
trial toward responders, every effort should be made to report a meaningful outcome over time such as 
ACR  Pedi  70,  90,  minimal  disease  activity  or  inactive  disease  /  remission  at  1  and  2  years.  These 
outcomes were included among the secondary endpoints of the study. 
The MAH has adapted the definition of ‘inactive disease’ from the JIA ACR criteria, and the definition is 
also  largely  consistent  with  the  definition  provided  in  the  CHMP  Guideline.  However,  some 
operationalisations  have  been  made,  i.e.,  the  MAH  has  operationalised  “normal  physician’s  global 
assessment of disease activity” as “Physician’s global assessment of disease activity score ≤ 10mm
”.  Also,  “absence  of  morning  stiffness”  was  operationalised  as  “Duration  of  morning  stiffness 
attributable  to  JIA  ≤15  min”  and  no  information  was  given  on  how  morning  stiffness  duration  was 
measured. In principle, other parties may apply slightly different operationalisations, in which case the 
results  would  not  be  fully  comparable.  Therefore,  whereas  it  can  be  agreed  that  results  for  ‘inactive 
disease’  can  be  presented  in  a  context  where  the  corresponding  exact  definition  is  available,  their 
inclusion  in  the  SmPC,  where  a  condensed  presentation  is  required,  is  not  supported.  At  the  CHMP’s 
request, the MAH agreed to remove this information from the SmPC. 
As stated in the CHMP Guideline, JIA is a fluctuating, flaring disease, and for some forms of JIA, the risk 
of  flares  decreases  with  aging.  Thus,  once  patients  are  stabilised  in  remission,  lower  maintenance 
dosages  and  even  drug  withdrawal  may  be  appropriate.  Dose-reduction  or  dose-interruption  and  re-
treatment at relapse should be addressed within the clinical programme, and controlled clinical study 
designs  are  preferred.  While  not  directly  addressing  this  aspect  of  treatment,  study  F2304  allows  a 
limited  opportunity  to  address  the  need  for  continued  maintenance  treatment  in  a  well  responding 
patient. 
The event-driven sample size is found adequate for detecting a clinically relevant effect and statistically 
significant effect. The randomisation and blinding procedures are considered adequate. 
Log-rank test, stratified by JIA category and MTX use, is a robust statistical method for comparing the 
distribution  of  event  times  and  considered  fit  for  purpose.  In  terms  of  effect  size,  the  hazard  ratio 
estimated  by  the  specified  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  is  conventional.  Here  it  measures  the 
Assessment report

Page 67/107 
 
 
 
immediate  risk  of  observing  a  disease  flare  among  those  that  have  not  been  observed  to  experience 
flare at earlier visits post Week 12. Provision of a single hazard ratio as a measure of treatment effect 
can be criticised for its inherent selection bias (as the immediate risk of flare is compared between groups 
that are affected by post-randomisation selection, i.e. those that have not flared under their randomised 
treatment) which may also lead to the hazard ratio as not being constant. The estimated proportions of 
subjects  that  experience  flare  by  selected  timepoints  may  be  better  understood  and  can  be  retrieved 
from the analyses conducted by the MAH. Of note, the trial did not reach the number of observed flares 
required for the primary analysis and thus continued until all subjects reached all Week 104. Therefore, 
no administrative censoring needed to be done before, approximately, Week 104. The reasons for non-
administrative censoring of data should always be evaluated and sensitivity analyses done, especially if 
the  proportion  of  non-administratively  censored  observations  is  large  because  censoring  might  be 
predictive of flare. To this end, the MAH planned a sensitivity analysis where subjects discontinuing the 
study  treatment  prematurely  for  any  reason  are  considered  as  having  flared  at  the  time  of  study 
treatment discontinuation.  
The efficacy summaries provided for TP1 are descriptive. In the absence of a blinded comparator, it is 
impossible to assess the extent to which the responses and improvements in disease activity may reflect 
an effect of the treatment. 
The descriptive summaries of observed data by TP2 visit and randomised treatment reflect the disease 
activity among those that have not been observed to experience a disease flare following ‘response’ at 
Week  12.  Given  that  subjects  are  excluded  from  TP2  and  the  data  summaries  in  question,  and  no 
adjustments  are  done  to  account  for  this  selection  process,  these  summaries  have  no  causal 
interpretation concerning the effect of withdrawal from active treatment. 
The summary of JIA response at the time of observed disease flare and at subsequent evaluations help 
understand the disease state relative to study baseline and whether disease activity is improved following 
re-treatment  (for  subjects  receiving  placebo  in  TP2),  although  these  data  are  open-label  and  lack  a 
control arm. The summaries also shed light on the robustness of the flare definition as an endpoint and 
as a criterion guiding treatment decisions. 
Overall, the data analyses provided are adequate for meeting the primary objective. While a comparison 
of  benefits  and  risks  between  potential  alternative  treatment  strategies  beyond  the  primary  endpoint 
was not included among the stated objectives of the study, the study design in itself would not seem to 
preclude also such comparisons. 
The original protocol for the study had an effective date of 24 October 2016; first subject first visit took 
place on 23 May 2017, and last subject last visit took place on 09 November 2020. The highest number 
of subjects were enrolled in Russia (18), Turkey (17) and Germany (16). Almost 50% of subjects were 
recruited within EU Member States. 
The study protocol was amended on two occasions. The amendments do not jeopardise the reliability or 
integrity  of  the  study,  and  COVID  19  -related  challenges  in  study  conduct  appear  to  have  been 
appropriately managed. 
A protocol deviation implying inappropriate use of prohibited or non-acceptable medications was reported 
in a high proportion of subjects. As these have not been further commented on in the CSR, the MAH was 
requested to clarify the nature of these medications and discuss their potential implications regarding 
the  efficacy  analyses.  In  its  response,  the  MAH  clarified  that  the  majority  of  such  protocol  deviations 
were related to the dose of a corticosteroid, oral DMARD or NSAID that was not maintained stable since 
baseline, with most of these deviations representing discontinuations or dose reductions. The deviations 
were balanced between TP2 treatment groups, and according to the MAH, are not believed to have an 
impact on the efficacy analyses. The clarification is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022

Considering the length of the study, overall attrition during the study was moderate, with over 70% of 
subjects completing the planned 2 years of treatment. There was no particular clustering with respect 
to reasons for discontinuation. 
The majority of subjects were in the higher age and body weight ranges; only 3 subjects under 6 years 
of age, and 6 subjects with a body weight of less than 25 kg body weight at baseline were enrolled into 
the study. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the treatment 
groups; whereas slight differences between the disease subtypes could be observed, these do not raise 
concerns with respect to the validity of the results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study F2304 met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation of time to 
flare with secukinumab compared to placebo in TP2 (HR of flare event = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, 
p<0.001). The primary analysis was appropriately supported with a tipping point analysis, confirming 
robustness of the results with respect to censoring of data during the 92-week follow-up. A prolongation 
of time to flare with secukinumab compared to placebo was observed in both ERA and JPsA subjects; in 
ERA subjects, the risk of a disease flare with placebo was lower when compared to JPsA subjects. Other 
descriptive subgroup analyses (based on age, weight, gender and methotrexate use at baseline) yielded 
HR’s <1 for all subgroups; notably, the effect of secukinumab was more pronounced among subjects 
who were not using methotrexate, but it can be agreed that incremental efficacy is seen both with and 
without methotrexate. During the procedure, the indication was amended to specify that secukinumab 
may  be  used  with  or  without  MTX  which  was  considered  acceptable  to  the  CHMP.  From  an  efficacy 
perspective, the results do not point to particular concerns regarding any of the subgroups analysed, but 
it should be noted that all subjects in the 2-<6-year age range were randomised to placebo in TP2; as 
such, an assessment of efficacy based on the primary endpoint in this age group is not possible. 
During  TP1,  improvements  in  disease  activity  were  rapid,  and  over  90%  of  subjects  completing  TP1 
achieved a JIA ACR 30 response. Almost 70% of subjects achieved a JIA ACR 70 response, and 36% 
achieved  inactive  disease  status  which  –  although  in  an  uncontrolled  open-label  setting  -  can  be 
considered  suggestive  of  a  clinically  relevant  treatment  effect.  The  following  statement  is  currently 
included in the SmPC and was considered adequate to the CHMP also as it would pertain to JIA: “Available 
data  suggest  that  a  clinical  response  is  usually  achieved  within  16 weeks  of  treatment.  Consideration 
should  be  given  to  discontinuing  treatment  in  patients  who  have  shown  no  response  by  16 weeks  of 
treatment.  Some  patients  with  an  initial  partial  response  may  subsequently  improve  with  continued 
treatment beyond 16 weeks.” 
Improvements  were  seen  in  both  disease  subtypes  and  across  all  analysed  subgroups;  a  JIA  ACR  70 
response at Week 12 was seen in all 6 subjects in the <25 kg weight band (with this group also including 
all  3  subjects  aged  2-<6  years).  However,  even  from  an  efficacy  perspective,  the  evidence  base  for 
inclusion of the 2-<6-year age group in the initially proposed indication was considered very limited. 
Since  actual  clinical  experience  in  the  youngest  patients  initially  proposed  to  be  included  in  the 
therapeutic indication was very limited, the MAH revised the indication during the procedure to exclude 
children from 2 to less than 6 years of age. 
The separation in Kaplan-Meier curves mostly occurred during the first 4-5 months after randomisation 
into TP2, suggesting that the risk of flare varies among the patients and that those who are in the highest 
need for continued therapy tend to flare during the first months after discontinuation of secukinumab. 
Also, only 55% of subjects withdrawing to placebo had experienced a flare event at the end of TP2; thus, 
in the clinical setting, a substantial proportion of patients with an early response to secukinumab could 
incur longer-term treatment benefit even with a short treatment course. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 69/107 
 
 
 
Moreover, at the time of the observed flare event, subjects’ disease activity levels were often better than 
at  baseline,  with  a  third  (7/21)  of  subjects  still  meeting  JIA  ACR50  response  in  the  placebo  group. 
Whether  the  predefined  flare  events  on  placebo  were  indicative  of  further  decline  in  subjects’  -  and 
thereby  populations’  -  clinical  state  is  not  possible  to  tell  since  subjects  were  switched  to  open-label 
secukinumab  immediately  when  a  flare  was  observed.  However,  among  subjects  who  met  the  flare 
criteria on continued secukinumab, the subsequent JIA ACR response profiles appeared not very different 
as compared with subjects who did not have flare event, with e.g. JIA ACR 50 response rates varying 
around  80%  following  flare  vs.  90%  in  subjects  with  no  flare  observed.  This  suggests  that  the  flare 
definition may not have been a specific indicator of a permanent loss of response. Given the retreatment 
with  open-label  secukinumab,  it  is  not  possible  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  comparison  of  outcomes 
between populations whose secukinumab is continued vs. discontinued at Week 12. In order to better 
assess the benefit of long-term treatment, a longer-term placebo control would be required. 
Given these observations, there remains uncertainty regarding the appropriate length of treatment; it 
may  be  that  any  “lost  opportunity”  could  be  quite  limited  if  a  treatment  strategy  is  applied  whereby 
treatment in a well responding patient is interrupted and restarted in case of a flare. 
To elucidate the time course of disease activity in a population for whom the treatment strategy would 
correspond  to  “treatment  withdrawal  followed  by  retreatment  as  needed”  as  compared  to  chronic 
continuous  treatment,  and  consequently  to  enable  an  informal  comparison  of  these  longer-term 
treatment  strategies,  the MAH  was  requested  to  provide  a  summary  of  JIA ACR  responses  and  mean 
JADAS-27 in the entire study population through Week 104, i.e. combining subjects with and without a 
flare, and provide a discussion. 
In  its  response,  the  MAH  argued  that  the  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  individualised  treatment 
durations nor the possibilities to attempt dose reduction or discontinuation in a well-responding patient. 
Rather,  the  goal  was  to  maximise  the  benefit  to  patients,  and  the  study  results  support  the  need  for 
continuous  (monthly)  treatment  with  secukinumab  s.c.  for  the  prevention  of  flares.  The  MAH  further 
argued  that  assessments  within  the  study  were  primarily  symptomatic  and  may  not  represent  the 
complete  assessment  of  inflammation for  each  patient,  and  that  increased  joint  or  structural  damage 
could still be occurring even in the absence of symptoms. Therefore, the MAH considered that it cannot 
make standardised recommendations to discontinue treatment within this multi-faceted and fluctuating 
disease that would apply to all patients and proposed that it is best for any decisions to that effect to be 
left to the treating physician, following a full assessment of the patients’ disease burden. 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  an  evaluation  of  different  long-term  treatment  strategies  was  not  among  the 
stated objectives of study F2304; nevertheless, the design and the collected data do in fact provide an 
opportunity to evaluate the merits of different approaches in this respect, and the results would seem 
to support the notion that overall, similar longer-term outcomes on the group level can be achieved with 
a relapse-retreatment strategy compared to chronic treatment. 
The demonstration of treatment benefit with secukinumab in study F2304 is not disputed, and it can also 
be  agreed  that  the  results  are  not  sufficiently  robust  to  formalise  different  long-term  treatment 
recommendations into the SmPC. Furthermore, the lack of information regarding different longer-term 
treatment strategies is not viewed as critical to the benefit-risk balance. Consequently, the issue is not 
pursued  further  within  the  current  variation  procedure.  Nevertheless,  considering  that  the  current 
posology in principle outlines a potentially life-long treatment for a paediatric population, less demanding 
long-term treatment approaches, e.g. less frequent dosing schemes or indeed dose interruptions in well-
responding patients, would very likely translate into decreased treatment burden and could even increase 
compliance.  As  such,  the  MAH  is  strongly  recommended  to  study  the  effectiveness  and  usability  of 
different  long-term  treatment  strategies  in  JIA  patients,  including  strategies  involving  a  “treatment 
withdrawal followed by retreatment as needed” approach in the post-authorisation setting.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Secukinumab  was  studied  in  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  event-driven  randomised  withdrawal 
study in 86 paediatric patients aged 2 to < 18 years with ERA or JPsA subtypes of JIA. The study met its 
primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically relevant prolongation in time to 
disease flare. During the open-label Treatment Period 1, improvements in disease activity were rapid, 
and at Week 12, almost 70% of subjects had achieved a JIA ACR 70 response and 36% had achieved 
inactive disease status which – although in an uncontrolled open-label setting - can be considered as 
further supporting a clinically relevant treatment effect. 
Since  actual  clinical  experience  in  the  youngest  patients  initially  proposed  to  be  included  in  the 
therapeutic indication was very limited (total N=3), the MAH revised their claim during the procedure to 
exclude children from 2 to less than 6 years of age from the indication.  
The  MAH  is  recommended  to  study  the  effectiveness  and  usability  of  different  long-term  treatment 
strategies in JIA patients, including strategies involving a “treatment withdrawal followed by retreatment 
as needed” approach in the post-marketing setting. 
The CHMP considered that the efficacy data available supports the following indication: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) 
Cosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
Cosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
juvenile psoriatic arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This safety analysis is primarily based on data from Study F2304. The safety population included all 
patients who were exposed to study treatment (N=86).  
Safety evaluations consisted of evaluation of AEs and SAEs, laboratory abnormalities, findings on ECGs 
and vital signs, immunogenicity, and important compound- and class-related risks including infections 
and infestations, inflammatory bowel disease, malignant or unspecified tumours, suicidal ideation and 
behaviour, and hepatitis B reactivation. 
AEs are presented as absolute and relative frequencies and as exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 
100 patient-years (PY) of exposure. 
The focus of the safety presentation is on the overall population over the entire study period (TP1 
+TP2 + TP3). The randomized withdrawal study design limits comparison of safety between the 
randomized treatment groups (secukinumab vs placebo in TP2), since given that all patients received 
secukinumab in TP1, a carry-over effect into TP2 cannot be excluded for patients randomized to 
placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 71/107 
 
 
 
 
The safety population thus comprises: 
• 
• 
patients who received secukinumab in TP1 only (up to Week 12) 
patients who received secukinumab in TP1, were randomized to placebo in TP2, and remained 
on placebo until end of study 
• 
patients who received secukinumab in TP1, were randomized to placebo in TP2, and switched 
to open-label secukinumab in TP3 
• 
patients who received secukinumab throughout the entire study period (TP+ TP2 + TP3) 
To assess the consistency of safety across different baseline characteristics, subgroup analyses were 
performed on intrinsic factors of age, gender and weight and the extrinsic factor of concomitant 
methotrexate use. 
In addition, a cross study comparison of safety data from study F2304 with pooled data from the 
pediatric psoriasis studies study A2310 and study A2311 was performed by means of side-by-side 
presentation of AEs (crude incidence and exposure-adjusted AEs). This analysis included data from 
those patients who received the same weight-based dosing regimen and treatment duration (12 
weeks) across all 3 studies. 
Study A2310 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active 
(etanercept)-controlled study to demonstrate the superiority of secukinumab (low and high dose) in 
pediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years with severe chronic plaque psoriasis with respect 
to both PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (co-primary endpoints) at Week 12, compared to 
placebo (Study A2310 Week 52). 
Study A2311 was an open-label, parallel group, two-arm, multi-center trial in pediatric patients aged 6 
years to less than 18 years with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with respect to PASI 75 
and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (co-primary endpoints) at Week 12, compared to placebo 
(historical control) [Study A2311 Week 24]. 
The MAH also refers to the large safety database across all indications (cumulative exposure of 35,241 
patient-years from 21,159 patients and healthy volunteers) in clinical trials, and 680,470 patient-years 
of post-marketing exposure [PSUR (26-Dec-2019 to 25-Dec-2020)]. 
Patient exposure 
All patients received secukinumab in TP1 and TP3 and either placebo or secukinumab in TP2. Overall, 
the mean duration of exposure to study treatment (secukinumab or placebo) during the study period 
(TP1 + TP2 + TP3) was 601 days, with a patient-time of 141.5 PY (Table 18). 
In TP2, the mean duration of exposure was longer in the secukinumab group (456 days) compared to 
the placebo in TP2 group (358 days), which reflects that a higher proportion of patients randomized to 
placebo exited TP2 due to a flare. 
A maximum of 29 SC doses for the secukinumab treatment group could be administered for the entire 
treatment period (last dose at Week 100). During the entire treatment period, 23/48 patients (47.9%) 
in  the  secukinumab  group  and  10/38  patients  (26.3%)  in  the  Placebo  in  TP2  group  received  the 
maximum number of study treatment injections (i.e., secukinumab in TP1 and TP3 and Placebo in TP2).

The study design and eligibility criteria included lack of response or intolerance to ≥ 1 NSAID and DMARD 
and  allowed  for  continued  use  and  stable  dose  of  NSAID,  methotrexate,  sulfasalazine  (ERA  patients 
only),  and/or  corticosteroids  during  TP1  and  TP2.  This  should  be  taken  into  consideration  for  the 
interpretation of the data on use of concomitant medications. 
The treatment groups in the entire treatment period refer to the secukinumab (all patients who did not 
take  any  placebo)  and  the  placebo  (all  patients  who  took  placebo  in  TP2  and  secukinumab  in  other 
period/s) groups and are presented as secukinumab and Placebo in TP2 groups in this SCS. Treatment 
comparisons  between  secukinumab  and  Placebo  in  TP2  groups  have  not  been  made  since  due  to  the 
study design, the exposure times for these groups were different over the entire treatment period. In 
addition, it cannot be ruled-out that events occurring in TP2 under placebo are due to a spill-over effect 
by the previous secukinumab treatment in TP1. 
During the entire treatment period, concomitant medications were used by more than 98% of patients 
(secukinumab: 97.9% [47/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 100% [38/38 patients]) and were well-balanced 
between  the  treatment  groups.  In  general,  the  5  most  commonly  used  medications  were  folic  acid, 
methotrexate,  paracetamol,  ibuprofen  and  naproxen.  As  per  ATC  class,  the  5  most  commonly  used 
concomitant  medications  categories  included  Musculoskeletal  system  (secukinumab:  97.9%  [47/48 
patients];  Placebo  in  TP2:  92.1%  [35/38  patients]),  Genitourinary  system  and  sex  hormones 
(secukinumab: 87.5% [42/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 81.6% [31/38 patients]), Alimentary tract and 
metabolism (secukinumab: 83.3% [40/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 81.6% [31/38 patients]), Sensory 
organs (secukinumab: 77.1% [37/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 76.3% [29/38 patients]) and Blood and 
blood forming organs (secukinumab: 70.8% [34/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 73.7% [28/38 patients]). 
In the entire treatment period, concomitant medical procedures and significant non-drug therapies were 
used  by  41.9%  of  patients  (secukinumab:  41.7%  [20/48  patients];  Placebo  in  TP2:  42.1%  [16/38 
patients]). The most commonly used disease-specific therapy categories included Surgical and medical 
procedures  (secukinumab:  31.3%  [15/48  patients];  Placebo  in  TP2:  23.7%  [9/38  patients])  and 
Investigations (secukinumab: 18.8% [9/48 patients]; Placebo in TP2: 26.3% [10/38 patients]). 
Adverse events  
Considering that the randomized withdrawal study design limits comparisons between the randomized 
treatment  groups,  the  section  below  focuses  on  presentation  of  AEs  over  the  entire  treatment  period 
(TP1 + TP2 + TP3).  
Common adverse events  
Adverse events by system organ class and preferred term 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 79 patients (91.9%) in the entire treatment period (Table 
20). The 3 most common reported SOCs reported in the total population were Infections and infestations 
(79.1%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (52.3%)  and  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders 
(37.2%) (Table 20). 
The AE incidence in Infections and infestations was mainly driven by events of nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, while diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent 
AEs  in  the  Gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC.  Arthralgia  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  the 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC (Table 20, Table 21). All of these reported AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity.

AIN457: all patients who did not take any placebo. Placebo in TP2: all patients who took placebo in TP2 and AIN457 in other period/s. N= 
number of total patients; n= number of patients with events. Preferred terms are sorted in descending order of frequency in the AIN457 column. 
A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. MedDRA version 
23.1 was used for reporting.  
Exposure adjusted incidence rates 
In  total,  the  EAIR  (expressed  as  per  100  PY)  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  by  any  primary  SOC  in  the 
entire treatment period was 290.7 in all patients. The EAIRs of the most commonly reported SOCs with 
AEs  were:  Infections  and  infestations  (134.2/100  PY),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (50.4/100  PY)  and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (31.0/100 PY), respectively. 
Treatment periods 
Overall, 56 out of 86 subjects (65.1%) experienced incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in any SOC in 
TP1.  The  3  most  commonly  reported  AEs  by  SOC  were  Infections  and  infestations  (38.4%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (17.4%) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.8%) in TP1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 77/107 
 
 
 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  in  TP2  in  any  SOC  was  84.0%  (63/75  subjects) 
(secukinumab:  34/37  subjects,  91.9%;  placebo:  29/38  subjects,  76.3%).  The  3  most  commonly 
reported AEs by SOC in the TP2 in both treatment groups were Infections and infestations (secukinumab 
73.0%;  placebo  44.7%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (secukinumab  48.6%;  placebo  28.9%)  and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (secukinumab 29.7%; placebo 23.7%). 
Overall, 23 out of 32 subjects (71.9%) experienced incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in any SOC 
over TP3. The 3 most commonly reported AEs by SOC in TP3 were Infections and infestations (62.5%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (40,6%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (34.4%) in TP3. 
Potential relationship of adverse events to study treatment 
Treatment-emergent AEs possibly related to study treatment by the investigator were reported in 32/86 
patients (37.2%) in the entire treatment period. These AEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs 
of Infections and infestations (12.8%, mainly due to nasopharyngitis), Gastrointestinal disorders (8.1%, 
mainly due to diarrhoea and aphthous ulcer), and General disorders and administration site conditions 
(8.1%, mainly due to injection site pain and injection site pruritus). 
Severity of adverse events 
The majority of treatment-emergent AEs in the entire treatment period were either mild (40/86 patients, 
46.5%) or moderate in severity (37/86 patients, 43.0%). Severe AEs occurred at a low frequency (2/86 
patients, 2.3%). 
The severe AEs of aphthous ulcer and joint effusion were reported in one patient each in TP1. Both AEs 
were  non-serious  events.  The  aphthous  ulcer  AE  was  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  the 
investigator,  secukinumab  dose  was  not  changed  and  the  event  resolved  with  treatment.  The  joint 
effusion AE was considered unrelated to secukinumab by the investigator, resolved with treatment and 
the study treatment was withdrawn. There were no severe events in the Placebo in TP2 group. 
Side-by-side display of adverse events in JIA categories ERA and JPsA and paediatric psoriasis 
(low dose group) 
A side-by-side display of AEs up to Week 12 from the low dose group (secukinumab 75 mg [< 50 kg]; 
secukinumab 150 mg [≥ 50 kg,]) of the pooled psoriasis paediatric studies (Study A2310 Week 52 DBL 
data and Study A2311 Week 24 DBL data) and final core study DBL data from Study F2304 in TP1 for 
all patients and by body weight group is presented below. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported  in  56  patients  (65.1%)  in  Study  F2304  and  in  42  patients 
(51.2%) in the secukinumab group from the pooled paediatric psoriasis studies (Study A2310 and Study 
A2311). Majority of the reported AEs in Study F2304 were mild or moderate in severity. 
In  both  Study  F2304  and  the  pooled  paediatric  psoriasis  studies,  AEs  by  SOC  were  most  commonly 
reported  in  Infections  and  infestations,  and  this  AE  pattern  was  observed  across  all  the  body  weight 
categories (< 25 kg, 25 - < 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg), followed by Gastrointestinal disorders and Skin and 
general disorders (in the body weight categories of 25 - < 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg). As expected for the JIA 
population, AEs in the Musculoskeletal disorders SOC were reported in a higher number of patients [9 
patients (10.5%); 5 patients in the body weight category of 25 - < 50 kg and 4 patients in the ≥ 50 kg 
category] in Study F2304 vs. only 1 patient (1.2%) in the ≥ 50 kg category in the paediatric psoriasis 
studies (Table 22).

A patient with multiple adverse events within a primary system organ class is counted only once. System organ classes are presented in 
descending frequency in AIN457 group from Study CAIN457F2304. The pooled psoriasis paediatric studies includes AIN457A2310 week 52 
DBL data and AIN457A2311 week 24 DBL data. *For AIN457 low dose group, patients weighing < 50 kg received 75 mg and patients 
weighing ≥ 50 kg received 150 mg (the same dose regimen as Study F2304). MedDRA Version 22.1 has been used for the reporting of adverse 
events in Pooled psoriasis paediatric studies. MedDRA Version 23.1 has been used for the reporting of adverse events in CAIN457F2304 DBL.

The PTs for AEs (for all patients and by body weight category) were also more frequently reported 
from the Infections and infestations SOC (commonly reported PTs included upper respiratory tract 
infection and nasopharyngitis). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in the study (Table 23). 
Other serious or clinically relevant adverse events  
Treatment  emergent  SAEs  were  reported  for  11  patients  (12.8%)  overall,  and  all  were  reported  in 
patients  receiving  secukinumab.  By  treatment  period,  SAEs  were  reported  for  2  patients  in  TP1,  5 
patients  in  TP2  (all  were  randomized  to  secukinumab),  and  5  patients  in  TP3.  The  most  frequently 
reported SAEs were Infections and infestations (SOC; 7 patients, 8.1%). There was no trend or pattern 
with respect to type of SAE reported, and SAEs were reported in both JIA categories (ERA: 4 patients, 
JPsA: 7 patients).  
One of the SAEs led to discontinuation of study drug; this was an SAE of Crohn’s disease also mentioned 
below. 
SAEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were reported for 2 patients:  
• 
• 
In TP2, Crohn's disease was reported as an SAE in a JPsA patient randomized to secukinumab. Study 
medication was discontinued due to the event. 
In TP3, a JPsA patient who was randomized to placebo in TP2 experienced a flare that was reported 
as an SAE (juvenile PsA). Study medication (secukinumab) was continued. 
Adverse events requiring dose interruption or discontinuation of study drug 
Overall, few patients required interruption of dosing or discontinuation of study drug due to an AE.  
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported for 8 patients (9.3%). By SOC, the most 
frequent  events  were  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (3  patients,  3.5%;  the  events 
were joint effusion and enthesopathy) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder (2 patients, 2.3%; the 
events  were  psoriasis,  and  urticaria).  The  remaining  AEs  were  pneumonia,  epilepsy,  and  the  SAE  of 
Crohn’s disease mentioned above. In two patients, these AEs occurred during placebo treatment in TP2 
(enthesopathy,  psoriasis);  the  remaining  AEs  occurred  during  secukinumab  treatment  in  TP1  (joint 
effusion), TP2 (Crohn's disease, pneumonia) and TP3 (enthesopathy, epilepsy, urticaria).  
AEs leading to interruption of study drug were reported for 7 patients (8.1%); by SOC, the most frequent 
such AEs were Infections and infestations (4 patients, 4.7%). The remaining AEs were diarrhea, food 
poisoning,  nonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease,  transaminase  increased,  and  blood  alkaline  phosphatase 
increased, all reported in single patients each.  
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in both JIA categories (ERA: 3 patients, JPsA: 
5 patients). Similarly, AEs leading to interruption of study drug were also reported in both JIA categories 
(ERA: 3 patients, JPsA: 4 patients).

Exposure adjusted incidence rates 
The EAIR (per 100 PY) of treatment-emergent SAEs by any primary SOC in the entire treatment period 
was 8.2 in all patients. The most commonly reported SAEs were in the SOCs of Infections and infestations 
and Gastrointestinal disorders (EAIR: 5.1/100 PY and 1.4/100 PY, respectively) (Table 25).

Laboratory findings 
Criteria for clinically notable laboratory abnormalities were based on CTCAE grades for the following 
parameters: haemoglobin, platelets, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, TBL, GGT, ALT, AST, 
ALP, glucose, cholesterol, and TG. 
Hematology 
All  newly  occurring  or  worsening  laboratory  abnormalities  in  the  entire  treatment  were  either  CTCAE 
Grade  1  or  2,  with  the  exception  of  2  cases  of  CTCAE  Grade  3  decreases  in  neutrophil  count  in  the 
secukinumab group. There were no CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities observed in the entire treatment period 
(Table 26). 
CTCAE Grade 3 abnormalities in neutrophil count during the entire treatment period were as follows. 
•  2 out of 85 patients (2.4%) with AE of neutropenia experienced a shift in absolute neutrophil levels 
(<1.0-0.5 x10e9/L) from no grade at Week 12 to Grade 3 by Week 88 (11-year-old male weighing 
32.7 kg with Grade 3 abnormality at this single visit) and Week 44 (9-year-old male weighing 30 kg 
with Grade 3 abnormality at this single visit). These Grade 3 abnormalities were observed in TP2 in 
the secukinumab treatment group and were not associated with any infections. 
Most  of  the  patients  had  normal  hematology  values  at  baseline  and  also  at  post-baseline  during  the 
entire treatment period.

There were no CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities for hemoglobin (Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated). LLN = Lower 
limit of normal. n = Number of patients with most extreme value meeting the criterion post-baseline and that is newly occurring or worsening 
compared to baseline.  m = Number of patients with evaluable criterion who did not meet the criterion at baseline. A patient with multiple 
variable measurements is counted only once under the worst condition. Newly occurring means missing at baseline and ‘grade x’ after 
baseline and worsening means ‘less than grade x’ at baseline and worsened to ‘grade x’ post-baseline where 1≤x≤4. 
Treatment Periods 
Most of the newly occurring or worsening abnormalities in haematology parameters in TP2 were CTCAE 
Grade 1 or 2. Occurring at the highest frequencies among all haematology parameters was haemoglobin 
decrease in TP2. Differences were observed for newly occurring or worsening abnormalities between the 
secukinumab  treatment  group  and  placebo  for  Grade  1  haemoglobin  decrease  (<  LLN  -  100  g/L: 
secukinumab  18.8%  and  placebo  6.7%)  and  neutrophil  decrease  (<  LLN  -  1.5  x109/L:  secukinumab 
16.2% and placebo 2.7%). As stated earlier in entire treatment period, 2 CTCAE Grade 3 abnormalities 
were observed in secukinumab treatment group only for absolute neutrophils (<1.0-0.5 x10e9/L) in 2 
subjects in TP2. The majority of subjects had values within normal range in TP2 with low frequencies of 
subjects shifting to CTCAE Grade 1 or Grade 2 from Week 12 within TP2.

Clinical chemistry 
Newly  occurring  or  worsening  abnormalities  in  clinical  chemistry  parameters  in  the  entire  treatment 
period  were  mostly  of  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2  (Table  27).  CTCAE  Grade  3  abnormalities  in  the  entire 
treatment period were as follows: 
•  Serum aspartate aminotransferase (> 5.0-20.0 x ULN) was noted in 1 patient (1.2%) (Table 27).  
The Grade 3 abnormality was observed in TP3 in Patient  in the secukinumab treatment group. 
•  Serum alanine aminotransferase (> 5.0-20.0 x ULN) were noted in 2 patients (2.3%) (27). These 
Grade 3 abnormalities were observed in TP2 in Patient  and Patient in the secukinumab treatment 
group. 
There were no CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities reported during the entire treatment period. 
Additional details about the hepatic transaminase elevations are provided in the hepatic enzymes section.

AIN457: all patients who did not take any placebo. Placebo in TP2: all patients who took placebo in TP2 and AIN457 in other period/s. 
LLN = Lower limit of normal, ULN = Upper limit of normal. n = Number of patients with most extreme value meeting the criterion 
post-baseline and that is newly occurring or worsening compared to baseline. m = Number of patients with evaluable criterion who did 
not meet the criterion at baseline. A patient with multiple variable measurements is counted only once under the worst condition. 
Newly occurring means missing at baseline and ‘grade x’ after baseline and worsening means ‘less than grade x’ at baseline and 
worsened to ‘grade x’ post-baseline where 1≤x≤4. 
Hepatic enzymes 
The incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities was low in the entire treatment period. Increases in ALT > 3 
x ULN were detected in 8 patients (9.3%). Two patients (4.2%) were noted with ALT increase > 5 x ULN 
in the secukinumab treatment group while AST levels > 3 x ULN were noted in 4 patients (8.3%) and > 5 
x ULN in 1 patient (2.1%) in the secukinumab treatment group. There were no patients who met the 
laboratory criteria of Hy’s Law (Table 28). 
Details of hepatic transaminases elevations (> 3 x ULN) are provided below  
1.  Patient A had normal ALT (17 U/L) at baseline (Day 1). Following multiple Grade 1 elevations in ALT 
from Day 113 onwards, an AE of recurrent increase of ALT (moderate in severity, unrelated to study 
treatment) was reported. On Day 617, an AE of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (moderate in severity, 
unrelated to study treatment) was reported. On Day 645, ALT continued to be elevated at 139 U/L 
(> 3  x  ULN)  with  concomitant  AST  elevation  at  52 U/L  and  an  AE  of  transaminases  increased 
(moderate, unrelated to study treatment, study treatment interrupted) was reported on the same 
day.  On  Day  672,  the  patient  was  noted  with  a  Grade  3  elevation  (ALT  increase  > 5  x  ULN)

accompanied by AST elevation. The patient had received oral methotrexate (20 mg) once weekly for 
ERA from Day -92 to Day 427. At the time of last reporting (Day 729), the AEs of non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease and transaminases increased were ongoing with ALT at 136 U/L (> 3 x ULN) and with 
AST at 54 U/L. 
2.  Patient  B  was  reported  with  normal ALT  levels  at  baseline  and  noted  to  have  a  single  instance  of 
Grade 3 elevation in ALT (242 U/L: ALT increase > 8 x ULN) on Day 209 after a Grade 1 elevation 
on Day 29. On Day 209 (Week 28). AST on the same day was 115 U/L (> 3 x ULN). Mild AEs of ALT 
and  AST  increase  (both  unrelated  to  study  treatment)  were  reported  on  Day  209  which  were 
considered  resolved  on  Day  244  for  ALT  increase  and  Day  245  for  AST  increase  (Day  244:  ALT: 
41 U/L and AST: 26 U/L). The patient had been receiving 20 mg methotrexate once weekly (as 2 mL 
SC injections each) for ERA from Day -74 onwards. 
3.  Patient C in TP3 on Day 478 experienced a single instance of AST elevation (299 U/L, > 8 x ULN) 
accompanied by elevated ALT (81 U/L). An AE of AST increase (moderate in severity, suspected to 
be related to study treatment) was reported on Day 479. Treatment included ursodeoxycholic acid 
and AST and ALT levels normalized on Day 510 (ALT: 13 U/L; AST: 20 U/L). The patient had been 
receiving 15 mg methotrexate weekly (as SC injections) for ERA from Day -592 onwards.

ULN (Hy’s Law laboratory criteria) 
AIN457: all patients who did not take any placebo. Placebo in TP2: all patients who took placebo in TP2 and AIN457 in other period/s. 
ULN = Upper limit of normal. Newly occurring: patients not meeting criterion at baseline and meeting criterion post-baseline. n = Number of 
patients who meet the designated criterion. m = Number of patients with evaluable criterion who did not meet the criterion at baseline. 
A patient with multiple variable measurements is counted only once under the worst condition. 
Treatment Periods 
Most of the newly occurring or worsening abnormalities in haematology parameters in TP2 were 
CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. Occurring at the highest frequencies among all haematology parameters was 
haemoglobin  decrease  in  TP2.  Differences  were  observed  for  newly  occurring  or  worsening 
abnormalities between the secukinumab treatment group and placebo for Grade 1 haemoglobin 
decrease (< LLN - 100 g/L: secukinumab 18.8% and placebo 6.7%) and neutrophil decrease (< 
LLN - 1.5 x10
9
/L: secukinumab 16.2% and placebo 2.7%). As stated earlier in entire treatment 
period, 2 CTCAE Grade 3 abnormalities were observed in secukinumab treatment group only for 
absolute neutrophils (<1.0-0.5 x10e9/L) in 2 subjects in TP2. The majority of subjects had values 
within normal range in TP2 with low frequencies of subjects shifting to CTCAE Grade 1 or Grade 2 
from Week 12 within TP2. 
Lipid profile 
Overall, the frequency of newly occurring or worsening after baseline abnormalities in lipid parameters 
was low for the entire treatment period. 
Urinalysis 
Small improvements post-baseline were seen in a few parameters at various timepoints during the entire 
treatment period, but overall, no trends were noted. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Overall, there were only a few cases of changes in vital signs reported during the entire treatment period, 
which  included  11  patients  (12.8%)  with  newly  occurring  high  sitting  pulse  rate  and  4  patients  each 
(4.7%)  with  newly  occurring  notable  abnormalities  of  high  systolic  and  high  diastolic  blood  pressure, 
respectively.  These  were  not  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Interpretation  is  focused  on  the  total 
population for the entire study since it cannot be ruled-out that events occurring in TP2 under placebo 
are due to a spill-over effect by the previous secukinumab treatment in TP1 (Table 29).

from baseline. m = Number of patients at risk for an abnormality with a non-missing value at baseline and post-baseline. 
 n = Number of patients who meet the designated criterion. A patient with multiple variable measurements is counted only once under the 
worst condition. 
Physical development 
The  changes  in  height  and  weight  in  these  pediatric  patients  over  the  entire  treatment  period  were 
similar in the secukinumab and Placebo in TP2 treatment groups, and the patients continued to grow 
(height and weight) over time up to the end of study. 
Electrocardiograms 
Overall, the incidence of newly occurring notable abnormalities in ECG parameters was low in the entire 
treatment period (Table 30).

Safety topics of interest 
Safety considerations that arose from prior experience with secukinumab in psoriasis, PsA, AS, and nr-
axSpA, and that may be relevant in the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA, are identified risks of infections 
and infestations, potential risks of malignant or unspecified tumours, IBD, hepatitis B reactivation, and 
Assessment report

suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour.  These  safety  topics  of  interest  were  evaluated  using  standardized 
groupings of terms defined on a project level. 
Infections  and  infestations  (by  SOC)  were  reported  in  68  patients  (79.1%).  All  events  were  mild  or 
moderate in intensity. With the exception of one case of pneumonia, none led to discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
AEs  related  to  the  identified  risks  of  hypersensitivity  (SMQ)  (narrow)  were  reported  in  18  patients 
(20.9%).  All  were  non-serious,  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and  with  the  exception  of  one  case  of 
urticaria (which occurred on secukinumab treatment in TP3 and led to withdrawal of study drug), none 
led to any change in study treatment. No injection site reactions were reported. 
AEs  related  to  the  identified  risk  of  neutropenia  (NMQ)  (narrow)  were  reported  in  6  patients  (7.0%). 
Four patients were receiving secukinumab at the time of the event, and 2 patients were on placebo. All 
events  were  single  occurrences,  non-serious,  not  associated  with  infections,  and  did  not  require 
treatment or interruption of study drug. One neutropenia AE was moderate, all other AEs were mild in 
intensity. The events were ongoing at last report in 3 patients, and resolved in 3 patients.  
The search for IBD retrieved one case; this was Crohn’s disease in a patient randomized to secukinumab 
in TP2, the event was an SAE and led to discontinuation of study drug. 
No cases of MACE, mycobacterial infections, hepatitis B reactivation, or malignancy were reported.  
Intentional self-injury was reported in one patient during TP3 (SMQ: suicide/self-injury); this was a case 
of self-inflicted injury in a patient randomized to placebo in TP2. The patient completed the study and 
entered the extension study. No other cases related to the risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour were 
reported.

Exposure-adjusted incidence rates over entire treatment period 
The most frequent EAIR (per 100 PY) over the entire treatment period were reported in the category of 
Infections and infestations (SOC) for all treatment groups (135.9/100 PY). Infection of skin structures 
(NMQ) was the second most frequent category reported (18.0/100 PY). Other AEs with notable EAIRs 
(>5 per 100 PY) included Hypersensitivity (SMQ) (14.5/100 PY). 
Treatment periods 
In TP1, the SOC of Infections and infestations (33/86 subjects, 38.4%) was the most frequently reported 
AE  among  all  risks  from  the  RMP.  In  line  with  observations  in  entire  treatment  period,  the  SOC  of 
Infections and infestations (45/75 subjects, 60.0%) represented the most frequently reported AE among 
all risks from the RMP in TP2 (secukinumab: 28/37 subjects, 75.7%; placebo: 17/38 subjects, 44.7%). 
In TP2, the other 2 most frequently reported risks were observed for Infections of skin structures (NMQ) 
(total:  16/75  subjects,  21.3%;  secukinumab:  13/37  subjects,  35.1%;  placebo:  3/38  subjects,  7.9%) 
and Hypersensitivity (SMQ, narrow search) (total: 8/75 subjects, 10.7%; secukinumab: 3/37 subjects, 
8.1%;  placebo:  5/38  subjects,  13.2%)  in  TP2.  In  TP3,  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  infestation  was  the 
most frequently reported AE among all risks from the RMP. 
Subgroups of study population 
Subgroup  analyses  by  age,  gender,  weight  and  concomitant  methotrexate  use  were  performed  for 
disposition, demographics, treatment exposure, treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs and important risks in 
Study F2304. Treatment-emergent AEs were also analyzed by JIA category (ERA and JPsA). 
The results of these analyses were consistent with those of the overall population and did not reveal any 
safety  concerns  specific  to  any  of  the  subgroups.  Key  safety  results  by  age  and  weight  groups  are 
highlighted in Table 32 and Table 33, respectively. 
Of note, analysis of safety revealed no indication of an increased safety concern in the age group of 2 to 
<6  years  (3  patients)  or  the  lowest  weight  group  (<25  kg,  6  patients),  as  compared  to  the  overall 
population (the <25 kg weight group also includes the 3 patients from the 2 to <6-year-old group). One 
of these patients (2-years-old at study entry, weight <25 kg), experienced an SAE of tonsillitis in TP1, 
and an SAE of adenoidal hypertrophy in TP3; neither event was considered related to study treatment 
(secukinumab) and the patient recovered from both events with no treatment interruption.

Immunogenicity and immunological events 
In study F2304 there were no patients with treatment-emergent ADAs (i.e., negative at baseline and 
positive during treatment). One patient in the Placebo in TP2 group was reported having ADAs at baseline 
only.  This  patient  was  reported  to  have  an  immunogenicity-related  mild  AE  of  urticaria  on  Day  326, 
which was considered unrelated to the study treatment; no action was taken with study treatment, and 
the event was considered resolved with treatment on Day 328. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information regarding drug interactions was generated in Study F2304.

Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. The immunomodulatory nature of 
secukinumab may reduce immune responses to live attenuated vaccines or may render a recipient 
prone to infectious manifestations (including secondary transmission) resulting from attenuated live 
vaccines. Patients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. 
Data from study CAIN457A2224 suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune 
response to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. 
Population results in PsA and AS patients with secukinumab do not suggest that methotrexate has an 
impact on the disposition of secukinumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
In study F2304 the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and reported in 8/86 patients 
(9.3%) in the entire treatment period. These AEs as per SOC were reported in no more than 1-2 
patients in either treatment group and were non-serious, with the exception of Crohn's disease. AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported in both JIA categories (ERA: 3 patients, JPsA: 5 patients). 
Treatment periods 
In TP1, 1 out of 86 subjects had joint effusion AE causing study drug discontinuation. During TP2, a 
similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups had AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
(secukinumab: 2/37 subjects, 5.4%; placebo: 2/38 subjects, 5.3%). All AEs (pneumonia, 
enthesopathy, psoriasis) were reported as non-serious except for the SAE of Crohn's disease. In TP3, 3 
out of 32 subjects had enthesopathy, epilepsy and urticaria AEs respectively, which led to study drug 
discontinuation. 
AEs leading to dose interruption or adjustment  
In study F2304 the incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was low and reported in 7/86 patients 
(8.1%) in the entire treatment period. AEs leading to dose interruption were reported in both JIA 
categories (ERA: 3 patients, JPsA: 4 patients). 
Treatment Periods 
Over TP1, 3 out of 86 subjects had AEs leading to temporary dose interruption. One subject each had 
AEs by PT pharyngotonsillitis, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased. 
Two out of 37 subjects (5.4%) in the secukinumab treatment group only had AEs leading to temporary 
dose interruption (1 subject each: diarrhoea and transaminases increased) in TP2. AEs leading to dose 
adjustments or temporary interruption were reported by 3 of 32 subjects (9.4%; majority were in SOC 
Infection and infestations) in TP3. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data is available for ERA and JPsA, the paediatric JIA categories under assessment.   
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety is based on a single phase 3 study F2304 in the target population. In addition, cross study 
comparative tabulation of the safety results of this single study in the current target indication and the 
pooled data from two previous (recently approved) paediatric psoriasis clinical trials are presented. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 92/107 
 
 
 
MAH also refers to the large safety data set in adults, which includes post marketing safety data. In 
addition, an updated population PK model of secukinumab, utilising paediatric and adult data from 
several indications, has been provided to support the submission.  
Exposure 
Overall, a single study F2304 with the mean duration of exposure to study treatment (secukinumab or 
placebo) during the study period (TP1 + TP2 + TP3) of 601 days, with a patient-time of 141.5 PY 
could, in principle, be considered adequate. However, the CHMP raised objections since the safety data 
in 2 - <6 years of age are limited to 3 subjects. Furthermore, all of these subjects were randomised to 
receive placebo in TP2, and even though they are continuing on open-label secukinumab in the long-
term extension study, long-term safety data will be, at best, only available from these three patients. 
The MAH revised their claim during the procedure to exclude children from 2 to less than 6 years of 
age from the indication. 
Safety results in Study F2304 
- TEAE 
Infections and infestations represented the most frequently reported safety topic of interest driven by 
mild to moderate events of nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. There were no 
reported cases of MACE, mycobacterial infections, hepatitis B reactivation, or malignancy. 
In study F2304 the majority of subjects experienced TEAEs during the study. Overall (N = 86 
patients), the reported TEAEs were most frequently categorized in the SOCs Infections and Infestations 
(68 patients, 71.1%), Gastrointestinal disorders (45 patients, 52.3%) and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (32 patients, 37.2%).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs overall by PT (those occurring in ≥15 % of subjects) were 
nasopharyngitis (27 patients, 31.4%), diarrhoea (17 patients, 19.8%), nausea (19 patients, 22.1%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (19 patients, 22.1%) and cough (13 patients, 15.1%). 
By SOC the frequencies of TEAEs in the category Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were 
higher in the secukinumab treatment arm, 16 (33.3%) vs 9 (23.7%) in the placebo and Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), 5 (10.4%) in the IMP arm vs none in 
the placebo arm. In the placebo arm TEAEs were more numerous in the SOC category Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders 14 (29.25%) vs 16 (42.15%) and Nervous system disorders 6 (12.5) vs 
9 (23.7%) and Blood and lymphatic system disorders 3 (6.3) vs 7 (18.4), in the secukinumab and 
placebo arms, respectively.  
By PT the frequencies of TEAEs were more numerous in the IMP treatment arm for the PT of Diarrhoea 
11 (22.9) vs 6 (15.8), Arthralgia 8 (16.7%) vs 4 (10.5%), Pharyngitis 6 (12.5%) vs 3 (7.9%) and 
Influenza 5 (10.4%) vs 0. The frequencies were quite similar between the treatment arms for 
Nasopharyngitis 16 (33.3%) vs 11 (28.9%), Nausea 11 (22.9%) vs 8 (21.1%) and Upper respiratory 
tract infection 10 (20.8) vs 9 (23.7%) in the IMP and placebo arms, respectively. 
The AE incidence in Infections and infestations was mainly driven by events of nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, while diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most 
frequent AEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. Arthralgia was the most frequently reported AE in 
the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC.  
Most TEAEs in the entire treatment period were either mild or moderate: 40 (46.5%) patients reported 
only mild AEs, while 37 (43.0%) patients reported AEs up to moderate in severity. Severe AEs 
occurred at a low frequency: 2 patients (2.3%) reported a severe AE, both of which (joint effusion and 
aphthous ulcer) occurred in TP1. No severe events occurred in TP2 or TP3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 93/107 
 
 
 
- SAEs 
No deaths were reported in the study. 
Treatment emergent SAEs were reported for 11 patients (12.8%) overall, and all were reported in 
patients receiving secukinumab. The SAE were mainly single occurrences in both treatment arms and 
did not show any trends or clustering. 
By treatment period, SAEs were reported for 2 patients in TP1, 5 patients in TP2 (all were randomized 
to secukinumab), and 5 patients in TP3. The most frequently reported SAEs were Infections and 
infestations (SOC; 7 patients, 8.1%). There was no trends or patterns or clustering with respect to 
type of SAE reported, and SAEs were reported in both JIA categories (ERA: 4 patients, JPsA: 7 
patients). One of the SAEs led to discontinuation of study drug; this was an SAE of Crohn’s disease 
also mentioned hereafter. SAEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were 
reported for 2 patients: In TP2, the Crohn's disease was reported as an SAE in a JPsA patient. Study 
medication was discontinued due to the event. In addition, in TP3, a JPsA patient who was randomized 
to placebo in TP2 experienced a flare that was reported as an SAE and study medication 
(secukinumab) was continued. 
- Safety issues of special interest  
Based on previous experience, identified risks of infections and infestations, potential risks of 
malignant or unspecified tumours, IBD, hepatitis B reactivation, and suicidal ideation and behaviour 
were taken to be putatively also relevant for the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA. The safety results 
appeared, in general, to be consistent with the known safety profile of secukinumab.  
- Malignancies 
No malignancies were observed in the study. However, in the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (including cysts and polyps), a discrepancy between the treatment arms was seen, with an 
incidence of 5 (10.45%) in the secukinumab treatment arm in comparison with none in the placebo 
arm. The MAH discussed in more detail this finding and the possible reasons for the observed 
discrepancy and based on the provided data, malignancies appear not to be a safety concern, in short 
term, for this target paediatric population.     
- Laboratory results  
Evaluation of laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, and other physical findings did not identify any new 
safety concerns. Most of the newly occurring or worsened haematology and clinical chemistry 
abnormalities were CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2. Of note is, that 2 patients with an AE of neutropenia 
randomized to secukinumab in TP2 developed a grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count. These were, 
however, single occurrences, resolved without interruption of study drug, and importantly, were not 
associated with infections. The incidence of liver abnormalities was low, and there were no patients 
who met the laboratory criteria of Hy’s Law.  
- Growth and maturation 
No evidence of growth retardation was observed, based on changes in height and weight measured 
during the study. The changes observed were similar in the secukinumab and placebo groups in TP2, 
and the patients continued to grow over time up to the end of study. As no assessment of Tanner 
staging of pubertal development was performed in this study, the MAH referred to data from the 
paediatric PsO study A2310 (reviewed as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057). The results 
suggest that secukinumab did not have any effect on sexual maturation of the paediatric PsO patients 
treated in the study. Some residual uncertainly may remain, as no data in the target indication itself 
are available; however, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP in the 6-18 years subgroup. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 94/107 
 
 
 
the 2-<6 years subgroup, the CHMP expressed concerns during the assessment regarding the 
development of the immune system, growth and maturation in children in this youngest age group. 
The MAH revised their claim during the procedure to exclude children from 2 to less than 6 years of 
age from the indication. 
- Immunogenicity 
There were no patients with treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies in the study. 
- Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analyses by age (2 - < 6 years, 6 - < 12 years and 12 - < 18 years) and weight (< 25 kg, 
25 - <50 kg, ≥ 50 kg) for incidence rate of TEAEs in TP1 did not reveal any safety concerns and did not 
show increased incidence rates for the lower age (2 - < 6 years) and lower weight (< 25 kg) groups. 
However, the CHMP raised objections on the small numbers in the lowest age and weight categories, 
which hampers firm conclusions. The MAH revised their claim during the procedure to exclude children 
from 2 to less than 6 years of age from the indication. 
Subgroup analyses by gender, concomitant methotrexate use, for baseline characteristics of 
disposition, background and demographics, duration of exposure, crude incidence and EAIR per 100 PY 
of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs and safety issues of special interest AEs, did not reveal any safety 
concerns. 
In the course of the study F2304 the patients received, in addition to the IMPs methotrexate (and/or 
other DMARDs). This was not included in the initial indication claim. As indicated in the efficacy 
section, the MAH revised the indication claim during the procedure to indicate that secukinumab may 
be used alone or in combination with methotrexate. 
- Discontinuations due to AEs 
Discontinuations due to AEs were not numerous. There were none in the TP1, 1 (2.7%) in TP2 and 
none in the TP3 in the secukinumab treatment arm. The respective incidences were only slightly higher 
in the placebo arm: 2 (5.3%) in TP2 and 3 (14.3) in TP3 (placebo in TP2).      
- Long-term data  
Study F2304 is a 2-year study (core phase) with an additional extension study to assess the efficacy 
and safety in the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA. Safety data are available for all patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug up to final core study DBL (with the above-mentioned 
limitations in the smallest of children). Data from the ongoing extension study (Study F2304E1) was 
not included in this application, and the MAH has committed to submitting these data (see RMP section 
2.6). 
Clinical data in the youngest (2 - < 6 years) age group is scarce, especially long-term data (at best will 
be available only for the 3 patients currently participating in the long-term extension study F2304E1). 
As there are no other ongoing or planned studies in JIA or other paediatric patients that could provide 
relevant additional efficacy or safety data, the MAH was requested during the procedure to discuss in 
detail and propose a plan of possible means whereby the long-term safety, in this youngest age group, 
could be followed-up.  
The MAH has, with due diligence, investigated the feasibility of accruing these and concluded that a long-
term safety assessment was considered not feasible due to limited sample size, complexity of pooling 
data  from  different  origins,  difficulty  to  account  for previous  exposure  or  confounders,  and  ultimately 
limited precision of estimates. Therefore, based upon these considerations the MAH has determined that 
it  is  not  feasible  to  obtain  sufficient  data  in  JPsA  or  ERA  patients  aged  2  to  <6  years-old  using  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 95/107 
 
 
 
combination registry approach i.e. to conduct a registry-based PASS in this subset of patients aged 2 to 
6 years old. The MAH withdrew the indication claim in the 2-<6 years subgroup during the procedure. 
Extrapolation 
It is further noted, that tabulated cross study comparative data with pooled paediatric psoriasis studies 
study A2310 and study A2311 were presented and the MAH refers also to the large Cosentyx adult 
safety set, including post-marketing data. The safety profile for secukinumab observed in study F2304 
was comparable to that of secukinumab in the pooled psoriasis paediatric studies and adult safety 
data. However, considering that there may be age-related differences e.g. in comorbidities, the 
strategy and adequacy of extrapolation from these sources is not considered ideal, as the paucity of 
actual data among patients aged 2 - <6 years limits possibilities to qualify the extrapolation model. 
This was acknowledged by the MAH. During the procedure, the MAH revised their indication claim to 
children 6 years of age and older.  
Overall, the safety profile of secukinumab in study F2304 in a population of paediatric patients, six 
years and older, in the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA, appeared consistent with the known safety 
profile of secukinumab, and appeared not to show any new or unexpected safety signals. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of secukinumab in the single phase 3 study F2304 of the paediatric population, 6 
years and older, with the juvenile idiopathic arthritis categories of psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-
related arthritis shows no new or unexpected safety signals. The safety data appeared broadly 
consistent with the overall safety profile of secukinumab based on the existing extensive adult safety 
data across multiple indications, including psoriasis, PsA, and axial SpA (both non-radiographic axial 
SpA and AS) and also with that of the patients with the recently approved indication of paediatric 
psoriasis.  
The main uncertainty and safety concern was related to the very limited experience in children under 6 
years of age, particularly as the target population for secukinumab (or any anti-IL-17 therapy) would 
have been extended to this age group for the first time. Addressing this limitation e.g. through an 
appropriately designed post-authorisation safety study was not considered feasible, and the MAH 
decided to exclude this age group from the therapeutic indication during the procedure. 
The CHMP concluded that the safety profile of secukinumab in treatment of paediatric patients, 6 years 
and older, with the juvenile idiopathic arthritis categories of psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related 
arthritis is considered acceptable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated version 10.2 RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 10.2 is acceptable.

Risk minimisation measures 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, an editorial change was made in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC for the 150/300 mg solution 
for injection to delete a duplicate paragraph. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
The MAH has performed satisfactory user consultations of Cosentyx PL in context of original MA 
application (plaque psoriasis) and extension of indication procedures (PsA, AS and paediatric plaque 
psoriasis).  
• 
Both adult and adolescent users have been included into the readability testing. For children, it 
is expected that the PL would be read by adult caregivers. 
• 
Given that the proposed PL changes related to the new indication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 98/107 
 
 
 
 
are not extensive, a new user consultation is not deemed necessary. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The JIA categories ERA and JPsA are chronic conditions with decreased health-related quality of life 
and risk of permanent joint damage. JIA may persist into adulthood, causing ongoing significant 
morbidity and impaired quality of life and imposing a significant burden on patients, their parents, and 
society. 
ERA and JPsA, as defined by the ILAR classification, represent paediatric correlates of the adult 
conditions for which secukinumab is approved, i.e., AS, nr-axSpA, and PsA. While JPsA includes 
patients with conditions similar to adult PsA, many paediatric patients with spondyloarthritis-like 
conditions are classed as ERA (as well as sometimes JPsA). 
ERA is considered a form of undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. Although patients with ERA may not 
have signs of axial disease at their time of diagnosis, many of these children later develop sacroiliitis 
and evolve into spondyloarthropathies in adulthood. Similarities between ERA and adult 
spondyloarthritis include enthesitis, arthritis, and inflammatory back pain, and a shared genetic 
susceptibility through the HLA-B27 risk allele linked to activation of the IL-23 / IL-17 axis. Another 
common feature is inflammatory bowel disease, present in a subset of ERA and adult spondyloarthritis 
patients. While adults experience predominantly inflammatory back pain, common presenting features 
of juvenile-onset disease are localized more to hips and peripheral joints. Sacroiliitis, if present, can 
also be clinically silent in children with ERA. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The goal of therapy in all forms of JIA, including ERA and JPsA, is to achieve an inactive disease state, 
prevent disability and damage, and ensure the age-appropriate development of affected children and 
adolescents. 
NSAIDs are the first-line of treatment in ERA and JPsA. They provide symptomatic relief, but are not 
disease-modifying and do not alter disease progression; in addition, some patients respond poorly to 
NSAIDs. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are widely used to induce rapid relief of inflammatory 
symptoms and for functional improvement, and they play an important part in the prevention of 
deformities secondary to joint contractures; however, corticosteroids should not be used long-term. 
Methotrexate, which is the most widely used synthetic DMARD in JIA, does not improve axial disease, 
and the ACR JIA guidelines advise against methotrexate monotherapy in children with sacroiliitis and 
enthesitis. 
TNF inhibitors are recommended for patients with enthesitis and/or sacroiliitis who do not achieve 
disease control on NSAIDs. However, many children, including patients with ERA and JPsA, do not 
respond to TNF therapy. Furthermore, whereas other classes of biologic agents have become available 
or are being studied for certain types of JIA, there are currently no medicinal products authorised in 
the EU for use in both ERA and JPsA. There is thus an unmet need for new therapies with high efficacy 
and a favourable safety and tolerability profile for these conditions in children and adolescents.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study to support the current variation application (study F2304) was a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, event-driven randomised withdrawal study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
secukinumab in 86 paediatric patients aged 2 to < 18 years with JIA subtypes of ERA or JPsA. During 
Treatment Period 1, all subjects received open-label secukinumab for 12 weeks. At the end of TP1, 
subjects with a JIA ACR 30 response were randomised to continue on secukinumab or switch to 
placebo (Treatment Period 2 [TP2]). Follow-up continued until the subject developed a flare, or for a 
maximum of 100 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to flare during TP2. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study F2304 met its primary endpoint: for the combined ERA and JPsA categories, the time to flare in 
TP2 was statistically significantly longer in the secukinumab group compared to the placebo group 
(hazard ratio of flare event, HR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, p<0.001). The risk of flare was reduced 
by 72% for subjects on secukinumab compared with subjects on placebo in TP2. Robustness of the 
primary analysis was appropriately supported by a tipping point analysis with a worst-case scenario. 
During TP2, there were a total of 21 flare events in the placebo group compared to 10 flare events in 
the secukinumab group. At 1 year, the flare-free rate was 76.7% (95% CI: 58.7, 87.6) in the 
secukinumab group and 54.3% (95% CI: 37.1, 68.7) in the placebo group. By the end of TP2, median 
time to disease flare was not reached in the secukinumab group and was 453 days in the placebo 
group. 
Prolongation in time to disease flare in TP2 was observed in both JIA categories (ERA: HR=0.45, 95% 
CI: 0.16 to 1.28; JPsA: HR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.57). In descriptive subgroup analyses based on 
age, weight, gender and methotrexate use at baseline, a favourable effect of secukinumab was seen 
across all analysed subgroups. The difference between treatment groups was more pronounced among 
subjects who were not using methotrexate. 
During TP1 (i.e., when all subjects were receiving open-label secukinumab), improvements in disease 
activity was observed already during the first weeks. At Week 12, a JIA ACR 30 response was achieved 
by 75/83 subjects (90.4%) completing TP1, a JIA ACR 70 response was achieved by 58/83 subjects 
(69.9%), and inactive disease status was achieved by 30/83 subjects (36.1%). 
Improvements were seen across all JIA ACR core components, with the largest improvements seen on 
active joint count (79.3%) and physician’s global assessment (77.4%), and the smallest improvement 
(13.6%) seen on median CRP. 
In descriptive subgroup analyses for TP1 based on age and weight group, gender and methotrexate 
use at baseline, JIA ACR 30 response rates ranging from 82.8% to 100%, and JIA ACR 50 response 
rates ranging from 79.3% to 100% were seen across the different subgroups. Although based on 
descriptive statistics only, the results were consistent across the subgroups analysed. 
During TP1, mean JADAS-27 score decreased from 15.07 (SD 7.13) at baseline to 4.64 (SD 4.72) at 
Week 12; mean decrease from baseline to Week 12 was -10.49 (SD 7.23). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Actual clinical experience in the youngest patients initially proposed for inclusion in the indication and 
posology (i.e., patients 2 - <6 years of age) was limited to 3 subjects; furthermore, all of these 
subjects were randomised to receive placebo in TP2, further limiting the opportunity for conclusions 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 100/107 
 
 
 
regarding longer-term effects. All of these subjects developed at least a JIA ACR 70 response at the 
end of TP1, but the experience in these youngest children was still considered very limited. The MAH 
decided to exclude this age group from the indication. 
At the end of TP2, only 55% of subjects withdrawing to placebo had experienced a flare event; thus, in 
the clinical setting, a substantial proportion of patients with an early response to secukinumab could 
incur longer-term treatment benefit even with a short treatment course. While the available results are 
not considered sufficiently robust to formalise different long-term treatment recommendations into the 
SmPC, these aspects are considered of potentially substantial clinical relevance, and the MAH is 
recommended to study the effectiveness and usability of different long-term treatment strategies in 
JIA patients, including strategies involving a “treatment withdrawal followed by retreatment as 
needed” approach in the post-authorisation setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study F2304 the majority of subjects experienced TEAEs during the study. Overall (N = 86 
patients), the reported TEAEs were most frequently categorized in the SOCs Infections and Infestations 
(68 patients, 71.1%), Gastrointestinal disorders (45 patients, 52.3%) and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (32 patients, 37.2%).  
By SOC the frequencies of TEAEs in the category Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were 
higher in the secukinumab treatment arm, 16 (33.3%) vs 9 (23.7%) in the placebo and Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), 5 (10.4%) in the IMP arm vs none in 
the placebo arm. In the placebo arm TEAEs were more numerous in the SOC category Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders 14 (29.25%) vs 16 (42.15%) and Nervous system disorders 6 (12.5) vs 
9 (23.7%) and Blood and lymphatic system disorders 3 (6.3) vs 7 (18.4), in the secukinumab and 
placebo arms, respectively.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs overall by PT (those occurring in ≥15 % of subjects) were 
nasopharyngitis (27 patients, 31.4%), diarrhoea (17 patients, 19.8%), nausea (19 patients, 22.1%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (19 patients, 22.1%) and cough (13 patients, 15.1%). 
By PT, the frequencies of TEAEs were higher in the IMP treatment arm in comparison with placebo for 
the PTs of Diarrhoea 11 (22.9) vs 6 (15.8), Arthralgia 8 (16.7%) vs 4 (10.5%) and Pharyngitis 6 
(12.5%) vs 3 (7.9%). The frequencies were similar between the treatment arms for Nasopharyngitis 
16 (33.3%) vs 11 (28.9%), Nausea 11 (22.9%) vs 8 (21.1%) and Upper respiratory tract infection 10 
(20.8) vs 9 (23.7%) in the IMP and placebo arms, respectively. 
The AE incidence in Infections and infestations was mainly driven by events of nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, while diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most 
frequent AEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. Arthralgia was the most frequently reported AE in 
the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC.  
Most TEAEs in the entire treatment period were either mild or moderate: 40 (46.5%) patients reported 
only mild AEs, while 37 (43.0%) patients reported AEs up to moderate in severity. Severe AEs 
occurred at a low frequency: 2 patients (2.3%) reported a severe AE, both of which (joint effusion and 
aphthous ulcer) occurred in TP1. No severe events occurred in TP2 or TP3. 
No deaths were reported in the study. 
Treatment emergent SAEs were reported for 11 patients (12.8%) overall, and all were reported in 
patients receiving secukinumab. By treatment period, SAEs were reported for 2 patients in TP1, 5 
patients in TP2 (all were randomized to secukinumab), and 5 patients in TP3. The most frequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/573021/2022  
Page 101/107 
 
 
 
reported SAEs were Infections and infestations (SOC; 7 patients, 8.1%). There was no trends or 
patterns or clustering with respect to type of SAE reported, and SAEs were reported in both JIA 
categories (ERA: 4 patients, JPsA: 7 patients). One of the SAEs led to discontinuation of study drug. 
SAEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were reported for 2 patients: In TP2, 
the Crohn's disease was reported as an SAE in a JPsA patient. Study medication was discontinued due 
to the event. In addition, in TP3, a JPsA patient who was randomized to placebo in TP2 experienced a 
flare that was reported as an SAE and study medication (secukinumab) was continued. 
Subgroup analyses based on age and weight group, gender and concomitant methotrexate use were 
performed for treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs and important risks in Study F2304. Treatment-
emergent AEs were also analysed by JIA category. The results of these analyses were consistent with 
those of the overall population and did not reveal any safety concerns specific to any of the subgroups. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, a single study F2304 with the mean duration of exposure to study treatment (secukinumab or 
placebo) during the study period (TP1 + TP2 + TP3) of 601 days, with a patient-time of 141.5 PY 
could, in principle, be considered adequate for the assessment of B/R of the newly proposed 
indications. However, a concern was that the safety data on patients 2 - <6 years of age are limited to 
3 subjects. Furthermore, all of these subjects were randomised to receive placebo in TP2, and even 
though they are continuing on open-label secukinumab in the long-term extension study, long-term 
safety data will be, at best, only available from these three patients.  
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided a detailed review of the currently available scientific 
information on the immune development in children with regard to the role and function of IL-17 in the 
developing immune function, both from the non-clinical and clinical point of view (including both non-
clinical and clinical systematic reviews of the available peer reviewed literature), to further support the 
overall safety claims in the youngest patient age group. In addition, as there are no other ongoing or 
planned studies in JIA or other paediatric patients that could provide relevant additional efficacy or 
safety data, the MAH was requested during the procedure to discuss in detail and propose a plan of 
possible means whereby the long-term safety, in this youngest age group, could be followed-up. The 
MAH has, with due diligence, investigated the feasibility of accruing these and concluded that a long-
term safety assessment was considered not feasible due to limited sample size, complexity of pooling 
data from different origins, difficulty to account for previous exposure or confounders, and ultimately 
limited precision of estimates. Therefore, based upon these considerations the MAH has determined 
that it is not feasible to obtain sufficient data in JPsA or ERA patients aged 2 to <6 years-old using a 
combination registry approach i.e. to conduct a registry-based PASS in this subset of patients aged 2 
to 6 years old and ultimately withdrew the indication claim in the 2-<6 years patients during the 
procedure.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH initially applied for a new indication for secukinumab (Cosentyx) to include treatment of 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Enthesitis-Related Arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis) in patients 2 
years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot tolerate, conventional 
therapy. The subtypes being applied for are recognised entities within the ILAR classification scheme 
for JIA. Furthermore, secukinumab is already authorised for the adult indications of axial 
spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and psoriatic 
arthritis, and it is agreed that that these entities can be considered to appropriately correlate with the 
proposed paediatric indications.  
Whereas medicinal products are available for the treatment of JIA, these are mostly authorised for 
polyarticular JIA, and a dearth of therapies still exists for other subtypes, including ERA and JPsA. 
Secukinumab in the proposed target groups can therefore be considered to address a clinically relevant 
unmet need. 
In study F2304, a statistically significant treatment effect was shown for secukinumab in respect to 
time to flare in the randomised withdrawal phase. Furthermore, although TP1 was conducted in an 
open-label manner, the observed response rates are sufficiently high to be considered evidence of a 
drug effect. The demonstrated effects can be considered clinically relevant and thus generally 
supportive of the new indication. 
From the safety perspective, acknowledging the limitations of cross study comparisons, the safety 
profile observed for secukinumab in the single phase 3 study F2304 appeared, so far, broadly similar 
to what has previously been reported for secukinumab.  
The main uncertainty and safety concern was related to the very limited experience in children under 6 
years of age, particularly as the target population for secukinumab (or any anti-IL-17 therapy) would

EMA/573021/2022  
Page 104/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have been extended to this age group for the first time. Addressing this limitation e.g. through an 
appropriately designed post-authorisation safety study was not considered feasible, and the MAH 
decided to exclude this age group from the therapeutic indication during the procedure. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the reported study is considered to provide adequate evidence of efficacy of secukinumab in 
the treatment of patients with the ERA and JPsA subtypes of JIA in patients aged 6-18 years, and the 
observed safety profile is largely consistent with extensive experience gained in adult patients. The 
extensive experience available with secukinumab in corresponding adult indications can also be 
considered supportive of a beneficial benefit-risk profile. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cosentyx is positive in the following indication: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) 
Cosentyx,  alone  or  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX),  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  active 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
Cosentyx,  alone  or  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX),  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  active 
juvenile psoriatic arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0372/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

Introduction 
Caspofungin  acetate  is  a  semisynthetic  lipopeptide  compound  of  the  echinocandin  family  and 
represents  the  first  in  a  new  class  of  antifungal  agents  (glucan  synthesis  inhibitors)  that  inhibits  the 
synthesis of beta-1, 3-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. Cancidas was granted 
an EU Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances on 24 October 2001, indicated in the 
treatment  of  invasive  aspergillosis  in  adults,  who  are  refractory  to  or  intolerant  of  amphotericin  B, 
lipid  formulations  of  amphotericin  B  and/or  itraconazole.  The  approved  dosage  is  a  single  70-mg 
loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg thereafter. Duration of treatment is not specified and is to 
be  based  upon  the  severity  of  the  patient’s  underlying  disease,  recovery  from  immmunosuppression 
and  clinical  response.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has  committed  to  specific 
obligations  and  follow-up  measures.  Pursuant  to  article  13  (2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC) 
No 2309/93  and  part  4G  of  the  Annex  to  Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  has  agreed  to 
provide, as requested by  the CPMP, additional clinical data. These data  will form the basis for a re-
assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of Caspofungin MSD in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. 
A  type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  invasive  candidiasis  in  non-
neutropenic  adult  patients  was  granted  an  EU  Marketing  Authorisation  17  February  2003.  The 
recommended dose regimen in these patients is a single 70-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 
mg thereafter. The duration of treatment is to be based upon the patient’s clinical and microbiological 
response, but in general therapy should be continued for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.  
Caspofungin has been given a marketing authorisation in the indication salvage treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis in the United States on 29 January 2001 and in more than 50 further countries. In addition 
caspofungin  has  been  approved  for  invasive  candidiasis  in  Korea  and  Brazil  and  for  the  primary 
treatment of oesophageal (EC) candidiasis (and, in some instances, oropharyngeal candidiasis [OPC]) 
in 5 countries in South America and the United States.  
The present type II variation concerns an extension of the indications to include: “Empirical therapy 
for  presumed  fungal  infections  in  febrile  neutropenic  adult  patients”  as  requested  by  the  MAH  in 
September 2003. The recommended dose constitutes a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1 followed 
by 50 mg thereafter. Duration of empirical therapy should be based on the patient’s clinical response. 
Therapy  should  be  continued  until  resolution  of  neutropenia.  Patients  diagnosed  with  a  fungal 
infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days treatment should be continued for at least 7 days 
after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms resolved.

Clinical assessment 
2.1 
Introduction 
Invasive  fungal  infections  are  an  important  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with 
neutropenia  following  chemotherapy  for  cancer,  and  Candida  and  Aspergillus  species  are  the  most 
commonly  identified  pathogens.    Fever,  without  signs  of  localized  infection,  is  the  typical  clinical 
presentation.  Early, definitive diagnosis is difficult; therefore, empirical administration of antifungal 
agents has become the standard of care for neutropenic patients who remain febrile despite empirical 
antibacterial therapy.  Conventional amphotericin B has been shown to reduce the frequency of proven 
fungal  infections  in  febrile  neutropenic  hosts,  but  its  use  has  been  limited  due  to  toxicity.  A  recent 
study  of  patients  with  persistent  fever  and  neutropenia  demonstrated  that  empirical  therapy  with 
AmBisome was as effective as conventional amphotericin B and associated with fewer breakthrough 
fungal infections, less infusion-related toxicity, and less nephrotoxicity.  Nonetheless, infusion-related 
toxicity and nephrotoxicity still occurred in 17 to 19% of patients receiving AmBisome.   
Caspofungin  is  the  first  in  a  new  class  of  antifungals,  the  echinocandins.    Caspofungin  inhibits  the 
synthesis  of  b-1,  3-D-glucan,  an  essential  component  of  the  cell  wall  of  many  pathogenic  fungi, 
including Candida and Aspergillus spp. Caspofungin has been approved for the treatment of invasive 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
2/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of other therapies and for the treatment of 
invasive candidiasis.  
In view of its favourable efficacy and safety profile in documented fungal infections, caspofungin may 
represent an effective and well-tolerated agent as empirical therapy in patients with persistent febrile 
neutropenia. 
2.2 
Pharmacokinetics 
There was one pharmacokinetics report associated with this dossier. It is a population PK/PD analysis 
performed  on  data  obtained in 122  patients (out  of 152) treated  empirically  with  caspofungin in the 
Phase  III  Study  026.  All  doses  were  administered  as  1-hr,  constant-rate,  intravenous  infusions.  The 
maximum duration of empirical treatment was 28 days. 
Plasma samples were analyzed with a validated HPLC method using fluorescence detection. The limit 
of quantification was 125 ng/ml. End-of-infusion (C1hr) and trough (C24hr) samplings were performed. 
The  PK  parameters  were  the  time-averaged  C1hr  and  C24hr  over  two  different  time  periods,  namely 
Days 3 to 14 in analyses assessing effects on caspofungin PK, and Day 3 to the end of IV therapy in 
analyses  assessing  the  effects  of  caspofungin  PK  on  outcome.  Statistical  analysis  was  adequate.  A 
relatively  large  number  of  concentration  values  were  excluded  due  to  inappropriate  sampling  times; 
furthermore, 34 pairs of trough and peak samples were assumed to include a switching error. 
The following conclusions follow the lines of the previously characterised caspofungin PK profile: 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
(cid:0) 
Neither end-of-infusion (C1hr) nor trough (C24hr) concentrations predict treatment outcome, not 
even in subgroup analyses (low-risk vs high-risk patients, and prior antifungal prophylaxis vs 
no prophylaxis). 
With  the  possible  exception  of  nausea,  the  occurrence  of  clinical  AE’s  and/or  laboratory 
abnormalities  does  not  appear  to  be  increased  by  higher  caspofungin  plasma  concentrations 
within the range of PK parameters examined. 
Weight  is  a  significant  covariate  for  C24hr  but  not  for  C1hr.  However,  the  effect  of  weight  is 
modest within the 50 to 90-kg range of body weights; the current recommendation to increase 
the daily dose from 50 to 70 mg in patients weighing more than 80 kg may remain. 
On average, C1hr and C24hr were increased 23% and 31%, respectively, in  women  relative to 
men. This does not warrant any dose adjustment based on gender. 
Older patients on average have modestly higher C24hr concentrations than younger patients, but 
no dose adjustment is necessary based on age. 
Race, renal status, and serum  albumin levels are  not significant determinants of  caspofungin 
PK. 
In  general,  the  drug-interaction  screening  did  not  unravel  any  concomitant  medication  that 
would be likely to alter caspofungin PK. 
Both C1hr and C24hr concentrations are modestly reduced in empirical therapy patients relative 
to healthy subjects. This is similar to the observation made in invasive candidiasis patients and 
does not warrant further comments. 
Therefore, PK parameters from this Phase III Study 026 are compared to those in previously studied 
healthy subjects (16  from Protocol 021  and 13  from  Protocol 030  with the same  dosage regimen  of 
caspofungin). 
2.3 
Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  data  to  support  the  extension  of  indication  of  caspofungin  to  empirical  therapy  of 
presumed  fungal  infections  in  febrile,  neutropenic  patients,  originate  from  a  Phase  III  study, 
Protocol 026: A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Comparative Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Efficacy  of  MK-0991 Versus  Amphotericin B Liposome  for Injection as Empirical 
Therapy in Patients With Persistent Fever and Neutropenia.

This  is  a  double-blind  and  in-house  blind,  randomized,  comparative  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, 
tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  caspofungin  versus  AmBisome  in  the  treatment  of  persistent  fever  and 
neutropenia.  Patients were stratified at study entry to either a high-risk stratum or a low-risk stratum.  
Patients  at  high  risk  had  undergone  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  or  received 
chemotherapy  for  a  relapse  of  acute  leukemia.    All  others  were  assigned  to  the  low-risk  stratum.  
Patients  were  also  stratified  by  whether  or  not  they  had  received  prophylactic  antifungal  therapy 
during their chemotherapy regimen 
Study period: 
Jan 2000- Aug 2002, 116 study sites (over 40 study sites within the EU) 
Participants:  
Study design: 
Men and women 16 years and older, who had received chemotherapy for leukemia, lymphoma,

least 96 hours of parenteral systemic antibacterial therapy preceding randomization and fever 
>38.0°C at randomisation were enrolled. 
Phase III: Double blind (and in-house blind), randomised comparative (non-inferiority) study, 
including 1123 patients; 1 hr IV caspofungin 50 mg/day (after a loading dose 70mg day 1) 
(n=556) + 2 hrs IV placebo (multivitamin complex) versus 1 hr IV placebo (saline) + 2 hrs IV 
AmBisome 3 mg/kg (n=539). Dose increases to either 70mg/day caspofungin or AmBisome 
5mg/kg/day were allowed if lack of efficacy.

Primary objective: To compare, in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia, the 
proportion of patients in the caspofungin group with a successful treatment outcome to that of 
liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) (on all 5 study endpoints) 
The safety variables included the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences; 
nephrotoxicity, infusion-related events, laboratory tests outside predefined clinically 
significant limits (CSLAs) and patients who had study drug decreased because of toxicity. 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients who had a successful treatment 
outcome as defined in the primary objective.  The secondary endpoints included assessment of 
each of the individual components of the primary endpoint.  For each endpoint, the proportion 
and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  displayed  and  the  difference  in  response  rates 
between  the  2  treatment  groups  was  also  displayed  with  its  95%  CI  (95.2%  for  the  primary 
endpoint, using the adjusted alpha  of 0.048 from the DSMB interim analysis  plan).   The CIs 
for the individual proportions were calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial 
distribution.    The  CI  for  the  difference  in  response  rates  for  the  primary  endpoint  was 
calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel adjustment for stratification.    
The study  was  designed to test  for  noninferiority  of  caspofungin relative to  Ambisome  as  empirical 
therapy  in  patients  with  persistent  fever  and  neutropenia.    The  definition  of  noninferiority  that  was 
used for this study states that the 95.2% (two-sided) CI for the difference in response rates between the 
2 treatment groups (calculated as caspofungin minus AmBisome) includes zero and the lower limit of 
the CI is not less than -10%.   
The primary analysis was performed using the MITT population (at least 1 complete dose of therapy).  
The  evaluable-patients  analysis  (at  least  4  days  of  therapy  and  no  protocol  violations)  provided 
supportive data to confirm the results of the MITT analysis.   
As  pointed  out  in  the  CPMP  PtC  (Point  to  Consider  on  the  clinical  evaluation  of  new  agents  for 
invasive fungal infections - CPMP/EWP/1343/01, dated 22 May 2003) there are some major problems 
with assessing the true efficacy in empiric therapy, since such an indication should be based solely on 
the  successful  treatment  of  any  fungal  infections  documented  from  examination  of  specimens  taken 
just  before  adding  the  antifungal  agent.  However,  the  confirmation  of  fungal  infection  from  post-
baseline  specimens  might  only  represent  failure  to  treat  an  infection  that  was  present,  but  not 
confirmed,  before  initiation  of  therapy, or  albeit  less  likely,  a  failure  of  prophylaxis.  Thus,  the  two 
possible  roles  of  the  drug  cannot  be  differentiated.  It  is  further  stated  in  the  CPMP  PtC  that  a 
superiority  trial  would  be  the  most  appropriate  for  granting  an  indication  that  reflected  the  overall 
utility of the drug in this type of clinical situation. The MAH was therefore asked to justify the choice 
of  a  non-inferiority  trial  instead  of  a  superiority  trial.  The  response  provided  by  the  MAH  was 
reasonable,  even though  a trial showing a  difference  would  have been  more  convincing, for reasons 
stated in the CPMP PtC. At the time of the initiation of the caspofungin empirical therapy trial (1999), 
the prevailing  approach  for  empirical antifungal therapy studies was the non-inferiority  design using 
the delta of -10%. The CPMP PtC did not come into operation until recently, in November 2003. The 
P026  study  was  modelled  after  the  earlier  large  randomised  comparative  trials  in  empirical  therapy, 
including the one that led to the approval of AmBisome in this indication. Moreover, the MAH sought 
regulatory guidance from the FDA regarding the primary efficacy endpoint. 
2.3.2  Results of the study Protocol 026. 
•  Participant flow  
Of 1123 patients enrolled at 116 investigative sites, 1111 received at least one dose of study therapy 
and were included in the analysis of safety.  Of the 1111 treated patients, 1095 were included in the 
MITT  analysis;  8  patients  in  each  treatment  group  were  excluded.    The  most  common  reason  for 
exclusion  was  absence  of  a  temperature  above  38oC  at  entry.    There  were  901  patients  in  the 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
5/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluable-patients  analysis;  210  patients  (116  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  94  in  the  AmBisome 
group)  were  excluded.    The  most  common  reasons  for  exclusion  from  the  evaluable-patients 
population were protocol violations that confounded assessment (12.6%) and inadequate study therapy 
(generally receipt of less than 4 days of study therapy; 5.1%).  The most common protocol violation 
that resulted in exclusion from the evaluable-patients population was discontinuation of study therapy 
prior  to  resolution  of  neutropenia  (without  having  met  any  failure  endpoint  at  the  time  of 
discontinuation). 
•  Baseline data 
Demographics and patient characteristics 
The  demographics  and  baseline  patient  characteristics  of  the  1111  treated  patients  are  displayed  in 
Table  1.    The  majority  of patients  enrolled  in  the  study  were  men  (56%)  and  White  (89.5%).    The 
mean ages of the caspofungin and AmBisome groups were 48.8 and 47.7 years, respectively.   
The most common primary conditions reported in the study were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 
64.0%),  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL;  10.9%),  and  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (ALL;  9.9%).  
Eighty-one  patients  (7.3%)  had  undergone  allogeneic  HSCT,  and  165  (14.9%)  had  undergone 
autologous HSCT at some time prior to study entry.  Most patients (73.4%) entered the study severely 
neutropenic with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 100 cells/microl.   
Overall,  24.8%  of  the  patients  were  in  the  high-risk  category,  and  constituted  26.6%  of  the 
caspofungin  and  22.9%  of  the  AmBisome  group.    The  numbers  of  patients  categorized  as  high-risk 
due to allogeneic HSCT were similar in both treatment groups (6.6% of the caspofungin and 7.5% of 
the  AmBisome  group).    A  numerically  larger  proportion  of  patients  in  the  caspofungin  than  the 
AmBisome  group  were  considered  high  risk  on  the  basis  of  relapsed  acute  leukemia  (20.0%  and 
15.4%,  respectively).    The  proportions  of  patients  who  received  prior  antifungal  prophylaxis  were 
similar in both treatment groups (56.2% of the caspofungin and 56.3% of the AmBisome group).

Duration of therapy 
For  the  caspofungin  group,  the  mean  and  median  duration  of  therapy  for  all  treated  patients  were  
13 and 11 days, and  for the  AmBisome  group 12.5 and 10 days, respectively.  For both  groups, the 
range was 1 to 90 days.  The mean and median duration of therapy for high-risk patients were slightly 
greater  than  for  low-risk  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (respectively,  15.2  and  12.2  days  for  the 
caspofungin group and 14.5 and 12 days for the AmBisome group).   
There  was  an  option  to  increase  the  dose  on  Day  5  or  later  to  70  mg/day  for  caspofungin  and  
5  mg/kg/day  for  AmBisome.    A similar  number  of patients in  both treatment  groups  received study 
medication at the standard  dose, as  was the  number  of patients who  had their  dose increased  due to

lack of efficacy (75 or 13.3% for caspofungin and 78 or 14.3% for AmBisome).  The treatment groups 
were also similar with respect to the time that the dosage increase was implemented.  Patients whose 
dose of study therapy was increased because of clinical deterioration had slightly lower response rates 
than those who continued to receive the standard dose in both treatment groups. 
A total of 59 patients (30 in the caspofungin group and 29 in the AmBisome group) were treated for 
more than 28 days. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Composite Endpoint  
To be considered a favorable overall response for this study, patients had to have a favorable response 
for all components of the composite endpoint.

§  N = number of patients in the treatment group in the specified analysis population. 
For  the  MITT  population,  the  percentages  of  patients  with  a  favorable  overall  response  in  the 
caspofungin and AmBisome groups, after adjustment for strata were 33.9% and 33.7%, respectively.  
The  estimated  difference  in  response  rates  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (caspofungin  minus 
AmBisome) was 0.2%, with a 95.2% CI of (-5.6, 6.0).  The CI contains 0 and the lower limit (-5.6%) 
is above the prespecified limit of -10.0%, indicating that caspofungin is noninferior to AmBisome as 
empirical therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.  The supportive analysis performed 
on the evaluable-patients population gives similar results.  
It is important to examine the overall favorable response rates within each of the randomization strata 
(risk category and prophylaxis stratum) in the primary analysis population, because of their potential 
impact on the overall study outcome.   
Table  3  displays  the  observed  favorable  overall  response  rates  in  the  MITT  population  for  the  2 
treatment groups overall, by risk category, and by prophylaxis stratum.  The observed (unadjusted for 
stratum)  percentages  of  patients  with  favorable  overall  responses  are  34.2%  for  caspofungin  and 
33.6% for AmBisome.  The overall favorable response rates were somewhat higher for patients in the 
high- than the low-risk category for both treatment groups, and numerically were greatest in the high-
risk patients who received caspofungin.  Overall response rates were similar for both treatment groups 
whether or not antifungal prophylaxis was used.  Results were similar for the MITT and the evaluable-
patients populations.

§ Only patients with a baseline infection are included in this analysis. 
Overview of Baseline and Breakthrough Documented Infections 
As  already  described,  all  cases  of  suspected  fungal  infection  were  reviewed  by  the  Adjudication 
Committee,  using  blinded  data.    There  were  a  total  of  358  cases  with  suspected  fungal  infections 
reviewed  by  the  Adjudication  Committee.    A  total  of  106 MITT  patients  had  cases  of  documented 
(proven  or  probable)  invasive  fungal  infections  (53  with  only  baseline  infection,  52  with  only 
breakthrough  infection,  and  1 with  both  baseline  and  breakthrough  infection).    Three  additional 
patients  in  the  study  had  documented  baseline  infections,  but  were  not  included  in  the  MITT 
population  (incomplete  dose  of  study  therapy  or  did  not  meet  the  entry  criterion  for  fever).    Of  the 
remaining patients 156 were considered to have a possible infection and 93 to have no fungal infection 
at all.  
After locking of the clinical database, it was noted, during the preparation of narrative summaries, that 
3 cases that should have been adjudicated were not, and one case previously adjudicated had important 
autopsy data that had been available but was missed in the earlier adjudication.  These cases were sent 
to  the  adjudicators  as  blinded  data  in  order  to  present  the  most  complete  and  accurate  adjudication 
dataset possible.  However, the clean file was not altered because adjudication of these patients would 
have  no  impact  on  the  primary  study  result:  these  patients  failed  other  endpoints  and  were  already 
failures for the primary analysis.  Inclusion of these cases affects only the numbers and distribution of 
diagnoses for documented breakthrough infections in the AmBisome group; these were:  1 new case 
with  breakthrough  probable  chronic  disseminated  candidiasis,  and  one  change  of  diagnosis  from 
breakthrough proven sinusitis to breakthrough proven disseminated fungal infection.  The data on late-
adjudicated cases, are included in the text and tables that follow.  Inclusion of these data had no impact 
on the overall study analysis or its conclusions.

Successful Treatment of Baseline Infection 
Patients with baseline infections were enrolled into the study and included in the MITT analysis only 
if the likelihood of a fungal infection at the time of study entry was, at most, possible.  Patients with 
known, documented invasive fungal infections were excluded.  Therefore, those patients with baseline 
infections described below may have had possible infection present at study  entry (or by Day 2), but 
the  confirmatory  information  from  tests  or  specimens  obtained  prior  to  or  at  entry,  that  led  the 
Adjudicators to consider these probable or proven infections, did not become positive until after study 
entry.   
The  Adjudication  Committee  assessed  the  response  to  study  therapy  of  all  baseline  invasive  fungal 
infections.  “Complete response” and “partial response” were considered favorable clinical outcomes.   
Complete  response  was  defined  as  resolution  of  all  attributable  signs,  symptoms,  and  abnormalities 
detected  by  radiography,  bronchoscopy,  endoscopy,  or  other  procedures,  and  negative  cultures  for 
fungal pathogens.  A partial response was defined as clinically meaningful improvement in attributable 
symptoms  and  signs,  as  well  as  in  attributable  abnormalities  detected  by  other  procedures,  as  noted 
above.   
As displayed in the Tables 3 and 4 the percentages of MITT patients who had successful treatment of 
their baseline fungal infections were 51.9% in the caspofungin and 25.9% in the AmBisome group.  
The difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was 
25.9% with a 95% CI of (0.9, 51.0).  Within each treatment group, the response rates were lower for 
patients in the high- than the low-risk category, as expected. 
Demographics of Patients with Baseline Infections 
There were 27 patients in each treatment group with baseline infections:  4.9% of the caspofungin and 
5.0%  of  the  AmBisome  group.    The  baseline  demographic  characteristics  of  the  54  patients  with 
baseline infections were generally similar between the 2 treatment groups.   
Distribution of Baseline Infections, Overall, and by Stratum 
The  most  common baseline infections  were  due to Aspergillus species (12 infections  per  group; the 
most common diagnosis was pneumonia) and Candida species (also 12 infections per group; the most 
common diagnosis was fungemia).  The infection types were balanced between the 2 treatment groups.  
The remaining pathogens were Dipodascus (1), Fusarium (2), and Mucor (1) species, and mould NOS 
(not otherwise specified; 2). 
With respect to risk-category, the distribution of infections was reasonably balanced in the 2 treatment 
groups,  except  that  high-risk  patients  in  the  caspofungin  group  had  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of 
Aspergillus  baseline  infections  (6/146  or  4.1%)  than  low-risk  patients  (6/410  or  1.5%).    For 
AmBisome  there  were  similar  proportions  of  Aspergillus  baseline  infection  in  the  2  risk  categories 
(2/122 [1.6%] in the high-risk and 10/417 [2.4%] in the low-risk). 
The  distribution  of  infections  by  use  of  prior  prophylaxis  was  balanced  overall  between  the  2 
treatment  groups.    The  use  of  prophylaxis,  however,  was  associated  with  lower  overall  rates  of 
baseline infections due to Candida species (both treatment groups combined:  5/617 [0.8%] in patients 
with prior prophylaxis and 19/478 [4.0%] without prophylaxis).  These findings are expected, in view 
of the frequent use of fluconazole prophylaxis in this study population.  
The number of baseline infections due to Candida species in this study was as high as the number of 
baseline  infections  due  to  Aspergillus  species  (24  infections  of  each).  This  is  somewhat  surprising 
when  considering  the  frequent  use  of  fluconazole  prophylaxis,  which  should  reduce  the  number  of 
Candida infections. However, the number of Candida infections is indeed much lower in patients who 
received antifungal prophylaxis than in those who did not.  
Concerning the use of prophylaxis this use seems to be quite different according to the center involved 
and the investigator in charge: indeed, 37.7% of high risk patients did not receive any prophylaxis at 
all, whereas 54.4% of low risk patients did receive prophylaxis. This difference in “clinical practice” 
has  to  be  taken  into  consideration  when  looking  at  the  prophylaxis  strata,  meaning  that  it  is  very 
difficult to draw conclusions based upon the occurrence of prior prophylaxis.

Microbiology of Baseline Pathogens 
There were 25 yeast pathogens and 30 mould pathogens (including the Fusarium sp. described in the 
footnote)  identified  either  microbiologically  or  histologically  as  causing  baseline  infections  by  the 
Adjudication Committee; MIC data were available in 25/55 or 45.5% of total baseline pathogens. 
The  MIC  distribution  was  examined  for  15  unique  pathogenic  isolates  tested  from  patients  with 
baseline  yeast  infections.    Most  baseline  yeast  isolates  were  Candida  species  and  had  MICs  to 
caspofungin ≤1 µg/ml.  There were 2 isolates with caspofungin MIC >8 µ g/ml:  1 C. parapsilosis that 
trailed  and  1 D.  capitatus,  and  1  C.  krusei  had  an  MIC  of  2µg/ml.    All  yeast  isolates  had  MICs  to 
amphotericin B ≤1.0 µ g/ml.  
The  MIC  distribution  was  examined  for  10  unique  pathogenic  isolates  from  patients  with  baseline 
mould  infections.    Most  baseline  mould  isolates  were  Aspergillus  species.    All  mould  isolates  had 
MICs  to  caspofungin  ≤0.5 µ g/ml.    Most  mould  isolates  had  MICs  to  amphotericin  B  ≤1  µg/ml; 
however, there were 3 isolates with higher MICs to amphotericin B:  1 A. candidus had an MIC of 2, 
another A. candidus had an MIC of 4, and 1 A. terreus had an MIC of 4 µg/ml.  
Response to Treatment for Specific Baseline Infections 
Response rates were higher in the caspofungin group for both baseline infections caused by Candida 
and  Aspergillus  species  (see  Table  5)  and  the  difference  was  most  pronounced  for  Aspergillus 
infections (overall) with rates of 41.7% for the caspofungin group and 8.3% for the AmBisome group.  
Results were similar in the MITT and evaluable-patients populations.

Of  the  favorable  responses,  partial  responses  were  seen  more  often  in  infections  caused  by 
Aspergillus species,  (frequently  manifesting  as  pneumonia),  whereas  complete  responses  were  more 
often  seen  with  Candida  infections  (frequently  manifesting  as  candidemias).    Of  the  14  successful 
responses  in  the  caspofungin  group,  6  were  partial  and  8  were  complete  (1  complete  and  4  partial 
responses caused by Aspergillus sp, and 6 complete and 2 partial responses caused by Candida sp.).  
Of the 7 successful responses in the Ambisome group, 3 were partial (2 Candida sp. and 1 Fusarium 
sp.) and 4 were complete (3 Candida sp. and 1 Aspergillus sp).  A complete response for candidemias, 
documented  by  repeat  blood  cultures,  was  more  readily  achieved  than  a  complete  response  for 
pneumonias,  because  of  the  typical  lag  times  in  resolution  of  associated  radiographic  abnormalities.  
The small numbers of isolates from individual species and limited availability of MIC data preclude an 
analysis of outcome by MIC. 
Per Pathogen Outcomes for Baseline Infections 
The  clinical  response  by  pathogen  in  MITT  patients  is  displayed  in  Table  6.    The  proportions  of 
patients in the  caspofungin and  AmBisome treatment  groups that  had favorable  clinical responses to 
baseline Aspergillus pathogens were 46.2 and 7.7%, respectively, and to baseline Candida pathogens, 
they were 63.6 and 41.7%, respectively.  These results are similar to those observed in the response to 
treatment for specific baseline infections (see Table 5) with this difference that for one patient in each 
treatment  group,  there  were  2  unique  baseline  isolates  of  an  Aspergillus  species  associated  with 
pneumonia (A. candidus in the caspofungin group and A. flavus in the AmBisome group), and that one 
case  of  probable  chronic  disseminated  candidiasis,  in  the  absence  of  culture  or  histopathologic 
confirmation  of  Candida  species,  was  considered  to  be  “presumed  Candida  species”  and  thus  not 
counted in the per pathogen displays. 
The  response  rate  of  Ambisome  for  treating  baseline  fungal  infections  is  unexpectedly  very  low 
(25.9%)  when  comparing  this  to  results  from  other  studies,  e.g.  Ambisome  versus  voriconazole 
(Walsh  TJ  et  al.  Voriconazole  compared  with  liposomal  amphotericin  B  for  empirical  antifungal 
therapy in patients with neutropenia and persistent fever. N Engl J Med 2002; 346:225-34.). Although 
it is acknowledged that the number of baseline infections is small, this seems to be mainly due to an 
abnormally  low  response  rate  for  baseline  infections  caused  by  Aspergillus  species.  It  is  not 
understood  what  the  exact  reason  for  this  could  be.  When  looking  at  Table  6  it  seems  that  5 
Aspergillus species in the  Ambisome  group  were  not  further identified (versus 4 in the  caspofungin 
group).  
The  scarcity  of  data  directly  related  to  Aspergillus  infections  in  previously  performed  empirical 
studies  is  acknowledged.  Data  from  studies  with  documented  infections  are  indeed  difficult  to 
compare  with  the  current  empirical  study  data,  due  to  the  differences  in  study  design,  in  applied 
definitions and in other criteria. This also applies to the historical control study, which is an entirely 
different study with another design and another patient population.  Furthermore, there seems to be a 
discrepancy between  microbiological  data as provided in Table 6  for the  AmBisome  group and data 
provided  in  the  originally  submitted  documentation.  Indeed,  the  single  A.  terreus  infection  in  the 
AmBisome  group  is  not  mentioned  here  and  similarly  only  3  instead  of  4  A.  flavus  infections  are 
documented. Instead 1 unknown mould and 1 Aspergillus-like mould are mentioned here as causative 
organisms. The apparent discrepancy between Table 6 submitted by the MAH in December 2003 and 
the original documentation submitted in September 2003 can be explained by the conventions used to 
present  the  data.  In  tables  that  displayed  diagnosis  of  the  invasive  fungal  infection,  but  not  specific 
pathogen  names, 
the  Adjudication  Committee’s 
determination of the causative pathogen, and were displayed according to the genus of the causative 
pathogen.  In  contrast,  in  listing  tables  and  in  per  pathogen  displays,  the  causative  pathogens  were 
identified  by  genus  and  species,  if  this  information  was  available.  Therefore,  even  if  it  would  have 
been  useful  to  apply  the  same  conventions  at  all  times  to  prevent  confusion,  the  discrepancy  is  
here clarified.

Baseline Fungemias 
Of 15 baselines yeast MITT isolates tested, 12 were blood isolates.  Thus, the MIC data available for 
blood isolates  from patients in the  MITT population resembled the  overall  MIC pattern  for all  yeast 
baseline pathogens.  Yeasts caused all documented fungemias in this study. 
Persistence of Baseline Infections 
The persistence of baseline infections was examined by reviewing all documented baseline infections 
with  an  unfavorable  outcome,  as  determined  by  the  Adjudication  Committee.    A  positive  final  on-
therapy  culture  from  a  relevant  site  was  considered  persistence.    Negative  final  on-therapy  cultures 
were considered evidence of eradication.  For disseminated infections, all relevant sites were reviewed 
and any positive final on-therapy culture from a relevant site was considered persistence.  Posttherapy 
cultures,  whether  positive  or  negative,  were  not  considered  relevant  here  inasmuch  as  patients  may 
have received alternative antifungal therapy, or could have relapsed.   
In  the  caspofungin  group,  2  of  the  13  baseline  infections  with  clinical  failure  were  associated  with 
documented  microbiological persistence: One  was a  C. tropicalis  disseminated  fungal infection  with 
positive  blood  culture  at  entry.    Although  repeat  blood  cultures  were  negative,  the  patient  had  a 
positive culture from skin biopsy on Day 6.  This patient received 14 days of study therapy and was a 
clinical  failure.  The second  was a  case of  Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium sp. pneumonia  with 
sputum culture positive on Day –3 for A. fumigatus only, and subsequent sputum culture on Day 11 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
14/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that was positive for both A. fumigatus and Fusarium sp.  This patient received 19 days of therapy and 
was a clinical failure.   
In  the  AmBisome  group,  4  of  the  20  baseline  infections  with  clinical  failure  were  associated  with 
documented persistence.  There were 3 cases of persistent candidemia (1 C. tropicalis, and 2 C. krusei) 
and one case of persistent Aspergillus niger in a disseminated fungal infection. 
There were 27 patients with baseline infections in each treatment group. Apart from the persistence of 
infections  as  described  above,  the  patients  with  documented  baseline  infections  and  unfavorable 
outcomes can be described as follows: 
Among documented baseline infections in the MITT population, there were 13 unfavorable responses 
in the  caspofungin  group and 20  unfavorable  responses in the  AmBisome  group.   Most  unfavorable 
responses  were  failures.  The  others  were 2 indeterminate outcomes in the  caspofungin  group and  1 
stable  disease  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  patient  narrative  summaries  and  adjudicators’ 
assessments  of  the  reason  for  an  unfavorable  clinical  outcome  were  reviewed  and  selected  patient 
characteristics and reasons for  failure  determined  from this review are presented in a table  (data not 
presented here).   
Patients  with  unfavorable  outcomes  for  baseline  infections  were  a  very  high  risk  subset  of  patients; 
most  were  either  high  risk,  or  if  low  risk  had  acute  leukemia  (mostly  AML),  and  entered  with 
profound neutropenia.  Most patients had multiple reasons for failure.   
Of  the  13  unfavorable  responses  in  the  caspofungin  group,  5  were  dose-increased  for  inadequate 
clinical  response,  9  were  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  7  had  persistent 
neutropenia,  10  had  progressive  signs  or  symptoms,  9  had  progressive  (or  new)  radiological 
abnormalities,  5  had  a  positive  culture,  including  2  with  persistent  baseline  pathogen,  10  changed 
antifungal therapy, and 4 patients died.   
For the 20 patients  with  unfavorable responses in the  AmBisome  group, 10 were  dose-increased  for 
inadequate  clinical  response,  5  were  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  13  had 
persistent  neutropenia,  18  had  progressive  signs  or  symptoms,  14  had  progressive  (or  new) 
radiological abnormalities, 12 had a positive culture, including 4 with persistent baseline pathogen, 8 
changed antifungal therapy, and 10 patients died.   
In the “baseline fungal infection” endpoint, there was an imbalance for persistent neutropenia (defined 
as ANC <500/µL at the end of study therapy) between treatment groups, which favours caspofungin. 
Persistent neutropenia was commonly present in patients with an unfavorable treatment outcome (in 7 
of the 13 caspofungin failures, 53.8 %, and in 13  of the 20 AmBisome failures, 65%), and only 1 of 
the 21 patients with favorable outcomes for both treatment groups. Although the two groups were well 
balanced at study  entry, persistent neutropenia appeared somewhat  more  common in the  AmBisome 
group  (13/27,  48%,  had  persistent  neutropenia  in  the  AmBisome  group  vs.  7/27,  25.9%,  in  the 
caspofungin  group),  and  this  independent  prognostic  factor  may  have  influenced  the  outcomes  of 
baseline infections. 
(cid:0) 
Absence of Breakthrough Infections 
Breakthrough infections were defined as probable and/or proven adjudicated infections with onset on 
or after Day 3 of study therapy and up to 7 days after completion of therapy.   
The distinction between a baseline and a breakthrough infection was predefined, albeit very arbitrary, 
as based  upon the  given  definitions (onset  up  to the second  day  of study therapy  versus  onset  on  or 
after  the  third  day  of  study  therapy).  The  adjudication  committee  decided  if  it  was  a  baseline  or 
breakthrough infection  with date  of  onset as the  date  that a  diagnostic test  (e.g. a  culture specimen) 
was obtained. 
As displayed in Tables 3 and 4 the percentages of MITT patients without breakthrough infections were 
similar in both treatment groups (94.8% in the caspofungin and 95.5% in the AmBisome group).  The 
observed difference (caspofungin minus AmBisome) in response rates between the 2 treatment groups 
was -0.8% with a 95% CI of (-3.3, 1.8).  Breakthrough infections were more common for patients in 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
15/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the high-risk category in both treatment groups, as expected, but the rates of breakthrough infections 
appeared similar whether or not antifungal prophylaxis was used.   
Demographics of Patients With Breakthrough Infections 
In  the  MITT  population  there  were  29  caspofungin  patients  and  24  AmBisome  patients  with 
breakthrough  infections,  when  the  late  adjudication  cases  are  included.    The  baseline  demographic 
characteristics of these patient infections were generally similar.   
Distribution Of Breakthrough Infections Overall and by Stratum  
There  were 30 breakthrough infections in 29 patients in the caspofungin group, and 25 breakthrough 
infections in the 24 AmBisome patients.  Candida species were the most common pathogens (chronic 
disseminated candidiasis [14] and fungemia [12] were the most common diagnoses).  The second most 
common pathogens were Aspergillus species (pneumonia was the most common diagnosis [12]).

Overall,  by  pathogen,  the  types  of  breakthrough  infections  were  balanced  between  the  2 treatment 
groups. However, there  were  more breakthrough infections  caused by species other than Candida or 
Aspergillus in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (4/30 versus 1/25, respectively): these were 
caused by Basidiomycetes (1), Zygomycetes (2) and Fusarium (1) in the caspofungin group, and by a 
not further specified mould in the Ambisome group.  Across pathogens, there were numerically more 
cases of disseminated fungal infection in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (8 versus 3).   
Breakthrough  infection  occurred  more  often  in  high-risk  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (15/146 
[10.3%]  of  caspofungin  and  9/122  [7.4%]  of  AmBisome  patients)  than  low-risk  patients  (15/410 
[3.7%]  and  16/417  [3.8%],  respectively).    Also  there  was  a  higher  proportion  of  Aspergillus 
breakthrough infections in high-risk patients in both treatment groups (7/146 [4.8%] and 7/122 [5.7%], 
respectively) than low-risk patients (3/410 [0.7%] and 2/417 [0.5%], respectively). 
The  overall  distribution  of  breakthrough  infections  was  generally  similar  between  the  2 treatment 
groups whether or not prophylaxis was used. 
Microbiology of Breakthrough Pathogens 
The organisms causing breakthrough infections were primarily Candida and Aspergillus species, but 
also  included  several  less  common  yeast  and  mould  pathogens.    There  were  32  yeast  pathogens 
(including the C. glabrata in the footnote) and 24 mould pathogens identified either microbiologically 
or  histologically as  causing breakthrough infections by the  Adjudication Committee;  MIC data  were 
available in 27/56 or 48.2% of total breakthrough pathogens.

Of the 17  unique  yeast breakthrough isolates tested in  the  MITT  population, 15  were blood isolates 
and 14 were Candida species.  
There were 5 yeast isolates in the caspofungin arm and 2 from the AmBisome arm (1 C. parapsilosis 
and 1 C. guilliermondii, both trailers) with caspofungin MICs >8 µ g/ml.  In the caspofungin group, 3 
of the 5 isolates with MICs >8 µg/ml in RPMI were trailing isolates (all C. parapsilosis) and one was 
a  non-Candida  isolate,  T.  beigelii.    Trailing  in  RPMI  medium  has  been  consistently  seen  for  some 
Candida  species,  especially  C.  parapsilosis  and  C.  guillermondii.    This  in  vitro  phenomenon  is  not 
seen  in  other  media  and  has  not  been  associated  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  caspofungin.    The 
significance  of  caspofungin  MICs  for  T.  beigelii  is  unclear  since  there  are  no  standardized  testing 
methods for any anti-fungal agent against the non-Candida yeasts.  
One breakthrough Candida isolate, Candida albicans, had a clear endpoint of MIC >8 µg/ml in RPMI.  
This  isolate  came  from  a  patient  with  a  breakthrough  disseminated  Candida  infection  involving 
multiple sites and blood.  This patient had 4 separate Candida albicans isolates all determined to be of 
common origin by DNA and CA3 fingerprinting analyses:  an oropharyngeal isolate, a blood isolate, a 
tissue isolate from lung biopsy and a tissue isolate from liver biopsy.  Additional evaluation included 
MIC testing, FKS1 gene sequence analysis, assays of glucan synthase activity, and in vivo activity in 
the mouse TOKA disseminated candidiasis model.  The liver and mouth isolates were considered fully 
susceptible  to  caspofungin  by  all  methods.    The  lung  and  blood  isolates,  however,  showed  elevated 
MIC values both in RPMI (>128 µ g/ml) and AM3 (>16 µg/ml) medium, had FKS single amino acid 
substitution at position 645, and reduced inhibition of glucan synthesis based on increased IC50 values.  
In the animal model, caspofungin showed efficacy against the blood but not the lung isolate.  For the 
lung isolate, an ED90 value  could not be  calculated, although there  was a significant reduction of C. 
albicans  colony  forming  units (CFU) in  kidneys  of  mice  at doses ranging  from 12  to 20 mg/kg/day, 
compared to infected, untreated controls.   
All 10 unique mould breakthrough isolates from both treatment arms, most of which were Aspergillus 
species,  had  caspofungin  MICs ≤0.5 µ g/ml  and  amphotericin  B  MICs  of  ≤1 µ g/ml.  There  was  1  A. 
flavus  isolate with an amphotericin B MIC of 2 µg/ml. 
Timing of Breakthrough Infections 
Most  breakthrough  fungal infections  in both  treatment  groups  occurred  while  the  patients  were  still 
receiving  study  therapy  (only  4 of  30  cases  for  caspofungin  and  5  of  25  for  AmBisome  occurred 
within 7 days after the end of study therapy).

Discordance  between  the  Adjudication  Committee  and  the investigators  was  common  regarding  the 
adjudicated probable and proven fungal infections but was generally not of clinical significance; most 
of the discordance was due to the different terminology used to describe the same pathogenic process.  
The  Adjudication  Committee,  which  was  unaware  of  the  investigators’  assessments  regarding 
treatment  outcome,  was  generally  more  conservative  than  the  investigators  and  assigned  more 
unfavorable treatment outcomes. 
 Mortality in Patients with Documented Infections 
Because  mortality  rates  are  substantial  in  this  at-risk  patient  population,  due  to  fungal  and  other 
infections,  as  well  as  underlying  malignancy  and  its  noninfectious  complications,  it  is  important  to 
examine mortality from a variety of perspectives.  This study examined mortality using three different 
prespecified  approaches.    This  section  presents  mortality  data  in  patients  with  documented  fungal 
infections, with  consideration of  overall  mortality and mortality potentially attributable to the  fungal 
infection (e.g. death caused by or occurring in the presence of active fungal infection).   
The  other  prespecified  approaches  to  mortality  were  survival  to  7  days  posttherapy  for  the  MITT 
population, as a component of the primary endpoint (see point 3 below) and a review of mortality for 
all treated patients in the Safety section.   
Overall mortality rates in the MITT population due to or in the setting of active fungal infection are 
summarized separately for patients with baseline and breakthrough infections in Table 8 below.

- Mortality in Patients With Documented Baseline Infection 
The mortality rate in patients with a baseline infection was substantially lower in the caspofungin than 
the AmBisome group (3 deaths [11.1%] versus 12 deaths [44.4%]) (p<0.01).  The excess mortality in 
the  AmBisome  group  appeared  primarily  to  be  associated  with  bacterial  or  fungal  infections  or 
nonspecific  sepsis  syndromes.    Investigators  made  a  determination  about  the  relationship  of  the 
adverse experiences to death.  The Adjudication Committee determined independently the presence of 
invasive fungal infections, but did not specifically assess whether a fungal infection contributed to the 
patient’s death.  However, a review of the narratives of the 15 deaths among 54 patients with baseline 
infections shows that 13 (86.7%) of these 15 deaths were either due to fungal infections or occurred in 
the setting of active fungal infection:  3 of 27 patients (11.1%) in the caspofungin group and 10 of 27 
(37.0%) in the AmBisome group, thus yielding mortality rates in the setting of active fungal infection 
of 11.1% and 37.0%, respectively.  These results are also consistent with the higher rate of successful 
treatment  outcome  for  baseline  infections  in  the  caspofungin  group.    The  Adjudication  Committee 
assessed  the  treatment  outcome  of  the  baseline  infection  as  failures  in  each  of  the  13  patients  who 
died.    In  the  remaining  2  cases,  the  deaths  were  due  to  noninfectious  causes,  and  the  Adjudication 
Committee’s determination of treatment outcome for the baseline infection was favorable.   
- Mortality in Patients With Documented Breakthrough Infection 
During the study period, the mortality rate in patients with breakthrough infections was similar for the 
2  treatment  groups:    10  deaths  (34.5%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  10 deaths  (41.7%)  in  the 
AmBisome group.  The most common fatal adverse experiences were in the Body as a Whole system; 
usually  related  to  a  bacterial  or  fungal  infection  or  a  nonspecific  sepsis  syndrome.    There  was  one 
additional  fatal  adverse  experience  in  the  caspofungin  group  reported  in  the  poststudy  period  (more 
than  14  days  after  the  end  of  study  therapy)  as  a  fatal  fungal  infection.    Thus  there  were  11/29  or 
37.9% deaths in the setting of breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group.  All 21 deaths (11 in 
the  caspofungin  group  and  10  in  the  AmBisome  group)  were  either  due  to  a  fungal  infection  or 
occurred in the presence of active fungal infection. 
- Breakthrough Infections Identified After the 7-day Posttreatment Follow-Up Visit 
All  suspected  fungal  infections  were  adjudicated,  but  the  analysis  of  breakthrough  infections  was 
limited  to  those  that  occurred  and  were  documented  by  the  7-day  posttherapy  visit,  as  defined  and 
required by the protocol.  Evidence for breakthrough infections identified after the 7-day posttreatment 
follow-up visit was not required by protocol and was not uniformly available; however, in some cases, 
these data were reported by the investigator and all such information was provided to the Adjudication 
Committee.    Any  breakthrough  infections  identified  from  data  obtained  only  after  the  7-day 
posttherapy follow-up visit were documented by the Adjudication Committee.  Although described in 
the  study  report,  they  were  not  counted  in  the  primary  analysis.    There  were  5  “post-7-day” 
breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group, and 6 in the AmBisome group.  Of the 11 patients 
with “post-7-day” breakthrough infections, 3 patients died (or had a fatal adverse experience) during 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
18/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the study (during 2  week posttreatment  follow-up period):  2 in the  caspofungin  group and 1 in the 
AmBisome  group.    Based  upon  available  data,  the  overall  numbers  of  “post-7-day”  breakthrough 
infections  appeared  similar  between  the  treatment  groups,  with  similar  distribution  of  specific 
diagnoses, pathogens, and mortality. 
- Adjudicated Possible Invasive Fungal Infections 
The Adjudication Committee assessed all the same variables with respect to possible infections as for 
the  documented  infections,  although,  as  prespecified,  possible  invasive  fungal  infections  were  not 
included  in  any  of  the  formal  study  analyses.    However,  when  possible  infections  were  included 
according  to  the  same  conventions  as  documented  infections,  the  conclusions  of  the  primary  study 
analysis remain unchanged for both the MITT and evaluable-patients populations. 
The company was asked to prove its assertion that inclusion of “possible” invasive fungal infections in 
the  primary  analysis  would  not  alter  the  main  study  conclusion.  As  specified  in  the  protocol  only 
documented  infections (i.e. proven  or probable infections)  were  considered  for analysis. Concerning 
the possible breakthrough infections, the majority of patients (56/57) had pneumonias. Only 3 out of 
the 57 patients had microbiological data of which only one fulfilled the microbiological criteria for IFI 
as defined by the EORTC/MSG. Although the criteria of diagnosis of possible IFI were sufficient for 
initiating antifungal therapy, a post-hoc examination by the expert panel based upon all data available 
up to 7 days post-therapy could not demonstrate more definitive data, which is reassuring. Although it 
can  be  agreed  that  the  occurrence  of  possible  infections  should  be  regarded  with  a  high  level  of 
uncertainty, and that in the setting of an empirical therapy trial in febrile neutropenic patients, analysis 
of documented invasive fungal infections should be limited to the probable and proven categories, the 
higher numbers of possible breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group vs AmBisome group (38 
vs 19) raises some concern.  
(cid:0) 
Survival to 7-Day Follow-Up 
Four patients in the caspofungin group and five in the AmBisome group were lost to follow-up within 
7 days after the completion of therapy and are therefore counted as failures for the survival endpoint.  
As  shown  in  the  Tables  3  and  4  the  percentages  of  patients  who  survived  for  at  least  7  days  after 
completion  of  therapy  were  92.6%  for  caspofungin  and  89.2%  for  AmBisome.    The  observed 
difference (caspofungin minus AmBisome) in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was 3.4% 
with a 95% CI of (0.0, 6.8).  The rate of survival to 7 days posttherapy was lower in high- than low-
risk patients within  each treatment group, as would be expected.  For the evaluable-patients analysis, 
patients who  were lost  to  follow-up  earlier than 7 days after the  completion of therapy  are  excluded 
from the analysis of the survival endpoint.  Results were similar for the evaluable-patients population 
(survival rate 92.6% for caspofungin and 90.1% for AmBisome).   
Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Survival Time 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to death for each of the treatment groups were calculated in order 
to reflect the probability of surviving beyond a given day through 7 days posttherapy (see Figure 1).  It 
should be  noted that  most patients  completed study treatment by 28  days and  were  followed  only  7 
days longer for the survival endpoint, or up to 35 days.  Consequently, the population becomes much 
smaller after Day 35.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was significant (p=0.044), indicating that there 
is  a  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  time  to  death.    A  consistently  higher 
proportion of caspofungin than AmBisome patients survived, and the difference was most pronounced 
after Study Day 28.  The Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival to 7 days posttherapy was repeated for 
the  evaluable-patients  population,  however,  the  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant 
(p=0.192). 
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  curves  were  also  calculated  in  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  the  risk 
category on survival time.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was significant (p=0.032), indicating that 
there is a difference among the 4 treatment group and risk category combinations with respect to time 
to  death:    there  was  a  shorter  survival  time  for  high-risk  patients  in  the  AmBisome  than  the 
caspofungin group, and for low-risk patients in either treatment group.

Deaths Reported During Treatment and Follow-up Period 
In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  patients  lost  to  follow-up  before  7  days  post-therapy  were 
considered failures.  The percentages of patients who actually died during study therapy or the 7-day 
posttherapy  follow-up  period  were  numerically  lower  for  caspofungin  (6.7%,  37/556)  than  for 
AmBisome  (9.8%,  53/539).    Most  of  the  deaths  in  both  groups  occurred  during  the  7-day 
posttreatment  follow-up  period.    The  treatment  groups  were  generally  balanced  with  respect  to  the 
most  common  fatal  adverse  experiences,  which  were  related  to  various  infections  (fungal  and  non-
fungal), hematologic malignancies, and respiratory illnesses.  Cardiovascular fatal adverse experiences 
were  slightly  more  frequent  in  the  AmBisome  group  (10  [1.8%]  for  caspofungin  and  19  [3.5%]  for 
AmBisome).    Fatal  hepatobiliary  system  adverse  experiences  were  noted  in  2  caspofungin  patients 
(0.4%)  but  not  in  the  AmBisome  group;  neither  was  considered  drug  related.    Similar  adverse 
experiences  led to  death  in  both  treatment  groups  and  reflected  the  serious  underlying  diseases  and 
complications expected in such a sick study population.   
Overall, 90 (8.2%) MITT patients died, 37 in the caspofungin group and 53 in the AmBisome group. 
Few patients died during study therapy; the majority of fatal events (79/90; 88%) occurred during the 
7-day follow-up. Autopsy was performed in 21 (23%) cases. Of these 10 had documented IFI (5 in 
each treatment group), according to the adjudicators and IFI was confirmed in all cases at autopsy. In 
the other 11 cases, 2 with possible pneumonia and 9 with non-fungal deaths (not considered to have 
IFI by Adjudicators), no invasive fungal infection could be detected at autopsy. Fatal adverse events in 
the remaining cases included e.g. cardiovascular events, respiratory illnesses and sepsis/multiple organ 
failure reflecting the serious underlying disease and complications that could be expected in this study 
population. Data suggest that most patients (other than those discussed above with documented IFI) 
died due to non-fungal causes. 
The MAH was asked to investigate if there was indeed an increase in creatinine levels in those patients 
who died and to analyse if these levels could be a reason  for the difference in survival seen between 
both  treatment  groups.  As  expected,  an  increase  in  creatinine  in  patients  with  already  pre-existing 
renal impairment was indeed a clear predictor of increased mortality. As clearly demonstrated in this 
analysis,  the  outcome  of  a  baseline  infection  as  well  as  the  presence  of  persistent  neutropenia  are 
important prognostic factors for survival. The survival endpoint as presented in the application file had 
to be re-analysed due to the existing imbalance in persistent neutropenia in the patients with a baseline 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17

infection. Taking these data into consideration, the survival advantage for caspofungin appears at least 
doubtful.  
(cid:0) 
Absence of Premature Discontinuation Due to Toxicity of Lack of Efficacy 
The study endpoint defined discontinuations due to either toxicity or lack of efficacy as failure for the 
MITT  analysis.    In  contrast,  patients  who  discontinued  therapy  for  reasons  other  than  study  drug-
related toxicity or lack of efficacy were, like patients who completed therapy, considered as successes.  
Patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  therapy  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  had  either  suspected  fungal 
infection  generally  requiring  a  change  of  antifungal  therapy  or  persistent  fever  without  a  suspected 
fungal infection.   
As shown in the Tables 3 and 4 the rates of absence of premature discontinuation for toxicity or lack 
of efficacy were consistently higher in the caspofungin group, overall (89.7% for caspofungin versus 
85.5%  for  AmBisome)  and  for  both  high-  and  low-risk  categories  and  with  or  without  use  of 
antifungal  prophylaxis.    Results  for  the  evaluable-patients  population  were  generally  similar (88.2% 
for caspofungin and 83.4% for AmBisome, respectively). 
Reason for Premature Discontinuation 
More than  one reason  for  discontinuation  was possible;  however, only  one reason  was identified by 
the investigator for assessment of this endpoint.  The specific reasons for endpoint discontinuations are 
summarized in Table 9 below.

Lack of Efficacy 
Lack of efficacy could have been due either to suspected fungal infection or to persistent fever without 
specific evidence to suggest fungal infection.  As shown above similar proportions of patients in both 
treatment groups discontinued for each of the lack of efficacy reasons.   
All discontinuations due to  lack  of  efficacy  were  reviewed.  If any  evidence of  fungal infection was 
present,  then  the  case  was  adjudicated.    In  contrast  to  other  analyses  in  this  submission,  possible 
invasive  fungal  infections  in  the  Adjudicators’  assessment  were  included  with  probable  or  proven 
infections in  order to permit an adequate  comparison  with the investigators’  clinical  management of 
the  patients.    For  all  49  discontinuations  due  to  suspected  fungal  infection,  the  Adjudication 
Committee agreed that there was at least a possible fungal infection (either baseline and breakthrough 
infection).  Of baseline infections, all but 2 were considered by the Adjudication Committee to have 
unfavorable treatment outcomes, thus showing fundamental agreement between the investigators’ and 
the Adjudication Committee’s decisions regarding possible and documented infection.  
Toxicity 
Caspofungin  had  generally  lower  rates  of  discontinuation  due  to  drug-related  adverse  experiences 
(4.9% for  caspofungin and 8.2%  for  AmBisome).  Relatively  few  patients prematurely  discontinued 
therapy due to drug-related clinical adverse experiences.  Nine patients in the caspofungin group were 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
21/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences of the skin and skin appendages, and 1 case was 
a serious rash; all patients recovered. Five patients in the caspofungin group were discontinued due to 
drug-related adverse experiences in the hepatobiliary system or hyperbilirubinemia; one of the adverse 
experiences was considered serious.  Of these 5 patients 4 patients had underlying hepatic dysfunction.  
The  hepatobiliary  adverse  experience  generally  occurred  in  the  setting  of  other  concomitant  organ 
dysfunction  or  allergic  reaction,  with  no  particular  pattern  to  the  biochemical  abnormalities  noted.  
The biochemical abnormalities that occurred during therapy were relatively mild in 2 cases, and in 2 
of  3  other  cases  with  marked  abnormalities,  this  appeared  to  be  an  isolated  event.    The  adverse 
experience resolved in 2 cases.  With regard to the 3 cases with hepatobiliary adverse experiences that 
did not resolve, 14-day follow-up information was available only in 1 case; the other 2 patients died of 
other  causes  within  4  days  after  discontinuation  of  therapy  and  therefore  resolution  could  not  be 
assessed.  
Very  few patients discontinued therapy  due to  drug-related laboratory adverse  experiences (3  versus 
13 cases in the caspofungin and the AmBisome group, respectively).  Laboratory drug-related adverse 
experiences  leading  to  discontinuation  were  primarily  related  to  liver  function  tests  (ALT,  AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, and total or direct hyperbilirubinemia) or to increased serum creatinine.  In each 
test category, there were fewer discontinuations in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group.  
(cid:0) 
Resolution of Fever During Neutropenia 
Fever  resolution  was  defined  as  a  maximum  oral  temperature  (or  its  equivalent,  using  noninfusion-
related  temperatures)  of  <38  degrees  Celsius  for  at  least  48  consecutive  hours  during  the  period  of 
neutropenia  (ANC  <500/µL).    As  shown  in  the  Tables  3  and  4  similar  percentages  of  patients 
experienced  fever  resolution  during  neutropenia:  41.2%  in  the  caspofungin  and  41.4%  in  the 
AmBisome  group.    The  observed  difference  (caspofungin  minus  AmBisome)  in  response  rates 
between the 2 treatment groups was -0.2% with a 95% CI of (-6.0, 5.6).  This endpoint had the lowest 
success rate of all the individual components of the composite primary endpoint.   Unexpectedly, there 
was a higher rate of fever resolution in the high-risk category for both treatment groups (50 to 52.1% 
for high-risk patients; 37.3 to 38.9% for low-risk patients).  A detailed exploration was undertaken of 
the  durations  of  fever,  neutropenia,  and  fever  during  neutropenia,  with  an  emphasis  on  differences 
related to risk category rather than treatment group. 
Time to Resolution of Fever During Study Therapy 
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  computed  for  the  proportion  of  MITT  patients  with  persistent  fever 
during study therapy.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was not significant (p=0.834), indicating that 
there is no difference between the treatment groups with respect to time to resolution of fever.  By Day 
7 of study therapy, ~50% of the patients in each treatment group had resolution of fever.  
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  also  used  to  display  the  time  to  resolution  of  fever  by  the  4 treatment 
and  risk  category  groups  for  MITT  patients.    The  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant 
(p=0.402), indicating that there is no difference among the 4 treatment and risk category groups with 
respect to time to resolution of fever.   
Time to Resolution of Neutropenia During Study Therapy 
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  calculated  for  the  time  to  resolution  of  neutropenia.    In  the  MITT 
analysis,  the  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant  (p=0.732),  indicating  no  difference 
between the treatment  groups  with respect to time to  resolution  of  neutropenia.  By  Day  8  of  study 
therapy,  ~50%  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  resolution  of  neutropenia  during  study 
therapy.   
For  the  MITT  analysis,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  also  computed  for  the  time  to  resolution  of 
neutropenia for the 4 treatment group and risk category subgroups.  The median times to resolution of 
neutropenia for the low-risk groups (8 days for both treatment groups) were lower than those observed 
in the high-risk groups (11 and 12 days for the caspofungin and AmBisome groups, respectively).  The 
log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  highly  significant  (p<0.001),  indicating  a  difference  among  the  4 
treatment  groups  and  risk  category  combinations  groups  with  respect  to  time  to  resolution  of 
neutropenia.  Low-risk patients had a shorter duration of neutropenia (by 3 to 4 days) than high-risk 
patients in both treatment groups.  However, for each risk category, caspofungin and AmBisome had 
similar response rates for this endpoint. 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
22/42 
 
 
 
 
Time to Resolution of Fever During Neutropenia 
The log-rank  chi-square statistic  was not significant (p=0.258), indicating  no difference between the 
treatment groups with respect to time to resolution of fever during neutropenia.  By Day 10 of study 
therapy,  ~50%  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  resolution  of  fever  during  neutropenia, 
compared with Day 7 in the analysis for resolution of fever irrespective of neutropenia.  Kaplan-Meier 
estimates  for  the  time  to  resolution  of  fever  during  neutropenia  for  the  MITT  analysis  were  also 
calculated for the 4 treatment groups and risk category groups.  No significant difference was observed 
(p=0.075) among the 4 treatment group and risk category combinations. 
However, as the duration of neutropenia was markedly different between the risk categories for both 
treatment groups, additional Kaplan-Meier calculations were performed to examine the effect of risk 
category  alone.    The  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  significant  (p=0.021),  indicating  a  difference 
between  the  risk  categories  with  respect  to  time  to  resolution  of  fever  during  neutropenia.  
Unexpectedly,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  persistent  fever  during  neutropenia  was  consistently 
higher  in  the  low-risk  than  the  high-risk  stratum,  a  fact  explained  by  the  censoring  of  data  from 
patients whose neutropenia had resolved before 48 hours without fever could be demonstrated.  Since 
the low-risk patients had shorter durations of neutropenia, they were censored from this analysis to a 
greater  extent  than  high-risk  patients.    Such  patients  are  thus  considered  failures  for  both  the  fever 
resolution and the overall endpoint. 
Exploratory Analyses Based on Variations of the Resolution of Fever Endpoint 
Fever is a nonspecific finding in the neutropenic patient and can be caused by a variety  of infectious 
and noninfectious problems, including viral and bacterial as well as fungal infections, the underlying 
primary malignancy, or it can be a complication of therapy.  A number of exploratory analyses were 
performed in which fever resolution was either substantively modified from the definition used in the 
primary  analysis  or  was  excluded  entirely  from  the  composite  primary  analysis.    For  consistency, 
handling of all other endpoints was unchanged in these analyses. 
For the primary analysis, fever resolution was defined as having a maximum oral temperature of <38o 
C  for  at  least  48  consecutive  hours  during  neutropenia.    The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  in  an 
exploratory manner using variations of the definition of fever resolution as follows: (1) resolution of 
fever  for  24  hours  prior  to  the  resolution  of  neutropenia,  (2)  resolution  of  fever  at  the  7-day 
posttherapy follow-up visit, and (3) exclusion of fever resolution from the composite endpoint.  These 
definitions  can be  considered progressively less  conservative than that  used  for the primary analysis 
because  (1)  the  shortening  of  the  required  duration  without  fever  from  48  to  24  hours  during 
neutropenia  should  be  more  readily  and  frequently  achieved,  (2)  the  “afebrile  at  7-day  follow-up” 
endpoint  is  independent  of  neutropenia,  and  also  because  the  temperature  recorded  is  a  single 
measurement  and  not  the  maximum  temperature  over  a  24-hour  period,  and  (3)  exclusion  of  fever 
resolution simply disregards the temperature data.   
Table  10  summarizes  the  observed  rates  of  overall  favorable  responses  and  for  fever  resolution 
according to each of the 4 definitions.   
It  is  apparent  that  the  overall  favorable  response  rates  and  the  fever  resolution  rates  increase 
substantially  with progressively less  conservative  definitions  of  fever resolution.  It  should be  noted 
that all other endpoint responses (e.g., those for documented infection, survival, and discontinuation of 
therapy)  were  handled  identically  to  the  primary  analysis,  and  so  these  other  individual  endpoint 
responses  are  unchanged.    Overall  response  rates  are  increased  most  dramatically  when  fever 
resolution is excluded entirely, and reflects a composite outcome that consists solely of endpoints of 
documented infection, survival, and premature discontinuation of therapy.

Overall response with fever resolution for 24 hours during neutropenia 
The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  after  fever  resolution  was  redefined  as  having  a  maximum  oral 
temperature  of  <38o  C  for  at  least  24  consecutive  hours  during  the  period  of  neutropenia.    It  was 
expected that requirement of a shorter period without fever would increase the response rate in low-
risk  patients  whose  short  durations  of  neutropenia  would  not  permit  a  demonstration  of  48  hours 
without fever despite favorable responses for all other endpoints.  It was confirmed that the difference 
in fever resolution rates between risk categories is much smaller than that observed with the 48 hour 
afebrile endpoint used in the primary analysis (see Figure 2).   
Overall response with fever resolution at the 7-day follow-up visit 
The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  after  fever  resolution  was  redefined  as  having  a  maximum  oral 
temperature (or its equivalent) of <38o C at the 7-day posttherapy follow-up visit in order to evaluate 
outcome  when  temperature  was  not  linked  to  neutropenia.    Similarly,  these  results  confirm  the 
expectation that the difference in fever resolution rates between risk categories is eliminated with the 
7-day posttherapy endpoint (see Figure 2).   
Overall response excluding the resolution of fever endpoint 
This  analysis  demonstrates  that  overall  response  rates  increase  markedly  for  both  treatment  groups, 
and that low-risk patients have higher overall response rates (by at least 4%) than high-risk patients, 
as would be expected, when fever resolution is excluded from the endpoint and efficacy is based upon 
documented invasive fungal infections, survival, and completion of therapy (see Figure 2).   
The data from this study suggest that patients with short durations of neutropenia may frequently fail 
the  fever  resolution  endpoint  but  have  favorable  outcomes  for  other  endpoint  components.  This 
explains the paradoxical observation that high-risk patients, in whom a longer period of neutropenia 
was demonstrated, in fact had higher rates of favorable overall responses (43.2% for caspofungin and 
37.7%  AmBisome)  than  low-risk  category  patients  (31.0%  for  caspofungin  and  32.4%  for 
AmBisome) when the 48 hour-afebrile-during- neutropenia definition of fever resolution was used in 
the  primary  analysis  (see  Table  3).    In  fact,  the  high-risk  patients  in  the  primary  analysis  had 
substantially higher rates of fever resolution (52.1% for caspofungin and 50.0% for AmBisome) than 
low-risk patients (37.3% for caspofungin and 38.8% for AmBisome). Review of the primary analysis 
by risk category using variations of the fever resolution endpoint confirms the observation that low-
risk  patients  have  higher  response  rates  than  high-risk  patients  when  the  less  conservative  fever 
resolution definitions are used.  This is most apparent when fever resolution is excluded entirely from 
the  overall endpoint. The results of the analysis that  excludes  fever resolution indicate  much  higher 
overall response rates in both treatment groups, and also suggest that caspofungin may be superior to 
AmBisome  as  empirical  therapy  when  fever  resolution  is  excluded  and  only  the  other  4  secondary 
endpoints  are  considered:  overall  favourable  response  of  81.7%  for  caspofungin  versus  74.7%  for 
Ambisome  when  adjusted  for  strata  (estimated  difference  in  response  rate  7.0%  with  a  95%  CI  of 
(1.9, 12.1)).

The difference in fever resolution between the high and low risk groups seems indeed to be the cause 
for the higher overall response rate seen in high risk patients, for the reasons explained above. This is 
confirmed when using the less conservative definitions for fever resolution. Nevertheless, although it 
is acknowledged that by extending the period without fever a number of patients in the low risk group 
would  be  excluded  from  the  analysis  due  to  rapid  recovery  of  their  neutropenia,  the  criterion  of  48 
hours  without  fever  seems  a  minimum  requirement  for  the  fever  resolution  endpoint.  Theoretically, 
fever resolution for 5 consecutive days during neutropenia would even be a better endpoint, although 
practically  more  difficult  to  realise.  It  is  reassuring  to  see  that  response  rates  for  caspofungin  as 
compared to Ambisome remain similar, independently of the definitions used for fever resolution.  
Figure 2: Variations of fever resolution endpoint – Overall response by risk category 
•  Ancillary analyses 
The primary analysis of efficacy was repeated for demographic subpopulations based on gender, age 
(≤ or >65  years of age), and race (Caucasian versus  non-Caucasian).  Caspofungin seemed similarly 
efficacious in both males and females, in both older adult patients (>65 years) and those up to 65 years 
of  age,  and  in  Caucasians  as  well  as  non-Caucasian  patients,  although  a  limited  number  of  patients 
over 65 years and of non-White patients were studied. 
2.3.3  Clinical studies in special populations 
No special studies were performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  
Children were not included in the empirical study and no specific data were obtained in children for 
this indication. Nevertheless, a paediatric study is planned to start in 2005, which will closely follow 
the design of the present adult study, but will be primarily a safety study. 
2.3.4 
Issue on dose increase of caspofungin to 70mg 
The  recommendation  of  a  dose  increase  of  caspofungin  to  70  mg  in  case  of  inadequate  clinical 
response  cannot be  endorsed  due to lack  of supportive  data. A  minimum requirement to support the 
recommendation  of  up-dosing  is  that  a  dose-response  effect  of  higher  doses  of  caspofungin  should 
have been documented. It is worth recalling that caspofungin has been authorised for use in invasive 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
25/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aspergillosis  only  under  exceptional  circumstances.  In  particular,  there  is  an  ongoing  Specific 
Obligation (S.O.) to evaluate higher doses of caspofungin in invasive aspergillosis. This S.O. will not 
be fulfilled, since the aspergillosis study has been stopped. Instead, the MAH has included a wording 
on the 70mg dosage in the SPC.  
Similarly,  the  MAH  has  withdrawn  the  request  to  increase  the  dose  to  70  mg  and  has  proposed 
deletion of the text regarding updosing to 70mg for empirical therapy.  
The  wording  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  is  as  follows:  “A  single  70-mg 
loading dose should be administered on Day-1, followed by 50 mg daily thereafter. Doses higher than 
70 mg daily have not been adequately studied.” This new wording applies to the existing indications 
of  Invasive  Aspergillosis  and  Invasive  Candidiasis  as  well  as  to  the  current  variation  II/17  for  the 
empirical treatment indication.  
2.3.5  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The indication, as proposed by the MAH, “ Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in 
febrile, neutropaenic adult patients, should be revised.  
The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the 
identity of any fungal pathogen, a fact which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore the 
CPMP decided to adopt an alternate wording, as follows: “Empirical therapy for presumed fungal 
infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients”. Together with 
this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeasts and non-aspergillus moulds 
was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: “Limited data suggest that less common non-Candida 
yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin 
against these fungal pathogens has not been established.”  
However,  the  current  indication  for  invasive  candidasis  (IC)  is  inconsistent  with  the  extension, 
since it includes only non-neutropenic patients. The number of neutropenic patients with IC who 
have received caspofungin has increased with the  data from the empirical trial and now totals 26 
patients (14 patients from the invasive candiasis trial (P014) trial and 12 patients from the current 
trial). In comparison with the 22 neutropenic patients who received AmBisome/amphotericin B in 
these trials, favourable response rates were slightly higher in the caspofungin group (15/26 (58%) 
vs  9/22  (41%)).  Considering  the  great  difficulties  in  recruiting  a  large  number  of  neutropenic 
patients with documented IC, the CPMP is of the opinion that efficacy for caspofungin has been 
sufficiently demonstrated to delete the restriction of the IC indication to non-neutropenic patients.

2.4.1  Supportive clinical data 
(cid:0) 
Background Summary 
Safety information on 876 individuals who received single or multiple doses of caspofungin has been 
submitted previously through the  original and supplemental  Marketing  Applications in patients  with 
invasive  aspergillosis  (N=72),  oesophageal  or  oropharyngeal  candidiasis  (N=285),  and  invasive 
candidiasis (N=125).  In addition, a total of 394 subjects received caspofungin in Phase I trials.   
The  following  drug-related  adverse  experiences  have  been  reported  in  at  least  2%  of  patients  with 
invasive  aspergillosis  or  Candida  infections:    infused  vein  complications/  thrombophlebitis,  fever, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, chills, increased ALT and AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, 
increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased bilirubin, decreased serum albumin, decreased serum 
potassium, eosinophilia, decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit, decreased WBCs and decreased platelets.  
Possible allergic type reactions have been reported in clinical studies including isolated reports of rash, 
facial  swelling,  pruritus,  sensation  of  warmth,  or  bronchospasm.    Cases  of  anaphylaxis  during 
administration of caspofungin have also been reported. 
The  following  serious  adverse  experiences  have  been  reported  in  association  with  caspofungin  in  at 
least one patient in clinical studies: pulmonary infiltrates, venous thrombosis, hypercalcemia, rash, and 
thrombocytopenia.

Safety data to support this variation 
The safety data to support the extension of indication of caspofungin to empirical therapy of presumed 
fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic patients, originate from a Phase III study, Protocol 026: A 
Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Comparative Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and 
Efficacy of MK-0991 Versus Amphotericin B Liposome for Injection as Empirical Therapy in Patients 
With Persistent Fever and Neutropenia. 
1  Patient exposure 
There were 1123 patients randomized in the study, of whom 1111 received at least one dose of active 
therapy (564 patients received caspofungin and 547 patients received AmBisome) and were included 
in the analysis of safety.  The duration of study therapy for both treatment groups ranged from 1 to 90 
days.  The mean duration of study therapy in the  caspofungin and AmBisome groups were 13.0 and 
12.5 days, respectively.   
Table 11 displays the descriptive statistics for duration of therapy (after Day 1) by treatment group and 
dose  to  define  the  exposure  of  patients  to  elevated  doses  of  study  therapy.    Therapy  on  Day  1  was 
excluded from the analysis so that the 70-mg loading dose of caspofungin on Day 1 would not skew 
the results.  The mean durations of the standard dose of study therapy were similar for the 2 treatment 
groups  (10.4  and  10.3  days  for  caspofungin  and  AmBisome,  respectively).    Similar  numbers  of 
patients received the increased dose of study therapy after Day 1 (13.3% for caspofungin and 14.3% 
for  AmBisome).    In  addition,  the  mean  durations  of  study  therapy  at  the  increased  dose  were  also 
similar for the 2 treatment groups (11.6 and 10.0 days for caspofungin and AmBisome, respectively).

2  Adverse events 
As  expected in seriously ill patients, clinical adverse  experiences  were  common in this study:  of the 
1111  patients,  1039  (93.5%)  reported  at  least  1  clinical  adverse  experience:    521  (92.4%)  in  the 
caspofungin group and 518 (94.7%) in the AmBisome group.   
Drug-related clinical adverse experiences were significantly less common in the caspofungin than the 
AmBisome group (p<0.001).  The proportion of patients in the caspofungin group who discontinued 
from therapy  due  to a serious  drug-related  clinical adverse  experience  was also significantly smaller 
than the corresponding proportion in the AmBisome group (p=0.015) (see Table 12).

The  number (%)  of patients  with specific  clinical adverse  experiences, both  overall and drug related 
and occurring at an incidence of at least 2% overall, is displayed by body system in Table 13 above.   
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group  were 
consistent  with  those  reported  overall  and  included  fever  (17.0%),  chills  (13.8%),  rash  (6.2%),  and 
headache (4.3%).   
The most frequently reported drug-related clinical adverse experiences in the AmBisome group were 
chills  (24.7%),  fever  (19.4%),  nausea  (11.3%),  vomiting  (8.6%),  and  headache  (5.7%).    The  drug-
related adverse experiences of chills, nausea, and vomiting were less common in the caspofungin than 
the AmBisome group (p<0.05). 
3  Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall,  312  (28%)  of  the  1111  patients  had  at  least  one  serious  clinical  adverse  experience:    147 
(26.1%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  165  (30.2%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  most  common 
serious  adverse  experiences  across  treatment  groups  were  pneumonia  (4.2%),  AML  (3.0%),  and 
respiratory  failure  (2.8%).    There  were  25  patients  with  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences 
determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy: 9 (1.6%) 
in the caspofungin group and 16 (2.9%) in the AmBisome group.   
In the  caspofungin  group, 3  patients  had serious  drug-related adverse  experiences  of renal  failure  or 
insufficiency.    Two  patients  with  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  of  rash  recovered.    The 
remaining  cases  were  (1)  an  infusion-related  hypersensitivity  reaction  (consisting  of  chills,  rigors, 
chest  tightness,  and  tachypnea  lasting  15  minutes,  followed  2  hours  later  by  nausea  and  high  fever, 
resolving over 3 hours after the infusion), (2) a case of progressive hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of 
metastatic disease of the lungs and liver, (3) congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, and extension of a 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17

prior  myocardial  infarction  in  the  setting  of  AML  and  underlying  cardiovascular  disease,  and  (4) 
bronchiolitis  obliterans  with  organizing  pneumonia  noted  on  lung  biopsy  performed  3  days  after 
completion of study therapy.   
In  the  AmBisome  group,  5  patients  had  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the  respiratory 
system consisting of 3 adverse experiences of respiratory distress, 2 dyspnea, and 1 hypoxia, 3 patients 
had  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the  immune  system  (hypersensitivity  reaction  [3], 
anaphylaxis  [1],  and  anaphylactic  reaction  [1])  and  3  patients  had  serious  drug-related  adverse 
experiences  in  the  urogenital  system  (acute  renal  failure  [2],  and  renal  insufficiency  [1]).    The 
remaining  cases  were  a hypokalemia, a ventricular  fibrillation  with  cardiac arrest, a fungal infection 
and a Grand mal seizure. 
There  were 136 patients (12.2% of the 1111 patients receiving study drug)  who died as a result of a 
fatal adverse experience that occurred during the course of the study:  61 (10.8%) in the caspofungin 
group  and  75  (13.7%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Only  3 patients  had  serious  adverse  experiences 
leading  to  death  that  were  considered  either  possibly,  probably  or  definitely  drug-related  by  the 
investigator.  One patient was treated with caspofungin but discontinued and subsequently expired due 
to renal insufficiency that was felt by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug therapy.  The 
other  2  patients  who  died  due  to  a  drug-related  serious  adverse  experience  were  in  the  AmBisome 
group:    one  experienced  a  cardiac  arrest  reported  by  the  investigator  as  possibly  related  to  study 
therapy,  while  the  other  died  due  to  respiratory  distress  that  was  probably  related  to  study  therapy.  
The  remaining  deaths  were  due  to  complications  of  underlying  diseases  or  infections,  and  the 
distribution of the different aetiologies was generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
4  Discontinuations due to AES 
There  were  161  discontinuations  from  study  therapy  as  a  result  of  a  clinical  adverse  experience, 
including  78  (13.8%) in the  caspofungin group and 83 (15.2%) in the  AmBisome  group.  The  most 
frequently reported specific clinical adverse experiences leading to discontinuation of study therapy in 
the caspofungin group were rash (1.4%), fever (1.1%), and pneumonia (1.1%), and in the AmBisome 
group were AML (1.5%), fever (1.3%), pneumonia (1.1%), and fungal infection (1.1%).   
Of  the  161  discontinuations,  60  occurred  because  of  a  drug-related  clinical  adverse  experience, 
including 25 (4.4%) in the caspofungin group and 35 (6.4%) in the AmBisome group.  
In the caspofungin group ten patients discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences of the skin 
and  skin  appendages  (1  case  was  a  serious  rash;  all  patients  recovered),  and  five  patients  were 
discontinued  due 
the  hepatobiliary  system  or 
hyperbilirubinemia (one of the adverse experiences was considered serious).   
There  were  35  discontinuations  in  the  AmBisome  group  due  to  drug-related  clinical  adverse 
experiences: 4 because of hypersensitivity reactions, 3 anaphylaxis or anaphylactic-type reactions and 
4 fevers. 
to  drug-related  adverse  experiences 
in 
Of the patients with a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience as described above, 4 patients in 
the  caspofungin  group  discontinued  treatment  (the  patient  with  the  hypersensitivity  reaction,  the 
patient with the hyperbilirubinemia, one patient with renal insufficiency and one patient with rash). In 
the AmBisome group all except for 2 patients with a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience 
(one case of renal insufficiency and the patient with hypokalemia) discontinued treatment.  
5  Laboratory findings 
Of the 1111 patients, 627 (56.4%) reported at least 1 laboratory adverse experience:  302 (53.5%) in 
the  caspofungin  group  and  325  (59.4%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Laboratory  adverse  experiences 
were significantly less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (p=0.049). 
Other  significant  differences  in  favour  of  caspofungin  included  the  following  safety  parameters:  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  (p<0.001),  the  proportion  of 
patients  who  discontinued  from  therapy  due  to  a  laboratory  adverse  experience  (p=0.026),  and  the 
proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  from  therapy  due  to  a  drug-related  laboratory  adverse 
experience (p=0.010) (see Table 14).   
The  number  (%)  of  patients  with  specific  laboratory  adverse  experiences,  both  overall  and  drug 
related, is displayed by test category in Table 15.   
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
31/42 
 
 
 
The  most  common  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group  were 
increased  ALT  (8.7%),  hypokalemia  (7.3%),  increased  alkaline  phosphatase  (7.0%),  increased  AST 
(7.0%), and total blood bilirubin increased (3.0%).   
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  AmBisome  group 
were increased alkaline phosphatase (12.0%), hypokalemia (11.8%), increased ALT (8.9%), increased 
AST (7.6%), and increased serum creatinine (5.5%).   
The  drug-related adverse  experiences  of increased alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, and increased 
serum  creatinine  were  less  common  in  patients  who  received  caspofungin  than  in  patients  who 
received AmBisome (p<0.05).

- Serious Laboratory Adverse Experiences 
Two  patients  (0.4%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  5  patients  (0.9%)  in  the  AmBisome  group 
experienced  a  serious  laboratory  adverse  experience.    Neither  of  the  2  serious  laboratory  adverse 
experiences  reported  in  the  caspofungin  group  were  determined  to  be  drug  related,  but  1  of  the  5 
serious adverse experiences in the AmBisome group (increased total serum bilirubin) was determined 
to be drug related. 
- Discontinuations Due to Laboratory Adverse Experiences 
There  were  22  patients  overall  who  discontinued  from  study  therapy  due  to  a  laboratory  adverse 
experience:    6  (1.1%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  16  (2.9%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Of  the  6 
discontinuations in the caspofungin group, 3 were due to a drug-related adverse experience of hepatic 
dysfunction (increased AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase [1], increased ALT only [1], and increased 
total  and  direct  bilirubin  only  [1]).    In  the  AmBisome  group,  there  were  13  (2.4%)  drug-related 
discontinuations:    9  due  to  abnormal  liver  function  tests  (increased  bilirubin,  increased  alkaline 
phosphatase, increased ALT and AST), and 4 due to increased creatinine.

- Safety Analyses 
Four safety hypotheses were predefined for this study. The primary safety analysis for this study was a 
comparison  of  the  incidence  of  nephrotoxicity  between  the  2  treatment  groups.  The  results  of  the  4 
safety analyses are summarized in Table 16.

†  N = Number of patients in treatment group. 
‡  Observed difference = Caspofungin 70/50 mg—AmBisome 3.0 mg/kg 
§  For analysis of nephrotoxicity, percent was calculated as m/n (Number of patients with nephrotoxicity/ 
Number of patients with serum creatinine data).  For caspofungin, n= 547 and for AmBisome n = 522. 
- Nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity  was  predefined  as  a  doubling  of  serum  creatinine  or  an  increase  in  creatinine  by  ≥1 
mg/dL, if the creatinine was elevated at study entry.  The analysis included all patients who met these 
criteria during study therapy, whether or not the elevations were considered to be adverse experiences.  
As predefined in the protocol, the analysis of nephrotoxicity was performed using the data from only 
those  patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  >30  ml/min  at  baseline.    The  observed  proportions  of 
patients with nephrotoxicity were 2.6% (14/547) for caspofungin and 11.5% (60/522) for AmBisome.  
The difference in nephrotoxicity rates between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) 
was  -8.9%,  with  a  95%  CI  of  (-12.0,  -5.9).    The  CI  lies  completely  below  0,  indicating  that 
caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the risk of nephrotoxicity. 
- Infusion-Related Adverse Experiences 
Infusion-related  adverse  experiences  were  recorded  daily  during  intravenous  study  therapy.    The 
proportions  of  patients  who  developed  at  least  1  infusion-related  event  were  35.1%  (198/564)  and 
51.6%  (282/547)  in  the  caspofungin  and  AmBisome  groups,  respectively.    The  difference  in 
proportions between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was -16.4%, with a 95% 
CI  of  (-22.2,  -10.7)  and  an  associated  p-value  <0.001,  indicating  that  caspofungin  is  superior  to 
AmBisome with respect to the occurrence of infusion-related events (mainly chills and fever).  There 
were numerically fewer severe infusion-related events in the caspofungin group than in the AmBisome 
group (5.1% in the caspofungin group versus 8.6% in the AmBisome group).  
- Drug-Related Clinical and Laboratory Adverse Experiences 
Overall,  686  (61.7%)  of  the  1111  patients  reported  one  or  more  clinical  or  laboratory  adverse 
experiences determined by the investigator to be drug related:  307 (54.4%) in the caspofungin group 
and  379  (69.3%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  difference  between  the  2  treatment  groups 
(caspofungin minus AmBisome) was -14.9, with a 95% CI of (-20.5, -9.2) and an associated p-value 
<0.001, indicating that caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the  occurrence of drug-
related adverse experiences.

- Discontinuations Due to Drug-Related Clinical or Laboratory Adverse Experiences 
Seventy-two (6.5%) of the 1111 patients discontinued therapy due to a clinical or laboratory adverse 
experience determined by the investigator to be drug related:  28 (5.0%) in the caspofungin group and 
44  (8.0%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  difference  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (caspofungin 
minus  AmBisome)  was  -3.1,  with  a  95%  CI  of  (-6.0,  -0.2)  and  an  associated  p-value  of  0.037, 
indicating  that  caspofungin  is  superior  to  AmBisome  with  respect  to  the  occurrence  of  drug-related 
adverse experiences that result in discontinuation from therapy. 
6  Safety in special populations 
Adverse experience summaries were reviewed for patient subgroups based on age, gender, and race. 
Of the 1111 patients enrolled in the study that received active therapy, 14.9% (165 patients) were >65 
years  of  age.    Not  unexpectedly,  patients  in  this  age  category  in  both  treatment  groups  had  higher 
incidences  of  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences  and  death  than  those  patients  aged  65  years  and 
younger  (37.1%  versus  24%  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  40.8%  versus  28.5%  in  the  AmBisome 
group,  respectively  for  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences;  20.2%  versus  9.1%  in  the  caspofungin 
group and 23.7% versus 12.1% in the AmBisome group, respectively for deaths).  However, given the 
relatively  small  number  of  elderly  patients  any  actual  differences  due  to  patient  age  are  difficult  to 
assess.   
Of the 1111 patients enrolled in the study that received active therapy, 622 patients were male and 489 
were female.  Overall, the clinical and laboratory adverse experience profile showed similar incidence 
of clinical adverse experiences in males and females in both treatment groups. 
Overall, nearly 90% of patients (994/1111) were white.  As a result, the clinical and laboratory adverse 
experience profile  of patients who  were  white  mirrors that of the  overall study populations, and  any 
apparent differences in the  occurrence of  adverse  experiences in  other races should be  considered in 
context, given the small size of this population.   
2.4.2  Post-marketing data 
From 14-Dec-2000 through 15-Mar-2003, a total of 300 spontaneous and compassionate-use, named-
patient,  or  temporary-use-authorization  study  reports  were  identified.    Of  these  reports,  207  were 
spontaneous  adverse  experience  reports  received  from  healthcare  providers  and  120  (58%)  were 
serious.    The  remaining  93  were  compassionate-use,  named-patient,  or  temporary-use-authorization 
study reports that were not part of Merck clinical trials of which 73 (78%) met the criteria for serious.   
In the 120 spontaneous reports that had at least one serious adverse event, the most frequently reported 
serious adverse events were death NOS (10 reports), hypokalemia (9), increased alkaline phosphatase 
(8),  increased  AST  (8),  increased  ALT  (7),  and  multiorgan  failure  (7).    In  the  73  serious 
compassionate-use,  named-patient,  temporary-use-authorization  study  reports,  the  most  frequently 
reported serious adverse experiences were death NOS (11), multiorgan failure (11), aspergillosis (6), 
septic shock (6) and increased alkaline phosphatase (4). 
From  14-Dec-2000  through  15-Mar-2003,  95  reports  of  fatal  outcomes  were  identified  concerning 
patients  who  received  caspofungin  in  the  postmarketing  environment,  including  38  spontaneous 
reports and 57 compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization study reports.  In 22 
reports,  the  causes  of  death  were  unknown  and/or  there  was  insufficient  information,  precluding  a 
proper evaluation.   
In the remaining 73  reports, the patients' deaths  were  most likely  related to their serious  underlying 
medical illnesses (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, leukaemia, sepsis, and pneumonia).   
Six  spontaneous  reports  were  identified  which  may  be  indicative  of  possible  drug  interactions  with 
caspofungin.    The  reported  interacting  therapies  included  cyclosporine  (2),  gemtuzumab  (1), 
ciprofloxacin and clindamycin (1), tacrolimus (1), and warfarin (1).   
In 2 reports, limited information was received involving possible drug interactions with cyclosporine, 
precluding  further  evaluation,  since  no  information  was  provided  in  either  report  regarding  blood 
cyclosporine  levels  or  dosing  regimens  of  other  concomitant  therapies.    In  2  clinical  studies, 
cyclosporine (one 4-mg/kg dose or two 3-mg/kg doses) increased the area under the curve (AUC) of 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
35/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
caspofungin by ~35%, probably due to reduced uptake of caspofungin by the liver, while blood levels 
of cyclosporine remained unchanged.   
One  report  concerned  possible  drug  toxicity  with  caspofungin  and  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  a 
patient with preexisting leukemia, diabetes mellitus, and elevated AST and ALT.  The patient received 
1 day of therapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  Over the next 8 days, his condition deteriorated; he 
developed  hepatic  failure  and  hepatorenal  syndrome.    Therapy  with  caspofungin  was  started  on  the 
eighth  day, and  on the  following  day,  he  experienced a  “significant” increase in liver  enzymes.  He 
died 2 days later from hepatic and respiratory failure.  Hepatotoxicity, including severe hepatic veno-
occlusive disease, has been reported in association with the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single 
agent,  as  part  of  a  combination  chemotherapy  regimen,  and  in  patients  without  a  history  of  liver 
disease or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant.   
The  3  remaining  reports  of  potential  drug  interactions  consisted  of  1)  a  patient  who  developed 
bronchospasm, shortness of breath, chills, and back pain on the third day of infusion with caspofungin, 
which  was  attributed  to  a  possible  drug  interaction  between  caspofungin,  ciprofloxacin,  and 
clindamycin, 2) a patient  on therapy  with tacrolimus  2 mg twice a  day.  When  concomitant therapy 
with itraconazole and amphotericin B were switched to caspofungin, the patient developed decreased 
blood tacrolimus levels, and 3) a patient  with an increased prothrombin time attributed to a  possible 
drug interaction with warfarin and caspofungin.  Concomitant therapy included fluconazole, which is 
known  to  increase  the  effect  of  warfarin.    No  information  was  provided  in  this  report  regarding  the 
temporal  relationship  between  the  initiating  of  any  medications  and  the  patient's  increased 
prothrombin time.  
Hepatic Adverse Events 
A  total  of  67  reports  that  may  represent  hepatic  injury  were  identified  in  patients  treated  with 
caspofungin, of which 41 were spontaneous and 26 were from compassionate-use, named-patient, or 
temporary-use-authorization programs.   
In  49  of  the  67  reports,  the  patient  had  serious  underlying  medical  conditions,  pre-existing  hepatic 
disease/elevations  in  liver  function  tests,  and/or  concomitant  therapies  that  were  associated  with 
hepatotoxicity.    In  another  15  reports,  there  was  insufficient  information  for  a  proper  evaluation.    
Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase), elevated direct and total bilirubin and 
rare  cases of  hepatic  dysfunction are included in the  “Side Effects” section of the  current CCDS for 
caspofungin.  All 67 reports were either consistent with the current CCDS for caspofungin and/or were 
reported as not related to therapy with caspofungin. 
Renal Adverse Events 
A total  of 22 reports representing possible  renal  dysfunction  were identified in patients treated  with 
caspofungin (14 reports were from the marketed environment, and 8 occurred in patients who received 
caspofungin from compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization programs).   
including 
tobramycin, 
In  19  of  the  22  reports,  the  patients  received  concomitant  medications  known  to  be  associated  with 
nephrotoxicity, 
tacrolimus,  ciprofloxacin,  cefepime,  vancomycin,  or 
amphotericin.  The 3 other reports include a case of nonserious polyuria occurring on the same day as 
the  initiation  of  therapy  with  caspofungin,  nephrotic  syndrome  in  a  patient  with  borderline  renal 
function (inadequate information on concomitant medications and medical history), and acute tubular 
necrosis in  a patient  with a  complicated postoperative  course status post bowel resection,  where the 
reporter did not believe to be associated with caspofungin. 
Additionally,  in  5  reports,  pre-existing  elevated  serum  creatinine  (3),  renal  failure  and  renal  tubular 
acidosis  were  described  in  the  patient’s  concurrent  condition/medical  history.    Increased  serum 
creatinine is included in the “Side Effects” section of the current CCDS for caspofungin.  At this time 
there is inadequate  evidence  of  a  causal relationship  between the  other  described renal  dysfunctions 
and treatment with caspofungin, based on available data.  
Allergic Adverse Experiences 
Thirty-nine reports with allergic adverse experience terms and reported in temporal association with 
administration of caspofungin were identified (32 were spontaneous reports and 7 occurred in a patient 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
36/42 
 
 
who received caspofungin from compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization 
programs).  Eighteen of the 39 reports were considered serious.  Nine of these patients had a 
concurrent condition/medical history of previous drug allergy/reaction; one had a history of asthma. 
Anaphylaxis, and possible histamine-mediated symptoms, including isolated reports of rash, facial 
swelling, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm are labeled in the CCDS for caspofungin.  
The above reports were consistent with the current CCDS and safety profile for caspofungin, and pose 
no additional concerns regarding potential allergic adverse experiences temporally associated with 
administration of caspofungin. 
Safety reports from ongoing studies 
At the time of this application, there were 3 ongoing open-label noncomparative clinical studies in the 
caspofungin development program. 
Since  the  submission  of  the  Worldwide  Clinical  Summary  (submitted  06-Mar-2002)  for  Invasive 
Candidiasis,  there  were  24  patients  who  received  caspofungin  in  the  Salvage  Aspergillosis  study 
(Protocol  019)  during  the  period  from  06-Nov-2001  to  15-Mar-2003.    During  this  time  period,  35 
serious adverse experiences were reported in 19 patients, none of which were drug related.  Nineteen 
(in 14 patients)  of the 35 serious adverse  experiences reported  were  fatal.  The adverse  experiences 
reported were consistent with the serious underlying diseases, concurrent conditions, and concomitant 
medications in these seriously ill patients.   
Thirty-one  patients,  aged  2  to  17  years,  were  treated  with  caspofungin  in  the  Pediatric 
Pharmacokinetic study (Protocol 033) during the period from 06-Nov-2001 to 15-Mar-2003.  Sixteen 
serious  adverse  experiences  were  reported  in  10  patients,  none  of  which  were  drug  related.    One 
patient experienced the fatal serious adverse experience of fungal pneumonia.   
One patient was enrolled in the Combination Therapy study (Protocol 037) from 06-Nov-2001 to 15-
Mar-2003.  There were no serious adverse experiences reported for this patient prior to the in-house 
data cutoff date of 15-Mar-2003. 
2.4.3  Conclusion of clinical safety 
A  total  of  1111  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  therapy  (564  received  caspofungin  and  547 
received AmBisome) in the submitted Empirical Therapy Study. By comparison, 876 individuals had 
received single or multiple doses of caspofungin in prior applications for caspofungin. As a result, this 
study provides the largest increase to the safety database of caspofungin to date.  
Overall, drug-related clinical and laboratory adverse experiences were significantly less frequent in the 
caspofungin group than in the AmBisome group. 
The  most  common  drug-related  clinical  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group  were: 
fever (17.0%), chills (13.8%), rash (6.2%), and headache (4.3%).  Chills, nausea, and vomiting were 
significantly less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group 
included  increased  ALT  (8.7%),  hypokalemia  (7.3%),  increased  alkaline  phosphatase  (7.0%), 
increased  AST (7.0%), and total blood bilirubin increased  (3.0%).  A significant  difference between 
the 2 treatment groups  was  noted  for drug-related increased  alkaline phosphatase,  hypokalemia, and 
increased serum creatinine in favour of caspofungin.  
Four safety hypotheses were predefined for this study. The primary safety analysis for this study was a 
comparison of the incidence of nephrotoxicity between the 2 treatment groups; 2.6 % of the patients in 
the  caspofungin  group  versus  11.5  %  of  patients  in  the  AmBisome  group  met  the  definition  of 
nephrotoxicity, indicating that caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the occurrence of 
nephrotoxicity.  
Similarly, in this study caspofungin was superior to AmBisome with respect to the 3 other predefined 
safety  comparisons,  including  infusion-related  events,  drug-related  adverse  experiences,  and 
discontinuations due to drug-related adverse experiences.   
Cancidas-H-379-II-17

Safety  data  on  caspofungin  from  ongoing studies  and  from the postmarketing  environment are quite 
consistent  with  what  has  been  previously  reported  in  other  Phase  II  and  III  studies  within  the 
caspofungin development program. 
Thus,  in  general  caspofungin  safety  results  from  this  study  together  with  postmarketing  data  do  not 
seem to raise any new concerns, but vigilance still remains mandatory.  
2.5 
Benefit Risk assessment and conclusion 
Invasive  fungal  infections  are  an  important  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with 
neutropenia  and  cancer  chemotherapy,  with  Candida  and  Aspergillus  being  the  most  commonly 
identified pathogens. No early diagnostic procedure for establishing an accurate diagnosis of invasive 
fungal  infections  is  available,  therefore  empirical  administration  of  antifungal  agents  has  become 
standard practice in neutropenic patients who remain febrile despite adequate antibacterial therapy. A 
pre-emptive approach is currently being evaluated, using more advanced diagnostic measures such as 
PCR techniques, ELISA antigen and chest CT, but at present these tests are not standardised  for this 
use  and  there  is  no  real  consensus  for  defining  a  target  population  for  pre-emptive  therapy  yet. 
Although  the  pre-emptive  approach  is  currently  being  used  in  certain  European  centres,  empirical 
therapy is still considered relevant clinical practice.  
There are some major problems with assessing true efficacy in empirical therapy, since the indication 
should  be  based  solely  on  the  successful  treatment  of  any  fungal  infections  documented  from 
examination of specimens taken just before adding the antifungal agent. The sole inclusion criterion is 
neutropenic  fever  without  response  to  parenteral  antibiotics,  and  the  rate  of  fever  caused  by  non-
infectious causes is difficult to evaluate. Given that all patients with and without fungal infections are 
treated,  the  true  efficacy  of  the  antifungal  drug  is  difficult  to  evaluate.  The  controlled  trials  on 
empirical  antifungal  therapy  performed  so  far  have  all  used  a  non-inferiority  design  and  composite 
endpoints. However, to compare two antifungal drugs and show that they are equivalent without a well 
defined primary endpoint is not optimal. A superiority trial design would be more appropriate for new 
antifungals, as stated in the recently adopted CPMP PtC. However, at the time of the initiation of the 
caspofungin  empirical  therapy  trial  (1999),  the  prevailing  approach  for  empirical  antifungal  therapy 
studies  was  the  non-inferiority  design  using  a  delta  of  -10%.  The  CPMP  PtC  did  not  come  into 
operation  until  recently,  in  November  2003.  The  P026  study  was  modelled  on  the  earlier  large 
randomised  comparative  trials  in  empirical  therapy,  including  the  one  that  led  to  the  approval  of 
AmBisome  in  this  indication.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  CPMP  considered  that  a  superiority  trial 
cannot be considered an absolute requirement for granting this indication. The CPMP also believes, in 
accordance with the MAH’s position, that the efficacy of caspofungin in documented invasive fungal 
infections has been satisfactorily demonstrated in previous studies. 
The  response  assessment  reports  clearly  demonstrate  the  multitude  of  prognostic  factors  (e.g. 
persistent  neutropenia,  change  in  antibacterial  regimen,  pre-existing  renal  impairment,  underlying 
disease…) that might affect the outcome of all the separate secondary endpoints and thereby also the 
primary composite efficacy endpoint. All these variables are impossible to control for and contribute 
to the difficulties of assessing true efficacy of a drug in empirical therapy. A cautious attitude towards 
the results achieved in empirical antifungal trials is indeed indicated. As shown, there was a trend for 
prolonged  neutropenia  in  patients  with  baseline  infections  in  the  AmBisome  group,  favouring 
caspofungin, which likely influenced on the outcome of baseline infections.  
The MAH has responded in  many ways satisfactorily to the list of outstanding issues. Regarding the 
major  issue  of an imbalance  for persistent neutropenia  (defined as  ANC <500/µl at the  end  of study 
therapy  (EOT))  between  treatment  groups  favouring  caspofungin  in  the  “baseline  fungal  infection” 
secondary endpoint, the MAH claimed that this was due to the fact that there were more unfavourable 
responses  and a related shorter  duration  of therapy in the  AmBisome  group. This circular  reasoning 
(the  time  to  end-of-therapy  itself  depends  on  the  resolution  of  neutropenia)  cannot  be  endorsed. 
Overall, there was a clear trend for prolonged neutropenia in the AmBisome group, irrespective of the 
time  to  end-of-therapy.  However,  this  analysis  is  based  on  very  few  patients  (27  subjects  in  each 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
38/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment group, i.e. 5% of the whole population) and a reanalysis of the study with adjustment for a 
post-entry  outcome  (“persistent  neutropenia”)  is  inappropriate.  Therefore  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any 
firm conclusions.  
A similar trend in the outcome of the 7-day survival favouring caspofungin was demonstrated. Since 
the  differences  in  successful  treatment  response  for  baseline  infections  and  7-day  survival  between 
treatment groups were small and barely/not statistically significant, the superiority of caspofungin to 
AmBisome  cannot  be  claimed  for  these  two  secondary  endpoints.  However,  the  non-inferiority  of 
caspofungin to AmBisome in the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. favourable overall response for the 5-
part composition endpoint) remains unchanged. 
Regarding the requested supplementary data on possible breakthrough infections it was clarified that 
the majority of patients (56/57) had pneumonia and that only 3 of these subjects had microbiological 
data,  whereof  only  one  fulfilled  the  microbiological  criteria  for  IFI  as  defined  by  EORTC/MSG. 
Although it  can be agreed that the  occurrence  of possible infections should be  regarded  with  a  high 
level of uncertainty, and that in the setting of an empirical therapy trial in febrile neutropenic patients, 
analysis  of  documented  invasive  fungal  infections  should  be  limited  to  the  probable  and  proven 
categories,  the  higher  numbers  of  possible  breakthrough  infections  in  the  caspofungin  group  vs  the 
AmBisome group (38 vs 19 ) raises some concern.  
Data of this pivotal comparative phase III trial, P026, including more than 1000 patients, indicate that 
caspofungin  performs  similarly  to  liposomal  amphotericin  B  in  the  treatment  of  suspected  fungal 
infection  due  to  Aspergillus  and  Candida  in  patients  with  persistent  febrile  neutropenia.  Also, 
caspofungin showed similar efficacy to AmBisome for the prevention of breakthrough infections with 
no  appreciable  difference  between  groups  in  total  rates  or  in  by-pathogen  rates.  Caspofungin  has  in 
earlier  clinical  studies  convincingly  been  shown  to  be  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  refractory 
invasive  aspergillosis  and  invasive  candidiasis  in  non-neutropenic  patients.  Limited  data  in 
neutropenic patients with  documented  candidaemia as well as deep-sited Candida infections indicate 
that  caspofungin  has  similar  efficacy  in  these  patients.  In  the  P026  trial,  the  safety  profile  of 
caspofungin was demonstrated to represent an advantage compared with Ambisome.  
The indication, as proposed by the MAH, “ Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in 
febrile, neutropaenic adult patients, should be revised.  
The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the 
identity of any fungal pathogen, a fact which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore the 
CPMP decided to adopt an alternate wording, as follows: “Empirical therapy for presumed fungal 
infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients”. Together with 
this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeast and non-aspergillus moulds 
was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: “Limited data suggest that less common non-Candida 
yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin 
against these fungal pathogens has not been established.”  
Considering  all  the  above  aspects  and  the  revision  of  the  SPC  as  requested,  the  risk/benefit 
relationship is considered favourable.

2.6.2  Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” 
The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the 
identity  of  any  fungal  pathogen,  a  fact  which  is  not  supported  by  the  data  provided.  Therefore  the 
CPMP  decided  to  adopt  an  alternate  wording,  as  follows:  “Empirical  therapy  for  presumed  fungal 
infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients”. 
Cancidas-H-379-II-17

The  current  indication  for  invasive  candidasis  (IC)  is  inconsistent  with  the  extension  of  indication, 
since  it  includes  only  non-neutropenic  patients.  The  number  of  neutropenic  patients  with  IC  who 
have  received  caspofungin  has  increased  with  the  data  from  the  empirical  trial  and  now  totals  26 
patients  (14  patients  from  the  invasive  candiasis  trial  (P014)  trial  and  12  patients  from  the  current 
trial).  In  comparison  with  the  22  neutropenic  patients  who  received  AmBisome/amphotericin  B  in 
these trials, favourable response rates were slightly higher in the caspofungin group (15/26 (58%) vs 
9/22  (41%)).  It  will  read  as  follows:  “  Treatment  of  invasive  candidiasis  in  non-neutropenic  adult 
patients”. 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration” 
The  recommendation  of  a  dose  increase  of  caspofungin  to  70  mg  in  case  of  inadequate  clinical 
response cannot be endorsed due to lack of supportive data. The wording in section 4.2 of the SPC as 
proposed  by  the  MAH  is  as  follows:  “Doses  higher  than  70 mg  daily  have  not  been  adequately 
studied.” This new wording applies to the existing indications of Invasive Aspergillosis and Invasive 
Candidiasis as well as to the empirical treatment indication. 
The CPMP agreed on the wording as proposed by the MAH at the time of the application:  “Duration 
of empirical therapy should be based on the patient’s clinical response. Therapy should be continued 
500).  Patients  found  to  have  a  fungal 
until  up  to  72  hours  after  resolution  of  neutropaenia  (ANC
infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and treatment should continue for at least 7 days 
after both neutropaenia and clinical symptoms are resolved.” 
≥
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and special precautions for use” 
Together with this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeast and non-
aspergillus moulds was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: “Limited data suggest that less 
common non-Candida yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The 
efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been established.”  
The CPMP agreed on the modified wording as proposed by the MAH at the time of the application:  
“The  safety  information  on  treatment  durations  longer  than  4 weeks  is  limited,  however,  available 
data suggest that caspofungin continues to be well tolerated with longer courses of therapy (up to 162 
days).” 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
Based on the results of the empirical therapy study, adverses events were updated in this section 4.8, 
as follows: “In clinical studies, 1440 individuals received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS: 564 
febrile neutropaenic patients (empirical therapy study), 125 patients with invasive candidiasis, 72 
patients with invasive aspergillosis, 285 patients with localised Candida infections, and 394 
individuals enrolled in Phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had received 
chemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (including 39 
allogeneic transplantations). In the studies involving patients with documented Candida infections, the 
majority of the patients with invasive Candida infections had serious underlying medical conditions 
(e.g., haematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple concomitant 
medications.  Patients in the non-comparative Aspergillus study often had serious predisposing 
medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, haematologic malignancy, 
solid tumours or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications.“ 
… 
” Reported clinical and laboratory abnormalities among all patients treated with CANCIDAS (total 
989) were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation.”… 
Furthermore, tachycadia, dyspnea and sweating were added as adverse events reported.

The MAH proposed to delete the word “isolated” since there were 39 post-marketing reports of 
suspected allergic reaction of which 18 were serious. The CPMP accepted this proposal. 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
The CPMP agreed on the update of the numbers in the in vitro activity of caspofungin: 
“Caspofungin  has  in  vitro  activity  against  Aspergillus  species  (Aspergillus  fumigatus  [N = 75], 
Aspergillus  flavus  [N = 111],  Aspergillus  niger  [N = 31],  Aspergillus  nidulans  [N = 8],  Aspergillus 
terreus  [N = 52],  and  Aspergillus  candidus  [N = 3]). Caspofungin  also  has  in  vitro  activity  against 
Candida  species  (Candida  albicans  [N = 1032],  Candida  dubliniensis  [N = 100],  Candida  glabrata 
[N = 151],  Candida  guilliermondii  [N = 67],  Candida  kefyr  [N = 62],  Candida  krusei  [N = 147], 
Candida lipolytica [N = 20], Candida lusitaniae [N = 80], Candida parapsilosis [N = 215], Candida 
rugosa  [N = 1],  and  Candida  tropicalis  [N = 258]),  including  isolates  with  multiple  resistance 
transport  mutations  and  those  with  acquired  or  intrinsic  resistance  to  fluconazole,  amphotericin B, 
and 5-flucytosine.” 
Considering the great difficulties in recruiting a large number of neutropenic patients with documented 
IC,  the  CPMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  efficacy  for  caspofungin  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  to 
delete  the  restriction  of  the  IC  indication  to  non-neutropenic  patients.  Therefore,  the  paragraph  on 
Invasive Candidiasis was modified to read: “These limited data are supported by the outcome of the 
empirical therapy study.”  
≥
The CPMP agreed on the following wordings to reflect data on empirical therapy as follows: 
“Empirical Therapy in Febrile, Neutropaenic Adult Patients: A total of 1111 patients with persistent 
fever and neutropaenia were enrolled in a  clinical study and treated with either caspofungin 50 mg 
once  daily  following  a  70-mg  loading  dose  or  liposomal  amphotericin  B  3.0 mg/kg/day.  Eligible 
patients  had  received  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  or  had  undergone  hematopoietic  stem-cell 
transplantation, and presented with neutropaenia (<500 cells/mm3 for 96 hours) and fever (>38.0°C) 
96 hours of parenteral antibacterial therapy. Patients were to be treated until up 
not responding to 
to 72 hours after resolution of neutropaenia, with a maximum duration of 28 days. However, patients 
found to  have a documented fungal infection could be treated longer. If the drug was well tolerated 
but the patient’s fever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated after 5 days of therapy, the dosage 
of  study  drug  could  be  increased  to  70 mg/day  of  caspofungin  (13.3 %  of  patients  treated)  or  to 
5.0 mg/kg/day  of  liposomal  amphotericin  B  (14.3 %  of  patients  treated).There  were  1095  patients 
included  in  the  primary  Modified  Intention-To-Treat  (MITT)  efficacy  analysis  of  overall  favourable 
response; caspofungin (33.9 %) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7 %) [% difference 
0.2  (95.2 %  CI  –5.6,  6.0)].  An  overall  favourable  response  required  meeting  each  of  5  criteria: 
(1) successful  treatment  of  any  baseline  fungal  infection  (caspofungin  51.9 %  [14/27],  liposomal 
amphotericin B 25.9 % [7/27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study 
drug  or  within  7  days  after  completion  of  treatment  (caspofungin  94.8 %  [527/556],  liposomal 
amphotericin  B  95.5 %  [515/539]),  (3) survival  for  7  days  after  completion  of  study  therapy 
(caspofungin 92.6 % [515/556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2 % [481/539]), (4) no discontinuation 
from  the  study  drug  because  of  drug-related  toxicity  or  lack  of  efficacy  (caspofungin  89.7 % 
[499/556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5 % [461/539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period 
of  neutropaenia  (caspofungin  41.2 %  [229/556],  liposomal  amphotericin  B  41.4 %  [223/539]). 
Response  rates  to  caspofungin  and  liposomal  amphotericin  B  for  baseline  infections  caused  by 
Aspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7 % (5/12) and 8.3 % (1/12), and by Candida species were 
66.7 %  (8/12)  and  41.7 %  (5/12).  Patients  in  the  caspofungin  group  experienced  breakthrough 
infections  due  to  the  following  uncommon  yeasts  and  moulds:  Trichosporon  species  (1),  Fusarium 
species (1), Mucor species (1), and Rhizopus species (1).” 
Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” 
The CPMP agreed on the proposed wording to update the paragraph on elderly patients as follows:  
Cancidas-H-379-II-17  
41/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“In patients who were treated empirically or who had invasive candidiasis, a similar modest effect of 
age was seen in older patients relative to younger patients.” 
2.6.2  Package Leaflet 
The CPMP agreed on the proposed wordings to reflect the change from the SPC in the PL, as follows: 
1. What is CANCIDAS and what is it used for? 
“Persistent fever due to infection may occur following chemotherapy or medical conditions that lower 
the body’s resistance to disease by lowering counts of certain white blood cells. If the fever is not 
reduced by treatment with an antibiotic, your doctor may suspect that you have a fungal infection and 
prescribe CANCIDAS to treat it.”is added. 
4. What undesirable effects may CANCIDAS have? 
This section of the PL is udated as follows: 
“The most common side effect is fever.  
Other reported side effects include:  
•  Headache, 
• 
• 
• 
•  abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
• 
•  pain, chills, vein irritations at the infusion site (including itching, redness, discharge, 
rapid heart beat, 
flushing,  
shortness of breath, 
rash, itching, sweating, 
swelling, burning sensation, or clotting), 
•  allergic reactions (including swelling of the face and/or lips, itching, rash, sensation of 
warmth, or trouble breathing), 
swelling of the hands, ankles or feet, 
impaired liver function, 
• 
• 
•  alterations in some laboratory blood tests (including decreased red blood cell count and 
increased values of some liver and kidney tests, high calcium).” 
In  addition,  the  MAH  has  completed  the  list  of  local  representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet  in 
accordance with EMEA/QRD templates, to include the 10 accession countries. 
III. 
 CONCLUSION 
The  majority  of  the  CPMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
proposed  wordings  to  be  introduced  into  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  based  on  the 
observations and the appropriate conclusions.  
The CPMP adopted on 24 March 2004 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of 
the Community Marketing Authorisation.

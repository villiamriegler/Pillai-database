Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune 
pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (live attenuated, nasal) 
On 1 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Pandemic influenza 
vaccine H5N1 MedImmune, intended for prophylaxis against influenza in an officially declared pandemic 
situation in children and adolescents. The applicant for this medicinal product is MedImmune LLC. 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune will be available as a nasal spray (suspension). The active 
substance is a live, cold-adapted, temperature sensitive and attenuated reassortant influenza virus of the 
strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), produced in Vero cells and subsequently propagated in eggs (ATC 
code: J07BB03). The virus contained in the vaccine is able to induce protective immunity by infecting and 
replicating in cells lining the nasopharynx of the vaccine’s recipient.   
The benefit with Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) MedImmune is its ability to robustly prime naïve 
individuals against H5N1, resulting in an immune memory response that could be achieved as early as 4 
weeks post priming and last for at least 4-5 years, as detected by subsequent re-exposure to H5N1 antigens. 
Boosted immune responses lasted for up to 6 months and showed broad cross-neutralising activity against 
up to 4 different H5N1 clades. Similar results were seen with other potential pandemic strains, such as H7N9 
and H7N7.  
The most common side effects are headache and events of the upper respiratory tract including nasal 
congestion and rhinorrhoea in the adult population tested. The vaccine’s safety profile is considered similar 
to that of Fluenz Tetra (live attenuated influenza seasonal vaccine); hence decreased appetite, headache, 
nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea and malaise are expected to be very common side effects in children, and 
myalgia and pyrexia are expected to be common. 
The full indication is: "Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation in children and 
adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age. Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune 
should be used in accordance with official guidance".

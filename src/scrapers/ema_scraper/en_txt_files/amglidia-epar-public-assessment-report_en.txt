2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Neonatal diabetes is a disease of early infancy due to mutations in the genes coding for the Kir6.2 and SUR1 
subunits of the pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel which result in failure of insulin secretion. 
The prevalence of neonatal diabetes is less than 0.02 per 10,000 individuals in the EU and should be 
considered as an extremely rare disorder of genetic origin which cannot be prevented. 
Neonatal diabetes is a detectable condition that needs most often emergency treatment with IV fluid and 
insulin, the only method so far to re-establish metabolic control, and to avoid short-term risks such a 
ketoacidosis, dehydration and death in newborns and toddlers. 
Genetic testing for mutations in the genes coding for the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic beta-cell 
ATP-sensitive potassium channel remains mandatory for diagnosis of all suspected cases of neonatal 
diabetes. 
The proof of concept to use Glibenclamide oral suspension for newborns, infants and children for the 
treatment of neonatal diabetes has been established in two studies reported in 2006 (Pearson et al. NEJM, 
2006 and Babenko et al. NEJM, 2006).  
The conclusion of one of the articles (Pearson et al. NEJM, 2006) was that "Sulphonylurea therapy is safe in 
the short term for patients with diabetes caused by KCNJ11 mutations and is probably more effective than 
insulin therapy. This pharmacogenetic response to sulphonylureas may result from the closing of mutant 
KATP channels, thereby increasing insulin secretion in response to incretins and glucose metabolism."  
The conclusion of the second article (Babenko et al. NEJM, 2006) was that "Dominant mutations in ABCC8 
accounted for 12 percent of cases of neonatal diabetes in the study group. Diabetes results from a newly 
discovered mechanism whereby the basal magnesium-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of SUR1 on 
the Kir pore is elevated and blockade by sulphonylureas is preserved."  
It is therefore possible to switch from insulin injections to oral glibenclamide and to treat neonatal diabetes 
associated with an insulin secretion defect of pancreatic β-cells provided that there are insulin secreting β-
cells in the endocrine pancreas.  
Glibenclamide is an antidiabetic drug in a class of medications known as sulfonylureas and is currently 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes. In clinical practice, sulfonylureas like 
glibenclamide are administered off label, or within clinical research protocols, to treat neonatal diabetes in 
newborns/children, using commercially available glibenclamide tablets licensed for adults only. 
To render glibenclamide tablets suitable for oral intake by newborns/children, the nursing staff, under 
medical prescription, or the parents at home, must crush the tablet into small pieces and present the drug to 
the infant by mixing the fragments with a small volume of water; the mixture is then administered with an 
oral syringe. The use of such formulation is not ideal as it is rather inaccurate and can lead to errors in 
administration in new-borns and infants. 
To overcome the obvious inconvenience of this process and in view of a better compliance, as no specific oral 
glibenclamide formulation is available for the paediatric population, AMMTeK has developed an oral 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 11/60 
  
  
glibenclamide suspension presented in two strengths (0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml), adapted to be used in 
newborns, infants up to 23 months and children to replace crushed tablets of glibenclamide previously used 
off-label and long-term use of insulin, where possible for the treatment of neonatal diabetes. 
The development programme in support of the efficacy and safety of Amglidia 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml, oral 
suspension is based on both bibliographical data and data from clinical studies conducted by the applicant 
and includes:  
- two proof of concept studies (Babenko et al. NEJM, 2006 and Pearson et al. NEJM, 2006) in which 
sulfonylureas were used off-label in patients with neonatal diabetes. 
- a prospective, open-label, single-center, single arm, non-randomized, uncontrolled phase II study (GlidKir 
study, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00610038) of glibenclamide crushed Daonil® tablets including 
pharmacokinetic data; 19 patients with neonatal diabetes (age 0.1–18.5 years) were enrolled and 18 patients 
switched from insulin to SU therapy to examine improvement of neuropsychological functioning (Beltrand et 
al. Diabetes Care, 2015). 
- a bioavailability study (1AMK1/Glibentek1) comparing pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide crushed tablets 
versus glibenclamide oral suspension in healthy volunteers (Clinical study report, 2012). 
- a Phase II, single-centre, prospective, open-label, non-randomised study to evaluate tolerance and 
acceptability of glibenclamide oral suspension in 10 patients with neonatal diabetes (age 0.3 to 16.2 years) 
including pharmacokinetic data (Neogli study, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02375828). 
- Long-term follow-up safety study (Geneodia) with oral glibenclamide tablets (crushed or not) which includes 
children with neonatal diabetes treated in France since 2005 (Abstract). 
The application for Amglidia 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml, oral suspension is an Article 10(3) hybrid application. In 
the hybrid dossier, reference is also made to nonclinical and clinical documentation included in the dossier of 
the reference medicinal product (Daonil® tablets).

General information 
The chemical name of glibenclamide is 1-[[4-[2-[(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoyl)amino]ethyl]phenyl] sulfonyl]-
3-cyclohexylurea corresponding to the molecular formula C 23H28ClN23O5S. It has a relative molecular mass of 
494.00 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 Glibenclamide structure 
As there is a monograph of glibenclamide in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
glibenclamide, which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Information on the elucidation of the chemical structure of the active substance is included in the CEP. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white or almost white, crystalline powder, practically insoluble in 
water, sparingly soluble in methylene chloride, slightly soluble in ethanol (96 per cent) and in methanol. 
Glibenclamide  is achiral. 
Polymorphism has been observed for glibenclamide. Two polymorphs and two solvates of glibenclamide have 
been isolated and characterized. The solvates showed higher water solubility than polymorphs I and II. Form 
I  was  the  most  stable  and  was  selected  as  the  commercial  form.  A  third  polymorph  (form  III, 
recrystallization  from  a  mixture  of  chloroform  and  ether)  and  another  solvate  (recrystallization  from  a 
mixture  of  carbon  tetrachloride  and  chloroform)  are  described  in  the  literature.  Form  III  showed  a  higher 
solubility than form I and II and a lower melting point than form I. The authors concluded that form II and 
form III are metastable and that form I as the marketed form of the active substance is the stable form. A 
loss on drying test is systematically performed at release with the specification NMT 1.0% as described in the 
glibenclamide Ph. Eur. monograph to prevent formation of solvated forms. Glibenclamide is not hygroscopic 
and  thus  it  is  not  likely  to  absorb  water  during  storage.  Based  on  these  results,  the  active  substance  is 
present under the anhydrous polymorphic form I. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Glibenclamide is packed in polyethylene bags placed in an airtight HDPE drum. 
Specification 
The active substance is controlled according to the specification described in Table 1. These specifications are 
based on the Ph. Eur. monograph for glibenclamide. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 13/60 
  
  
 
 
 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification 
(melting point, UV and visible absorption, IR, TLC, and colour test), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying 
(Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay (titrimetry), residual solvent (GC), particle size (laser 
granulometry), and  polymorph identity (XRPD). 
The  control  tests  are  carried  out  to  comply  with  the  specifications  and  test  methods  of  the  Ph.  Eur. 
monograph.  Additional  specifications  have  been  set  for  residual  solvents  and  particle  size.  Both  additional 
methods have been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 (1 pilot and 2 commercial) scale batches confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability 
The relevant information was assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. The retest 
period of the substance is 2 years when stored in double polyethylene bags placed in an airtight HDPE drum. 
2.2.2.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The qualitative formulation of the oral suspension is presented in two concentrations, 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  active  substance  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  and  only  slightly  soluble  in  methanol.  Therefore,  the 
particle size is crucial for the performance of the finished product and its bioavailability. The active substance 
is micronized by the active substance manufacturer.  
Polymorph identity is routinely tested by the active substance manufacturer to confirm that the polymorphic 
form of the micronized active substance is form I. It is systematically re-tested upon receipt by the finished 
product manufacturer by XRPD in order to ensure that transportation has not impacted the polymorphic form. 
All  excipients  are  conventional  and  widely  used  in  oral  solutions,  and  are  well  known  pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in  section  6.1  of  the  SmPC  and  in  paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. 
A  compatibility  study  between  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  likely  to  be  used  in  the  formulation 
was  performed.  Binary  mixtures  containing  the  active  substance  and  each  excipient  inthe  ratio  of  the  most 
diluted final formula (0.6 mg/ml) were stored for 1 month at 40 °C/75% RH. After analysis by HPLC using the 
validated related substance analytical method, the results presented showed no impurity above the reporting 
threshold (0.10%). 
The matrix formula of the suspension was established during development work. This formula can be used at 
a large range of pHs without affecting its consistency, in combination with different preservatives whose anti-
microbial  activity  is  directly  dependent  on  the  pH.  Thus,  the  development  strategy  of  the  finished  product 
was  to  introduce  the  active  substance  into  this  matrix  formula  and  to  subsequently  define  the  preservative 
system  and  the  target  pH  of  the  final  product.  Then,  optimization  steps  were  launched  to  verify  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 14/60 
  
  
homogeneity  of  the  product,  its  stability  under  different  conditions,  and  to  improve  the  manufacturing 
process. 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  behaviour  of  the  active  substance  in  suspension,  one  “standard”  formulation  was 
prepared containing common compendial excipients used for this kind of pharmaceutical form. Two different 
preservatives have been tested: sodium benzoate and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (paraben).  To 
characterize  the  final  formulation  and  the  adequacy  with  the  objective  of  the  development,  different  tests 
have  been  performed:  visual  appearance  and  sedimentation  visual  observation,  microscopic  examination, 
osmolality, and taste. 
In  order  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  the  sodium  benzoate  preservative,  batches  containing  0,  0.25%  and 
0.5% were manufactured and evaluated in line with Ph. Eur. 5.1.3. The batch with no preservative was found 
to  be  contaminated  whereas  the  preservative  was  found  to  be  effective  at  the  other  2  levels.  Nonetheless, 
given the target population’s susceptibility to infection and the multi-dose container which will be opened on 
a daily basis, the higher level of preservative was selected to ensure effectiveness throughout the shelf-life. 
Instructions  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC  with  instructions  as  to  which  strength  formulation  should  be 
used  for  which  dose.  This  ensures  that  the  amount  of  sodium  benzoate  never  exceeds  the  acceptable  daily 
intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg/day. This approach was deemed acceptable. 
CHMP  also  requested  that  the  applicant  manufacture  batches  containing  only  90%  of  the  nominal  sodium 
benzoate  to  represent  the  worst  case  scenario  which  would  still  pass  the  release  specification  for  sodium 
benzoate  assay  (90-110%)  to  investigate  preservative  efficacy  over  the  proposed  shelf-life.  Two  pilot  scale 
batches were duly manufactured and stability studies instigated under long term and accelerated conditions. 
The  studies  were  on-going  at  the  time  of  CHMP  opinion  with  only  results  from  t 0  available.  Therefore,  the 
CHMP recommended that if an out of specification result is obtained at any time-point during these studies, a 
variation should immediately be submitted in order to amend the shelf-life and specification to ensure the on-
going quality of the product throughout its shelf-life. 
The  stability  of  the  formulations  containing  the  different  preservatives  was  investigated  over  15  days  at  50 
°C. The content of both preservatives and the active substance did not change during the 15 days. A freeze 
thaw  study  (three  3-4  day  cycles  at  -18  °C  and  3-4  days  at  40  °C/75%  RH)  were  performed.  After  the 
different cycles, there was no significant change in the size or shape of the active substance crystals. Sodium 
benzoate  was  selected  as the  preservative  as  paraben  is  contra-indicated  in  neoneates  and  young  children. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
Due  to  the  very  low  solubility  of  glibenclamide,  no  dissolution  method  was  initially  developed.  However,  a 
dissolution method has finally been developed and validated using two batches. The results showed that the 
method was able to discriminate batches with different viscosity. However, the CHMP recommended that the 
applicant should review the dissolution data as new batches are manufactured (including the third validation 
batch) and tighten the specification limits by post-approval variation if appropriate.  
The primary packaging is a brown glass bottle (type III) with a child-resistant closure (polypropylene screw 
cap with polyethylene capsule inside).The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Each  bottle  is  provided  with  the  following  devices:  one  1 mL  or  5 mL  graduated  oral  syringe  of  LDPE  and 
polypropylene depending on the presentation prescribed and an adaptor (LDPE) to be plugged on the bottle. 
The  medical  devices  are  CE  marked.  The  devices  have  been  tested  with  the  finished  product  (technical 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018

batches  manufactured  for  analytical  purpose)  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  2.9.27  “Uniformity  of  mass  of  delivered 
doses from multidose containers”. All the results are compliant with the Ph. Eur. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  6  main  steps.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
As  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  non-standard,  a  manufacturing  process  validation  report  has 
been  provided.  The  report  presents  the  results  from  2  batches  per  strength  of  the  finished  product.  The 
manufacturing process is the same for both dosages. The presented process validation data was considered 
acceptable. However, according to the guideline on “process validation for finished products - information and 
data to be provided in regulatory submissions,” data on a minimum of 3 production scale batches should be 
submitted. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that the third validation batch be manufactured within 1 year 
and the completed validation report be provided as soon as available. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
smell, density (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass 
of  delivered  dose  (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  of  glibenclamide  (HPLC, 
DAD/HPLC),  glibenclamide  content  (HPLC),  identification  of  sodium  benzoate  (HPLC),  sodium  benzoate 
content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), and microbiological control (Ph. Eur.). 
CHMP assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. In relation to the solubility specification, validation has been performed on two batches. 
The CHMP recommended that dissolution limits should be reconsidered in the light of dissolution data of the 
third validation batch and of the stability data generated. If warranted, the dissolution specification should be 
tightened by submission of the appropriate variation. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results (except for dissolution data) are provided for 3 commercial scale batches per strength 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 commercial scale batches per strength of the finished product stored upside down for up 
to  36  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  using  the  same  analytical  methods  as  at  release.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed under long term and accelerated conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  This  study  showed  that  unknown  impurities  were  growing  mainly  in  the 
finished product after a sun test exposure of 11 hours. These results confirm that the product is sensitive to 
light. 
An in-use stability study has been performed to demonstrate that both strengths are stable for 30 days under 
the  conditions  likely  to  be  encountered  during  routine  use  of  the  finished  product.  Samples  were  tested  for 
container  content  interaction,  assay  of  glibenclamide,  assay  of  related  impurities  of  glibencalmide,  and 
determination of microbial contamination. The amount of glibenclamide and the impurity level in the sample 
remains stable during the study. This study has demonstrated that both suspensions are stable for 30 days 
after the first opening. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months, with the bottle kept in the outer 
carton in order to protect from light as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. In addition, the 
product should be used within 30 days of first opening, keeping the bottle tightly closed between uses. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product which the applicant has committed to resolving post-approval. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.5.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation. 
-  Considering  the  current  absence  of  particle  size  data  during  shelf-life,  the  applicant  should  keep  the 
proposed acceptance criteria  and reassess them at the end of the stability study (at the latest), tightening 
them if necessary. Until two years long-term data are available, the applicant should perform a full re-test on 
each active substance batch just before using it to manufacture the finished product in order to check that all 
the tests are compliant with the current proposed specification. 
- The third validation batch should be manufactured in a reasonable time (within 1 year) and the completed 
validation report will be provided as soon as available. 
-  If  an  out  of  specification  result  is  observed  at  any  time-point  during  the  stability  studies  with  batches 
manufactured with 90% of sodium benzoate, the applicant should immediately submit a variation in order to 
amend the shelf-life and specification to ensure the on-going quality of the product throughout its shelf-life.  
-  The  applicant  should  provide  new  dissolution  data  as  new  batches  become  available  (including  the  third 
validation batch) and consider the current proposed dissolution limit in the light of the dissolution data to the 
third batch and of the stability data generated. If warranted, the dissolution specification should be tightened 
by submission of the appropriate variation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
CHMP assessment report

aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product, where appropriate. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-
clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics  
Sulfonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide) are used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes 
mellitus. The hypoglycaemic effect of sulfonylureas is due to a stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic 
β-cells via blockade of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel (Sturgess et al. 1985; Trube et al. 1986; Zünkler 
et al. 1988a; Panten et al. 1989; review in Panten et al. 1996). The KATP channel couples cellular metabolism 
to membrane excitability. The KATP channel has first been described in guinea pig and rabbit cardiac myocytes 
(Trube and Hescheler 1984; Noma 1983) and later in pancreatic ß-cells (Ashcroft et al. 1984; Cook and Hales 
1984; Rorsman and Trube 1985) but also in other tissues such as specific regions of the brain, skeletal and 
smooth muscles. In the pancreatic ß-cell the KATP channel regulates insulin secretion stimulated by nutrients 
like glucose; its metabolism in the pancreatic ß-cell mitochondria leads to ATP formation at the expense of 
ADP; this increased cytosolic ATP-to-ADP ratio results in closure of the KATP channels and membrane 
depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels followed by increases in intracellular Ca2+, 
which then triggers the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules (review in Ashcroft and Rorsman 1991). The 
KATP channels are octamers of four pore-forming subunits of the inward rectifier Kir6.0 subfamily that includes 
Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (Inagaki et al. 1995) and four regulatory SUR subunits that include SUR1, SUR2A and 
SUR2B (Aguilar-Bryan et al. 1995). The SUR subunit contains the binding sites for sulfonylureas. The 
pancreatic ß-cell KATP channel is formed by Kir6.2/SUR1 subunits (Inagaki et al. 1995) and Kir6.2/SUR2A 
form the cardiac KATP channel (Inagaki et al. 1996). ATP inhibits the pancreatic ß-cell and cardiac myocyte 
KATP channel via binding to the Kir6.2 subunit; in pancreatic ß-cells the presence of SUR1 can enhance the 
blocking action of ATP (Tucker et al. 1997). 
Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding either Kir6.2 (KCNJ11; Gloyn et al. 2004) or SUR1 (ABCC8; 
Proks et al. 2006; Babenko et al. 2006) induce neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) via hyperpolarization of the 
pancreatic ß-cell resulting in reduced insulin secretion. The mutations increase KATP channel activity either via 
reducing block of ATP at the Kir6.2 subunit or by enhancing Mg-nucleotide stimulation at the SUR1 subunit 
(Koster et al. 2005). Transgenic mouse models carrying ATP-insensitive mutant KATP channels leading to the 
development of NDM have also been generated (Koster et al. 2000; Remedi et al. 2009). Neonatal diabetes is 
defined by hyperglycaemia within the first 6 - 9 months of life which is either permanent requiring lifelong 
therapy and is associated with Kir6.2 mutations or transient for which relapses can occur in adolescence and 
which is associated with SUR1 mutations. 20 - 30 % of patients also have neurological symptoms such as 
mental or motor developmental delay, muscle hypotonia, hyperactivity and epilepsy (DEND syndrome: 
developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes). There is a correlation between the open probability of 
KATP channels and disease severity: mutations inducing the highest open probability of KATP channels located 
in the cerebral nervous system lead to the most severe form of NDM with neurological symptoms (DEND 
syndrome; Clark et al. 2010); in the absence of epilepsy, the syndrome is called intermediate DEND 
syndrome. Since mutations in Kir6.2 lead to higher open probabilities of the KATP channel compared to those 
of SUR1, most patients with the DEND syndrome have mutations in Kir6.2. Since the discovery of activating 
CHMP assessment report

mutations in KATP channels as the major mechanism underlying neonatal diabetes mellitus, most patients 
have been switched from insulin to sulfonylurea treatment (Pearson et al. 2006; Babenko et al. 2006). 
Mutations in either Kir6.2 or SUR1 subunits leading to NDM impair sulfonylurea-induced block of KATP 
channels to varying extent. Therefore, patients with NDM require higher sulfonylurea doses compared to 
adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (reviews in Ashcroft and Rorsman 2013; Proks 2013). Transfer 
from insulin to sulfonylurea treatment of NDM was found to be best predicted by the in-vitro response of the 
specific Kir6.2 mutation to sulfonylurea-induced KATP current block and by the duration of diabetes (Babiker et 
al. 2015). Hyperglycaemia has glucotoxic effects leading to pancreatic ß-cell dysfunction, reduced ß-cell mass 
and insulin deficiency; therefore, the ability to treat NDM patients with sulfonylureas is inversely correlated 
with the duration of the disease and NDM patients should be treated with sulfonylureas as early as possible 
after diagnosis. In a mouse model of KATP channel-dependent NDM, hyperglycaemia and subsequent loss of 
ß-cells can both be prevented by chronic sulfonylurea treatment which induces permanent remission of NDM 
(Remedi et al. 2011). Furthermore, in NDM patients treated with sulfonylureas, there is a reduction in the 
required dose of sulfonylureas with time (review in Nichols and Remedi 2012). On the other hand, chronic 
glibenclamide treatment has been demonstrated to induce loss of insulin secretory capacity. 
Safety pharmacology  
Concerning safety pharmacology, the cardiovascular safety and possible neurotoxic effects of sulfonylureas 
are under discussion. 
The study carried out by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) in the early 1970s suggested that 
the use of tolbutamide was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
diabetes mellitus and co-existing coronary heart disease (University Group Diabetes Program 1970), which 
might be explained by sulfonylurea-induced block of cardiac KATP channels. Block of cardiac myocyte KATP 
channels under ischaemic conditions might either result in antiarrhythmic effects by preventing re-entry 
arrhythmias, or might lead to deleterious effects by augmenting the ischaemic damage or by abolishing 
ischaemic preconditioning. However, glibenclamide is sensitive (~ 10x) for the pancreatic ß-cell SUR1 vs. the 
cardiac myocyte SUR2A subunit, and glibenclamide did not alter cardiovascular mortality in the UKPDS study 
(1998). Therefore, from both a pre-clinical and clinical point of view, glibenclamide seems to be devoid of 
cardiac effects mediated via block of cardiac myocyte KATP channels. Glibenclamide oral suspension is 
administered at relatively higher doses in ND patients compared to adults, which potentially could affect 
cardiac SUR2A. However, due to the extreme rarity of ischemic heart disease in newborns and children this is 
considered to be not relevant. 
KATP channels consisting of Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits are expressed in both pancreatic ß-cells and in the 
brain, and an activation of KATP channels has a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischaemia. In streptozotocin-
induced diabetic mice subjected to cerebral artery occlusion, the administration of tolbutamide increased 
neuronal injury, and a meta-analysis indicated that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with 
sulfonylureas have an increased risk of stroke (Liu et al. 2016). On the other hand, in the brain SUR1 is a 
regulatory subunit for the pore-forming Trpm4 subunit of a non-selective cation channel (NCCa-ATP), which is 
expressed under conditions of central nervous system injury (ischaemia). Opening of NCCa-ATP channels during 
cerebral ischaemia is depolarizing and is involved in edema formation, and in animal models of stroke 
glibenclamide has demonstrated neuroprotective effects (reduction of cerebral edema, infarct volume and 
mortality; Simard et al. 2006; review in Simard et al. 2012). Therefore, sulfonylureas have both detrimental 
and beneficial affects under conditions of cerebral stroke. Since SUR1 in combination with Kir6.2 has higher 
sulfonylurea affinity compared to SUR1 in association with Trpm4 and sulfonylureas are trapped within the 
CHMP assessment report

Page 20/60 
  
  
ischaemic brain, it was concluded that sulfonylurea treatment might contribute to an increased risk for stroke 
in the diabetic population (commentary by Parkinson and Hatch 2016). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following oral administration of glibenclamide, the extent of absorption is 75 % in rats and > 90 % in rabbits 
and dogs (Kellner et al. 1969). In humans after oral administration of 5 mg glibenclamide, a Cmax value of 90 
nM was obtained (Rupp et al. 1969). Glibenclamide is a substrate for human organic anion-transporting 
polypeptide OATP-B, which is responsible for its uptake on the luminal membrane of intestinal epithelial cells 
(Satoh et al. 2005). 
Glibenclamide is a weak acid (pKa value of 6.3) and is highly lipophilic (partition coefficient between octanol 
and water for the un-dissociated form of 94; Panten et al. 1989). Taking an extent of plasma protein binding 
of > 99 % into account, the therapeutically effective free plasma concentration of glibenclamide is < 10 nM 
(Panten et al. 1989). In all species tested (rats, rabbits and dogs) uptake into the brain was low (Kellner et 
al. 1969; Kaiser and Forist 1975). After s.c. administration, glibenclamide was not detectable in the brain of 
rats and after intracranioventricular administration of glibenclamide, glibenclamide was rapidly removed from 
the brain; the authors raise doubt whether the glibenclamide concentrations in the brain of DEND patients 
treated with p.os glibenclamide is high enough to inhibit neuronal KATP channel activity (Lahmann et al. 
2015). 
Glibenclamide crosses the placenta of pregnant rats (Sivan et al. 1995) and mice (Shuster et al. 2014), but 
transport via breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) from the fetus to the mother limits the fetal distribution 
of glibenclamide in the pregnant mouse (Zhou et al. 2008) and in the perfused rat placenta (Cygalova et al. 
2009). In humans glibenclamide is also actively transported via BCRP from the fetus to the mother and is not 
detectable in the human fetus (Kraemer et al. 2006; Pollex et al. 2008). In breast-feeding women given oral 
doses of 5 - 10 mg glibenclamide, no glibenclamide was detected in breast milk (Feig et al. 2005). 
Glibenclamide inhibits p-Glycoprotein and is a substrate for this transporter (Golstein et al. 1999). 
The main metabolites in humans are the 4-trans (M1) and 3-cis (M2) hydroxyl derivatives (Rupp et al. 1969); 
both are also found in the rabbit, whereas only metabolite M2 is found in rats and dogs. Therefore, regarding 
drug metabolism, the rabbit most closely resembles humans. Both metabolites have pharmacological effects 
which are lower compared to the parent substance (Rydberg et al. 1994). 
In the human liver, glibenclamide is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 iso-enzyme CYP3A4, and to a 
minor extent by CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 (Naritomi et al. 2004; van Giersbergen et al. 2002; 
Zharikova et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2010). The CYP iso-enzymes in neonates and children are sufficiently 
developed in order to metabolize glibenclamide in a similar manner as in adults. 
Elimination half-lives are 1.4 - 2.8 h in rats, 7.4 - 8.6 h in rabbits, 3.7 - 4.3 h in dogs and about 4.8 h in 
humans; values for clearance are 0.15 - 0.25 ng/ml in rats, 0.56 - 0.74 ng/ml in rabbits and 0.28 - 0.52 
ng/ml in dogs. Dogs and rats excrete 90 % of the dose in faeces via biliary secretion, whereas both in rabbits 
and in humans 50 % of the dose is excreted in both faeces and urine, respectively (Kellner et al. 1969; 
Kaiser and Forist 1975; Rupp et al. 1969).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The acute toxicity of glibenclamide is low after oral administration (LD50 values > 10 g/kg in mice, rats, 
rabbits, guinea-pigs and dogs). In repeated dose toxicity studies with oral administration of glibenclamide, 
effects on pancreatic ß-cells were observed (enlargement of the islets of Langerhans with irregularly 
configured islets and reduction in pancreatic β-cell granulation in rats, ß-cell exhaustion as indicated by 
depletion of insulin-containing granules in rabbits; Hebold et al. 1969; Mizukami et al. 1969 and Webster et 
al. 1975).  
Available data of in vitro and in vivo studies do not show any evidence for genotoxicity of glibenclamide. 
After oral administration for 18 months in rats and for 2 years in mice, no carcinogenic effects of 
glibenclamide were observed. 
Glibenclamide did not affect male and female fertility in rats and mice. When orally administered during 
organogenesis glibenclamide did not induce any teratogenicity in rats, mice and rabbits, respectively. 
Glibenclamide administration throughout gestation and lactation did not affect litter size, birth weights and 
viability of the F1-generation in rats and mice.  
No juvenile toxicity study was conducted. This is in line with the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) 
submitted for this product, in which it was argued that nonclinical safety could be assessed on the basis of 
the existing published data, without the need for further studies. A positive opinion was given by the 
Paediatric Committee on 19 July 2013, with final CHMP Decision (Decision N° P/0209/2013) on 3 September 
2013. Concerns raised during the CHMP assessment of the marketing authorisation application, such as age 
dependent maturation of the metabolic systems relevant for glibenclamide and the development of the blood-
brain barrier were adequately addressed by the applicant. Since clinical data in the paediatric population are 
already available, no non-clinical studies were requested by the CHMP.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Several pharmacology studies published in high-impact journals clearly demonstrate the effect of 
glibenclamide in NDM caused by activating mutations in pancreatic ß-cell KATP channels. A clear correlation 
between the in-vitro sensitivity of mutated pancreatic ß-cell KATP channels towards sulfonylurea-induced block 
and the effectiveness of sulfonylureas for the treatment of NDM was found. The Applicant has provided a 
comprehensive list of mutations in genes encoding for Kir6.2 and SUR1 leading to NDM, the in-vitro 
sensitivity of these mutations towards sulfonylurea-induced KATP current block, and the responses of patients 
carrying these mutations to sulfonylurea treatment. Functional in-vitro data are not necessary for 
determining the therapeutic dose in clinical practice because this can be done by titration of glibenclamide 
according to blood glucose level. However, these data  provide a strong rationale that treating patients 
carrying KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations with glibenclamide is a suitable approach. 
Concerning the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide, the blood-brain-permeability of glibenclamide is under 
scientific discussion, although some published data suggest effectiveness of glibenclamide in NDM patients 
with neurological symptoms (iDEND and DEND syndromes).  
The toxicology studies of glibenclamide were performed several decades ago, but due to the wide clinical 
experience with glibenclamide no further studies are required. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Amglidia was provided and was accepted by 
the CHMP. Additional non-clinical studies were not considered necessary by the CHMP. 
The discovery that gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of the pancreatic ß-cell 
KATP channel cause NDM and that the affected children can be switched from insulin to sulfonylurea therapy 
is a milestone in the field of diabetes mellitus. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for an oral suspension containing glibenclamide. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioavailability study with cross-over design under 
fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study. 
Furthermore, a tolerance and acceptability study was conducted, and bibliographical data were submitted. 
GCP

Conclusion of Bioavailability Study (1AMK1/Glibentek1) 
When glibenclamide suspensions were administered in 18 healthy male subjects, glibenclamide plasma 
concentrations peaked 0.5 hour earlier than those observed with a crushed Daonil tablet (median value of 2.5 
hours post-dose versus 3.00 hours post-dose). Mean plasma peak Cmax values were similar for the two 
suspensions, with values of 201.71±71.43 ng/mL for the 30 mg/5mL suspension and 206.93±67.33 ng/mL 
for the 3 mg/5 ml suspension. These values were approximately 40% higher than those obtained for the 
crushed tablet (148.34±46.74 ng/mL). 
Exposures were similar for the two suspension dosages (AUC0-∞ values of 1120.9 ±400.5 ng.h/mL and 
1172.3±422.0 ng.h/mL for the 30 mg/5 mL and 3 mg/5 mL suspensions, respectively), and higher than the 
exposure observed after Daonil administration. Relative bioavailability was 121.6% for the 3 mg/5 mL

formulation and 114.1% for the 30 mg/5 mL formulation (see Appendix 14.4.2.2.) when compared to the 
Daonil crushed tablets. 
Elimination half-lives were similar for the two suspensions (close to 8 hours) and a little shorter than those 
observed with Daonil crushed tablets (10.45 hours).

Treatment 
At inclusion (Day 0, D0), patients were all treated with the classical form of glibenclamide (tablet or crushed 
tablet). Two to 4 blood samples for the determination of glibenclamide concentration were drawn for each 
patient at pre-dose (T0) and sparsely during the first four hours after drug administration.  
After 1 month, the switch was made to the glibenclamide oral suspension formulation and at month 2 (M2), 
another pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted.  
Pharmacokinetic Results 
A total of 10 patients with 42 concentration time points were available for analysis: 
- 24 concentrations for the solid formulation (glibenclamide tablets) 
- 18 concentrations for the liquid formulation (glibenclamide oral suspension) 
From the 10 patients available, 7 had concentrations before and after the switch (i.e., for both formulations).

Conclusion of NEOGLI study 
Individual pharmacokinetic parameters after administration of glibenclamide tablets or oral glibenclamide 
suspension were assessed in the NEOGLI study.  
Due to the extreme rarity of the condition, the number of patients included in the NEOGLI study was very 
limited. From the 10 paediatric patients available, 7 had concentrations before and after the switch, i.e. for 
both formulations. Different daily doses were administered with a median dose of 3.81 mg/day (ranging from 
1.2 to 22.5 mg/day) for the tablets and a median dose of 1.23 mg/day (ranging from 0 to 3.5 mg/day) for 
the glibenclamide oral suspension formulation.  
When the child is on stable dose of glibenclamide tablets, the starting dose of glibenclamide suspension 
should be reduced, and given with the same numbers of intake per day as it was done in the pivotal NEOGLI 
study; a starting dose reduction for the suspension, as compared to glibenclamide tablets is required due to 
the higher bioavailability of the glibenclamide suspension. Subsequently dose adjustment as described in 
SmPC Section 4.2 Posology should be applied. 
The presented PK results of the NEOGLI study are highly variable and rather descriptive due to the limited 
number of patients and different daily doses used. No further statistical and clinical meaningful conclusion 
can be drawn. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
Mechanism of action 
The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (or KATP channel) is a type of potassium channel that is gated by 
intracellular nucleotides, ATP and ADP. ATP-sensitive potassium channels are composed of Kir6.x-type 
subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Of particular importance here are the KATP channels in 
pancreatic ß-cells (Kir6.2/SUR1). In vascular myocytes KATP is Kir6.1/SUR2B. The KATP in cardiac and 
skeletal myocytes is assumed to be predominantly Kir6.2/SUR2A while the dominating KATP in neuronal 
cells is Kir6.2/SUR1 (= ß-cell-type). 
Sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide work by binding to and inhibiting the ATP-sensitive potassium channels 
(KATP) in pancreatic ß-cells. This inhibition causes cell membrane depolarization, provoking opening of 
voltage-dependent calcium channels. This results in an increase in intracellular calcium in the ß-cell and 
subsequent stimulation of insulin release. 
Glibenclamide has an approximately 10-20 times higher binding affinity to the pancreatic than to the 
cardiovascular KATP-channels (Quast et al. 2004). 
A model of action of sulphonylurea on β-cells expressing mutations in the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP 
channel has been proposed by Pearson (Pearson et al, 2006) and is presented below. The mechanism is 
applicable on mutations of the SUR1 subunit as well.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The 1AMK1/GlibenTek1 study was performed to compare the relative bioavailability of single oral 
administration in fasted conditions of oral suspensions of glibenclamide (0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml) with oral 
crushed Daonil® tablets (non-micronized) in healthy male adult volunteers. This study allowed to determine 
the starting dose when a child is transferred from off label use crushed Daonil® non-micronized tablets to the 
glibenclamide oral suspension; when the child is on a stable dose of crushed glibenclamide tablets (non-
micronized), the starting dose of glibenclamide suspension should be decreased by 18% for the 0.6 mg/ml 
formulation and by 12 % for the 6 mg/ml, respectively, with the same numbers of intake per day. 
The presented PK results of the NEOGLI study are highly variable and rather descriptive due to the limited 
number of patients and different daily doses used. No further statistical and clinically meaningful conclusions 
can be drawn from the NEOGLI study. 
The pharmacodynamics and especially the mechanism of action of sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide is well 
understood, providing a sound rationale for the treatment of children with NDM due to mutations in the β-cell 
ATP-sensitive potassium channel with Amglidia. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology and PK/PD approach of this Article 10.3 hybrid application is considered acceptable 
in view of the extreme rare disease of neonatal diabetes. 
A higher bioavailability was found for the oral suspension compared to glibenclamide crushed tablets (non-
micronized). The dosing recommendations (“the starting dose of glibenclamide suspension should be 
decreased by 18% for the 0.6 mg/mL formulation and by 12 % for the 6 mg/mL, respectively, with the same 
numbers of intake per day.”) given in the proposed SmPC adequately reflect this finding. However, 
micronized and non-micronized glibenclamide tablets are available in the EU member states with the 
micronized formulation providing seemingly better absorption of glibenclamide. Therefore, the starting dose 
identified for switching patients from non-micronized glibenclamide to Amglidia cannot easily be transferred 
to the non-micronised formulation. For the latter, no switching data are available and thus the conversion 
rate between micronized tablets and the suspension has not been established. This issue is appropriately 
reflected in the product information. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of glibenclamide oral suspension in the treatment of ND is supported by bibliographical data and 
an efficacy, tolerability and acceptability study in 10 patients with ND (NEOGLI).  
Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare genetic disorder occurring in around 1/90000 to 1/260 000 live 
births characterised by diabetes that presents within the first 6 months of life and which may be either 
permanent (PNDM) or transient (TNDM). Considerable overlap occurs between the two groups, so that TNDM 
cannot be distinguished from PNDM based on clinical features. Newborns with NDM associated with a defect 
of β-cell function present hyperglycaemia, failure to thrive, as well as dehydration, ketoacidosis, and coma, 
and they require exogenous insulin therapy to obtain metabolic control and avoid death. 
Approximately 50% of cases of neonatal diabetes are due to gain-of-function mutations in the genes that 
encode the pore-forming (KCNJ11) or regulatory (ABCC8) subunits of the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 31/60 
  
  
(KATP) channel. In 
hypotonia are also found, a condition termed intermediate DEND (iDEND) syndrome. About 3% of patients 
30% of these patients, neurological symptoms such as developmental delay and muscle 
∼
also experience epilepsy (DEND syndrome, defined as developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes). 
More than 50 Kir6.2 variations and more than 70 SUR1 variations associated with NDM have been reported. 
The variants V59M, R201C and R201H of Kir6.2 are the most frequently observed mutations of KATP-channels 
leading to NDM. Though there is a correlation between the certain amino acid exchange and severity of the 
syndrome (TNDM, PNDM, iDEND and DEND) no one to one association is observed. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
No dose response studies were conducted. In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus the daily dose of 
glibenclamide is up to 15 mg.  
In the initial studies with paediatric patients with NDM a titration protocol was used:  
The glibenclamide dose is increased daily by 0.2 mg per kg per day in two divided doses. As the dose is 
increased it is usually possible to reduce and then stop the insulin dose. This reduction in insulin is achieved 
after the first day by the use of only short acting insulin enabling rapid titration of insulin dose depending on 
the pre-meal glucose. The finding of pre-meal capillary glucose values are < 7 mmol per litre either pre- 
breakfast and or before the evening meal is taken as an indication to reduce the insulin dose (usually by 50% 
of the normal pre-meal insulin dose) and keep the glibenclamide dose unchanged. However, if subsequent 
pre-meal capillary blood glucose values are >7 mmol per litre then glibenclamide dose titration could be 
recommenced. 
In Pearson, 2006 a graph with the sulfonylurea doses for 12 patients who had switched from insulin to 
sulfonylurea therapy is shown.  
Figure 5 
The doses required are high when calculated on a per kg body weight basis compared with adults with type 2 
diabetes, typically needing around 0.5mg/kg/d of glibenclamide, although doses as high as 2.3 mg/kg/d have 
been occasionally reported . When compared with Kir6.2 patients, SUR1 patients needed lower doses of 
sulfonylureas after transfer (0.26 vs. 0.45 mg/kg/day). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 32/60 
  
  
 
A titration and dosing regimen based on these experiences has been proposed by the applicant. The proposed 
starting dose of 0.2 mg/ kg/ day has been used in the published studies and is considered to be effective. As 
appropriate during treatment with any hypoglycaemic agent, the doses of glibenclamide will be adapted by 
titration in each individual patient. 
Many patients have been able to progressively reduce the dose of sulfonylurea after transition while 
maintaining good glycaemic control.  
Treatment induction includes analyses of C-peptide. An increase in C-peptide after start of sulfonylurea 
therapy might be a meaningful guide for estimating the response of the patient. However, this is still in the 
domain of research and cannot yet be a recommended parameter to be used in clinical practice. 
Summary of main efficacy results 
NDM, diagnosed within the first 3 months of life, is a rare condition occurring in around 1/90000 to 1/260 
000 live births. The clinical features are specific and different from the usual diabetes mellitus in children 
(type 1 auto-immune diabetes mellitus). Neonatal diabetes (ND) is associated with a defect of β-cell function. 
The three major genetic anomalies linked to neonatal diabetes mellitus are chromosome 6 anomaly, KATP-
channel mutations or insulin gene mutations. Transient neonatal diabetes resolves by a median of 12 weeks 
and is frequently associated with an abnormality of the chromosome region 6q24. In contrast, permanent 
neonatal diabetes requires (insulin) treatment for life.  
The physiological importance of KATP channels in insulin secretion was established 30 years ago. At 
substimulatory glucose concentrations, K+ efflux through open KATP channels maintains the β-cell membrane 
at a hyperpolarized potential of around -70 mV, which keeps voltage-gated Ca2+ channels closed. Elevation of 
the blood glucose concentration increases glucose uptake and metabolism by the β-cell, producing changes in 
cytosolic nucleotide concentrations that cause KATP channel closure. This leads to a membrane depolarization 
that opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels initiating β-cell electrical activity and Ca2+ influx, and the subsequent 
rise in [Ca2+]i triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. 
Approximately 50% of cases of neonatal diabetes are due to gain-of-function mutations in the genes that 
encode the pore-forming (KCNJ11) or regulatory (ABCC8) subunits of the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium 
(KATP) channel leading to dysfunctional KATP channel and.  
Prior to the discovery that NDM can be caused by mutations in the KATP channel, many patients were 
assumed to be suffering from early-onset type 1 diabetes. Accordingly they were treated with insulin 
injections. Recognition that these patients actually possess gain of function mutations in KATP channel genes 
rapidly led to a switch to sulphonylurea treatment. To date, many patients with NDM caused by mutations in 
Kir6.2 or SUR1 have been successfully transferred to sulphonylureas. This results in improved glycaemic 
control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or even fewer hypoglycaemic events and a simpler 
medication regime. Approximately 90% of patients with activating mutations in the KATP channel genes can 
be transferred from insulin onto sulfonylurea tablets. 
Studies have established that ~20% to 30 % of patients with mutations in KATP genes have abnormalities of 
the standard neurological evaluation ranging from mild to severe developmental delay. The concomitant 
presence of treatment resistant epilepsy and muscle weakness is known as developmental delay, epilepsy 
and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome; intermediate DEND is a less severe phenotype without epilepsy. 
However, appropriate testing methods detected developmental impairments in >70% of patients with KATP 
gene mutations. Several observations support a direct effect of the KATP-channel mutations on the central 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 33/60 
  
  
nervous system. These impairments adversely affect academic performance, social functioning, and quality of 
life. Sulfonylurea (SU) therapy may improve such neurological impairments since KATP channels are found in 
many tissues, including the brain, and play a role in membrane polarization and cell functions. It has been 
reported that SU therapy in neonatal diabetes secondary to mutations in potassium-channel subunits 
produces measurable improvements in neuropsychomotor impairments, which are greater in younger 
patients (Beltrand et al. 2015). The observation that glibenclamide most probably does not enter the CNS, 
the selectivity of glibenclamide for SUR1 and the expression pattern of SUR1 being prominent only in the 
pancreatic ß-cells and the brain contradict this assumption. Therefore, the extent to which neurological 
features respond to glibenclamide is uncertain. A study in France with 18 patients suggests that SU therapy 
improves neurodevelopmental parameters in patients with neonatal diabetes owing to potassium-channel 
subunit mutations and acts via a central mechanism (GlidKir-study, Beltrand et al. 2015). However this study 
was uncontrolled due to ethical reasons. Similar observations were reported by others (Busiah et al. 2013, 
Proks 2013). The improvements have been greater in younger patients.  
To date, available functional studies (Hattersley and Ashcroft 2005) show that increase in channel activity 
produced by mutations in SUR1 is smaller than that caused by Kir6.2 mutations. This may explain the 
relative high incidence of TNDM than PNDM among patients with ABCC8 mutations as well as why most 
patients with DEND syndrome (>90%) have mutations in Kir6.2. Knowledge of the specific mutation can help 
predict whether successful transfer to sulfonylureas is likely. In addition to the specific mutation shorter 
diabetes duration is associated with successful transfer to insulin independence. Genetic testing is considered 
mandatory in all cases of NDM; however, sulfonylurea treatment before such results are available may be 
considered due to the potential benefits. 
About 50% of type 2 diabetic patients treated with glibenclamide experience a severe deterioration of 
metabolic control within 6 years of therapy initiation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the 
pathophysiology observed in patients with type 2 diabetes is strikingly different from that in individuals with 
NDM due to KATP-channel mutations. Long-term data arguing for a persistent beneficial effect of SU in NDM 
are very limited. In 11 patients with KCNJ11-associated PNDM, retained HbA1c control with SU for more than 
57 month was reported (Iafusco et al. 2011). The sulfonylurea dose (mg kg−1 day−1) was progressively 
reduced in all these cases. Additional preliminary data suggest that efficacy is maintained for at least 10 
years (GENEODIA study, Hoarau et al. 2016). 
In the agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP), the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) requested that data on 
the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide oral suspensions be collected in the “Acceptability and tolerance study” 
(NEOGLI study) in which children treated for NDM were switched from tablets or crushed glibenclamide 
tablets to the glibenclamide suspension. 
The NEOGLI study has been submitted to further support the current application. The NEOGLI study was a 
phase 2 study performed at the Necker University Hospital, a public hospital for children in Paris and involved 
10 paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with neonatal diabetes caused by a genetic 
mutation of KCNJ11 or ABCC8. 
At inclusion (M0), all patients were treated with the classical form of glibenclamide (tablet or crushed tablet). 
After 1 month (M1), they were switched to the glibenclamide oral suspension formulation. At visits M1, M2 
(after 2 months), and M4 (after 4 months), patients were hospitalized for clinical and laboratory 
examinations 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 34/60 
  
  
Ten patients (7 boys) with KCNJ11 mutations, median age 2.7 years (0.3 to 16.2), median duration of 
glibenclamide therapy 2.3 years (0.01 to 11.3) were included. There were 6 children younger than 5 years 
old and 4 children over 5 years old. 
After switching from glibenclamide tablets to glibenclamide oral suspension, there was no deterioration in 
glycaemic control as evident from the similar serum HbA1c (6.48 vs 6.1% at Visits M0 and M4, respectively; 
p=0.076) and serum fructosamine (283.4 vs 271.2 μmol/L at Visits M0 and M4, respectively; p=0.552) 
concentrations. 
None of patients experienced deterioration in glycaemic control, defined as an increase of HbA1c by >0.5% 
and exceeding 5.6% in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤  5.6% or an increase of HbA1c by >0.5% in patients 
with baseline HbA1c >5.6%. 
The NEOGLI study also showed that - according to the hedonic scale assessment – the 6 children younger 
than 5 years old positively rated the acceptability of glibenclamide oral suspension. Five out of 6 parents of 
younger children preferred the suspension over the tablets. All 4 older children and their parents preferred 
the tablets over the suspension. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Glibenclamide is in clinical use for more than 40 years in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. With this 
application a new oral suspension of glibenclamide is introduced for the treatment of NDM in children. The 
aim is to avoid the currently practised off-label use of crushed glibenclamide tablets. 
This hybrid application is supported by data published in literature as well as by a distinct study performed in 
ten patients with NDM (NEOGLI) aiming at demonstration of efficacy, safety and acceptability of the 
glibenclamide suspension, which was designed in line with the recommendations of the PDCO (EMEA-001324-
PIP01-12-M01).  
In the evaluation of clinical benefit, the concept of targeting the underlying pathophysiology of NDM with 
glibenclamide is considered of key importance. This subtype of NDM is originating from overactive KATP-
channels due to gene mutations. This overactivity can be treated specifically with the KATP-channel blocker 
glibenclamide.  
Efficacy parameters reported in literature and investigated in the NEOGLI study focussed on 1) the 
investigation of glycemic control (HbA1c) after switching from insulin to glibenclamide (crushed) tablets or 
from glibenclamide crushed tablets to glibenclamide oral suspension 2) neurodevelopmental aspects and 3) 
the acceptability of the new formulation by infants and care givers. 
The proof of concept in humans and especially in children for the use of oral glibenclamide in the treatment of 
NDM has been established in the years from 2004 to 2006 in several publications. Subsequently, many 
patients have now been transferred to sulfonylurea drugs (off label use). Successful transfer from insulin to 
glibenclamide was described in the literature for more than 200 patients. The response rate of NDM 
originating from overactive KATP-channels due to gene mutations has been described to be about 90%, 
depending on the type of the mutation. There is some evidence that a shorter diabetes duration is associated 
with a more successful transfer to sulfonylureas. Summarizing the data in the literature, HbA1c values fell 
from ~8 % before transition to ~6% with SU therapy. The doses of SU required were high (typically 0.2 - 0.5 
mg/kg/d of glibenclamide) when compared to doses used in adults with type 2 diabetes. The glibenclamide 
dose needed depended on the type of the mutation and the age of the patient at the time of the transfer, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 35/60 
  
  
with higher doses required at higher age. Frequently, a decrease of the dose (in mg/kg/d) required for 
maintenance of glycemic control has been observed with continuing SU-therapy. Only limited data on long 
term efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy of NDM are available which is acceptable for a rare disease. 
Developmental impairments associated with KATP-channel mutations leading to NDM are frequently observed. 
It has been reported that SU therapy in neonatal diabetes secondary to mutations in potassium-channel 
subunits produces measurable improvements in neuropsychomotor impairments. As insulin therapy is without 
any effect here, an additional benefit may be considered plausible. However, the underlying pathophysiology 
(involved anatomical structures, responsible KATP-channel subtype) is unclear. Glibenclamide most probably 
does not enter the CNS which argues against an effect in the brain. However, the GlidKir study conducted in 
France with 18 patients has suggested that SU therapy improves neurodevelopmental parameters in patients 
with NDM owing to KATP-channel mutations. However, this study was uncontrolled. No final conclusion with 
respect to an additional clinical benefit of glibenclamide therapy can be drawn from this study.  
For treatment of NDM in newborns, infants and children, glibenclamide crushed tablets are in current practice 
suspended in water. This mode of administration is considered rather inaccurate and can lead to errors in 
administration in newborns and infants. To overcome the obvious inconvenience of this process and in view 
of a better compliance, an oral glibenclamide suspension presented in two strengths (0.6 mg/ml and 6 
mg/ml) has been developed. 
The NEOGLI-study showed that acceptability of glibenclamide oral suspension was positively rated by 
patients and their parents. The glycaemic control was essentially unchanged after switching from 
glibenclamide (crushed) tablets to glibenclamide oral suspension. 
In the published studies, which support this application, as well as in the NEOGLI-study only patients with 
approved mutations in the genes coding for the β-cell KATP-channel were included. In addition a small number 
of patients with chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus were successfully treated. No 
data have been provided for patients with NDM of other origin, in which efficacy is physiologically unlikely.  
On day180 of the procedure the applicant proposed an amended wording of SmPC section 4.1 (addition of 
“and adolescents” to the target population).  
This wording was found to be not acceptable, since adolescents are not in need of the suspension formulation 
and the acceptability of the suspension formulation has been rated as poor by the patients and caregivers for 
patients above the age of 5. With the response to the day 180 LoQ, the Applicant consented to delete “and 
adolescents” from the wording in 4.1 and from corresponding sections in the product information.  
Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In patients with certain mutations in the genes coding for the pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium 
channel, and chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes, glibenclamide has been shown to be a 
targeted and efficacious treatment. The glibenclamide suspension applied for is considered to address an 
unmet medical need in newborns, infants and children with NDM. Compared to subcutaneous insulin therapy, 
this treatment targets the underlying condition more specifically. Glycaemic control seems to be improved 
with glibenclamide compared to insulin treatment. Acceptability of the new formulation by the patients and 
their care givers is also improved, at least for patients below the age of five. Albeit improvements of 
neuropsychomotor impairments have been shown in one study, the physiological rationale is less clear and 
conclusion on an additional benefit of neurodevelopmental improvement cannot be drawn at the present 
time.

2.4.5.  Clinical safety 
The review of safety of glibenclamide is based 1) on the analysis of adverse events reported in the studies 
analysed for efficacy of glibenclamide crushed tablets in neonatal diabetes (Babenko, 2006, Pearson, 2006, 
Beltrand, 2005 and Horeau, GENEODIA study 2016) and 2) the safety information reported in the NEOGLI 
study (Glibenclamide crushed tablets followed by oral suspension). 
Patient exposure 
According to a recently published retrospective analysis (Babiker et al., Diabetologia 59:1162-1166, 2016), 
127 children and adolescents with neonatal diabetes were exposed to sulfonylureas. 
Adverse events 
Non-serious adverse events from studies published in the literature 
Non-serious adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal tract (transitory diarrhea) were reported in 
literature (Pearson et al., 2006). The slightly higher number of hypoglycaemic episodes reported in the 
same study (2% with insulin compared to 5% with SU) during continuous glucose monitoring has to be seen 
in the light of the better glycemic control with SU treatment. No severe hypoglycaemic event was noted in 
this study. Treatment for a period for more than one year does not seem to affect growth in children aged 
between 1 and 12 years of age. 
A longer-term observation published by Hoarau et al. showed no deterioration in renal or hepatic function 
and no cases of retinopathy or nephropathy. Insulin was re-introduced permanently in 1 patient (3 years 
after SU transfer) and transiently in another (1 year after transfer and during 4 years). A summary of the 
adverse events described in published literature is given in the following table:

Non-serious adverse events in the NEOGLI study 
Four patients experienced 10 NSAEs (non serious adverse events) considered as clinically important for 
the safety assessment (these adverse events had to be reported to the Sponsor). Of these, 7 NSAEs 
(abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, diarrhoea, vomiting, and dyspepsia) were assessed as related to 
Glibenclamide. Most NSAEs were of mild intensity and all were resolved. Non-serious adverse events 
considered as clinically important for safety assessment and the numbers of patients involved are given in 
the following table:

Table 8 Other non-serious adverse events and number of patients involved during the 
study period 
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly reported NSAEs and are a known side effect of 
glibenclamide (for adults in the treatment of type 2 diabetes). This ADR is considered appropriately reflected 
in the proposed SmPC.

Frequencies of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia 
The median frequencies of hypoglycaemic and hyperglycemic episodes are given in the following table: 
Table 9 Frequency of hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia episodes 
The frequencies of hypoglycaemic and hyperglycemic episodes were similar when the treatment period on 
glibenclamide crushed tablets is compared to glibenclamide suspension. In this context, it has to be taken 
into account that the initial dose of glibenclamide was decreased by 21% for the 0.6 mg/ml suspension and 
by 14% for the 6 mg/ ml suspension due to the higher bioavailability of glibenclamide oral suspension.

Laboratory findings 
Results of laboratory assessments were within normal limits, except one patient with moderate anemia 
(haemoglobin, 8.20 g/dL) at baseline and one patient with slightly reduced neutrophils count and elevated 
transaminases at the study end. Physical examination at baseline and subsequent visits revealed no 
abnormalities, related to the study treatment. ECG results showed no clinically significant abnormalities. 
Safety in special populations 
No study data were generated in special populations other than in the paediatric population.  
Recommendations given in section 4.2 of the proposed SmPC relating to children with renal and hepatic 
impairment are adequate, i.e. posology adjustment in patients with renal and hepatic impairment (mild to 
mderate) is stated in section 4.2 and section 4.4. Section 4.3 states that severe renal or hepatic impairment 
is a contraindication to glibenclamide treatment.

2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The review of safety of glibenclamide is based on the analysis of adverse events reported in published studies 
investigating glibenclamide crushed tablets in neonatal diabetes (Babenko, 2006, Pearson, 2006, Beltrand, 
2005 and Horeau, GENEODIA study 2016) and the safety information reported in the NEOGLI study 
(Glibenclamide crushed tablets followed by oral suspension). Of note, the frequencies of adverse drug 
reactions in this study cannot be directly compared due to the different study duration (1 month on Daonil 
crushed tablets and 3 month on glibenclamide suspension).  
According to a recently published retrospective analysis (Babiker et al., Diabetologia 59:1162-1166, 2016), 
the exposure of children/adolescents with neonatal diabetes to sulfonylureas was 127. However, it is 
considered difficult to provide an exact number. Taking into account the rarity of the condition, the number of 
children exposed to glibenclamide, either as crushed tablets or as oral suspension is considered acceptable. 
The study published by Pearson et al. reported five cases of transitory diarrhea. No other adverse drug 
reactions were reported in the published studies. Gastrointestinal side effects are a known ADR in adults. The 
proposed labelling in section 4.8 of the SmPC is adequate. 
Except one patient with elevated transaminases and slightly reduced neutrophil count (both adverse drug 
reactions are labelled in the product information), laboratory parameters were without abnormalities. The 
frequency of hypo- and hyperglycemia under the treatment with glibenclamide suspension was 
investigated in the published study of Pearson et al. (comparison with the period in which patients received 
insulin) and in the NEOGLI study (comparison with the period in which patients received crushed 
glibenclamide tablets). Results of hyoglycemic episodes in the study of Pearson did not suggest an increased 
risk for hypoglycaemia/hyperglycemia after switching from insulin (median percentages of measurements 
with blood glucose below 3.3 mmol/L: 2% with insulin and 5% with glibenclamide). The results have to be 
viewed in the light of an overall better glycemic control. In the NEOGLI study, 7 non-serious hyoglycemic 
events were reported in 5 patients with glibenclamide suspension. With the Applicant`s Response it was 
clarified, that asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (non-severe) was over-reported after the switch to glibenclamide 
suspension. Actually, there were more cases of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia with glibenclamide crushed 
tablets. 
Longer-term effects were assessed in the study of Pearson et al.: these1 year data showed no detrimental 
effect on growth compared with an age-matched population (no other parameter investigated). In the 
GENEODIA study (prospective analysis) no episodes of renal and hepatic failure and no development of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 43/60 
  
  
retinopathy or nephropathy were reported. In NEOGLI, five patients entered the extension phase; no adverse 
events likely to be related to study drug occurred during this extension period. 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Glibenclamide is a well-known drug in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the safety 
profile in the adult population is well characterised. The majority of children exposed to Glibenclamide have 
been treated with crushed tablets, a mode of administration which may easily lead to over-or underdosing. 
The adverse drug reactions reported with crushed tablets mainly were mild in intensity and were resolved. 
The data available for the glibenclamide suspension are sparse and uncontrolled. This is acceptable for a rare 
disorder and based on the vast accumulated knowledge obtained in adults. No unexpected adverse drug 
reaction occurred.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities (educational material), such 
as a prescriber’s guide, which aims at increasing awareness about the four presentations available (two 
strengths of the product, each containing either a 1mL or a 5mL syringe) and at minimising the risk of 
hypoglycaemia in case of mix-ups of the different presentations, are required in addition to the information 
included in the product information to this effect. The agreed key elements of this prescriber’s guide can be 
found in section 4. Recommendation. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.2 is acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact the fact that Amglidia is authorised as a new finished product formulation and considering 
the risk of medication errors linked to the different presentations, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate 
entry in the EURD list for Amglidia is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for 
glibenclamide. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product 
are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request the alignment of 
the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD).  The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

3.  Benefit-risk assessment 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Amglidia oral suspension is a new formulation of a well-known hypoglycaemic drug substance, ie. 
glibenclamide. Sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide are approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 
2 diabetes. Glibenclamide has been widely used throughout the world since the year 1970. Therefore, vast 
knowledge on its efficacy and safety profile in adult patients with type 2 diabetes exists. More recently, 
sulfonylureas are used off-label, e.g. as crushed tablets, for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus 
(NDM). Amglidia oral suspension is proposed for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus, for use in 
newborns, infants and children. 
Glibenclamide is a hypoglycaemic agent belonging to the class of sulfonylureas acting on the potassium 
channels of the pancreatic β-cells. The target disease for glibenclamide oral suspension is a form of neonatal 
diabetes mellitus associated with a defect of β-cell function with early onset in childhood that was recognized 
quite recently in the last 12 years. Specific genetic alterations, which explain the hyperglycemia, have been 
uncovered, showing that NDM is a new disorder with a rare incidence. Glibenclamide oral suspension is 
specifically designed to treat children with this rare condition for whom there is a lack of a suitable 
sulfonylurea formulation. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a disease of early infancy. In approximately 50% the disease is due to 
mutations in the genes coding for the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive 
potassium channel which result in failure of insulin secretion. Furthermore, the risk linked to NDM is also a 
risk of neurological and neuropsychological disturbances, including epilepsy leading to death or mental 
retardation as well as milder forms of dyspraxia or hypotonia. The condition was estimated to affect less than 
0.2 in 10000 persons. 
Amglidia 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml, oral suspension is proposed (by the applicant) to be administered in the 
following indication 
 “Amglidia is indicated for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus, for use in newborns, infants and 
children. 
Sulphonylureas like Amglidia have been shown to be effective in patients with mutations in the genes coding 
for the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel and chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes 
mellitus.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a detectable condition that needs most often emergency treatment with 
intravenous fluid and insulin, the only method so far to re-establish metabolic control, and to avoid short-
term risks such a ketoacidosis, dehydration and death in newborns and toddlers. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 49/60 
  
  
Insulin is difficult to handle because of the very low weight in these small children. The therapeutic margins 
are low between hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, both harmful to the neurological development of the 
newborn. 
Currently, in clinical practice sulfonylurea like glibenclamide are administered off-label or within clinical 
research protocols to newborns/children using a commercially available tablet form licensed for adults. To 
render the drug suitable for oral intake by newborns/children, the nursing staff, under medical prescription, 
or the parents at home, must crush the tablet into small pieces and present the drug to the infant by mixing 
the fragments with a small volume of water; the mixture is then administered with an oral syringe. The use 
of such formulation is not adequate as it is rather inaccurate and can lead to errors in administration in 
newborns and infants.  
The development of the oral suspension for the treatment of NDM in newborns, infants and children to take 
the place of crushed tablets previously used off-label and insulin is considered to address an unmet medical 
need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This hybrid application is based on data from studies published in literature and on data from the NEOGLI 
study (submitted as clinical study report). No controlled studies were performed in children with NDM, which 
is acceptable in the light of the rarity of the condition and due to ethical constraints.  
Two papers published in 2006 (Babenko et al., Pearson et al.) have established the proof of concept of oral 
glibenclamide in the treatment of children with NDM with the use of crushed tablets instead of insulin 
injections. In these studies, 34 patients (age range 4.8 to 16.5 years, Babenko et al.) and 49 patients (age 
range 3 month to 36 years, Pearson et al.) had been investigated open-label. In both studies metabolic 
control (HbA1c) was investigated after switch from insulin to sulfonylureas.  
In the study published by Rafig et al. (2008) 27 patients with SUR1 mutations were followed for at least 2 
months after transfer from insulin to sulfonylureas. Information on clinical features, treatment before and 
after transfer, and the transfer protocol used was collected. Successful and unsuccessful transfer patients and 
glycaemic control before and after transfer were compared. 
In the study published by Babiker et al. (2016) clinical data on 127 patients with neonatal diabetes due to 
KCNJ11 (Kir6.2) mutations who attempted to transfer to sulfonylureas were retrospectively analyzed. 
Successful transfer was considered when patients completely discontinued insulin whilst on sulfonylureas. All 
unsuccessful transfers received ≥0.8 mg kg−1 day−1 glibenclamide (or the equivalent) for >4 weeks.  
Thurber et al. (2015) performed a retrospective cohort study using data on 58 individuals with neonatal 
diabetes due to KCNJ11 mutations. They assessed the influence of age (2.6 (0.0–33.6) years) at initiation of 
SU therapy on treatment outcomes. 
The GlidKir study was an open-label study which has been performed to assess continuously the capillary 
glycaemia for three consecutive days and evaluate the insulin secretion under insulin and sulfonylureas and 
to evaluate the potential effects of sulfonylureas on neurodevelopmental parameters, which are known to be 
unresponsive to insulin in patients with neonatal diabetes owing to KATP channel mutations. In this 
prospective, open-label, single-center, single arm, non-randomized, uncontrolled study 18 patients (aged 
from 0.1-18.5 years) with neonatal diabetes and mutations in the beta cell potassium channel have been 
switched from insulin injections to glibenclamide (Beltrand, 2015).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 50/60 
  
  
The NEOGLI study evaluated efficacy, tolerance and acceptability of glibenclamide 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml 
oral suspension in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus secondary to a mutation of the ATP-dependent 
potassium channels. In this single-center, uncontrolled, non-randomised, open-label, prospective phase II 
study, 10 patients (aged from 0.3 – 16.2 years) with NDM and mutations in the beta cell potassium channel 
were switched from glibenclamide crushed tablets to Glibenclamide 0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml oral suspension. 
The GENEODIA study (Hoarau, 2016) was a long-term prospective follow-up study investigating metabolic 
control in children transferred from insulin to oral glibenclamide. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The sulfonylurea glibenclamide is an antidiabetic drug in widespread clinical use for treatment of type 2 
diabetes mellitus for more than 40 years. In the treatment of NDM with glibenclamide there is off-label 
clinical experience for more than 10 years. 
The mode of action of oral glibenclamide specifically targeting the condition is clearly a favourable effect. The 
pharmacologic response to sulfonylureas seems to result from the closing of mutant KATP channels, thereby 
increasing insulin secretion in response to incretins and increased blood glucose levels. 
As a consequence, insulin can be reduced or eliminated in affected patients, which is considered a benefit. 
Oral glibenclamide is more convenient to administer. About 90 % of the patients with NDM originating from 
overactive KATP-channels due to gene mutations can be transferred from subcutaneous insulin to sulfonylurea 
treatment. Successful transfer was described in the literature for more than 210 patients. In addition, 
efficacy of glibenclamide has also been reported in patients with 6q24-related transient ND.  
As for any antihyperglycemic agent, improvement of metabolic control is clearly a benefit. Results from 
published literature show beneficial antihyperglycemic effects when patients were transferred from insulin to 
(crushed) sulfonylurea tablets (e.g. Rafiq et al. 2008, n = 23; Thurber et al. 2015, n = 48; Babiker et al. 
2016, n = 112). HbA1c was reduced in these studies by 1.5 %, 2.3 % and 2.3 %, respectively. In the Glidkir 
study (Beltrand et al. 2015) HbA1c was reduced by 1.55 %. Only uncontrolled data are available; however 
consistent effects on HbA1c across studies and the magnitude of the observed reduction are considered 
sufficient to conclude on a favourable metabolic effect in the short-term. Limited 10-year data suggest long-
term efficacy. 
Developmental impairments associated with KATP-channel mutations in the brain in patients with NDM have 
been frequently observed. As insulin is without any effect here, an additional benefit of glibenclamide 
treatment seems plausible. Reports from uncontrolled studies (Mlynarski et al, 2007, Beltrand et al. 2015), 
suggest improvements in neuropsychomotor impairments (uncertainties surrounding this issue are mentioned 
below in 3.3.). 
The NEOGLI study showed that children with NDM can be effectively and safely switched from crushed non-
micronised tablets to the oral suspension of glibenclamide. Results of the NEOGLI study also showed that 
acceptability of glibenclamide oral suspension was positively rated by the target patient population, i.e., 
patients younger than 5 years old (n = 6). In addition, their parents preferred the suspension over the 
tablets. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 51/60 
  
  
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Insulin does not affect developmental impairments frequently associated with NDM. Pathophysiological 
background of these impairments is unclear with respect to tissues and KATP-channel subtypes involved. It 
has been reported in literature, that SU therapy in NDM secondary to mutations in potassium-channel 
subunits produces measurable improvements in neuropsychomotor impairments. However, results of the 
GlidKir study do not allow for a firm conclusion on an improvement of neuropsychological disturbances 
because of its uncontrolled nature and due to the fact that neurodevelopmental changes are inherent in a 
child`s development. In addition, it is unclear whether sulfonylureas do cross the blood-brain-barrier. 
Therefore, no final conclusion with respect to a clinical benefit of a glibenclamide therapy regarding 
neurodevelopmental improvements can be drawn and no such benefit can be claimed. 
Bibliographical evidence and the NEOGLI-study included only patients with confirmed mutations in the genes 
coding for the β-cell KATP-channel. In addition, a small number of patients with chromosome 6q24-related 
transient neonatal diabetes mellitus were successfully treated. Extrapolation to NDM due to other mutations 
is not possible. 
In persistent NDM, a life-time treatment has to be expected. Long-term data arguing for a persistent 
beneficial effect of SU in NDM are very limited. In 11 patients with KCNJ11-associated PNDM, retained HbA1c 
control with SU for more than 57 month was reported. Additional preliminary data suggest that efficacy is 
maintained for at least 10 years. In the light of the sparse long-term data, no firm conclusion is possible on 
whether life-long efficacy of glibenclamide can be expected. This awareness is important in the management 
of patients with the disease. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety experience in young patients with NDM is limited. The ADR profile appears to be in line with that 
observed in adults. Side effects which occurred in children with NDM were hypoglycaemia (two severe, drug-
related cases in the NEOGLI study, 7 cases classified as non-severe with uncertain drug relation), 
gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities (one case of elevated transaminases, one case of 
neutropenia). All side effects resolved without sequelae. No unexpected ADR occurred. 
With respect to hypoglycaemia, one study compared glibenclamide to insulin (Pearson et al., 2006) and 
found 2% of measurements of capillary blood glucose below 3.3 mmol/L with insulin compared to 5% with 
glibenclamide. However, these results have to be interpreted in the light of a better glycemic control with 
glibenclamide. No other comparative data on the incidence of hypoglycaemia are available. 
In the NEOGLI study episodes of hypoglycaemia were comparable with glibenclamide crushed tablets and 
glibenclamide suspension. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No clinical data exist with respect to the potential impact of glibenclamide on growth and development. 
However, considering the mechanism of action of glibenclamide, no detrimental effects are expected. No data 
are available for children with impaired renal or hepatic function; however, treatment recommendations in 
the proposed SmPC for these special groups are considered adequate (contraindication for severe renal and 
hepatic impairment, warnings for children with mild and moderate hepatic impairment).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The ability of oral glibenclamide to specifically address the underlying pathophysiology in children with NDM is 
seen as a benefit per se. As a consequence, insulin can be reduced or eliminated in the neonates, infants and 
children, which is considered an important benefit since oral glibenclamide is more convenient to administer. 
About 90 % of the patients with NDM originating from overactive KATP-channels due to gene mutations can be 
transferred from subcutaneous insulin to sulfonylurea treatment. Successful transfer was described in the 
literature for more than 210 patients. In addition, efficacy of glibenclamide has also been reported in patients 
with 6q24-related transient ND.  
As for any antihyperglycemic agent, metabolic control is key for assessment of efficacy. Results from 
published literature show beneficial antihyperglycemic effects when patients were transferred from insulin to 
(crushed) sulfonylurea tablets (e.g. Rafiq et al. 2008, n = 23; Thurber et al. 2015, n = 48; Babiker et al. 
2016, n = 112). HbA1c was reduced in these studies by 1.5 %, 2.3 % and 2.3 %, respectively. In the Glidkir 
study (Beltrand et al. 2015) HbA1c was reduced by 1.55 %. Although only uncontrolled data are available, 
the consistent effects on HbA1c across studies and the magnitude of the observed reduction are considered 
sufficient to conclude on a favourable metabolic effect in the short-term. Limited literature data support long-
term efficacy of glibenclamide in patients with NDM and an amenable mutation.  
Acceptability of the newly developed suspension formulation is also considered highly relevant in paediatric 
patients. The positive rating of acceptability by patients and care givers in children below the age of 5 in the 
NEOGLI study is reassuring. The development of an age-appropriate formulation is considered a benefit and 
expected to simplify treatment, increase dose accuracy and potentially increase compliance.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/153558/2018 
Page 56/60 
  
  
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is considered the most relevant side effect since it may impair the child`s long term 
development. Comparative data as regards hypoglycaemia (Pearson et al.) do not allow for any firm 
conclusion on the relative risk of hypoglycaemia of glibenclamide compared to insulin. In the NEOGLI study 
the frequency of hypoglycaemia with glibenclamide crushed tablets and glibenclamide suspension were 
comparable. 
Gastrointestinal side effects are transient and the observed cases were mild in nature and resolved without 
sequelae, albeit they may temporarily impair the patient`s and care giver`s quality of life. Overall, the safety 
profile appears to be in line with that observed in adults with type 2 diabetes.  No unexpected side effects 
occurred. The safety issues, most importantly hypoglycaemia, are expected to be well manageable in clinical 
practice. 
3.8.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Specifically targeting the underlying pathophysiology of NDM in patients with mutations in the KATP-channel 
and a better glycemic control compared to insulin is a clear benefit of glibenclamide. In addition, efficacy has 
also been reported in patients with rare 6q24-related transient ND. The safety profile of glibenclamide in 
patients with NDM is in line with that known in adults and adverse drug reactions reported in NEOGLI and the 
literature were generally mild and are considered well-manageable in clinical practice.  
Therefore, the benefits of the oral formulation of glibenclamide are considered to outweigh the risks in the 
treatment of newborns, infants and children with NDM and an amenable mutation. 
3.9.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a hybrid version of glibenclamide developed as a suspension formulation for use in 
children. The reference product Daonil tablets is indicated for non insulin dependent (type 2 diabetes 
mellitus), whenever blood glucose levels cannot be controlled adequately by diet, physical exercise, and 
weight reduction alone.  
The clinical pharmacology and PK/PD approach of this Article 10.3 hybrid application was considered 
acceptable for the extreme rare disease of neonatal diabetes. The 1AMK1/Glibentek1 study was designed to 
investigate the relative bioavailability of the two glibenclamide suspensions (0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml) 
versus crushed tablets of the reference product Daonil® 5 mg in healthy male subjects. A higher 
bioavailability was found for the oral suspension compared to glibenclamide crushed tablets (non-
micronized). Dosing recommendations and guidance for transfer of patients with neonatal diabetes from off-
label use of glibenclamide tablets to glibenclamide suspension are provided in the respective sections of the 
SmPC. The SmPC also clarifies that no dose recommendation can be given for switching patients from 
micronized glibenclamid tablets to Amglidia. 
From a risk minimisation perspective, the provision of an educational material such as a prescriber’s guide, 
which will be attached to the Product Information, will increase awareness about the four presentations 
available (two strengths of the product, each containing either a 1mL or a 5mL syringe) and minimise the 
risk of hypoglycaemia in case of mix-ups of the different presentations, at the time of prescription.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Amglidia is favourable in the following indication: 
Amglidia is indicated for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus, for use in newborns, infants and 
children. 
Sulphonylureas like Amglidia have been shown to be effective in patients with mutations in the genes 
coding for the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel and chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal 
diabetes mellitus. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Additional risk minimisation measures   
Prior to launch of Amglidia in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree the 
content and format of an educational material for Amglidia, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The educational material is aimed at increasing awareness about the four presentations available 
(two strengths of the product, each containing either a 1mL or a 5mL syringe) and at minimising 
the risk of hypoglycaemia in case of mix-ups of the different presentations. 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Amglidia is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe Amglidia, have access to the following 
educational guide: 
•  A Prescriber’s Guide, including  the SmPC of Amglidia  attached  
The Prescriber’s Guide shall contain the following key messages: 
Amglidia is a suspension to be administered with a provided oral syringe graduated in mL. Healthcare 
professionals or patients should never use another syringe than the one provided in the box to avoid dosing 
errors which could result in serious harm. 
•  Amglidia is available in four different boxes corresponding to four different presentations (four 
different strengths): 
  One box for the 0.6 mg/mL strength with one 1mL syringe: yellow colour for outer carton and 
reverse type yellow colour for label  
  One box for the 0.6 mg/mL strength with one 5 mL syringe: yellow colour for outer carton and 
reverse type yellow colour for label  
  One box for the 6 mg/mL strength with one syringe of 1 mL: purple colour for outer carton and 
reverse type purple colour for label  
  One box for the 6 mg/mL strength with one syringe of 5 mL: purple colour for outer carton and 
reverse type purple colour for label  
• 
• 
The choice of the Amglidia strength should be defined according to the prescribed posology and the 
patient’s body weight. 
The Amglidia 0.6 mg/mL strength should not be used for posology higher than 0.6 mg/kg/day to limit 
the exposure to the sodium benzoate excipient. Please read the posology and method of 
administration in the SmPC attached to this prescriber’s guide. 
•  Choice of the syringe to be used:  
  After the total daily dose and the strength to be used have been defined, the frequency of the 
daily administration should be pointed out and the corresponding volume per administration 
should be calculated. 
  Depending on the volume calculated per administration: 
 
 
If the volume per administration is 1mL or below, the 1mL syringe should be prescribed; 
If the volume per administration is more than 1mL, the 5mL syringe should be 
prescribed. 
• 
The prescription should state the calculated daily dose in mL, the strength of Amglidia to be used, the 
number of administrations over which the daily dose is divided, as well as the volume in mL to be 
administered for each dose and the size of the syringe to be used.

• 
• 
Patients and/or their caretakers should be explained that: 
  They are prescribed a dose of Amglidia in mL according to their body weight. This dose is to be 
administrated with a provided oral syringe graduated in mL.  
  There are 2 presentations for a same strength: one with a syringe of 1mL and one with a syringe 
of 5 mL.  
  Patients or their caretakers should be reminded to use the correct syringe as stated in their 
prescription. 
If the patient is prescribed a different presentation, the prescriber should highlight to the patient the 
packaging differences between the different presentations (focus on colour differentiation, warning 
statements on carton, thickness and length of the provided syringe).

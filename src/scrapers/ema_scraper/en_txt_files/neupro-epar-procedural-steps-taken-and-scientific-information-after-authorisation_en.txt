are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The update is based on data from two clinical trials,

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include 
summary descriptions of two clinical studies in 
relation to the use of equipotent doses for rotigotine 
as compared to ropinirole and other dopamine 
agonists as well as to amend the wording on the 
comparability of efficacy of rotigotine versus 
ropinirole, as observed in one of the pivotal trials. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
supported by three additional studies, investigating the 
efficacy and safety of rotigotine patches in equipotent 
doses to the oral dopamine agonists ropinirole, pramipexole 
and cabergoline. One of the studies indicated that effective 
control of Parkinson’s disease symptoms can be achieved 
when switching from an oral dopamine agonists to 
rotigotine patch. Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated to 
reflect relevant information on these two studies and to 
correct a statement on the comparability of efficacy of 
rotigotine and ropinirole observed in a previous pivotal 
trial.

PSUR data, aggression/aggressive behaviour as well as 
binge eating and compulsive eating were included as rare 
adverse reactions in the product information. Furthermore, 
based on a recent review of the available post-marketing 
data in relation to the risk of development of impulse 
control disorders when using medicinal products containing 
levodopa, dopamine agonists and/or Catechol-O-

of transdermal delivery of rotigotine on the control of early 
morning motor function, sleep quality, nocturnal 
symptoms, and non-motor symptoms in subjects with 
idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Subjects were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or 
placebo in weekly increments of 2mg/24h, starting at 
2mg/24h, to a maximum dose of 16mg/24h over 8 weeks, 
followed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. A statistically 
significant improvement was seen in the co-primary 
outcome measures early morning motor function, assessed 
by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
Part III, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the 
modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2).

Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
case analysis on SP791 and SP793 ( open label extension 
of study SP792) data to address the safety concern over 
augmentation rate, the CHMP concluded that the high 
frequency of augmentation in Restless Legs Syndrome 
(RLS) should be reflected in the SPC, even though clinically 
significant augmentation was much lower, because of the 
stringent criteria for evaluable patients. On the basis of the 
results of placebo controlled clinical studies (SP790, SP792) 
and 1-year, open-label follow-up studies (SP791, SP793), 
the CHMP recommended the following information to be 
reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC: 
- Augmentation may occur.  Augmentation refers to the 
earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the 
afternoon), increase in severity of symptoms, and spread of 
symptoms to involve other body parts. Based on two open-
label follow-up studies with one year duration, symptoms 
reflecting clinically relevant and not relevant augmentation 
may be as high as 9.4%. However, based on two 6-month, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, clinically relevant 
augmentation was observed in 1.5% of rotigotine-treated

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
extension studies SP790 and SP793, the CHMP concluded 
that long term data on rotigotine to treat Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS) supported previous evidence on efficacy, 
safety and tolerability. Moreover, results were not 
significantly different between studies. However 
discontinuation rates were kept high (up to 38%) and the 
CHMP requested an update of section 4.8 of the SPC to 
reflect this information. Subsequently the MAH provided 
additional 3-year data from an ongoing study (SP710) also 
conducted in RLS patients. At 1 year in SP791, SP793, and 
SP710, 27%, 38%, and 25% of subjects discontinued from 
the respective study. At 2 years in SP710, an additional 
10% of subjects discontinued, with 65% of subjects 
remaining in the trial. At 3 years in SP710, an additional 
11% of subjects discontinued, with 54% of subjects 
remaining in the trial. The CHMP therefore recommended 
the following information to be included in section 4.8 of 
the SPC: 
- The discontinuation rate was studied in 3 clinical trials 
ranging up to 3 years in duration. The percentage of 
subjects discontinuing was 25-38% over the first year, 
10% in the second year, and 11% in the third year.

- not to launch the product for the indication Restless

Consequently, Annex II is updated to reflect that the

relation to the crystal formation in the patches are 
considered fulfilled.

Safety Restriction and article 20 procedure in relation to 
pack size limitation and initiation of new patient treatment. 
Based on the review of these data,  the CHMP concluded 
that bioequivalence of rotigotine transdermal patch 
(4.5mg/10cm2) from the modified manufacturing process 
using polymorphic form 2 as drug substance for patch 
production and from the originally approved manufacturing 
process using polymorphic form 1 as drug substance for 
patch production was established.  
Furthermore, taking into account that all the related 
commitments undertaken by the MAH have been fulfilled to 
address the quality defect in relation to the crystal 
formation in the patches, the CHMP recommended the 
lifting of the restrictions, as requested by the MAH.

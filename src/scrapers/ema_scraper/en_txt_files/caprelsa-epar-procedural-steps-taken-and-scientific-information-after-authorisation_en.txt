Vandetanib starting dose should be reduced to 200 mg in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance ≥30 to <50 mL/min) and the QT interval should 
be closely monitored. Vandetanib is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe renal impairment (clearance 
below 30 mL/min). There is no information available for 
patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

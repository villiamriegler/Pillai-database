Clinical study number and title 
Description 
V59_43 is a phase 3, open label, single arm  multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine in healthy subjects 2 to 75 years of age in 
India. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Immunogenicity objectives (all at day 29 postvaccination): 
Primary 
 
To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM as measured by the 
percentage of subjects with Human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) seroresponse, directed 
against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y.

  Seroresponse is defined as: for subjects with a prevaccination hSBA titer <1:4, a 
postvaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8, for subjects with a prevaccination hSBA titer ≥1:4, an increase 
in hSBA titer of at least four times the prevaccination titer. 
Secondary 
 
To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM as measured by hSBA 
Geometric Mean Titer (GMTs) and by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥1:8, directed 
against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
Safety objectives: 
To assess the safety profile following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in terms of percentage and number of 
subjects with: 
  Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) reported from day 1 (day of vaccination) 
through day 7 postvaccination. 
  All other AEs reported from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination. 
  Serious AEs (SAEs) and medically attended AEs from day 1 through day 29. 
Study design 
Phase 3, multi-center, single arm, open-label study

Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The measure of immunogenicity used in this study was a serum bactericidal assay using hSBA for 
serogroup A, serogroup C, serogroup W, and serogroup Y performed at Novartis Vaccines and 
Diagnostics, Klinische Serologie, Marburg (Germany). 
Primary Response Variables 
 
Percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at 
day 29. 
Secondary Response Variables 
For the secondary immunogenicity endpoints the following measures were to be evaluated: 
 
hSBA Geometric Mean Titer(GMTs) to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at day 1 and 
day 29. 
 
 
hSBA Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
Percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥1:8 to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at day 
1 and day 29. 
Safety Endpoints 
Solicited local and systemic AEs and other unsolicited AEs were collected from day 1 through day 7 of 
the study. SAEs, AEs resulting in premature withdrawal and other medically attended events were 
collected from day 1 through day 29. An unexpected adverse event was one that was not listed in the 
current Summary of Product Characteristics or the Investigator’s Brochure or an event that was by 
nature more specific or more severe than a listed event.  
Statistical Methods 
Definition of populations analysed: 
1) All Enrolled Population: All subjects who had signed an informed consent, underwent screening 
procedure(s), and had a subject number assigned. 
2) All Exposed Population: All subjects in the all enrolled population who received a study vaccination.  
3) Full Analysis Set (FAS)/Modified Intention-to-Treat (MITT) Immunogenicity Population: All subjects 
in the exposed population who provided at least one evaluable serum sample whose assay result was 
available for at least one serogroup. 
4) Per Protocol (PP) Population, Immunogenicity: All subjects in the FAS who: 
 
Provided evaluable serum samples at day 1 and day 29, and 
  Had no major protocol violations. 
5) Safety Population: All subjects in the exposed population who provided any post-baseline safety 
data. 
Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for age, height and 
weight at enrolment were to be calculated overall and for each age group. Distributions of subjects by 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/495791/2015 
Page 5/13 
 
 
 
 
 
sex, ethnic origin, and previous vaccination were to be summarized overall and for each age group. 
Demographic data were to be tabulated for the Enrolled, FAS, PPS, and Safety populations. 
For this study there was no hypothesis statistically tested. Endpoints were to be reported descriptively. 
Primary analysis 
The number and percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse (as previously defined) and 
associated 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs were to be computed for each N meningitidis serogroups 
A, C, W and Y at day 29, overall. 
Due to the descriptive nature of analyses, there were no considerations with regard to type I or II 
errors or to multiplicity. 
The primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the Per Protocol (PP) population. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
 
hSBA GMTs: The hSBA titers at each visit (day 1 and day 29) were logarithmically transformed 
(base10) (to fulfill normal distribution assumption) and summarized by serogroup. GMTs and 
associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated at each time point by 
exponentiating the corresponding log-transformed means and 95% CIs. Titers below the limit 
of detection would be set to half that limit for the purposes of analysis. GMTs were to be 
reported for each N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y; 
 
hSBA GMR was defined as the geometric mean of the subject’s titer at day 29 divided by the 
subject’s titer at day 1. Its associated 2-sided 95% CIs were also to be computed for each N 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y;  
 
The number and percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥1:8 to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, 
W and Y were to be computed for each serogroup at day 1 and day 29 along with their 
associated 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs. 
Additional exploratory analyses 
The statistical analysis for immunogenicity (including primary and secondary endpoints listed above) 
was to be performed also stratified according to the age at enrolment (2 through 10 years of age, 11 
through 18 years of age, and 19 through 75 years of age). 
Interim analyses 
One interim analysis of safety data from this trial was initially planned. For all adult subjects’ (aged 19 
through 75 years) day 1 through day 29 safety data were analysed and submitted to the Competent 
Authority for their review and acceptance before subjects from 2 years through 18 years of age were 
enrolled into the study. 
On request of local health authorities an unplanned second interim analysis was introduced. Safety 
data from day 1 through day 29 of the adolescent (aged 11 through 18 years) age group were 
analysed and submitted to the Competent Authority for their review and acceptance before subjects 
from 2 years through 10 years of age were enrolled into the study.

The (unplanned, commissioned) interim analysis is not expected to have impacted the results in the 
last age cohort, considering the nature of the trial (single armed, descriptive study). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total 180 subjects were enrolled in this study, 60 per each age group (2 through 10 years, 11 
through 18 years and 19 through 75 years). All enrolled subjects were exposed to the single dose of 
MenACWY vaccine and completed the study without any premature withdrawals. 
In total, 5 subjects reported 6 protocol deviations; 3 subjects in 11 through 18 years group and 2 
subjects in 19 through 75 years group. The reasons for protocol deviations were subjects received 
excluded concomitant medication (n=1) , subjects did not satisfy the entry criteria but were 
randomized in the study (n=2) and no serological results available at visit 1 (n=1) or visit 2 (n=2). 
Therefore 175 persons were included in the PPS. 
Table 1 Overview of datasets 
Baseline data 
The population consisted of Asian in each group. The average age of the subjects at study entry was 
17.49 (±13.432) years and among all enrolled female subjects, 24.4% had childbearing potential.

Assessor’s comments 
The study population is relatively young. The oldest cohort consisted of more males than the youngest 
two cohorts. This is unlikely to have influenced study outcome.  
Efficacy results 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
Seroresponse 
Overall in 2 through 75 years group, at day 29 postvaccination, the seroresponse rate to a single dose 
of MenACWY was 72%, 88%, 55%, and 71%, respectively, for serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Among the 
subjects with baseline hSBA <1:4, the seroresponse rate at day 29 postvaccination was 72%, 93%, 
88%, and 84%, respectively, for serogroups A, C, W and Y. For subjects with baseline hSBA ≥1:4, the 
seroresponse rate were 100%, 77%, 33% and 57%, respectively, for serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
The hSBA response overall and per age strata is presented in table 3.

GMTs and GMRs 
At baseline before MenACWY-CRM vaccination, the hSBA GMTs against serogroups A, C, W and Y in 
overall 2 through 75 years group were 2.07, 3.63, 11 and 6.26, respectively. In 2 through 10 years, 
the baseline hSBA GMTs against serogroup A, C, W and Y were 2.08, 2.88, 9.27 and 3.59, respectively. 
In 11 through 18 years group, the baseline GMTs were 2.05, 4.01, 14 and 7.87, respectively, against 
serogroup A, C, W and Y. Similarly for subjects in 19 through 75 years group, the baseline GMTs were 
2.07, 4.14, 12 and 8.69, respectively, against serogroups A, C, W and Y.  
At day 29 postvaccination, the GMTs in overall 2 through 75 years group were 35, 153, 80 and 93 
against serogroup A, C W and Y respectively. At day 29 postvaccination, the GMTs in among 2 through 
10 years, 11 through 18 years and 19 through 75 years groups were 30, 50 and 29 against serogroup 
A, 67, 191 and 287 against serogroup C, 60, 75 and 116 against serogroup W and 45, 105 and 173 
against serogroup Y, respectively. 
Overall in 2 through 75 years group, at day 29 postvaccination, the GMTs increased 17 fold (GMR) over 
the baseline against serogroup A, 42-fold against serogroup C, 7.09-fold against serogroup W and 15-
fold against serogroup Y.

Assessors comments 
The immune response is broadly in line with what is known from the registration trials and reported in 
the SmPC. 
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
A total of 180 subjects were enrolled in this study, 60 subjects in each of the 3 age groups (2 through 
10 years, 11 through 18 years and 19 through 75 years); all of them provided postvaccination safety 
data and were included in the safety set.

Solicited AEs 
In the 2 through 5 years age group, the most commonly reported solicited local AE from 6 hours 
through day 7 after MenACWY-CRM vaccination was tenderness by 3.3% of subjects. In the age group 
6 through 75 years, pain (17.3 % of subjects) of mild intensity was the most frequently reported 
solicited local AE; 13.3% of subjects in the 6 through 10 years, 28.3% of subjects in the 11 through 18 
years and 8.3% of subjects in the 19 through 75 years age group reported pain after MenACWY-CRM 
vaccination. There were no severe local AEs reported. None of the subjects reported erythema or 
induration. 
In the 2 through 5 years age group, there were no solicited systemic AEs reported. In 6 through 10 
years of age group, the most commonly reported solicited systemic AE from 6 hours through day 7 
were malaise (6.7% of subjects), and headache (6.7% of subjects), followed by arthralgia (3.3% of 
subjects) and myalgia (3.3% of subjects). Body temperature of ≥38.0°C was reported by 3.3% of 
subjects. None of the subjects reported body temperature of ≥40°C. The use of analgesics and 
antipyretics were reported by 6.7% of subjects. In the 11 through 18 years age group the most 
commonly reported solicited systemic AE from 6 hours through day 7 were headache (8.3% of 
subjects) and chills (6.7% of subjects), followed by malaise (3.3% of subjects). Body temperature of 
≥38.0°C was reported by 1.7% of subjects. The use of analgesics and antipyretics were reported by 
8.3% of subjects. In the 19 through 75 years age group the most commonly reported solicited 
systemic AE from 6 hours through day 7 was headache (11.7% of subjects) followed by chills, malaise 
and myalgia (3.3% of subjects). Body temperature of ≥38.0°C was reported by 1.7% of subjects. The 
use of analgesics and antipyretics were reported by 3.3% of subjects in the 19 through 75 years of age 
group.  
One subject in 11 through 18 years of age reported severe headache on day 4 after vaccination. 
Unsolicited AEs 
In the overall age group (2 through 75 years), 10.6% of the subjects reported unsolicited AEs; 15% of 
subjects in the 2 through 10 years, 10% of subjects in the 11 through 18 years and 6.7% of subjects 
in the 19 through 75 years age group reported unsolicited AEs.  
In 2 through 10 years age group, the most commonly affected SOC was infections and infestations 
(10% of subjects). For 11 through 18 years age group, the most commonly affected SOC was 
infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorders (3.3% of subjects), whereas for 19 through 
75 years age group, general disorders and administration site conditions (3.3% of subjects) were 
commonly affected SOC. 
Possibly related unsolicited AEs were reported by 1.7% of subjects in the 2 through 10 years of age 
group, 3.3% of subjects in the 11 through 18 years and 2.8% in the 19 through 75 years of age 
groups.  
Deaths, withdrawals and SAEs 
No deaths were reported during the entire course of the study.  
No subject was prematurely withdrawn from the study due to AE. 
One (1.7%) subject (subject no: 05002) in the 19 through 75 years age group reported SAE (pyrexia) 
which was considered to be possibly or probably related to the study vaccines as per the investigator.

The subject was hospitalized on day 2 after vaccination because the investigator suspected Malaria 
(which was finally ruled out after laboratory investigation). 
Other significant events 
There was one pregnancy during the course of the study. The subject (01004) was followed up until 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known. The subject delivered a live born baby with no congenital 
abnormalities. 
Assessor’s comments 
The rates of AEs seems lower than what is known from registration studies. According to the MAH this 
reflects the overall lower rates of AEs reported from studies in India. The MAH refers to two 
publications (Bravo, 2014 and Bermal, 2011) to substantiate this, both reporting on vaccine trials in 
India. It is possible that differences in attitudes and access to health care would explain the lower rates 
of AEs. Importantly, no unexpected safety signals emerged and the findings are in line with the known 
safety profile of Menveo, which is overall well tolerated. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study V59_43 was a single armed, open label study conducted in India which aimed to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY in children and adults aged between 2 and 75 years. The 
immunogenicity is broadly in line with what is reported in the SmPC for the different age groups. 
Overall, the seroresponse rate was 72%, 88%, 55%, and 71%, respectively, for serogroups A, C, W, 
and Y. The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 were 72% for serogroup A, 95% for serogroup C, 
94% for serogroup W, and 90% for serogroup Y. 
The reported AEs were slightly lower than the known safety profile for Menveo, which could potentially 
be related to differences in reporting AEs in India. There were no unexpected observations and overall 
they confirm the tolerability and favourable safety profile of Menveo. 
In conclusion, the trial demonstrated that a single dose of Menveo is well-tolerated and immunogenic 
in healthy Indian subjects 2 through 75 years of age. 
Consequently, no further regulatory action considering Menveo is required, based on the presented 
results. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation

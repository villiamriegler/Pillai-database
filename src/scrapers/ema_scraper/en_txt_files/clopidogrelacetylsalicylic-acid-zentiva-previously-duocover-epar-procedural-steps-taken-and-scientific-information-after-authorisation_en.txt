increased risk of bleeding due to the potential additive effect. 
Clopidogrel has been shown to increase repaglinide exposure 
in healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown the 
increase in repaglinide exposure is due to inhibition of 
CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel. Due to 
the risk of increased plasma concentrations, concomitant 
administration of clopidogrel and drugs primarily cleared by 
CYP2C8 metabolism (e.g., repaglinide, paclitaxel) should be 
undertaken with caution.

The current variation is submitted in response to the CHMP's 
request following their December 2009 meeting to further 
update the Product Information of clopidogrel, following a 
further review of the available data on the interaction 
between clopidogrel and PPIs (including data from MAHs for 
PPIs). 
It provides an overview and discussion of the data generated 
from the comprehensive research program undertaken to 
further elucidate the variability of PK and PD response of 
clopidogrel.  
The study results require an update of the sections 4.4 
"Special warnings and precautions for use" and 4.5 
"Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction" of the SPC. The Patient Information Leaflets 
have been updated to reflect these SPC modifications. In 
addition, SPC section 4.2 was corrected by deleting 
information on the loading dose.

clopidogrel and CYP2C19 inhibitors including some 
proton pump inhibitors, futher to the CHMP request in

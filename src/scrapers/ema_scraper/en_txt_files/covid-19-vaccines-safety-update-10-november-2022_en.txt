Update as of 1 December 2023 
COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva was withdrawn from the EU market at the request of 
the company for commercial reasons. The withdrawal does not affect the 
information provided in this safety update. 
The safety of authorised COVID-19 vaccines is continuously monitored, and 
updated information is regularly provided to the public.  
Safety updates outline the outcomes from assessments of emerging 
worldwide safety data carried out mainly by EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee (PRAC) (section 1). They also outline how safety is 
monitored and contain high-level information on suspected adverse reaction 
reports, which PRAC takes into account in its assessments (section 2).  
This safety update follows the update of 6 October 2022 and reflects the 
main assessment outcomes of the PRAC meeting held 24 to 27 October 
2022. 
EMA confirms that the benefits of all currently authorised COVID-19 
vaccines continue to outweigh their side effects, given the risk of COVID-19 
illness and related complications, including hospitalisation and death.

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
Key messages from the latest safety 
assessments 
For Comirnaty and Spikevax, an update to the product 
information has been recommended to add heavy 
menstrual bleeding as a side effect.  
For Spikevax, a further update to the product 
information has been recommended to include urticaria 
as an uncommon side effect (i.e., occurring in less than 
1 in 100 persons). 
1.  Latest safety assessments 
Comirnaty (BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) 
Heavy menstrual bleeding 
Update to the product information  
The PRAC has now concluded its assessment of heavy menstrual bleeding 
(see PRAC highlights, October 2022). The Committee has recommended 
that heavy menstrual bleeding should be added to the Comirnaty product 
information as a side effect of unknown frequency.  
The conclusion was based on evidence including cases reported during 
clinical trials, observational studies, intensified post-marketing surveillance 
activities and spontaneously reported cases by patients and healthcare 
professionals, including from European countries, present in EudraVigilance. 
The assessment included almost 9,000 worldwide reports of heavy 
menstrual bleeding with either Comirnaty or Spikevax (both mRNA 
vaccines). 
The frequency category assigned is ‘not known’, as it is generally difficult to 
robustly estimate side effect frequencies from spontaneously reported cases 
of suspected side effects. In general, cases reported spontaneously by a 
patient or healthcare professional concern suspected side effects, i.e. 
medical events that have been observed after vaccination, but which are 
not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine. 
Heavy menstrual bleeding (heavy periods) may be defined as bleeding 
characterised by an increased volume and/or duration which interferes with 
the person’s physical, social, emotional and material quality of life. Cases of 
heavy menstrual bleeding have been reported after the first, second and 
booster doses of Comirnaty. A small number of cases involved positive

rechallenge (where heavy menstrual bleeding was seen after the initial 
vaccination and occurred again after a second dose). A positive rechallenge 
may indicate that a medicine may have caused the side effect in question. 
The available data reviewed involved cases that were mostly non-serious 
and temporary. 
After reviewing the data, the Committee concluded that there is at least a 
reasonable possibility that heavy menstrual bleeding is causally associated 
with Comirnaty and therefore recommended updating the product 
information. 
Menstrual disorders in general are quite common and they can occur for a 
wide range of reasons. This includes some underlying medical conditions. 
Any person who experiences postmenopausal bleeding or is concerned 
about a change in menstruation should consult their doctor. 
There is no evidence to suggest that menstrual changes experienced by 
some people following vaccination have any impact on fertility.  
With regard to the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnancy in 
general, several studies involving around 65,000 pregnancies at different 
stages did not find any sign of an increased risk of pregnancy complications, 
miscarriages, preterm births or adverse effects in the unborn babies 
following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.  
PRAC will continue to monitor cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and will 
communicate further if new recommendations are warranted.  
Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to continue to report 
cases of menstrual disorders following COVID-19 vaccination to their 
national authorities.  
About 672 million doses of Comirnaty, including about 
55.8 million doses in children and adolescents (below 
18 years of age), were administered in the EU/EEA from 
authorisation to 12 October 2022.  
Additionally, over 7 million doses of adapted Comirnaty 
vaccines (bivalent) have also been administered in adults.2  
The initial conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty in the EU was 
issued on 21 December 2020; following an assessment process, it was 
converted into a standard marketing authorisation on 10 October 2022. 
Information on how Comirnaty works is provided in the medicine overview 
(in all EU/EEA languages). Full information on the vaccine, including all 
identified side effects and advice on how to use it, is available in the 
product information (in all EU/EEA languages).

Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.)  
Heavy menstrual bleeding 
Update to the product information  
The PRAC has now concluded its assessment of heavy menstrual bleeding 
(see PRAC highlights, October 2022). The Committee has recommended 
that heavy menstrual bleeding should be added to the Spikevax product 
information as a side effect of unknown frequency.

Urticaria 
Update to the product information  
The PRAC concluded an assessment of the hypersensitivity reaction urticaria 
(hives [raised, red and itchy skin rash]) with Spikevax. After reviewing the 
data, the Committee concluded that there is at least a reasonable possibility 
that urticaria is causally associated with Spikevax and therefore 
recommended updating the product information. 
The Committee recommended that urticaria should be added to the product 
information as a side effect of uncommon frequency (occurring in less than 
1 in 100 people). Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset 
(within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to approximately 
two weeks after vaccination). 
About 158 million doses of Spikevax, including about 
3.1 million doses in children and adolescents (below 
18 years of age), were administered in the EU/EEA from 
authorisation to 12 October 2022.  
Additionally, over 180,000 doses of adapted Spikevax 
vaccines (bivalent) have also been administered in adults. 4

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
2.  How safety is monitored 
Before COVID-19 vaccines were granted EU marketing authorisation, the 
efficacy and safety of the vaccines were assessed in pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. 
All relevant new information emerging worldwide on the vaccines since 
marketing authorisation is collected and promptly assessed. This is in line 
with the pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU 
regulatory network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member 
States, EMA and the European Commission). 
EMA’s detailed assessments take into account all available data from all 
sources to draw robust conclusions on the safety of the vaccines. These 
data include clinical trial results, reports of suspected side effects, 
epidemiological studies monitoring the safety of the vaccine, toxicological 
investigations and any other relevant information. 
Summary safety reports 
The pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines includes monthly 
summary safety reports (MSSRs) which are compiled by the marketing 
authorisation holders to support timely and continuous benefit-risk 
evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic. MSSRs are 
intended to be compiled in the first months of marketing. Afterwards, 
summary safety reports may cover time periods longer than a month or 
may not be necessary anymore. Summary safety reports complement 
periodic safety update reports (PSURs).  
Case reports of suspected side effects 
Collecting reports of medical events and problems that occur following the 
use of a medicine, and therefore might be side effects, is one of the pillars 
of the EU safety monitoring system.  
Healthcare professionals and vaccinated individuals are encouraged to 
report to their national competent authorities all suspected side effects 
individuals may have experienced after receiving a vaccine even if it is 
unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. For more information on how to 
report, including the importance of detailing the vaccine product name and 
the batch, see Reporting suspected side effects.  
These spontaneous reports are collected in EudraVigilance, the EU database 
used for monitoring and analysing suspected side effects. Publicly available 
information can be accessed via EudraVigilance – European database of 
suspected drug reaction reports (in all EU/EEA languages).  
As of 26 October 2022, EudraVigilance contained the following: 
•  Comirnaty: a total of 948,424 cases (plus 1,661 cases relating to 
Comirnaty bivalent vaccines) of suspected side effects spontaneously

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
reported from EU/EEA countries; 8,321 of these reported a fatal 
outcome (plus 21 relating to Comirnaty bivalent vaccines)6,7 (by 12 
October 2022, about 672 million doses of Comirnaty had been given to 
people in the EU/EEA – plus over 7 million doses of Comirnaty bivalent 
vaccines8); 
•  COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva: 1 case of 
suspected side effects spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 
there was no fatal outcome5,6 (by 12 October 2022, about 2,400 doses 
of COVID-19 Vaccine had been given to people in the EU/EEA7); 
• 
Jcovden: a total of 58,226 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 336 of these reported a 
fatal outcome5,6 (by 12 October 2022, about 19.4 million doses of 
Jcovden had been administered to people in the EU/EEA7); 
•  Nuvaxovid: a total of 1,398 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; there was no fatal 
outcome5,6 (by 12 October 2022, about 291,000 doses of Nuvaxovid had 
been administered to people in the EU/EEA7); 
•  Spikevax: a total of 263,598 cases (plus 1,507 cases relating to 
Spikevax bivalent vaccines) of suspected side effects spontaneously 
reported from EU/EEA countries; 1,146 of these reported a fatal 
outcome (plus 5 relating to Spikevax bivalent vaccines)5,6  (by 12 
October 2022, about 158 million doses of Spikevax had been given to 
people in the EU/EEA - plus over 180,000 doses of Spikevax bivalent 
vaccines7); 
•  Vaxzevria: a total of 320,860 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 1,576 of these reported 
a fatal outcome5,6 (by 12 October 2022, about 69 million doses of 
Vaxzevria had been given to people in the EU/EEA7). 
These reports describe suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. 
medical events observed following the use of a vaccine. The fact 
that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination does 
not necessarily mean that this was caused by the vaccine. This may 
have been caused, for example, by health problems not related to 
the vaccination.  
6 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland).  
7 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side effect. 
As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case report, 
the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases. Similarly, 
this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a fatal 
outcome.

data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the European 
Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors EudraVigilance to detect 
any new safety issues. EudraVigilance relies on individual healthcare 
professionals and patients to report their own experience. The monitoring 
detects unusual or unexpected patterns in the reports received for further 
investigation and risk assessment.  
Planned and ongoing studies 
The companies that market COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide results 
from ongoing clinical trials. They also conduct additional studies to monitor 
the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines as they are used in vaccination 
campaigns and other clinical practice. For the list of planned and ongoing 
safety studies with COVID-19 vaccines, see the respective risk management 
plan (RMP): Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) 
Valneva, Jcovden, Nuvaxovid, Spikevax and Vaxzevria.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) is in place for each authorised COVID-
19 vaccine: Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) 
Valneva, Jcovden, Nuvaxovid, Spikevax and Vaxzevria. The PIP describes 
how the company will collect data on the vaccine’s efficacy and safety for its 
potential use in children and adolescents (below 18 years of age). Three 
vaccines are authorised in the EU for use in children and adolescents: 
Comirnaty (as of 6 months), Nuvaxovid (as of 12 years) and Spikevax (as 
of 6 months).  
In addition, EMA is coordinating observational studies in EU Member States 
looking at real-world data from clinical practice to monitor the safety and 
effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including in pregnant women

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer and originates in the lining of 
the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 90-95% of neoplasms arising from the kidney and for 2% to 3% 
of all adult malignancies. There is a 1.5:1 male preponderance, with peak incidence between 60 and 70 
years (Siegel et al, Cancer Statistics 2016 CA Cancer J Clin 2016; 66: 7-30). 
Globally, the incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) varies widely from region to region, with the highest 
rates observed in the Czech Republic and North America. In the EU, there were approximately 84,000 
cases of RCC and 35,000 deaths due to kidney cancer in 2012. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The main histological subtypes of RCC (Vancouver classification) are clear cell, multi-lobular cystic, 
papillary and chromophobe. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common type of RCC and accounts for 
70-85% of sporadic cases of RCC.  
A complex biological classification of RCC (and especially of its clear cell histotype) is currently emerging 
and RCC is proving to be an extremely heterogeneous disease (Gerlinger M et al; N Eng J Med 2012 366; 
883-892) beyond the seminal genetic alteration (mutation, deletion or hypermethylation) of 
the VHL tumour suppressor gene, which is present in the vast majority of sporadic RCCs. Other genetic 
alterations may also occur, especially over time, such as mutations in the mTOR pathway and especially 
in the highly conserved FAT (FRAP–ATM–TTRAP) and kinase domains of the MTOR gene (Voss MH et al 
Clin Cancer Res 2014; 20: 1954-1966). 
In RCC, overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) promotes neoangiogenesis, which contributes to the development and progression of RCC. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
About 25-30% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and fewer than 5% have a solitary 
metastasis. Metastatic deposits are generally found in the bone and lung. RCC is also associated with 
hypercalcaemia, fever, erythrocytosis or wasting syndromes. Patients with localised disease at diagnosis 
have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 85% compared with 10% in those with metastatic disease at 
diagnosis. According to SEER Cancer Statistics for years 2002 to 2008, individuals with localised disease 
at diagnosis had a 5-year relative survival rate of 91.1% compared with 11.6% in individuals with 
metastatic disease at diagnosis (approximately 1⁄4 of patients) (NCI, cited 19 May 2012, SEER Stat Fact 
Sheets: Kidney and Renal Pelvis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 10/123 
 
 
 
 
Whether the tumour subtype (i.e., clear cell versus papillary or chromophobe carcinoma) affects 
prognosis is controversial.  In addition to the histologic grade and anatomic extent of disease, clinical 
factors (e.g. performance status, interval from diagnosis to metastasis, number of metastatic sites, organ 
involvement, weight loss) can influence survival. (Delahunt B, Cheville JC, Martignoni G et al Am J Surg 
Pathol 2013 37: 1490 –1504). 
Advanced RCC in adults is most often diagnosed as early as 55 years of age and at an average age of 64 
years (ACS, 2012, Kidney Cancer (Adult): RCC).  
2.1.5.  Management 
Surgical resection remains the only known curative treatment for localised renal cell carcinoma, and it is 
also used to improve outcome or for palliation in metastatic disease. Targeted therapy and 
immunomodulatory agents are considered standard of care in patients with metastatic disease. 
Chemotherapy is used only occasionally, in certain tumour types.  
Advanced RCC is highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy 
(Hartmann, 1999, Anticancer Research; Hudes et al, 2011, J Natl Compr Canc Netw).  
Renal cell carcinoma is an immunogenic tumour, and spontaneous regressions have been documented. 
Many immune modulators have been used successfully, including the following: Interferon (IFN) and 
interleukin-2 (IL-2); the programmed cell death–1 protein (PD-1) receptor blocker nivolumab and similar 
agents; Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination; Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells plus IL-2; 
Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes; Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem-cell 
transplantation. 
In metastatic RCC, targeted therapy is now the first-line standard of care. VEGF inhibitors (e.g. axitinib, 
bevacizumab), multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib) and mTOR 
inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus) are already approved in the EU for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.   
About the product 
Tivozanib hydrochloride is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with a long half-life that preferentially binds 
to the three vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, 2, and 3) but needs to be present at 
higher concentrations to inhibit other tyrosine kinase receptors. The specificity to the VEGFR targets 
differentiates tivozanib hydrochloride from other available TKIs used in RCC.  
Proposed indication 
Treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who are VEGFR pathway 
inhibitor-naïve and are either untreated or who have failed prior therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) or 
interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
Proposed posology 
The recommended dose of tivozanib is 1340 microgram once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest 
period to comprise one complete treatment cycle of 4 weeks.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 890 micrograms or 1340 micrograms of 
tivozanib (as hydrochloride monohydrate) as active substance, equivalent to 1 mg tivozanib 
hydrochloride monohydrate and 1.5 mg tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate, respectively. 
Other ingredients are: mannitol, magnesium stearate, gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and yellow iron 
oxide (E172). The 890 microgram product also contains indigo carmine (E132).  
Imprint ink contains: shellac, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, indigo carmine aluminium lake 
(E132). The 890 microgram product also contains titanium dioxide and tartrazine aluminium lake (E102). 
The product is available in a white HDPE bottle with a child resistant closure containing 21 hard capsules 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate is 
1-{2-Chloro-4-[(6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]phenyl}-3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)urea hydrochloride 
hydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C 22H 19ClN4O5-Hydrochloride-H2O and has a relative 
molecular mass 509.34 g/mol and has the following structure: 
Figure 1: Structure of tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate 
The chemical structure was confirmed via Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy, 
Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) Spectroscopy, Elemental Analysis, Mass Spectrometry 
(MS), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. The 
results of additional characterisation tests including Hot Stage Polarized Light Microscopy, Differential 
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Dynamic Vapor Sorption, 
Polymorphism study, and Crystalline Form were also presented. 
Tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate is a white to light brown powder. It is not hygroscopic. It has low 
solubility across the physiological pH range (pH 1-7), is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble 
in ethanol and methanol. Tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate does not contain any chiral centres.   
Polymorphism has been observed for tivozanib. It has been demonstrated that the current manufacturing 
process consistently produces Form I (tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate salt). Stability studies have 
shown that the Form I drug substance does not undergo a change in crystalline form after storage at both 
the long-term condition of 25°C/60% RH and the accelerated condition of 40°C/75% RH. 
The CHMP considers that tivozanib is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tivozanib is synthesized in three main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The critical process 
parameters are duly justified, methodology is presented and control is adequate. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag which complies with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identity (FTIR, HPLC, chloride), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (USP), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), crystalline form (XRPD) and particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (including pre-clinical, development and commercial scales) of the active substance 
are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on eight commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36-48 months under long term conditions at 25ºC / 
60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Results from 60ºC/75% RH stress storage conditions for 6 weeks were 
provided on two batches. Results from a forced degradation study at high temperature (150°C), acid, 
oxidative and basic conditions were also provided on one batch. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release with additional tests for thermal profile by DSC and 
microbiological quality included. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating (aside from DSC and microbiological methods which were as per the method used for 
characterisation and the Ph. Eur respectively). 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no trends were observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months when stored in the 
proposed container.

Tivozanib hydrochloride 890 microgram capsules are described as a dark blue opaque cap and bright 
yellow opaque body, imprinted in yellow ink with “TIVZ” on the cap and in dark blue ink with “LD” on the 
body. 
Tivozanib hydrochloride 1340 microgram capsules are described as a bright yellow opaque cap and a 
bright yellow opaque body, imprinted in dark blue ink with “TIVZ” on the cap and in dark blue ink with 
“SD” on the body. 
The excipients in the capsule fill are mannitol and magnesium stearate. The composition of empty hard 
gelatin capsules and imprint inks are provided. The qualitative and quantitative composition is well 
defined and the final product is packaged into a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a 
polypropylene cap with an induction seal. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The finished product is manufactured by dry blending the active substance tivozanib hydrochloride with 
excipients  magnesium  stearate  and  mannitol  and  filling  the  blend  in  hard  gelatin  capsules.  Tivozanib 
hydrochloride  has  limited  solubility  at  physiologic  pH  range.  A  milling  step  of  tivozanib  hydrochloride 
during the active substance manufacturing process ensures consistency of the particle size of the active 
substance used batches in the manufacture of finished product. 
The dissolution method was developed and optimized via changes to the paddle speed and dissolution 
medium composition. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. The 
primary  packaging  is  a  white  HDPE  bottle  with  a  child  resistant  closure.  The  material  complies  with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by dry blending the active substance tivozanib hydrochloride with 
excipients magnesium stearate and mannitol and filling the blend into hard gelatin capsules. 
The in-process controls performed during the manufacturing process are appropriate and have been well 
described and justified.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
description, identification (HPLC, HPLC-PDA), assay (HLPC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 48 months at 25ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Fotivda are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, impurities, water content, dissolution and microbial limit test. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed. 
One batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products.  Based on the results for description, assay, impurities, water 
content and dissolution, it is concluded that the finished product is photostable. 
Forced degradation studies conducted on the capsule contents (thermal, light, base, acid and oxidative 
stress conditions) showed similar results to the drug substance studies and confirmed the suitability of the 
HPLC degradation product method for use in the analysis of stability samples.  
In addition, a study of one batch of each strength of the bulk product stored for 24 months under long 
term conditions at 25ºC/60%RH and intermediate conditions at 30ºC/75%RH and for 9 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH were provided. Based on available stability data, the proposed 
hold time of 24 months for bulk product is acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 5 years with the bottle tightly closed in order 
to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatin obtained from animal sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatin used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development programme employed a series of in vitro studies to assess the biochemical 
and cellular properties of tivozanib hydrochloride as an inhibitor of the VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) 
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 and a series of in vivo studies to evaluate the potency and breadth of the 
anti-tumour activity of tivozanib hydrochloride through an anti-angiogenic mechanism. All studies were 
conducted using tivozanib hydrochloride drug substance manufactured at Hamari (Osaka, Japan). 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed in rats and monkeys. In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  studies  investigated  the  ADME  properties  and  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  (DDIs). 
Toxicology studies in multiple species (mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys), evaluating single-dose and 
repeat-dose  toxicity  (up  to  26  weeks  in  rats  and  39  weeks  in  cynomolgus  monkeys),  as  well  as 
genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, mechanistic toxicology, and phototoxicity studies 
and assessment of the impurities profile for tivozanib hydrochloride were submitted.

Table 1: IC50 Values for Tivozanib Hydrochloride: 26 Recombinant Kinases (Study 1172) 
Three additional in vitro studies were performed to assess the overall selectivity of tivozanib 
hydrochloride for kinases (Studies KBC008, KBC009, and KBC010). Minimal inhibition was observed for 
any kinase at concentrations of 0.1 and 10 nM. At a concentration of 10 nM tivozanib hydrochloride, 12 
kinases showed inhibition of ≥ 50%. These potently inhibited kinases included various members of the 
ephrin receptor family, Janus kinase-3 (JAK-3), c-Kit, rearranged during transfection oncogene (Ret), 
CSF1R macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Fms), BRK, and Ableson leukemia oncogene 
cellular homolog 1. At concentrations of 100 nM tivozanib hydrochloride, most of the kinases showed little 
or no inhibition, while 39 kinases were inhibited by ≥ 50%. Among the set of 39 kinases against which 
tivozanib hydrochloride showed activity at 100 nM, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 ranked among the 
most strongly inhibited, with 18%, 0, and 3% activity remaining relative to control, respectively. Of the 
other kinases inhibited, Eph-B2, PDGFR–α, PDGFR–β, BRK, Tie-2 and c-Kit were strongly inhibited by 100 
nM of tivozanib hydrochloride, which is consistent with the findings in Study 1172. Also inhibited at this 
concentration were the mitogen-activated protein kinase (kinase 4), Eph-A, Eph-B, Fms, 
lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase, Ret, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type B, and 
v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral related oncogene homolog kinases. 
Cell-based assays were used to evaluate tivozanib hydrochloride inhibition of the phosphorylation of RTKs 
and demonstrated higher selectivity of tivozanib hydrochloride for the 3 VEGFR kinases. 
Three studies evaluated the inhibition of tivozanib hydrochloride on the cellular activity of VEGFR-1, 
VEGFR-2, or VEGFR-3 (Studies 951-03, 951-09, and 951-41, respectively).  Tivozanib hydrochloride 
potently and selectively inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of intracellular VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, 
and VEGFR-3 with IC50 values of 0.21, 0.16, 0.24 nM, respectively. 
Analogous studies were performed with various other receptor-expressing cells to assess the tivozanib 
hydrochloride-mediated inhibition of ligand-stimulated intracellular phosphorylation of other RTKs. 
Although tivozanib hydrochloride effectively inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit and PDGFR-β, the cellular 
IC 50 values were approximately 10-fold higher than for VEGFR-2. The concentrations of tivozanib 
hydrochloride required to inhibit the phosphorylation of all other tested kinases were considerably higher 
(≥ 1870-fold) than the concentration required for inhibition of VEGFR-2.

Two mechanism of action studies were conducted with tivozanib hydrochloride to evaluate the direct 
inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation as opposed to tumour cell inhibition. 
The functional selectivity of tivozanib hydrochloride on cells was evaluated (Study 951-04) by 
determining its effect on both VEGF- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated endothelial cell 
proliferation. As with VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in cells (IC50 = 0.16 nM), tivozanib hydrochloride at very 
low concentrations strongly inhibited the VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC (IC50 = 0.67 nM). In 
contrast, the inhibitory activity of tivozanib hydrochloride against bFGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs 
was weak (IC50 ≥ 300 nM). Similarly, the IC50 value for tivozanib hydrochloride inhibition of 
phosphorylation of FGFR-1 (normal human dermal fibroblast [NHDF] cells), one of the primary receptors 
for bFGF, was 299 nM in Study 951-33. This concentration translates to > 400-fold selectivity for 
inhibiting VEGF-induced versus bFGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. 
Study 951-28 evaluated the inhibitory activity of tivozanib hydrochloride on 8 human tumour cell lines in 
culture. Tivozanib hydrochloride at a concentration of ≥1 μM demonstrated limited inhibition of in vitro 
growth of all the cancer cell lines studied. In 4 of the cell lines administered a concentration of 10 μM of 
tivozanib hydrochloride, cell proliferation was reduced to about 50%.  
In vivo 
Tivozanib hydrochloride’s anti-tumour efficacy was evaluated in a broad range of human tumour 
xenograft mouse models. Overall, tivozanib hydrochloride demonstrated substantial and dose dependent 
anti-tumour activity ranging from significant tumour growth inhibition (TGI) to near complete tumour 
regression. 
Study AV951-08195 examined the effects of daily oral administration of tivozanib hydrochloride alone 
and in combination with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, on tumour growth, angiogenesis, and cell 
proliferation of human RCC 786-O xenografts implanted in nude mice.  
Oral administration of tivozanib hydrochloride at a dose of 5 mg/kg once daily led to a dramatic tumour 
regression of 86% in this model, relative to the pre-dose tumour volume (Figure 2). The effect was 
sustained through the extended dosing period. A comparison of tivozanib hydrochloride monotherapy and 
vehicle control is provided in Figure 2.

Xenografts (Study AV951-08195) 
Study AV951-08048 was designed to determine the effect of tivozanib hydrochloride in a murine lung 
tumour allograft model bearing a KRAS mutation (LK216) in SCID mice. 
Treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride resulted in significant regression of LK216 tumours at both dose 
levels (44.1% for the 5 mg/kg dose group and 56.4% for the 20 mg/kg group). Mean tumour volumes at 
Day 36 were 996, 189, and 135 mm3, for the vehicle control, 5 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg dose groups, 
respectively (Figure 3). The difference in relative tumour volumes in both tivozanib hydrochloride groups 
was considered statistically significant (p value < 0.01) compared with that of vehicle control.

(Study AV951-08048) 
A series of similar studies evaluated the anti-tumour efficacy of tivozanib hydrochloride against a broad 
spectrum of human tumour xenografts. In each of these studies, animals administered either dose of 
tivozanib hydrochloride had statistically significantly smaller relative tumour volumes than animals

administered vehicle control (p value < 0.05). This difference correlated to > 50% TGI in all studies at all 
doses tested.  
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tivozanib hydrochloride on tumour growth in rat 
models (Studies PRT/02149.1 and 951-31). Study PRT/02149.1 investigated the anti-tumour activity of 
0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride administered by oral gavage in a panel of 14 human tumours 
subcutaneously xenografted into nude rats. Doses of 0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg were selected to enable 
correlation between efficacy and pharmacokinetic data (Study PKP0227). 
At daily oral doses of 0.2 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride for 14 days, TGI was > 50% in 10 of the 14 
models studied. At daily oral doses of 1 mg/kg, TGI was > 85% in all models studied (Table 2). The most 
potent activity (> 100% inhibition, i.e., tumour regression) was observed with MDA-MB-231 breast 
carcinoma, LoVo colon carcinoma, DU145 prostate carcinoma, and Caki-1 RCC. 
Table 2: Effects of Tivozanib Hydrochloride on Tumour Growth in Vivo in Nude Rats (Study 
PRT/02149.1) 
Study 951-31 evaluated the anti-tumour efficacy of tivozanib hydrochloride in rats with A549 lung 
carcinoma xenografts, as well as the ability of tivozanib hydrochloride to inhibit angiogenesis. Tumour 
growth inhibition was stated to be 42.91% in the 0.04 mg/kg/day dose group and > 100% in the 0.2 and 
1.0 mg/kg/day dose groups, indicating that administration of tivozanib hydrochloride results in 
dose-dependent anti-tumour efficacy in rats. A dose-dependent effect was also noted on vascular 
permeability. 
Four studies evaluated the effect of tivozanib hydrochloride on angiogenesis and vascular permeability 
suppression in nude mice and rats. In addition to an analysis of anti-tumour efficacy Study AV951-08195 
also evaluated the impact of tivozanib hydrochloride on viable tumour area and microvasculature in an 
RCC xenograft model in nude mice. The effects of treatment with oral tivozanib hydrochloride as 
monotherapy and tivozanib hydrochloride in combination with IP rapamycin on tumour killing, 
angiogenesis, and tumour cell proliferation were analysed at the end of the study. The combination of 5 
mg/kg oral tivozanib hydrochloride and 1 mg/kg rapamycin IP resulted in similar tumour shrinkage (86%) 
as tivozanib hydrochloride monotherapy whereas most of the remaining tumours in the tivozanib 
hydrochloride treatment group were necrotic and angiogenesis had been effectively blocked at the end of

the treatment. The combination therapy significantly (p value < 0.05) reduced the remaining lesion to 
residual disease with a very low number of viable tumour cells compared with tivozanib hydrochloride 
monotherapy, as measured by Ki67. In tumours treated with the combination therapy, the percent viable 
tumour area was 15.4% compared with 57.2% in the tivozanib hydrochloride monotherapy group. 
Similarly, the average number of microvessels per viable tumour area was 10/mm2 in the combination 
therapy group compared with 62/mm2 in the tivozanib hydrochloride monotherapy group, as measured 
by CD31. 
Study AV951-08008 evaluated the effect of tivozanib hydrochloride on tumour growth and proliferation 
after 2 to 5 days of continuous daily oral dosing of tivozanib hydrochloride at 5 or 20 mg/kg (12 per group) 
or vehicle control (3 per group) in mice subcutaneously implanted with BH505 mouse breast HER2 tumour 
cells. 
After 2 days of oral dosing at 5 and 20 mg/kg, a dose responsive significant decrease (p value < 0.05) in 
viable tumour areas was observed in the tivozanib hydrochloride treated groups. Viable tumour areas 
were also significantly smaller in tumours treated with 20 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride than those 
treated with 5 mg/kg at all time points. A statistically significant but modest decrease in tumour cell 
proliferation rate (as measured by Ki67 staining) was observed in the 20 mg/kg dose group only at the 
72-hour and 96-hour time points compared with the vehicle group (p value < 0.05). No significant 
difference in CD31 microvasculature between the treatment groups in the number of tumour vessels per 
mm2 was observed; however, vessel cross-section area and therefore MVD were significantly decreased 
in both tivozanib hydrochloride-treated groups compared with vehicle control. 
Tumour hypoxia increased at both doses of tivozanib hydrochloride. At the 5 mg/kg dose level, tumour 
hypoxia increased gradually, reaching its highest level at 120 hours. At the 20 mg/kg dose level, tumour 
hypoxia increased steeply at 72 hours and remained fairly constant until the 120-hour time point. 
Mechanism of Action Studies in Rats To Evaluate the Antiangiogenic Properties of Tivozanib 
Hydrochloride (Studies 951-38 and 951-31) 
Two studies were conducted in nude rats subcutaneously implanted with A549 human lung cancer 
xenografts. The first (Study 951-38) investigated the ability of tivozanib hydrochloride to suppress 
vascular permeability and angiogenesis at oral dose levels of 0, 0.04, 0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg.  The second 
(Study 951-31) directly tested the ability of tivozanib hydrochloride to block angiogenesis in lung 
carcinoma and its effect on anti-tumour efficacy.  A dose-dependent decrease was noted in the quantity 
of Evans blue dye present in tumours, indicating decreased vascular permeability. Similarly, a 
dose-dependent decrease was also observed in MVD, indicating reduced angiogenesis. At doses of 1.0 
mg/kg daily, statistically significant effects were observed in both MVD and permeability, which correlated 
with > 100% TGI.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Following a single oral dose of tivozanib hydrochloride in mice, rapid absorption took place with T max 
ranging from 0.5 to 2 hours. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased proportionally with dose and a 
relatively short elimination t 1/2 of approximately 2.2 to 6.11 hours was observed. 
Following a single oral and IV doses of tivozanib hydrochloride in rats there was no sex related difference 
in exposure, a low CL of 23.9 mL/hr/kg, moderate Vd of 263 mL/kg, moderate rate of absorption with Tmax 
ranging from 2.63 to 4.25 hours, good oral bioavailability of 71.8 to 82.4%. Elimination t 1/2 was long and 
similar after both IV (9.0 hours) and oral administration (9.8 to 10.7 hours) in Sprague-Dawley rats. A 
long t 1/2 of 7.8 to 9.3 hours was also observed in nude rats. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased 
proportionally with dose. 
After repeat oral doses of tivozanib hydrochloride in rats there was no sex related difference in exposure, 
a moderate rate of absorption with Tmax ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 hours not affected by dose level or 
duration of dosing. The systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased proportionally with dose.  
Single and repeat oral doses of tivozanib hydrochloride in pregnant rabbits resulted in minimal 
accumulation with repeated dosing between GDs 6 and 18 and mean t1/2 estimates within approximately 
2 to 4 hours. 
After repeat oral dose of tivozanib hydrochloride in monkeys there was no sex related difference in 
exposure, a moderate rate of absorption with Tmax ranging from 1.8 to 8.0 hours not affected by dose 
level or duration of dosing. The systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased with repeat dosing. 
Overall, the oral PK and TK parameters of tivozanib hydrochloride appeared to be dose-linear in all species 
(mice, rats, and monkeys), and with no marked sex differences. The absorption was rapid in mice and 
more moderate in rats and monkeys. In all nonclinical species, concentration-time profiles for tivozanib 
hydrochloride showed secondary peaks, indicating that enterohepatic recirculation may occur. This 
observation was stated to be consistent with clinical data from healthy human subjects and cancer 
patients. The t 1/2 was species dependent, being longer (generally ≥ 6.7 hours) in rats and monkeys and 
shorter (approximately 2.5 hours at dose levels used in pharmacodynamics studies) in nude mice. 
Distribution 
The tissue distribution of radioactivity was measured by quantitative whole body autoradiography in 
fasted male and female Sprague-Dawley albino rats as well as in male Lister Hooded pigmented rats after 
a single oral administration of 1.0 mg [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride/kg. 
Tissue distribution in rats revealed that the highest concentrations of radioactivity post-dose were in the 
liver, white fat and Harderian gland, with the lowest found in the brain and spinal cord. Elimination was 
rapid in albino rats with all tissues BLQ at 72 hours post-dose. No sex differences were apparent in most 
tissues and there was limited distribution to sex-specific tissues. In pigmented rats, melanin binding to 
the choroid layer of eye displayed longer apparent elimination t 1/2 compared with other tissues. 
The association of tivozanib hydrochloride within the red blood cells of rat after an oral dose of 1 mg/kg 
[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride was limited. In vitro assessment of human blood-to-plasma partitioning 
showed that [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride primarily partitions into the plasma/serum component of blood 
and is independent of concentration in the target range of 0.1 to 5 μM.

The protein binding properties of tivozanib hydrochloride were investigated in 2 separate studies. One 
evaluated these properties in rat, monkey, and human plasma (Study DRZZ1039); the other addressed 
human plasma and serum protein binding and assessed tivozanib hydrochloride binding to human serum 
albumin (HSA) and AAG (Study 8236152). Tivozanib hydrochloride is highly protein bound in the monkey 
(97.6%), and in the rat and human (> 99%). Binding is independent of gender.  Human protein binding 
is the same (> 99%) in plasma and serum. HSA is the major plasma/serum protein component that binds 
tivozanib hydrochloride. 
Metabolism 
Study DRZZ1027 evaluated the comparative metabolic profile of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride in human, 
cynomolgus monkey, dog, and rat microsomes. In addition, metabolite formation was assessed in the 
presence of heterologously expressed human cDNA derived CYP450 enzymes to evaluate the involvement 
of CYP450 isoforms in the metabolism of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride. The results demonstrate the 
involvement of CYP450 in the metabolism of tivozanib hydrochloride. The disappearance of the drug was 
NADPH-dependent, and the percent tivozanib hydrochloride remaining decreased with increasing 
incubation times.  
At a concentration of 0.50 μM, the most extensive metabolism occurred in monkey liver microsomes, with 
79.0% of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride remaining at 60 minutes. This result was followed by human 
(88.7%), rat (89.8%), and dog (97.1%). The metabolite profile in rat and monkey was similar to that in 
human, while that in the dog was dissimilar to the human profile. Of the various heterologously expressed 
human CYP enzymes incubated with [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride, only CYP1A1 (at 0.50 and 5.0 μM) and 
CYP3A4 (at 5.0 μM) metabolised tivozanib hydrochloride. As CYP1A1 is mainly expressed in extrahepatic 
tissues such as the lung and intestine, it is unlikely that this isoform would be extensively involved in 
generating the metabolites observed after incubation with human liver microsomes.  
The in vitro study 8133-100 was conducted to further investigate the findings from Study DRZZ1027 in 
terms of structurally identifying the metabolites produced in human hepatic microsomal incubations.  
In Study 8201725 identification of the specific UGT isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of 
[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride was evaluated using cDNA expressed human UGTs. This study also 
evaluated the inhibitory potential of tivozanib hydrochloride towards microsomal UGT activity. 
Substantial levels of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride desmethyl glucuronide metabolites were formed by 
UGT isoenzymes UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10, but not by UGT 
isoenzymes UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17. The predominant metabolite 
formed (M14) was a desmethyl glucuronide metabolite. The M14 metabolite was formed by several UGT 
enzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10). Consistent with these results, 
M14 was also the predominant metabolite formed in vitro by human primary hepatocyte incubations. 
Other observed glucuronide metabolites were M10, another desmethyl glucuronide metabolite previously 
identified as a minor metabolite in human primary hepatocyte incubations (Study 8201725) and M25, a 
previously unidentified metabolite. Metabolite M10 was formed mainly by UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A7 
isoenzymes, and metabolite M25 was formed mainly by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 isoenzymes. 
Study 8201725 evaluated the in vitro metabolism of tivozanib hydrochloride in rat, monkey and human 
hepatocytes, including structural evaluation of metabolites. Tivozanib hydrochloride appeared to be 
metabolised mainly by the addition of oxygen, demethylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, or a 
combination of these pathways. Twenty two different metabolites, M1 to M24, were detected by using 
LC-MS/MS methods. Metabolites M10 (desmethyl glucuronide), M11 (glucuronide), M14 (desmethyl 
glucuronide), M4/M5 (oxide or N-oxide), M23 (desmethyl sulfate) and M24 (desmethyl sulfate) were also 
observed in incubations of human hepatocyte with [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride by using HPLC-RAD 
methods. Thus, these metabolites are considered to be the more prominent human metabolites and of

these only M14 (desmethyl glucuronide) was present at > 10% of total radioactivity and was designated 
as a predominant in vitro metabolite. All prominent human metabolites were present in both rat and 
monkey with the exception of M11 (glucuronide), which was unique to human hepatocytes, and M10, 
which was not observed with rat hepatocytes. 
In Study 8255110, a single oral dose of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride (5 mg/kg; approximately 200 
μCi/kg) was administered to 2 male bile duct-intact and 2 bile duct-cannulated rats to identify the 
metabolites of tivozanib hydrochloride. On the basis of the HPLC-RAD analysis, unchanged parent was the 
predominant circulating component representing approximately 91% of the total radioactivity exposure 
in serum. Metabolites M4 (mono-oxidation)/M5 (N-oxide of tivozanib hydrochloride)/M63 (reduction of 
the isoxazole ring of tivozanib hydrochloride) co-eluting, represented approximately 9% of the total 
radioactivity exposure in serum. HPLC-RAD profiles obtained from bile duct-intact and bile 
duct-cannulated rat urine were generally qualitatively similar with up to 15 radioactive peaks detected. 
Unchanged parent was not detected in the urine. None of the metabolites detected in urine represented 
greater than 0.5% of the administered radioactive dose. Metabolites identified in urine were products of 
both Phase 1 and Phase 2 biotransformation pathways (demethylation, mono-oxidation, hydrolysis and 
various conjugations along with the cleavage products of the conjugates). 
HPLC-RAD profiles obtained from bile duct-intact and bile duct-cannulated rat fecal extracts were 
generally qualitatively similar with up to 5 radioactive peaks detected. Unchanged parent was the 
predominant radioactive component representing 32.2 and 33.3% of the administered radioactive dose in 
intact and bile duct-cannulated rats, respectively. Predominant metabolites detected were M7 
(O-demethylation; intact rats only), M42 (structure not proposed), and M37 (structure not 
proposed)/M57 (structure not proposed) co-eluting. In intact rats M7 represented 4.99% of the 
administered radioactive dose. M42 and M37/M57 represented 2.86 and 2.62% of the administered 
radioactive dose in intact rats, and 4.11 and 1.01% of the administered radioactive dose in bile duct 
cannulated rats, respectively. Metabolite M59 (structure not proposed) was present in trace amounts 
(less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose) in intact rats only. 
The HPLC-RAD profile obtained from bile showed 9 radioactive peaks, including unchanged tivozanib 
hydrochloride. Unchanged parent was a minor component in the bile representing 0.388% of the 
administered radioactive dose. Predominant metabolites detected in bile were metabolites M55 
(glutathione conjugation)/M56 (N-oxidation couple with glutathione conjugation followed by cleavage of 
the conjugate) co-eluting, and M15 (mono-oxidation coupled with glucuronidation)/M60 
(O-demethylation coupled with sulfation) co-eluting, and representing 6.42 and 8.22% of the 
administered radioactive dose, respectively. Each of the other unknown metabolites detected in bile 
represented less than 1.5% of the administered radioactive dose. 
Following oral administration, unchanged parent was the predominant circulating component, 
representing approximately 91% of the total radioactivity exposure in serum, with metabolites M4 
(mono-oxidation)/M5 (N-oxide of tivozanib hydrochloride)/M63 (reduction of the isoxazole ring of 
tivozanib hydrochloride) co-eluting, which represented approximately 9% of the total radioactivity 
exposure in serum. Unchanged parent was not detected in the urine, and none of the metabolites 
detected in urine represented >0.5% of the administered radioactive dose. In bile, unchanged parent was 
a minor component in the bile, and predominant metabolites detected were products of both Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 biotransformation pathways. In faeces, up to 5 radioactive peaks were detected, with unchanged 
parent as the predominant radioactive component. 
The in vivo metabolism of tivozanib hydrochloride was evaluated in rat, monkey, and human serum, 
urine, and faeces. In rats, metabolites were also evaluated in the bile.  
Unchanged parent molecule is the predominant component in the serum and faeces in rats, monkeys and 
humans. The percentage of the total reactivity of unchanged parent in serum ranged from 77.6 to 95.1%

in humans, which is comparable to the 91% found in rats, and the 78% found in monkeys. Predominant 
serum metabolites in monkeys and rats were M4/M5 and M63 (rat only) representing a total of 9-17% of 
the total reactivity in rats and monkeys, respectively. In humans, no major metabolites were detected in 
serum. Each minor unknown metabolite detected represented ≤ 4% of the total radioactivity. 
No urinary excretion of the parent molecule was noted in any species. No major metabolites at amounts 
greater than 0.5% of the total administered radioactive dose were detected in rats and monkeys. In 
humans, urinary predominant metabolites (M40, M35 and M29) represented 0.764-10.3% the total 
radioactive dose. Minor metabolites (M26, M27, M28 and M31) represented less than 3% the total 
radioactive dose. Of these, the only human metabolite excreted in urine that was not seen in either 
serum, urine, bile, and/or faeces in rats or monkeys was M40, a glutathione conjugate. 
Unchanged tivozanib hydrochloride was a minor component in the bile of the rat representing 0.388% of 
the administered radioactive dose. Predominant metabolites detected in bile were metabolites M55/M56 
and M15/M60, representing 6.42 and 8.22% of the administered radioactive dose, respectively. 
In faeces, unchanged parent is the primary radioactive component for all species, with the percentage of 
total reactivity ranging from 7.82-46.1% in humans and 32.2 and 20.6% in intact rats and monkeys, 
respectively. In monkeys, 4 metabolites were observed, representing an average of less than 1% of the 
administered radioactive dose. In intact rats, the M7 metabolite represented 5% of the administered 
radioactive dose. Other metabolites, M42 and M37/M57 represented 2.86 and 2.62% of the administered 
radioactive dose respectively, in intact rats. In humans, the predominant radiolabelled components 
detected in faecal extracts were unchanged parent and metabolites M37, M42 and M7/M48. The 
predominant metabolites, together, represented a total of 6.35 to 34.3% of the radioactive dose. 
Potential of Tivozanib Hydrochloride to Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Isoforms In Vitro 
Two separate sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of tivozanib hydrochloride to 
inhibit various CYP450 pathways in vitro. One investigated the effect of tivozanib hydrochloride on various 
drug metabolising CYP450 isoforms (Study PK0501); the other (Study AV951-08274) focused specifically 
on the effect on the CYP 3A4 pathway. 
Effect of Tivozanib Hydrochloride on CYP450 Isoforms (Study PK0501) 
The effect of tivozanib hydrochloride on multiple CYP isoforms was investigated using human liver 
microsomes.

Microsomes (Study PK0501)

The mean IC50 for tivozanib hydrochloride for α-OH-triazolam formation (without preincubation) was 43 
μM. When tivozanib hydrochloride was preincubated with microsomal protein before addition of 
substrate, the IC50 increased to 103 μM, indicating no evidence of mechanism based or irreversible 
inhibition. Corresponding IC50 values for tivozanib hydrochloride for 4-OH-triazolam formation were: 65 
μM without preincubation and 93 μM with preincubation. Therefore, tivozanib hydrochloride is a weak 
inhibitor of human CYP3A4 activity. 
Evaluation of the Influence of CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP3A4 Substrates on the Human In 
Vitro Metabolism of Tivozanib Hydrochloride (Study AV951-08274) 
In this system, tivozanib hydrochloride consistently yielded 4 chromatographic peaks, labelled as A, B, C, 
and D. A fifth peak (E) was produced in low abundance by some but not all liver samples. The metabolite 
peaks were preliminarily identified as having molecular weights of 441 (deletion of methyl), 471 (addition 
of oxygen), and 457 (addition of 2H), as well as the parent compound (molecular weight of 455). Another 
peak had a molecular weight of 373. 
The estimated IC50 values for ketoconazole versus formation of metabolites A, B, C, and D were 1.12, 
1.97, 1.31, and 1.39 μM, respectively. These IC50 values are at least an order of magnitude higher than 
IC50 values for ketoconazole versus pure CYP3A4 substrates such as triazolam. 
These data indicate that tivozanib hydrochloride biotransformation is only partially dependent on CYP3A4, 
and inhibitors of CYP3A4 co-administered with tivozanib hydrochloride are not likely to have a major 
effect on tivozanib hydrochloride CL in vivo. 
Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of potential co-administered agents, 
temsirolimus and everolimus (both CYP3A4 substrates), on the metabolism of tivozanib hydrochloride. 
Both agents were found to be weak inhibitors of tivozanib hydrochloride biotransformation. The extent of 
inhibition did not exceed 50% even at concentrations substantially greater than usual levels of clinical 
exposure. IC50 values could not be calculated. These data indicate that these agents would not be 
expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on the CL of tivozanib hydrochloride in vivo. 
Potential of Tivozanib Hydrochloride to Inhibit Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase Pathways In Vitro 
(Study 8242516) 
The inhibitory potential of tivozanib hydrochloride towards microsomal UGT activity was evaluated. This 
study also investigated the specific UGT isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of [14C]-tivozanib 
hydrochloride, 
Dose-dependent inhibition of UGT activities by tivozanib hydrochloride was observed using either 4-MU or 
p-NP as substrates. At the highest concentrations evaluated (50 μM), UGT activities were 65.0% and 
71.6% using 4-MU and p-NP as substrates, respectively. Since tivozanib hydrochloride did not inhibit UGT 
activity by > 50% compared with solvent control, the results were not analysed by curve fitting, and IC50 
values were not determined.  
These data indicate that tivozanib hydrochloride is not likely to be a potent inhibitor of UGT activities and 
clinically relevant DDIs because of inhibition of UGT enzymes by tivozanib hydrochloride are not likely. 
Enzyme Induction (Study 8231061) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 29/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A study was conducted to measure the extent of induction of specific CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A) after exposure of human hepatocytes to tivozanib hydrochloride and to 
compare the effects with those of prototypical inducers rifampicin, omeprazole, and phenobarbital. 
Human hepatocyte cultures responded as expected to the prototypical inducers under the experimental 
conditions. Exposure of the cultures to 0.1, 0.5, and 5 μM tivozanib hydrochloride did not elicit substantial 
increases in CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 (except for 1 donor, considered as an experimental 
artefact) or CYP3A enzyme activities. The increases in all enzyme activities were < 40% compared with 
the induction by prototypical inducers. While induction of CYP3A mRNA was observed in all 3 donor 
hepatocyte cultures treated with tivozanib hydrochloride, the induction was considerably lower than that 
observed with the positive control, rifampicin. Additionally, as mentioned above, no induction of CYP3A 
activity was found for any donor. Thus, in vivo DDIs resulting from the induction of CYP1A, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A enzyme activities by tivozanib hydrochloride are unlikely. 
Substantial decreases in enzyme activities were observed with CYP1A and CYP3A at supra-therapeutic 
concentrations of 5 μM (equivalent to approximately 2274 ng/mL tivozanib hydrochloride which is ~20 
times higher than levels found in human serum at steady state) tivozanib hydrochloride for all 3 donors. 
However, these decreases were not observed consistently at 0.1 or 0.5 μM and thus were not considered 
clinically relevant. Overall, the results indicate that clinical in vivo DDIs resulting from the induction of 
CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A enzyme activities are unlikely to occur at tivozanib 
hydrochloride concentrations achievable in human subjects. 
Excretion 
The in vivo excretion of tivozanib hydrochloride was investigated as follows: the excretion of 
[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride into the urine, faeces, and expired air of rats; the biliary excretion of 
[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride in rats; the excretion of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride into the urine and 
faeces of monkeys. 
After oral administration, a mean of 87.8 and 1.70% of the total radioactivity dosed was recovered in 
faeces and urine, respectively, by 72 hours post-dose, suggesting that most of the test article was 
excreted during this period. Similar results were observed after IV administration, suggesting the 
principal route of tivozanib hydrochloride excretion is faecal excretion through bile. At the end of the 
collection period (168 hours post-dose), a mean total of 95.7 and 93.9% of the dose was recovered in 
urine, faeces, cage wash, expired air and carcass after oral and IV administration, respectively. Total 
recoveries after both routes of administration were generally good, indicating that no [14C]-tivozanib 
hydrochloride was being retained in rats. 
Additional evaluations of the 24-hour urine and faecal excretion of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride were 
conducted in rats as part of Study 8255110. Two male bile duct-intact Sprague-Dawley rats were orally 
dosed with 5 mg/kg (~200 μCi/kg) [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride (suspended in 0.5% MC). Within 24 
hours post-dose an average of 1.26 and 53.7% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine and 
faeces, respectively. Therefore, the bile represents a significant route of excretion of drug-derived 
material in the rat and another non-biliary route of excretion of tivozanib hydrochloride and/or its 
metabolites from the systemic circulation into the gastrointestinal tract exists.

A single oral dose of 3 mg/kg (~60 μCi/kg) [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride (suspended in 0.5% MC) was 
administered to 2 male cynomolgus monkeys. The amount of radioactivity that was excreted in the urine 
and faeces within 24 hours was then determined by liquid scintillation. Within 24 hours post-dose, an 
average of 3.40 and 27.4% was eliminated in the urine and faeces, respectively 
Potential for Serum-Protein-Binding Interactions between [14C]-Tivozanib Hydrochloride and 
Warfarin (Study 8236152) 
Because of the high serum protein binding properties of tivozanib hydrochloride, an in vitro study was 
conducted to evaluate the potential interactions between [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride and warfarin in 
human serum. This study also addressed overall protein binding and the specific proteins tivozanib 
hydrochloride binds in serum. 
The in vitro binding of 3H-warfarin to human serum in the absence or presence of 6 concentrations (0, 
0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 5 μM) of tivozanib hydrochloride was 98.0, 98.0, 98.1, 98.1, 98.1, and 98.1%, 
respectively. 
The mean protein binding of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride to human serum was 100, 99.9, 100, and 
100% at 0, 1, 3, and 6 μM warfarin, respectively. These data show that the binding of tivozanib 
hydrochloride was independent of the concentration of warfarin over the evaluated range. 
These data show that the binding of warfarin was independent of the concentration of tivozanib 
hydrochloride over the concentration range evaluated. Overall, these data indicate that protein binding 
interactions between tivozanib hydrochloride and warfarin are unlikely.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Key Findings After a Single Oral or IV Administration of Tivozanib Hydrochloride (Studies 
RZZ1011, RZZ1010, RZZ1009, and RZZ1008) 
There were 4 single-dose toxicity studies, 2 in mice and 2 in rats. The oral MTD in mice was considered to 
be 524 mg/kg, with doses ≥ 750 mg/kg producing severe adverse clinical effects resulting in early 
sacrifice. The oral MTD in rats was considered to be 276 mg/kg; lethality and/or severe adverse clinical 
signs were noted at doses of ≥ 369 mg/kg.  
The tolerability of a single IV administration of 30 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride (the maximal feasible 
dose [MFD] for this formulation) was also assessed in mice and rats. Only mild adverse clinical 
observations were noted, and it was concluded that a single IV dose of 30 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride 
was well tolerated in both mice and rats.

Under the conditions of a 13-Week Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with a 5-Week Recovery (Study 6691-158), 
the NOAEL in rats, based upon body weight effects in females, was 0.01 mg/kg. Based upon gross 
pathology findings, the NOAEL in rats was 0.03 mg/kg. In doses above the NOAEL (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 
mg/kg) the clinical conditions of rats generally improved during the recovery period. Some tivozanib 
hydrochloride-related effects persisted through the end of the recovery period; however, they appeared 
to be resolving. Conversely, in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group the microscopic findings in the kidney were 
more severe in the recovery-1 group (2 weeks after treatment) than at terminal sacrifice. 
In a 26-Week Oral Toxicity Study in Rats With a 6-Week Recovery (Study 1458-005) at the top dose 
(0.08 mg/kg), the haematological effects noted in both males and females were slight and resolved 
during the recovery phase. The body weight effect in females at 0.08 mg/kg that was observed during the 
last 9 weeks of treatment was considered to be treatment-related but not an adverse effect because the 
magnitude was small. Thus, the NOAEL was the top dose of 0.08 mg/kg, which corresponded to Week 26 
mean AUC0-24hr of 3935 ng·hr/mL. 
Under the conditions of a 13-Week Oral Toxicity Study in Cynomolgus Monkeys With a 5-Week Recovery 
(Study 6691-159), the NOAEL after 13 weeks of treatment in cynomolgus monkeys was determined to be 
0.1 mg/kg. This dose was correlated with AUC0-24hr values on Day 91 (Week 13) of 619 and 703 ng·hr/mL 
in males and females, respectively. Findings at 1.0 mg/kg group after at least 2 weeks of recovery and at 
0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg after at least 5 weeks of recovery indicate reversal or abatement of tivozanib 
hydrochloride-related changes. 
In a 39-Week Oral Toxicity Study (1458-006) in Cynomolgus Monkeys With a 6-Week Recovery tivozanib 
hydrochloride was well tolerated when administered daily to both male and female cynomolgus monkeys 
at all dose levels evaluated. The NOAEL was 0.1 mg/kg, the highest dose level administered. This dose 
correlated with AUC0-24hr values on Day 273 (Week 39) of 905 and 651 ng·hr/mL in males and females, 
respectively. In this study there were no treatment related adverse effects reported, not even on body 
weights. At the NOAEL the systemic exposure of the test animals was only 0.5 times that of clinical 
exposure at steady state.

Genotoxicity 
In an Ames Mutation Assay, tivozanib hydrochloride (with and without S-9 mix) was tested against the 
required bacterial strains at 5 dose levels over a concentration range of 0.32 to 5000 μg/plate. Tivozanib 
hydrochloride showed no mutagenic potential in the bacterial reverse mutation assay under the 
conditions of this test. 
An in Vitro Chromosomal Aberration Assay in CHO Cells (Study RCK0002) was considered unreliable as 
the test material was very toxic to the cells in this treatment, and it appears that it may have caused cells 
to undergo abnormal cell division leading to diploid cells and hyperdiploid cells (cells with greater than the 
normal diploid count but not polyploidy). No induction of endoreduplication occurred. 
An in Vivo Mouse Micronucleus Cytogenetic Assay in CHO Cells (Study RCK0003) showed no evidence of 
clastogenicity or aneugenicity after oral (gavage) administration of tivozanib hydrochloride up to the 
MTDs of 320 and 200 mg/kg for males and females, respectively.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The maternal and paternal NOAEL of tivozanib hydrochloride in rats for fertility and general reproduction 
was determined to be 0.1 mg/kg (Study 311-007). Based upon a calculated human equivalent dose, 0.1 
mg/kg is 0.7-fold the recommended clinical dose. In the pilot study, doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg in male and 
female rats produced mortality, adverse clinical and necropsy observations, and reduced body weights 
and feed consumption. In male rats these doses caused increased epididymis and testis weights and 
infertility. In the embryo foetal study in rats, the maternal NOAEL was determined to be 0.01 mg/kg. 
Based upon a calculated human equivalent dose, 0.01 mg/kg is 0.07-fold the recommended clinical dose. 
Doses ≥ 0.03 mg/kg resulted in increased incidences of early and late foetal resorptions, reduced foetal 
body weight, and gross external and skeletal malformations (0.03 mg/kg is approximately 5-fold lower 
than the recommended clinical dose); therefore, the developmental NOAEL was determined to be 0.01 
mg/kg (Studies 311-005P and 311-005). In the pilot study, presumed pregnant dams dosed with ≥ 0.3 
mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride produced no live foetuses. 
In an embryo foetal developmental study in rabbits, the maternal and developmental no observed effect 
level (NOEL) of tivozanib hydrochloride was > 1.0 mg/kg because no maternally toxic effects were noted 
at that dose (Study 311-006). This dose was associated with an AUC0-24hr on Day 18 of 1050 ng·hr/mL. 
This exposure level is approximately 0.6-fold the exposure levels observed in subjects with RCC (AUC0-t,ss 
1641 ng·hr/mL; Study AV-951-07-201).

Exposures (AUC0-24hr) obtained at the NOAEL in the 26-week rat study (3935 ng·hr/mL for a dose of 0.08 
mg/kg at Day 182) were approximately 2-fold over the steady state exposure measured in RCC patients 
administered 1.5 mg/day tivozanib hydrochloride (equivalent to 1340 micrograms/day tivozanib free 
base) in the Phase 2 study (AUC0-24hrs at steady state 164 ng·hr/m). In monkeys, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, the

NOAEL from the 39-week study resulted in an exposure of 764 ng·hr/mL at Day 273, which is 0.5-fold the 
exposures observed in humans at steady state. 
Local Tolerance  
A standard local irritation study in rabbits via IV, subcutaneous, and/or intramuscular injection was not 
performed. The intended route of administration of tivozanib hydrochloride is oral. 
Other toxicity studies 
Potential impurities in tivozanib hydrochloride drug substance were evaluated for genotoxic potential in a 
structural-activity risk assessment, and those with a positive structural alert were then assessed in Ames 
assays. Of those compounds with a structural alert that were relevant for the drug substance synthesis, 
Ames assays suggested genotoxic potential for DPQ, QC, ACP, MD, and 5-AMI. The level of QC, ACP, MD,

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
N

Primary pharmacology studies conducted at both molecular and cellular levels and in tumour models have 
demonstrated that tivozanib hydrochloride is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the VEGF pathway 
that exerts strong anti-tumour activities in a broad spectrum of tumour types by blocking tumour 
angiogenesis. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed by the 
applicant, which is considered acceptable, considering the high level of selectivity of tivozanib 
hydrochloride for the VEGF pathway.  
Safety pharmacology findings demonstrated an increase in blood pressure (see discussion on Clinical 
Safety). 
The pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, distribution, metabolism, excretion of tivozanib hydrochloride and 
the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with tivozanib hydrochloride were characterized after oral 
administration in several animal models including nude mice, nude rats, Sprague-Dawley rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys.  Intravenous (IV) administration was also evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats.   
Oral PK and toxicokinetic parameters were approximately dose-linear in all species (mice, rats, rabbits, 
and cynomolgus monkeys) with the systemic exposure in terms of Cmax and AUC increasing in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner. However, the rate of absorption was species dependent, 
ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 hours in rats, 1.8 to 8.0 hours in monkeys and from 0.5 to 1 hour in mice. These 
differences in exposure are probably driven by the differences in clearance among the species and 
correlate with the observed differences in t 1/2 across species.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride was highly bound to proteins in the plasma of all species tested (97.6% in 
monkeys and > 99% in rats and humans), and bindings were independent of concentration and sex.  In 
Assessment report

humans, protein binding was high (> 99%) in both plasma and serum. Binding was predominantly to 
albumin, with low binding to α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Tivozanib hydrochloride had an extensive 
distribution throughout the tissues investigated; however, organ levels were low, with tissue/blood ratios 
of less than unity in most tissues. The lowest concentrations were detected in the brain and spinal cord. 
In the pigmented rats, melanin binding to the choroid layer of the eye was apparent with a longer 
elimination t 1/2 of radioactivity than all other tissues; however, the amount of radioactivity bound to 
melanin steadily decreased after 120 hours post-dose.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride was metabolised by only 2 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)-derived 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, CYP1A1 and CYP3A4, and the formation of the predominant metabolite, 
a desmethyl glucuronide metabolite (M14) was mediated by multiple cDNA-expressed human uridine 
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, 
UGT1A9 and UGT1A10.  In vivo, the metabolic profiles in serum, urine, and faeces were similar in rats and 
monkeys.  After a single oral dose of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride in rats and monkeys, unchanged 
tivozanib hydrochloride was the major circulating component, representing approximately 91 and 78% of 
the total radioactivity exposure in serum, respectively, along with metabolites M4 (mono-oxidation) and 
M5 (N-oxide of tivozanib hydrochloride) co-eluting in both species.  
In vitro studies with tivozanib indicate that it is not a CYP enzyme inducer. In vitro studies conducted in 
human liver microsomes and hepatocytes evaluating the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 suggested that tivozanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2B6 and 
CYP2C8.  Based on the in vitro IC50 and in vivo unbound Cmax, tivozanib was unlikely to interact in a 
clinically relevant manner with active substances that are metabolised by these enzyme pathways (see 
SmPC section 4.5). Studies conducted in vitro have shown that tivozanib is not a potent inhibitor of UGT 
metabolic activities and clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are unlikely with medicinal products 
metabolised by these pathways. In vitro studies have shown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor 
inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride was not a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 
(including mechanism-based inhibition) and not an inhibitor of human liver UGTs. These data suggest that 
tivozanib hydrochloride has minimal potential to cause a DDI by inhibiting the metabolism of a 
co-administered agent that is a CYP or UGT substrate. In vitro, the inhibition of tivozanib hydrochloride 
metabolism by the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and the CYP3A4 substrates temsirolimus and 
everolimus was limited, indicating a low likelihood of a DDI with these agents. Tivozanib hydrochloride did 
not elicit substantial increases in CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A enzyme activities with the 
increases in all enzyme activities below 40% compared with the induction by prototypical inducers.  These 
results indicate that clinical DDIs resulting from the induction of CYP enzyme activities by tivozanib 
hydrochloride are unlikely to occur at concentrations of tivozanib achievable in human subjects. 
Tivozanib hydrochloride inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, at concentrations that are likely to 
restrict the effect to intestinal BCRP activity in vivo.  Tivozanib hydrochloride was not an inhibitor of 
transport proteins OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP. Tivozanib 
hydrochloride was not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at clinically relevant 
concentrations of 0.1 to 0.5 µM.  Thus, tivozanib hydrochloride is not expected to be at great risk of 
clinical DDIs when coadministered with substrates or inhibitors of P-gp. The potential for tivozanib to be 
a substrate of transporters other than P-glycoprotein has not been studied. The applicant should perform 
the evaluation of tivozanib as a substrate of OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 as 
a post-authorisation measure (see RMP). 
Excretion studies indicate that the principal route of elimination is faecal excretion.  Biliary excretion is a 
significant route of excretion but another non-biliary route of excretion of tivozanib hydrochloride and its 
metabolites from the systemic circulation into the gastrointestinal tract also exists.

When considering the toxicological profile of tivozanib hydrochloride identified over repeat-toxicity 
studies, sustained treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride resulted in treatment-related effects on the 
teeth, and bones and cardiovascular, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. 
Haematological and clinical chemistry alterations were also noted after exposure to tivozanib 
hydrochloride and appear to be reversible. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in the cynomolgus monkey repeat-dose studies. The lack of QT and 
QTc changes are consistent with findings in the in vitro study indicating that tivozanib hydrochloride does 
not inhibit the hERG channel.  
In rodents, mortality or moribundity were attributed to decreases in body weight and food consumption 
that were possibly related to the toxicities noted in teeth which included thinner, brittle, discoloured or 
maloccluded teeth, and tooth loss. Similar reductions in body weight and food consumption were 
observed in the 13-week study and the 26-week study; however, the findings in the 26-week study were 
less severe because of the lower dose levels used. Corresponding to the clinical observations of tooth 
toxicities observed in rats, histopathological evidence of dentin degeneration and dysplasia were also 
observed and may have been a result of disruption of dentin formation, which also relies on angiogenesis. 
The observed effects on teeth are believed to only affect growing teeth, a process which is continuous 
throughout the entire lifespan of the rat. The effect on incisors in rats is unlikely to be relevant to human 
adults. In contrast, in cynomolgus monkeys, which do not have continuous tooth growth, no tooth effects 
were noted; however, oral lesions were observed; these lesions may have contributed to the body weight 
loss observed at high dose levels.  
The NOAEL exposures (AUC0-24hr) obtained in the pivotal toxicology studies were 3935 ng·hr/mL (0.08 
mg/kg dose at Day 182) and 764 ng·hr/mL (0.1 mg/kg dose at Day 273). The mean exposure obtained 
in subjects with RCC administered 1.5 mg/day tivozanib hydrochloride (equivalent to 
1340 microgram/day tivozanib) in a Phase 2 study was 1641 ng·hr/mL (AUC0-t,ss; Study AV-951-07-201). 
This exposure corresponds approximately to an exposure in humans that is 2-fold below the exposure 
obtain at the NOAEL in the 6-month rat study and is greater than the exposure observed at the NOAEL in 
the 9-month monkey study (the exposure in monkeys was approximately 0.5-fold that of RCC patients). 
In the 4-week and 13-week repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, growth plate 
hypertrophy of the femur and tibia were observed in males and females at dose levels ranging from 0.1 
to 1.0 mg/kg. This finding was not observed after the recovery period. Growth plate hypertrophy was not 
observed in the 26-week rat study, likely because of the lower dose levels used in this study. In monkeys, 
the growth plate effects were noted at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg, which corresponded to an AUC0-24hr of 1531 
ng·hr/mL (Study 6691-159), systemic exposure approximately equivalent to the exposures observed at 
steady state in the Phase 2 study in subjects with RCC (AUC during the dosing interval at steady state 
[AUC0-t,ss] 1641 ng·hr/mL). The mechanism of this change is likely a result of disruption of the normal 
ossification of the growth plate. This process relies on VEGF-dependent capillaries, which invade the 
growth plate, initiating calcification, bone production and bone resorption. The principal reason for the 
thickening of the growth plate is the accumulation of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This finding is likely to 
be of reduced relevance in post-pubescent humans, for whom fusion of the epiphysis and diaphysis has 
already occurred. 
Adrenal cortical changes were noted in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys after 13 weeks of dosing over 
a dose range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. These changes included degeneration, necrosis and 
congestion/haemorrhage. In cynomolgus monkeys the adrenal findings were observed at doses ≥ 
0.5-fold the human exposure levels observed in subjects with RCC (mean AUC0-t,ss 1641 ng·hr/mL; Study 
AV-951-07-201). The safety margin is considered low and special attention should be given to these 
alterations.

Kidney changes, including glomerulopathy and chronic nephropathy, were observed in rats after 13 
weeks of dosing at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg (Study 6691-158). Based upon a calculated human equivalent 
dose, 0.3 mg/kg is 2-fold the recommended clinical dose. Increases in urinary albumin, urobilinogen and 
other proteins were also noted. The kidney lesions in the 1.0 mg/kg were more severe at the recovery 
than at terminal sacrifice and were observed at 2- to 7-fold the approximate human equivalent dose. 
Similar kidney lesions were not observed in cynomolgus monkeys. In the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2 
caution is advised with tivozanib use in patients with severe renal impairment as clinical experience is 
limited.  
In the gastrointestinal system, occasional macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed, including 
congestion and hyperplasia/metaplasia of the fundic epithelium in rats dosed with ≥ 0.3 mg/kg for 13 
weeks (Study 6691-158). This was observed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with severity and 
frequency increasing in a dose- and duration-responsive manner. The adverse clinical observations and 
histopathological findings reversed after cessation of treatment. 
Although they were considered not primary toxicities associated with tivozanib hydrochloride, liver and 
bile duct inflammation and biliary hypertrophy/hyperplasia were noted after sustained tivozanib 
hydrochloride administration in rats administered ≥ 0.3 mg/kg for 13 weeks. Elevations in ALT and AST 
were observed in rats. Pronounced changes considered secondary to bile duct inflammation occurred in 
the pancreas (atrophy) and duodenum (transmural and mucosal hypertrophy). 
The mechanism of the adrenal, renal and gastrointestinal toxicities is unknown; however, similar changes 
have been observed with other VEGF inhibitors such as sunitinib and pazopanib (CDER, 2009; Hamberg 
et al, 2010; Patyna et al, 2008). It is likely that the adrenal, renal and gastrointestinal toxicities noted in 
nonclinical models after tivozanib hydrochloride administration are a result of the VEGF dependence of the 
normal microvasculature in these organ systems; however, the impact of these changes at clinically 
relevant dose levels has minimal impact on the overall health of the animal.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride did not produce genotoxic, mutagenic or clastogenic effects in any of the systems 
tested. As it is intended for advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma, in accordance with ICH S9 Nonclinical 
Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, carcinogenicity studies are not required. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, abnormalities were noted in growing incisors (thin brittle teeth, 
tooth loss, malocclusions) at doses approximately 2-fold greater than the calculated human equivalent 
dose and growth plate hypertrophy was observed at doses approximately 0.7- to 7-fold greater than the 
calculated human equivalent dose. Tivozanib was shown to cause growth plate hypertrophy, absence of 
active corpora lutea and no maturing follicles in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels that produced 
exposures equivalent to those seen at the recommended clinical dose.  
In studies assessing mating and fertility parameters in male rats, doses > 2-fold higher than the 
recommended clinical dose, produced increased epididymis and testis weights associated with infertility. 
Increased testis weights were observed at a dose 7-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose.   
In female rats, an increase in non-viable foetuses was noted at a dose 0.7-fold the recommended clinical 
dose, while dose levels ≥ 2 fold the recommended clinical dose resulted in infertility (see SmPC section 
5.3). 
Tivozanib was shown to be teratogenic, embryotoxic and foetotoxic in pregnant rats at dose levels 5 times 
lower than the recommended clinical dose (based on a 60 kg human). Studies in pregnant rabbits showed 
no effect on maternal health or embryo foetal development at doses approximately 0.6 times the human 
exposure at the recommended dose (see SmPC section 5.3).  
The fertility and embryo foetal findings observed in rats are consistent with the intended pharmacology of 
VEGF inhibition (Hoeben et al, 2004; Josko et al, 2000). Vascular endothelial growth factor is a key 
Assessment report

regulator of angiogenesis during embryogenesis and skeletal growth. A number of studies have indicated 
that angiogenesis is critical to placental and foetal development; therefore, the inhibition of angiogenesis 
after administration of VEGF inhibitors such as sunitinib and tivozanib hydrochloride would be expected to 
have adverse effects on pregnancy.  
In conclusion, reproductive toxicity studies in rats showed that tivozanib hydrochloride affected fertility 
and foetal development in rats. Reproductive studies in rabbits showed no tivozanib 
hydrochloride-mediated effects at the highest dose tested. Because of these reproductive toxicity 
findings, tivozanib hydrochloride is not recommended in pregnant women (See SmPC section 4.6.). 
The applicant performed an ERA in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment 
of Medicinal Products for Human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). A PEC surface water (0.000281 mg/L) 
based on a DOSEAI of 1.34 mg /inhabitant day and a fraction market penetration of 0.00042 (orphan 
drug  designation  for  renal  carcinoma  effects),  resulted  very  low  and  did  not  trigger  the  action  limit 
calculation. A log Kow value of 4.09 at 40ºC has also been calculated by HPLC and demonstrated to be 
below 4.5 (action limit for PBT screening); however these ERA data do not allow definite conclusions on 
the  potential  hazard  of  tivozanib  to  the  environment.  Thus,  regarding  the  possible  hazard  impact  of 
tivozanib  (Log  Kow  5.2  at  pH  7.4)  in  the  environment,  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  a 
stepwise assessment, taking into account results of  the amount produced per year and /or the ready 
biodegradability test. In the event that the substance is not degraded, persistence in the water / sediment 
system study and bioaccumulation in fish should be performed. Depending on the results of both studies, 
a further toxicity study may be requested.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of tivozanib are sufficiently characterised and relevant information is included in 
the SmPC.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The Applicant should perform the evaluation of tivozanib as a substrate of OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
P-gp, BCRP, BSEP and MRP2. Based on the findings collected, a discussion on the need for further 
interaction studies should be provided along with the study reports.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
In study AV-951-10-115 all 30 enrolled healthy volunteers received at least one dose, and 29 completed 
the study. In this 2x2 crossover study, subjects received a single oral dose of 1.5 mg tivozanib 
hydrochloride (equivalent to 1340 microgram tivozanib) after a 10-hour fast or within 30 minutes after a 
high-fat meal. PK samples were collected predose and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 96, 168, 336, 
and 504 hours post-dose. The washout period was 6 weeks.  
In 30 healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of tivozanib hydrochloride in the fasted state the 
following PK parameters were derived: 
Table 9: Summary of PK parameters for tivozanib in the fasted state (study AV-951-10-115) 
Following oral administration of tivozanib, peak serum levels are achieved after approximately 2 to 
24 hours. After a single 1340 microgram dose, mean Cmax was 10.2 to 25.2 ng/mL across healthy subject 
and patient studies. Single dose AUC0-inf for healthy volunteers dosed with 1340 microgram tivozanib was 
1,950 to 2,491 ng.hr/mL. After once daily dosing of 1340 microgram tivozanib for 21 or 28 days in RCC 
patients, Cmax was 67.5 to 94.3 ng/mL and AUC0-24 was 1,180 to 1,641 ng.hr/mL. Exposure is dose 
proportional between 890 and 1340 microgram and dose-related over the wider range of 450 mg and 
1790 microgram. Accumulation at steady-state is approximately 6- to 7-fold the exposure observed at

single-dose levels.  Clearance is similar between acute and chronic dosing indicating no time-dependent 
changes in PK.  (See SmPC section 5.2.) 
Food effect study (AV-951-10-115) 
The effect of food on the PK of tivozanib hydrochloride was investigated in study AV-951-10-115. Food 
delayed absorption, with median Tmax of 3.0 hours and 24.0 hours in the fasted and fed state respectively. 
Multiple peaks were observed during the first 48 hours after dosing. In the fed state, there was a mean 
decrease of 23.4% for Cmax, but AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were comparable for fasted and fed states, as were 
CL/F and VZ/F.  
Table 10: Statistical Analysis for Pharmacokinetic Parameter Data (Study AV-951-10-115) 
Distribution 
In an in vitro human protein binding study (8236-152), [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride primarily 
partitioned into the plasma/serum component of blood. Protein binding was high (>99%), with no 
concentration dependence over the range 0.1 to 5 µM tivozanib hydrochloride. Albumin, rather than 
α-1-glycoprotein, is the major tivozanib hydrochloride binding component in human plasma. 
In an in vitro P-glycoprotein substrate inhibition study (8231062), the permeability of [14C]-tivozanib 
hydrochloride (0.1, 0.5 and 5 μM) was shown to be low in a Caco-2 permeability assay.  
The volume of distribution (Vz/F) after administration of the final formulation is about 100 L which has 
been confirmed by the PopPK outcomes (125 L with a 95%CI of 120-131 L). According to the PopPK 
analysis, volume of distribution (Vd) was found to increase nearly proportionally with body weight. 
Elimination 
In fasted healthy volunteers the mean half-life was 4.5 to 5.0 days (108 to 121 hours).  
Absorption, metabolism and excretion study (AV-951-10-111) 
The objective of this study was to determine the absorption and excretion kinetics (mass balance) of oral 
tivozanib hydrochloride and to characterise the metabolites present in serum, urine, and faeces in healthy 
male volunteers. After a 10 hour fast, 8 subjects were administered a single oral dose of 1.5 mg (160 µCi) 
of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride. Blood samples for PK and radio-analysis were collected pre-dose and at

1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours postdose; and at 24 hours thereafter until study 
completion. For metabolite profiling and identification, samples were taken at predose, and at 7, 14, 24, 
36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 192, 264, 360, 456, 552, and 648 hours postdose.  
Seven subjects completed the study; one subject withdrew consent for personal reasons. Median Tmax 
was 10.0 hours. Multiple peaks were observed within the first 48 hours after dosing. The mean half-life 
was 89.3 hours and 99.1 hours for [14C]-tivozanib and total radioactivity in the serum, respectively. Cmax 
and AUC values for [14C]-tivozanib were approximately 93% and 80%, respectively, of those values for 
total radioactivity in serum. Across all subjects, the mean recovery of total radioactivity was 91.1%, with 
11.8% recovered in urine (as metabolites only) and 79.3% recovered in faeces. 
Figure 6: Mean (± STD) Concentration-Time Profiles for [14C]-Tivozanib (Free Base) in Serum and Total 
Radioactivity in Serum and Whole Blood (Study AV-951-10-111) 
Unchanged tivozanib was the predominant circulating component, with a median of 90.1% of the total 
radioactivity. There were no major metabolites detected at exposure levels ≥10% of the total 
radioactivity exposure.  
Unchanged tivozanib was not detected in urine. The predominant metabolites detected in urine were M29, 
M35 and M40, together representing 0.764% to 10.3% (median 4.5%) of the radioactive dose. Minor 
metabolites (M26, M27, M28 and M31) together represented 0.136% to 2.85% (median 1.48%) of the 
radioactive dose.  
In faeces, the predominant radiolabelled components were unchanged tivozanib, and the metabolites 
M37, M42 and M7/M48 co-eluting. Unchanged drug represented 7.82% to 46.1% (median 26.2%) of the 
radioactive dose. The metabolites represented 6.35% to 34.3% (median 20.5%) of the radioactive dose.

An in vitro human metabolism study (DRZZ1027) investigated the metabolic profile of [14C]-tivozanib 
hydrochloride in human liver microsomes. There was NADPH-dependent disappearance of the drug, with 
a total of 4 metabolites detected (peaks 1-4). Metabolite formation was also assessed in the presence of 
human cDNA-derived CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9*1, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6*1, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP4A11). The only CYP450 isoforms capable of 
metabolising tivozanib hydrochloride were CYP1A1 (at 0.5 and 5.0 µM) and CYP3A4 (at 5.0 µM). Three 
metabolites generated in the presence of CYP3A4 were tentatively identified as peaks 1, 3 and 4. Peak 2 
was not generated following incubation with any of the human CYP isoforms.    
In vitro study 8133-100 was conducted to structurally identify the metabolites produced in human hepatic 
microsomal incubations. Hepatic clearance was estimated to be <25% of blood flow. A total of seven 
metabolites (M1 to M7) were observed using HPLC-MS/MS methods. All metabolites were generated by 
demethylation and/or oxidation. A schematic of the proposed metabolic pathway based on these results 
is presented below: 
Figure 7: Proposed Metabolic Pathway of Tivozanib Hydrochloride from Human Hepatic Microsomal 
Incubations (Study 8133-100) 
In vitro study 8242-516 using cDNA-expressed human UGTs showed that substantial levels of 
[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride desmethyl-glucuronide metabolites were formed by several UGT enzymes 
(UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10). For this step to occur, CYP3A4 needed to 
be present.  The predominant desmethyl-glucuronide metabolite, formed by UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, 
UGT1A8, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10, was M14. Other observed glucuronide metabolites were M10 and M25.

[14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride was incubated with human hepatocytes to evaluate the in vitro metabolism 
and structurally evaluate the metabolites (study 8201725). The estimated hepatic clearance of tivozanib 
hydrochloride was estimated to be < 1% of hepatic blood flow for human hepatocytes based on > 99% 
protein binding. The observed prominent human metabolites were M10, M11, M14, M4/M5, M23 and M24. 
Of these, only M14 was present at >10% of total radioactivity.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A dose escalation study in patients with solid tumours (AV-951-03-B01) investigated the 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg 
and 2.0 mg doses (of tivozanib hydrochloride) once daily for 28 days, followed by a 14 day rest period. 
Treatment cycles were repeated in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable AEs. Forty-two 
subjects were screened and treated, and all 42 completed the study.  
Blood samples for PK assessments were collected on the first and last day of treatment for each cycle 
(Day 1 and Day 28) before dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours after dosing. On Day 2 of treatment 
for each cycle, samples were taken 24 hours after dosing on the previous day. Samples were also taken 
24 hours and 48 hours after the last drug administration on Day 28, and each day of the rest period for 
each cycle.

A Phase 1b dose finding study of tivozanib in combination with mFOLFOX6 (study AV-951-07-103) 
provided PK data after single tivozanib hydrochloride doses of 0.5 mg (n=9), 1.0 mg (n=3) and 1.5 mg 
(n=18), 5 days prior to commencement of temsirolimus:

Population Pharmacokinetics 
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis was completed to characterize the PK of tivozanib in 
healthy volunteers and in subjects with solid tumours utilising data from various studies (AV-951-03-B01, 
AV-951-09-109 [capsule data only], AV-951-07-201, and AV-951-09-301; total N = 350 subjects), and 
updated in order to include one further study (AV951-10-202). This analysis evaluated the effects of 
individual-specific covariate factors (i.e., gender, race, age, weight, serum creatinine, BMI, serum 
albumin, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and their potential 
contribution to PK variability between subjects. Volume of distribution was found to increase nearly 
proportionally with body weight. Estimates of clearance were different between males and females, with 
females having a 25.4% lower value. Gender differences in clearance were most likely responsible for the 
longer t 1/2 determined for females (128 hours) compared to males (110 hours). The clearance differences 
between males and females were independent of weight. Other parameter-covariate relations that were 
evaluated and not found to affect the PK of tivozanib  included age, ALT, AST, creatinine and race on CL/F, 
and albumin and gender on volume of distribution. 
In the population model an analysis by creatinine clearance suggests no effect of renal impairment on 
exposure however there was no data in subjects with severe impairment.  In patients with hepatic 
impairment, an increase in exposure is seen.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Three combination studies in which tivozanib hydrochloride was coadministered with temsirolimus (Study 
AV-951-07-102), mFOLFOX6 (Study AV-951-07-103), or paclitaxel (Study AV-951-08-104) assessed the 
PK of each coadministered agent as a secondary endpoint, using a limited PK sampling regimen.  
Two DDI studies were conducted in healthy volunteers with either a potent inhibitor (ketoconazole) 
(Study AV-951-11-116) or a potent inducer (rifampin) (Study AV-951-11-117) of CYP3A4 to evaluate 
their influence on the PK of tivozanib. 
Ketoconazole did not cause a clinically significant change in the PK of tivozanib, indicating that tivozanib 
hydrochloride can be dosed concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Conversely, coadministration of 
tivozanib hydrochloride with rifampin resulted in an increased apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of tivozanib 
(mean of 0.583 to 1.21 L/hr), leading to a decreased tivozanib terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) by 
approximately 55% (mean of 121 to 54.0 hours).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tivozanib potently and selectively blocks all 3 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptors (VEGFR) and 
has been shown to block various VEGF induced biochemical and biologic responses in vitro, including 
VEGF ligand induced phosphorylation of all three VEGFR 1, 2 and 3, and proliferation of human endothelial 
cells. The next most potently inhibited kinase is c-kit which is 8-fold less sensitive to inhibition by 
tivozanib compared to VEGFR 1, 2 and 3. VEGF is a potent mitogenic factor that plays a central role in 
angiogenesis and vascular permeability of tumour tissues. By blocking VEGF induced VEGFR activation, 
tivozanib inhibits angiogenesis and vascular permeability in tumour tissues, leading to inhibition of 
tumour growth in vivo. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic parameters were measured in two clinical studies, a dose escalation study 
(AV-951-03-B01) and a Phase 2 RCC study (AV-951-07-201). In response to treatment with tivozanib, 
VEGF-A levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly there was a decrease in sVEGF2 
levels (a truncated soluble form of membrane-bound VEGFR2). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI

scans were used to measure tumour perfusion. There was a trend to diminishing internal vascularization 
of tumours over time, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action.    
Secondary pharmacology 
Study AV-951-10-112 was an open-label, non-randomised, single-arm cardiac safety study of tivozanib 
to evaluate the ECG and PK-ECG dynamics in patients with solid tumours. Fifty subjects received 1.5 mg 
(tivozanib hydrochloride) daily for 21 days.  The maximum mean QTcF change from baseline was 9.3 ms 
(90% CI 5.0 ms, 13.6 ms) at Day 21, when steady state is expected. For 2 subjects (4%), there was a 
new (not present at baseline) QTcF >480 ms ≤ 500 ms. For 6 subjects (12%) there was a change of 
30-60 ms in QTcF, and in one subject (2%) a change of > 60 ms in QTcF. An exposure effect relationship 
was observed for QTcF with a slope of 0.08464. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The applicant has submitted a PK/PD report, an exposure-response analysis of tivozanib for changes in 
sVEGFR2, blood pressure, hand and foot syndrome, tumour growth, and progression-free survival in 
patients with advanced RCC. All patients in this analysis received tivozanib 1.5 mg (tivozanib 
hydrochloride) for 21 days, followed by a 7 day rest, in a 4-week cycle for multiple cycles. For every 10 
ng/mL increase in Cavg, sVEGFR-2 decreased by approximately 6%. No exposure-response relationship 
could be identified for blood pressure measurement. The observed Cavg was significantly higher among 
patients experiencing at least one hand and foot syndrome event. Exploratory plots of the change in 
tumour size in study 301 as a function of time suggested that tumours shrank more rapidly with 
increasing tivozanib exposure (Cavg). The shrinkage rate increased a maximal 0.23% per week for each 
10% increase in Cavg relative to the average value of 59 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS vs. time by 
Cavg quartile suggested that increased tivozanib exposure was associated with an increase in PFS, from 
26.4 weeks in the lowest exposure quartile to 72.1 weeks in the highest exposure quartile. 
Concentration / effect analyses for dysphonia and fatigue AEs, which were reported by 27% and 26% of 
patients in study 301 respectively were provided.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has conducted a comprehensive clinical pharmacology program. This included 7 clinical 
pharmacology Phase I studies, 6 in healthy volunteers, and one in subjects with advanced solid tumours. 
An additional 7 clinical studies also include PK endpoints. Supportive PK data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies in subjects with advanced RCC are also included. A pop PK analysis was also conducted using 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 54/123 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
tivozanib plasma concentrations from 4 clinical studies (2 phase 1 studies, 1 phase 2 study and 1 phase 
3 study). In addition, several in vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed to determine 
protein binding, metabolism, and the potential for tivozanib to cause DDIs. 
The key PK parameters of tivozanib have been derived. Although no information is provided and 
considering that the drug substance is practically insoluble in aqueous solutions across the pH range 
tivozanib can be classified as a BCS class II or class IV compound.  
Following a single dose administration of tivozanib, absorption is rapid with peak plasma concentrations 
occurring at approximately 3 hours after administration. However the absorption process is highly 
variable, probably due to enterohepatic recirculation. Tivozanib is highly bound to albumin (>99%) with 
no concentration dependence over the range 0.1 to 5 µM and widely distributed throughout the body with 
a volume of distribution (Vz/F) about 100 L. Its half-life determined in healthy volunteers is 4.5 to 5.1 
days.  
In vivo studies demonstrated that no unchanged tivozanib is excreted in the urine, and it is suggested 
that tivozanib is primarily hepatically eliminated. CYP3A4 has been identified as one of the metabolic 
pathway. This has been confirmed with the results of the in vivo studies. Drugs known to be CYP3A4 
inhibitors are not likely to affect the PK of tivozanib to a clinically meaningful extent. However induction 
of CYP3A4 results in a significant reduction of the elimination half-life of tivozanib. 
After chronic dosing of tivozanib in RCC patients for 21 days followed by 7 days without administration of 
tivozanib, tivozanib Cmin is approximately 16.0 to 30.9 ng/mL. The elimination phase was best described 
by a 1-compartment elimination model. No evidence of a second compartment was found. Upon 
inspection of concentration time profiles densely sampled subjects in study AV-951-09-109, multiple 
concentrations peaks could be observed on a single day with an overall pattern in the occurrence. This 
was indicative of enterohepatic recirculation (EHRC) of tivozanib. 
The  effects  of  subject-specific  characteristics  on  tivozanib  PK  were  evaluated  in  study  109  and  two 
important relationships were identified: gender on CL/F, and body weight on V1/F, respectively. Volume 
of distribution increased nearly proportionally with body weight as suggested by the point estimate of the 
power relationship being close to unity (0.826). This is in line with expectations, as volume of distribution 
generally scales linearly with body weight. Women showed a 25.6% lower value for CL/F than men in this 
dataset. Body weight was evaluated as an explanatory covariate on CL/F instead of and in addition to 
gender, and gave almost no improvement to the model fit. In contrast, the inclusion of gender resulted in 
a  substantial  (ΔOFV-44.8)  improvement  in  the  fit.  It  is  worth  noting  that  two  other  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors,  sunitinib  and  sorafenib,  have  been  found  to  have  gender-related  differences  in  clearance. 
Other  parameter-covariate  relations  that  were  evaluated  and  not  found  to  affect  the  PK  of  tivozanib 
included age, ALT, AST, creatinine and race on CL/F and albumin and gender on V1/F. 
In the target population the Cmax and Tmax after a single 1.5 mg tivozanib hydrochloride (equivalent to 
1340 microgram tivozanib) dose are comparable to that observed in healthy volunteers. 
The clinical pharmacology program for tivozanib hydrochloride for the treatment of patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has involved both human in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, 
tivozanib hydrochloride is characterised by having a long elimination half-life (~4.5 to 5.1 days), possibly 
due to enterohepatic recirculation process, and being highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%).  It does 
not however interact with warfarin at the protein binding level. 
Tivozanib hydrochloride has low potential to perpetrate drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) level. The applicant has performed studies to investigate inhibition 
of CYP 2B6, 2C9 and several drug transporters. Results indicated that tivozanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP 
2B6, CYP 2C8 and the drug transporter BCRP. No studies were yet presented for establishing tivozanib as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 55/123 
 
 
 
 
a drug transporter substrate, but these studies were agreed to be presented as a post-authorisation 
procedure (see discussion on non-clinical aspects and RMP). 
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that ketoconazole does not impair the metabolism or overall clearance 
of tivozanib. Conversely, a clinical study did show that rifampin increased the clearance of tivozanib in a 
clinically meaningful manner. It is recommended that concomitant administration of tivozanib with strong 
CYP3A4 inducers, if used, should be undertaken with caution.  Moderate CYP3A4 inducers are not 
expected to have a clinically relevant effect on tivozanib exposure. Herbal preparations containing St. 
John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) are contraindicated. If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, this 
should be stopped before starting tivozanib treatment. The inducing effect of St John’s wort may persist 
for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
A total of 14 clinical studies have been completed, including 5 studies in healthy volunteers and 1 study 
in subjects with or without hepatic impairment, as well as 5 monotherapy and 3 combination therapy 
studies in subjects with solid tumours.  
Studies involving healthy volunteers assessed mass balance and in vivo metabolism, DDIs (ketoconazole 
and rifampin), bioequivalence and food effect. The potential for DDIs with combination therapies was also 
assessed in subjects with solid tumours. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tivozanib in humans are characterized by a variable absorption period with 
a median time to peak serum concentration (Tmax) ranging from approximately 2 to 24 hours in most 
studies. This is most likely due to enterohepatic recirculation of tivozanib, which was also seen in 
non-clinical mouse, rat and monkey studies. 
Exposure (Cmax and AUC) of tivozanib generally increased in a dose-proportional manner across the dose 
range evaluated (0.5 mg to 2.0 mg). Accumulation at steady-state is approximately 6- to 7- fold the 
exposure observed at single-dose levels, which is consistent with the long terminal elimination half-life 
(t½) of tivozanib (~4.5 to 5.1 days). Clearance is similar between acute and chronic dosing indicating no 
time-dependent changes in PK. 
The PK of tivozanib in general is similar in subjects with solid tumours compared to healthy volunteers, 
with slightly higher variability of parameters found in subjects with solid tumours. Dosing with food 
(Study AV-951-10-115) was shown not to have a significant impact on the exposure (AUC) of tivozanib 
compared to the fasted state (although a reduction in Cmax is observed). 
In the mass balance study (Study AV-951-10-111), the majority of circulating radioactivity was 
associated with unchanged tivozanib. No major metabolites were detected in the serum at exposure 
levels ≥ 10% of the total radioactivity exposure, indicating there were no disproportionate metabolites 
present in humans. The mean total radioactivity recovered was 91.1%, with a mean of 79.3% recovered 
from faeces. Urine accounted for a mean 11.8% of recovered radioactivity. There was no detectable 
parent compound in urine but various metabolites were detected. Unchanged tivozanib was the major 
component in faeces suggesting incomplete absorption and/or biliary excretion. 
When tivozanib was evaluated in a food effect study in healthy subjects, a high fat meal decreased the 
peak serum concentrations (Cmax) by 23% compared to the fasted state. There was no effect of food on 
the overall exposure (AUC). Based on these data, tivozanib can be taken with or without food (see SmPC 
section 4.2).  
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, it is suggested that there is a relationship between 
gender and tivozanib clearance. Females were found to have a 25.6% lower clearance compared to 
males. Also based on the Population PK analysis body weight did show a significant correlation with 
tivozanib volume of distribution.

Results from a single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tivozanib in 
subjects with hepatic impairment show that across the entire measurement period, tivozanib was 
eliminated more slowly in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) 
hepatic impairment. Tivozanib exposure was increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (mean 
AUC0-∞ by 4.0-fold) and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (mean AUC0-∞ by 2.6-fold).  No 
significant increase in exposure was observed in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic 
impairment (mean AUC0-∞ by 1.2-fold). Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when administering 
tivozanib to patients with mild hepatic impairment (see SmPC section 4.2).  Tivozanib should be used with 
caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and the dose reduced to one 1340 microgram 
capsule every other day.   
Tivozanib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). All patients should have liver function tests evaluated, including aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (AP), to determine hepatic function before 
starting and during treatment with tivozanib. 
Clinical studies with tivozanib were conducted in RCC patients with serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2 
times the upper limit of normal, including those who may have had a prior nephrectomy. Although the 
impact of further impairment of renal function on the overall disposition of tivozanib is unknown, a clinical 
study has shown that no unchanged tivozanib is excreted in the urine indicating that tivozanib does not 
undergo renal excretion. According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis of tivozanib exposure, no 
dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Experience of tivozanib 
use in patients with severe renal impairment is limited and caution is advised (See SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2).  
Tivozanib hydrochloride inhibits VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 and has been shown to block various VEGF-induced 
biochemical and biologic responses in vitro. In response to treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride, 
VEGF-A levels increase in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly there is a decrease in sVEGF2 levels. 
(See section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The applicant conducted a cardiac safety study. At steady state, the mean QTcF change was 9.3 ms (90% 
CI 5.0 ms, 13.6 ms). An exposure effect relationship was observed for QTcF with a slope of 0.08464. 
According to ICH E14, tivozanib exceeds the threshold level of regulatory concern, since the upper bound 
of the 90% confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval 
is greater than 10 ms. However, only one event of QTc prolongation was identified in the core RCC 
monotherapy studies (see discussion on clinical safety). QT/QTc interval prolongation may lead to an 
increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. It is recommended that tivozanib be used with caution in 
patients with a history of QT interval prolongation or other relevant pre-existing cardiac disease and those 
receiving other medications known to increase the QT interval. Baseline and periodic monitoring of 
electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the 
normal range is recommended (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
The exposure response analyses for dysphonia suggested that there is a clear relation to plasma 
concentrations in males and that the probability of a dysphonia event is smaller in women. The reason for 
the observed difference between the genders is unknown. Even if a larger proportion of women would 
have been dose reduced (not explored) it is difficult to see that dose reductions from 1.5 mg to 1 mg 
(tivozanib hydrochloride) which would result in 33% reduction of exposure could explain the difference 
observed, but rather suggests that plasma concentration alone is not a good predictor of dysphonia 
events. 
There was no significant relation between tivozanib concentration during Cycle 2 of treatment and fatigue 
of any grade when explored separately. For events of fatigue grade ≥3, the medical history of fatigue was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 57/123 
 
 
 
 
a strong predictor although the number of grade ≥3 events were relatively few hence the prediction is 
uncertain. Gender was not a significant explanatory factor. A significant relation to Cavg could only be 
identified after medical history of fatigue was included in the model. The observed proportion of patients 
having a severe fatigue event was low for patients without prior history of fatigue (5 out of 57 in the 
highest exposure quintile) while the observed proportion of patients having a severe fatigue event in 
patients with a prior history of fatigue was substantially higher although the overall number of patients 
was low (3 out of 7) in the highest exposure quintile. Given the low number of patients with a severe 
fatigue event these results should be interpreted with some caution but suggests that medical history of 
fatigue is more important than plasma exposure in predicting risk of grade ≥3 adverse events. 
There appears to be an exposure-response relationship for grade ≥3 hypertension in patients without a 
history of hypertension. As might be expected, patients with a history of hypertension have a higher 
probability of grade ≥3 hypertension irrespective of exposure. The finding of an exposure-response 
relationship for grade ≥3 hypertension is consistent with the known mechanism of action. Section 4.4 of 
the proposed SmPC includes a warning to reduce the dose or interrupt treatment and to consider 
discontinuation of treatment in cases of persistent severe hypertension, posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome, or other complications of hypertension. In addition, section 4.2 includes 
general advice to temporarily interrupt treatment and/or to lower the dose to 890 micrograms in the 
event of undesirable effects. The SmPC recommendations are supported by the outcome of the 
exposure-response analysis for hypertension AEs, and are acceptable.   
There appears to be an exposure-response relationship for sVEGFR-2, HFS, tumour growth and PFS. 
There also appears to be an exposure-response relationship for grade ≥3 hypertension in patients without 
a history of hypertension. As might be expected, patients with a history of hypertension have a higher 
probability of grade ≥3 hypertension irrespective of exposure. (See discussion on clinical Safety, SmPC 
section 4.4 and RMP).   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical Pharmacology aspects of tivozanib are well characterised and all relevant information is 
included in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose-response studies 
The first-in-human phase 1 Study AV-951-03-b01 was a dose escalation study designed to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose of tivozanib hydrochloride. The initial dose selected for the study was 2.0 mg 
tivozanib hydrochloride once daily, with a dosing regimen of 4 weeks of treatment followed by a 2-week 
rest period. The starting dose was based on the highest non-severely toxic dose observed in monkeys and 
the minimally effective dose in pharmacology studies.  
The study evaluated further doses of 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg (tivozanib hydrochloride) and reported a 
dose-dependent effect of tivozanib hydrochloride on both dose limiting toxicity and hypertension (see 
also section Dose proportionality and time dependencies). Exploratory efficacy results from this study 
showed that 4/12 (33%) patients in the Efficacy Population at the 1.5 mg dose level had documented SD. 
Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated dose-dependent increases in serum VEGF-A levels, 
dose-dependent decreases in serum soluble VEGFR-2 levels and a dose-dependent reduction in tumour 
perfusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 58/123 
 
 
 
 
The maximum tolerated dose was 2 mg in study AV-951-03-B01 (protocol KRN951/03-B01), whereas the 
1.5 mg dose was identified as the highest dose level with an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and was 
the dose selected for evaluation in other monotherapy clinical trials of tivozanib in patients with solid 
tumours.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies)

Treatments 
Tivozanib  hydrochloride  was  administered  in  4-week  cycles  consisting  of  once-daily  oral  tivozanib 
hydrochloride 1.5 mg for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Sorafenib was administered in 4-week 
cycles consisting of twice-daily oral sorafenib 400 mg for 4 weeks with no rest period.  
Patients  continued  to  receive  their  assigned  treatment  until  they  experienced  disease  progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, death or another reason to withdraw.  
Chemotherapy, biological therapy (including cytokines, signal transduction inhibitors, monoclonal 
antibodies), immunotherapy, or any other therapy for RCC was prohibited. However limited radiotherapy 
was permitted with interruption of study drug during treatment.  
Dose reductions and interruptions were recommended for study-drug related AEs grades 3 and 4, 
respectively. The sorafenib dose could be reduced to 400 mg once daily, then 400 mg once every other 
day. If toxicities resolved to ≤ Grade 1, the sorafenib dose could be re-escalated. If tivozanib or sorafenib 
was interrupted for Grade 4 toxicity; a lower dose was restarted as soon as toxicity improved to ≤ Grade 
2. If study drug was interrupted for more than 2 weeks, the patient was discontinued from the study.  
Specific protocol guidance was provided for the development of hypertension in patients taking tivozanib. 
Depending on the severity of hypertension, and the response to anti-hypertensive treatment, tivozanib 
could be continued at 1.5 mg (tivozanib hydrochloride) daily, interrupted and resumed at 1.0 mg 
(tivozanib hydrochloride) daily, or stopped. Specific protocol guidance was also provided in the event of 
skin toxicity with sorafenib.  
Patients who completed 2 years on study with no PD were given the option to continue treatment in an 
extension protocol (AV-951-09-902).  
Patients in the sorafenib arm of 951-09-301 who experienced radiographic evidence of PD were given the 
option to cross over to receive tivozanib in AV-951-09-902.  
Patients randomised to tivozanib were discontinued from the study once progression was confirmed by 
IRR and continued treatment with standard of care as per local availability of therapy. 
Objectives/endpoints 
The study was designed to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, PK and kidney-specific 
symptoms/health outcome measurements of subjects with advanced RCC randomised to treatment with 
tivozanib hydrochloride or sorafenib. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS by IRR assessment - defined as the time from randomisation to 
first documentation of PD or death due to any reason, whichever came first. 
Secondary objectives included: 
•  Comparison of the OS of patients randomised to treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride or 
sorafenib, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to date of death due to any 
cause and was analysed in the ITT population. 
•  Comparison  of  the  ORR,  DR  and  SD  of  patients  randomised  to  treatment  with  tivozanib 
hydrochloride or sorafenib,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 60/123 
 
 
 
 
ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR, relative to the total population of 
randomised  patients.  DR  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  first  documentation  of  objective 
tumour response according to RECIST to the first documentation of objective tumour progression 
or to death due to any reason. ORR, DR and duration of SD were analysed in the ITT population 
using both the Investigator and IRR assessments.   
•  Comparison of the safety and tolerability of tivozanib hydrochloride and sorafenib. 
•  Comparison of kidney-specific symptoms and health outcome measurements in patients 
randomised to treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride or sorafenib.  
•  Evaluation of the PK of tivozanib hydrochloride. 
• 
Patient reported outcomes. 
The following quality of life assessments were self-administered on the Day 1 visit of each cycle, and 
at the end of treatment visit: 
•  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G): a 27-question instrument to 
measure general quality of life in 4 domains - physical, social/family, emotional, and functional 
well-being.   
•  FACT - Kidney Symptom Index - Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS): a 9-question 
abbreviated version of the FKSI designed to specifically measure kidney cancer-related symptoms. 
•  European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D): a general measure of health status that 
measures 5 descriptors of current health state - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression. 
A tertiary objective was to study biomarkers in blood and archived tissue samples but this was never 
completed.  
Patients  underwent  disease  assessment  at  screening,  following  cycle  2  and  every  subsequent 
even-numbered cycle, with response determined by RECIST, Version 1.0.  
Sample size 
The median PFS in the sorafenib arm was hypothesised to be 6.7 months. Assuming a target HR of 0.70, 
equivalent to a 30% risk reduction (median of 6.7 months in the sorafenib control arm versus 9.7 months 
in the tivozanib arm) in PFS, the study would have more than 90% power to test the tivozanib regimen 
versus sorafenib using a two-sided 5% alpha log-rank test. A sample size of approximately 500 patients 
(250 patients per treatment arm) with a total number of 310 events (death or progression) was projected 
for this analysis. A dropout rate of 3% per treatment arm and accrual of approximately 40 patients per 
month would be assumed. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to tivozanib hydrochloride or sorafenib. Randomisation was 
stratified by geographic region (North America/Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe or rest of world); 
number of prior treatments for metastatic RCC (0 or 1); and number of metastatic sites/organs involved 
(1 or ≥ 2) as assessed by an independent radiologist. Randomisation was performed using an Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS). Treatments were randomly assigned to patients within the strata using a 
complete randomised block design. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 61/123 
 
 
 
 
A formal treatment cross-over was not built into the study design; however, patients randomised to 
sorafenib were given the option of crossing over to tivozanib hydrochloride in extension Study 
AV-951-09-902 if they developed radiographically documented PD as defined by RECIST and met other 
eligibility criteria. Patients randomised to tivozanib were discontinued from the study once progression 
was confirmed by IRR and continued treatment with standard of care as per local availability of therapy. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an unblinded (open-label) study. However IRR was blinded to treatment allocation. 
Statistical methods 
The ITT population was defined as all randomised patients. For the ITT population, treatment group was 
designated according to initial randomisation, regardless of whether the patients received the assigned 
study drug. The ITT population was used for the analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The per-protocol (PP) population was defined as all randomised patients who remained in the study for at 
least 8 weeks (2 cycles) (unless discontinued due to death or disease progression) and had no major 
protocol violations that would confound the effects of treatment in the judgment of the Sponsor medical 
monitor. 
The primary efficacy analysis was to compare PFS between treatment groups in the ITT population. The 
primary analysis of PFS was to be performed when approximately 310 PFS events had occurred. This 
analysis was considered positive if the 2-sided stratified log-rank test for PFS, where the stratification 
factors (as entered into the IVRS) were number of prior treatments (0 or 1) and number of metastatic 
sites/organs involved (1 or ≥ 2), was significant at the 5% level. Region was not included in the analysis 
at the request of the FDA who was concerned about the number of stratification factors. 
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed. Sensitivity analysis 1 used the investigator assessment 
of response and added in clinical PDs. For sensitivity analysis 2, initiation of new anti-cancer treatment 
was considered an event. For sensitivity analysis 3, discontinuation of therapy and initiation of new 
anti-cancer treatment were considered events. In these 2 analyses, also based on the IRR assessments, 
all deaths or PDs were events, even those occurring after 2 or more missed tumour assessments. 
Sensitivity analysis 4 used the IRR assessments and backdated any PD events that occurred immediately 
after missing or not evaluable (NE) assessments. If the PD occurred immediately after a NE assessment 
(or series of NE assessments), the PD date was the date of the first NE assessment preceding the PD. If 
the PD occurred immediately after a missing assessment (or series of missing assessments), the PD date 
was the date of the first missing assessment preceding the PD.  
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to date of death due to any cause. In the 
absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the last date the patient was known to be 
alive (as determined by a sweep conducted prior to the analysis) or the sweep date for the analysis, 
whichever was sooner. For the interim analysis of OS, patients known to have died between the sweep 
date (19 September 2011) and the snapshot (15 December 2011) were censored at the sweep date. For 
patients with no data beyond randomisation, survival times were censored on the date of randomisation.  
Overall survival was compared between the 2 treatment groups using the stratified log-rank test, where 
the stratification matched that used in the primary analysis for PFS. The hazard ratio was estimated using 
the Cox proportional hazard (PH) regression model. The distribution of OS was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. The HR for treatment was estimated using the Cox proportional hazard regression 
model. The unstratified and stratified log rank tests, where the stratification included the factors over 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 62/123 
 
 
 
 
which randomisation was stratified, were also performed. Kaplan-Meier plots of the survival distribution 
function by treatment group were produced.  
The ORR and corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CIs were presented for each treatment group. The disease 
control rate (proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD) was also presented for each treatment group. For 
the overall analysis, the confirmed ORR was compared between the 2 treatment groups using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, where the stratification matched that used in the primary PFS analysis.  
The estimate of the odds ratio for treatment (using the sorafenib arm as the reference treatment) and 
corresponding 95% CI were presented. The stratification factors were number of prior treatments (0 or 
1); and number of metastatic sites/organs involved (1 or ≥ 2). 
For the overall analysis, the confirmed ORR was compared between the 2 treatment groups using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, where the stratification matched that used in the primary PFS analysis. 
The estimate of the odds ratio for treatment (using the sorafenib arm as the reference treatment) and 
corresponding 95% CI were presented.  
DR was calculated only for patients who had an objective tumour response (confirmed). Response was 
confirmed by repeat evaluations performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first 
met. Duration of SD was defined as the time from randomisation to the first time the RECIST criteria for 
progression were met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since study treatment 
started. DR and duration of SD data were censored on the day following the date of the last tumour 
assessment documenting absence of PD for patients who were given antitumour treatment other than 
study drug or for patients who were removed from study follow-up prior to documentation of objective 
tumour progression. DR and duration of SD were analysed in a similar manner as PFS and OS.

North America/Western Europe contributed 40 randomised patients (7.7%) and the rest of the world 
contributed 20 randomised patients (3.9%).  
All patients were randomised between February 2010 and August 2010. The study dates were 
11/02/2010 (first patient dosed) to 10/06/2013 (last patient completed). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 27/07/2009. There were 4 major protocol amendments, including the 
following changes: 
Protocol amendment 1.0 Dated 17/08/2009 
The length of time patients with documented stable disease or an objective response could continue to 
receive study drug was changed from “up to 1 year” to “up to 2 years” from the first dose as long as 
tolerability was acceptable.  Patients with radiological evidence of progressive disease as assessed by the 
investigator, on either treatment arm, should continue treatment until PD was verified by an independent 
radiologist within 48 hours, except in the following situations: Greater than 50% increase in measurable 
disease per RECIST as assessed by the investigator; Appearance of new lesions, at least one of which 
measure > 20mm by CT scan or > 10mm by spiral CT scan as assessed by the investigator; Significant 
clinical deterioration that is indicative of progressive disease as assessed by the investigator. 
Protocol amendment 2.0 Dated 18/10/2010 
It was clarified that the number of metastatic sites/organs used in stratification was as determined by the 
independent radiologist. The exclusion criteria were amended to include all CNS metastases, unless 
previously treated and stable. All patients were to be followed until death from any cause.  
Protocol amendment 3.0 Dated 02/06/2011 
Text was added to specify that patients with radiological evidence of PD per local radiology assessment 
were to continue study drug until PD was verified by an independent radiologist and that images were to 
be submitted for independent review as soon as possible. The only exception was significant clinical 
deterioration indicative of progressive disease as assessed by the investigator. Tumour assessments were 
to be continued after discontinuation for patients who discontinued for reasons other than PD. After 
protocol amendment 3, all patients with evidence of PD as assessed by the investigator, on either 
treatment arm, were to continue treatment until PD was verified by an independent radiologist. Only 
patients with significant clinical deterioration indicative of PD as assessed by the investigator were 
exempt from verification by IRR review prior to discontinuation. 
Protocol amendment 4.0 26/09/2011 
It was clarified that patients who had PD, unacceptable toxicity, etc. were to be discontinued from 
receiving study drug, not necessarily from study participation. Patients could continue to be followed up 
for long-term response and survival.   
Protocol violations and deviations 
There were 13 eligibility violations in the tivozanib group compared to 14 in the sorafenib group. There 
were 24 occurrences of prohibited medicines (e.g. CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors, full dose 
anticoagulants) in the tivozanib group compared to 30 in the sorafenib group. Finally, there was one 
incidence of dosing beyond 30 days after confirmation of PD in the tivozanib group.  
For patients in the tivozanib group, there was a lower occurrence of deviations associated with missed 
doses (20 occurrences vs 112 occurrences in the sorafenib group) and other study drug deviations (3 
occurrences vs 45 occurrences in the sorafenib group). 
Data cut-off for AV-951-09-301 was 10/07/2013 and for the extension 951-09-902 was 20/01/2015.

The most frequent prior treatment for prior metastatic disease was interferon-alpha, which had been used 
as monotherapy in 75 (28.8%) patients in the tivozanib treatment group and 62 (24.1%) patients in the 
sorafenib group. Interferon-alpha was used in combination with one or more other anticancer agents in a 
further three patients in the tivozanib group and a further 15 patients in the sorafenib group. Two patients 
in the tivozanib group and two patients in the sorafenib group had received prior treatment with 
interleukin-2 with a further sorafenib patient receiving leukinferon (IFN plus a complex of cytokines) (See 
table below).

All 517 patients who were randomised to study treatment were included in the ITT population, which was 
the primary analysis population. A total of 444 patients (223 in the tivozanib group and 221 in the 
sorafenib group) were included in the PP population.

c Two subjects (Subject 433-001 in the tivozanib group and 433-010 in the sorafenib group) were included in the 
PP population in error as both received prohibited concomitant medications (steroids) during the study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint was PFS as determined by IRR in the ITT population.  In the primary analysis which 
was conducted after 310 events had occurred, median PFS was 11.9 months for tivozanib subjects 
compared to 9.1 months for sorafenib subjects. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.797 (0.639, 0.993). The 
p-value was 0.042.

Note that MSKCC Poor is not included because the number of events was too small (2 events in 2 subjects for tivozanib, no events 
in 1 subject for sorafenib) to estimate the hazard ratio. 
In the pre-specified subset of patients who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease 
(70% of the population), the median PFS in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm was 12.7 months (95% CI: 
9.1 to 15.0) compared with 9.1 months (95% CI: 7.3 to 10.8) in the sorafenib arm with a p = 0.037 and 
a HR of 0.756.  
In the predefined subgroup of one prior therapy for metastatic RCC, tivozanib showed a median PFS of 
11.9 months vs. 9.1 months, HRR 0.877.

Overall response rate (ORR) 
Table 33 Summary of Overall Response, IRR (ITT Population)  
Duration of response 
Median duration of response (DR) by IRR was 15.0 months for tivozanib compared to 12.9 months for 
sorafenib. The hazard ratio was 0.823 (90% CI: 0.488, 1.388). When investigator assessed, including 
extension study data, the difference in median DRs was increased: 24.3 months for tivozanib vs. 12.5 
months for sorafenib.  
Quality of life 
Patient reported outcomes were measured by FACT-G total score and subscales (physical, social, 
emotional and functional well-being), FKSI-DRS, EQ-5D weighted health state index and EQ-5D VAS. In 
general the scores were comparable between treatment groups. A total of 258 out of 260 tivozanib 
patients and 254 out of 257 sorafenib patients completed the FACT-G Scale questionnaire at baseline. 
Total FACT-G Score was Mean (std) 77.05 (14.967) for tivozanib and 76.93 (15.949) for sorafenib. At the 
end of treatment 215 patients in the tivozanib arm and 214 patients in the sorafenib arm completed the 
questionnaire and the scores were Mean (std) 73.53 (17.781) and 73.04 (18.110) respectively, changes 
from baseline were -3.66 (14.995) for tivozanib and -4.82 (14.684) for sorafenib. The results were not 
statistically significant.

Supportive studies 
There are three studies to support the efficacy in advanced RCC: the Phase 3 extension study, and two 
Phase 2 studies.  
Phase 3 extension study AV-951-09-902 
This study was set up as an open-label extension protocol for the pivotal study (AV-951-09-301).  
Patients were enrolled and treated as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients who were randomised to tivozanib and completed the pivotal study with no PD were 
continued on tivozanib 
Patients who had RECIST documented PD on tivozanib during the pivotal study were not enrolled, 
but were transferred to local standard of care   
Patients who were randomised to sorafenib and completed the pivotal study with no PD were 
continued on sorafenib 
Patients who had RECIST documented PD on sorafenib during the pivotal study were offered 
tivozanib 
Patients who continued sorafenib during the extension study were offered cross-over to tivozanib 
on progression 
Exclusion criteria included: progression of CNS metastases, haematological or serum chemistry 
abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension and treatment with another anti-cancer therapy.  
The dosing regimens were as for the pivotal study. Treatment was continued until clinical or documented 
PD, or unacceptable toxicity. Disease and responses assessment were conducted by the investigator; 
there was no IRR.  
The study dates were 24/05/2010 to 04/07/2014. A total of 277 patients were enrolled. Of these, 161 
who were initially randomised to sorafenib received at least one dose of tivozanib in the extension study. 
This includes 14 patients who started the extension study on sorafenib, six of whom had documented PD 
in the pivotal study. Eighty-eight patients who were initially randomised to tivozanib received at least one 
dose of tivozanib in this study. Twenty-eight patients who were initially randomised to sorafenib received 
at least one dose of sorafenib in this study (but did not cross-over to tivozanib). The patient flow through 
both studies is illustrated below:

Efficacy results 
Median PFS by investigator assessment, including data from the pivotal and extension study for the ITT 
population, was 14.7 months for tivozanib patients compared to 9.7 months for sorafenib patients 
(p=0.006). The hazard ratio was 0.755 (95% CI: 0.617, 0.922).   
For the 161 patients who crossed over to tivozanib, ORR was 18.0% (95% CI: 12.4%, 24.8%), all PR. 
Median duration of PR was 15.2 months. One hundred and eight patients (67.1%) had PD or died on 
study; median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 7.3 to 12.7 months). Seventy-eight patients (48.4%) died 
on study; median OS from the start of the first dose in this study was 21.6 months (95% CI: 17.0 to 27.6 
months). 
For patients who remained on initial randomised tivozanib or sorafenib, the ORR was 55.7% (95% CI: 
44.7%, 66.3%) and 57.1% (95% CI: 37.2%, 75.5%) respectively. Thirty-five (39.8%) patients on 
tivozanib treatment and 1 (3.6%) patient on sorafenib treatment had PD or died on this study.

Phase 2 study (AV-951-07-201) 
This was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomised, discontinuation trial of tivozanib in patients with 
metastatic or recurrent RCC, or RCC not amenable to surgical intervention. This study enrolled subjects at 
28 sites in Russia, Ukraine and India. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the safety 
of tivozanib, ORR at 16 weeks, and proportion remaining progression-free for 12 weeks following 
randomised assignment to tivozanib or placebo at 16 weeks.  
Of the 274 subjects enrolled, 272 received tivozanib hydrochloride 1.5 mg daily (3 weeks on, 1 week off) 
during the initial 16-week open-label period. After 16 weeks, treatment assignment was determined by 
disease status (using RECIST criteria): 
•  Subjects with ≥25% tumour shrinkage continued dosing with open-label tivozanib for 12 weeks 
at current dose, unless PD or intolerable toxicity.  
•  Subjects with <25% tumour growth or shrinkage were randomly allocated to tivozanib at current 
dose or placebo, in a double-blind design, for 12 weeks at current dose, unless PD or intolerable 
toxicity. Those with PD had treatment unblended – those on tivozanib were discontinued, and 
those on placebo were offered tivozanib.  
•  Subjects with ≥25% tumour growth or other evidence of progression were discontinued.  
All imaging studies were assessed retrospectively by IRR.  
Efficacy results 
At 16 weeks, following the initial open-label period, the ORR was 18.0% (95% CI: 13.6%, 23.1%) by IRR 
assessment. The PFS rate at 12 weeks post-randomisation (in subjects with <25% tumour growth or 
shrinkage) was 49.2% for tivozanib vs. 21.1% for placebo by IRR. The ORR for the entire study was 
30.1% (95% CI: 24.8%, 36.0%) by IRR. The ORR for the entire study for subjects with clear cell 
nephrology and nephrectomy was 35.8% (95% CI: 32.4%, 44.3%) by IRR.  
Phase 2 study (AV-951-10-202) 
This was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study of tivozanib in subjects with advanced RCC. One 
hundred and five subjects were enrolled from 21 sites in US and Canada. Subjects had unresectable 
locally recurrent or metastatic RCC and had undergone prior nephrectomy. Subjects were treatment 
naïve, or had received no more than one prior systemic therapy excluding VEGF or mTOR targeted 
therapy. Subjects received tivozanib 1.5 mg daily orally (3 weeks on, 1 week off).  After 6 months on 
study drug without PD or unacceptable toxicity, subjects were given the opportunity to enter an extension 
protocol, AV-951-09-901, to continue receiving study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion 
of subjects who were progression-free at 6 months after first dose of study drug. Tumour assessments 
were performed by the investigators. 
Efficacy results 
At 6 months, PFS was 60.9% (95% CI: 50.1%, 70.9%). ORR was 24.8% (95% CI: 16.9%, 34.1%); there 
were 2 subjects with CR.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study AV-951-09-301 was a 2-year, open-label, randomised, controlled, multi-national, 
multicentre, parallel-arm study comparing tivozanib with sorafenib in patients with advanced RCC. 
The study population had recurrent or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component and had undergone 
prior nephrectomy. Patients were treatment naïve or had received no more than one prior systemic 
treatment (immunotherapy including interferon-alfa or interleukin-2 based-therapy, chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapy or an investigational agent) for metastatic RCC. ECOG PS was 0 or 1. Patients were 
excluded if they had received any prior therapy with agents targeting the VEGF or mTOR pathway.  
As the majority (around 75-90%) of renal cell carcinomas are histologically clear cell or have a clear cell 
component, even if the pivotal study had included patients with non-clear-cell RCC (nccRCC), the 
numbers would have been small. Patients with nccRCC were included in supportive studies 201 and 202. 
Although the numbers are small, there appears to be evidence of activity of tivozanib in nccRCC albeit at 
a reduced level compared to RCC.  
The proposed indication does not specifically mention clear cell RCC. Given the evidence of activity in 
nccRCC, and the previous regulatory decisions regarding the indications for similar products, this is 
acceptable. Information on the population studied is included in SmPC section 5.1 which is sufficient.  
The chosen dose of sorafenib is the approved dose in the EU for advanced RCC. During a scientific advice 
(SA) procedure, CHMP expressed concern that sunitinib rather than sorafenib was currently considered to 
be the most active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in first-line RCC. However CHMP accepted the choice of 
sorafenib, with the comment that a demonstration of superiority would support a demonstration of 
efficacy. 
Due to the incidence of DLTs in Study AV-951-03-b01 at the highest dose level tested (2.0 mg), the 1.5 
mg dose of tivozanib hydrochloride was identified as the highest dose level with an acceptable 
safety/tolerability profile. This dose level was therefore determined as the RP2D (Eskens et al, 2011) and 
selected for further clinical studies. Following Study AV-951-03-b01 (with dosing cycles of 4 weeks of 
tivozanib hydrochloride followed by a 2-week rest period), the dosing regimen for RCC studies was altered 
to reduce the rest period to 1 week. In Study AV-951-03-b01, toxicities were rapidly reversible upon 
stopping treatment, supporting a shorter rest period. In addition, clinical data with sunitinib, another 
VEGFR inhibitor, demonstrated that some patients experienced recurrence of disease-related symptoms 
during a 14-day break in treatment (van der Veldt et al, 2008). For these reasons, the tivozanib 
hydrochloride dosing regimen was changed to 3 weeks of once-daily treatment followed by a 1-week rest 
period for the subsequent clinical study (AV-951-07-201), in an effort to maximise clinical benefit yet 
allow patients to recover from any treatment-related toxicity. This dosing regimen was also used for all 
subsequent RCC studies. 
In the SmPC section 4.2 the recommended dose of tivozanib is expressed as 1340 microgram (as this is 
the amount of tivozanib free base equivalent to 1.5 mg salt) once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day 
rest period to comprise one complete treatment cycle of 4 weeks.  
Patients who completed 2 years on study with no progressive disease (PD) were given the option to 
continue treatment in an extension protocol (09-902). In addition, patients who took sorafenib and 
experienced radiographic evidence of PD were given the option to cross over to receive tivozanib in study 
09-902. Patients randomised to tivozanib were discontinued from the study once progression was 
confirmed by independent radiological review (IRR), and transferred to standard care.  
Assessment report

The primary endpoint was PFS by independent radiological review (IRR). This was accepted as the 
primary endpoint during the CHMP SA procedure. As there was no IRR in extension study 09-902, the PFS 
using the IRR response assessment was limited to the end of Study 09-301. Key secondary endpoints 
included OS and ORR. 
The ITT population was defined as all randomised patients, and was used for the analysis of the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints. This is agreed since in an open label study every subject randomised 
should be included in the analysis regardless of whether they took the treatment.  
The ITT population was 517 patients (260 in the tivozanib arm and 257 in the sorafenib arm). Over 70% 
of the study population was male, in line with the known male preponderance for RCC. The median age 
was 59 years. This is younger than would be expected, given that RCC peaks in the 7th decade, and likely 
reflects the eligibility criteria. The majority of baseline characteristics, including cancer histories, were 
well-balanced between the groups. In each treatment arm, around 99% patients had metastatic disease 
at screening, and around 30% had a prior treatment for metastatic disease. A total of 78 (30.0%) patients 
in the tivozanib group were treated with IFN-α, alone or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, 
compared to 77 patients in the sorafenib group (30.0%). Very few received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 3 
(1.2%) in the tivozanib arm compared to 6 (2.3%) in the sorafenib arm. There was no obvious imbalance. 
The study was designed such that only patients randomised to sorafenib were permitted to cross over, 
which could potentially confound the overall survival results.  
There was an over-representation of subjects from non-EU European countries in the randomised study 
population (56%).   It is possible that it was easier to recruit in these countries because of limited 
availability of targeted therapies. Also, Investigators in many of these countries who had participated in 
the prior randomised discontinuation study were familiar with tivozanib and as a result, the study enrolled 
rapidly at the time of study initiation.  However, this over representation was unanticipated by the study 
sponsor. 
There was discordance of diagnosis between the investigator assessment and the IRR assessment in 
27.3% in the tivozanib group and 27.6% in the sorafenib group.  For patients with both IRR and 
investigator progression there was a discordance of date for 18.8% in the tivozanib group and 26.5% in 
the sorafenib group. Of these discordances around a half in each treatment arm were discordances where 
the IRR and the investigator had only been in disagreement for one assessment interval. The investigator 
assessments favoured tivozanib as they declared many more PDs on sorafenib than the IRR.  This 
highlights the issue of investigator bias and the importance of using an IRR for the primary analysis.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal study AV-951-09-301 
9% of patients with RCC are expected to be ≥ 75 years at diagnosis (Altekruse SF et al SEER cancer 
statistics review, 1975-2007. NCI 08.01.2016). The over 75 year age groups are relatively 
under-represented in the RCC clinical efficacy studies, representing only 3.1% of the pooled study 
populations. However this is a general issue for clinical studies, due to the exclusion criteria. 
Under-representation of older patients is not expected to have implications for efficacy.  
The primary endpoint was PFS as determined by IRR in the ITT population when 310 events had occurred. 
The median PFS (95% CI) was 11.9 months (9.3, 14.7) for tivozanib compared to 9.1 months (7.3, 9.5) 
for sorafenib; the hazard ratio (stratified Cox proportional hazards model) (95% CI) was 0.797 (0.639, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 91/123 
 
 
 
 
0.993) and p-value was 0.042. This updated analysis at study end is in line with the primary analysis. The 
pre-planned sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses of PFS are in line with the primary outcome. 
Internal inconsistency is noted in the large subgroups by geographical region. In the large subgroup of 
patients from Russia or Ukraine (56% of patients), the hazard ratio for PFS is 0.94 (0.70-1.26).No 
imbalance in prognostic factors was identified as a possible background cause for lack of PFS treatment 
effect in the large Russian/Ukrainian subgroup.  
Post-hoc exploratory analyses according to the geographical groupings of Russia/Ukraine and North 
America/EU were performed where the applicant highlighted the geographical imbalance in baseline 
ECOG scores. The analysis showed that for patients with an ECOG score of 1, the hazard ratio is around 
1 - in line with the Forest plot for pre-specified subgroups.  For the patients on sorafenib, ECOG score 
makes no difference to PFS outcome, and therefore was not considered a prognostic factor. Therefore the 
imbalance in ECOG status between treatment groups could not explain the observed geographical 
imbalance in PFS. The median OS (95% CI) was 28.2 months (22.5, 33.0) for tivozanib compared to 30.8 
months (28.4, 33.3) for sorafenib; the hazard ratio (stratified Cox proportional hazards model) (95% CI) 
was 1.147 (0.896, 1.470) and the p-value was 0.276. Since the study design allowed patients on 
sorafenib who had PD to receive tivozanib, there was potential for confounding and it was concluded that 
no clear difference in OS has been observed between the two treatment groups.   
The ORR outcome by IRR favours tivozanib over sorafenib, 33% vs 23%. Median duration of response by 
IRR was 15.0 months for tivozanib compared to 12.9 months for sorafenib.   
An increase in median PFS for tivozanib vs. sorafenib of 2.8 months is clinically relevant.  Sorafenib is an 
active comparator, ORR and duration of response favour tivozanib, and data from phase 2 studies are 
supportive of the efficacy of tivozanib. Taking these factors into account, it is considered that the efficacy 
of tivozanib has been demonstrated.  
Patient reported outcomes were generally comparable between treatment groups. For this un-blinded 
study, only limited conclusions can be drawn from patient-reported outcomes.   
Supportive studies 
The extension study (09-902) included 161 patients who crossed over from sorafenib to tivozanib. In this 
group, ORR was 18%. This provides some evidence of second-line activity of tivozanib in patients who 
have progressed on sorafenib. 
For the Phase 2 randomised discontinuation study (07-201), the ORR by IRR was 18% after the 16 week 
open-label period. After randomised discontinuation, the PFS rate at 12 weeks (in subjects with <25% 
tumour growth or shrinkage) was 49% for tivozanib vs. 21% for placebo by IRR. This study selected a 
population of patients who were stable on tivozanib and then tested whether this stable disease was lost 
if treatment was withdrawn. It is important to note that this study does not test the efficacy of tivozanib 
versus placebo in the target population.  
For the Phase 2 open-label single arm study (10-202), investigator-assessed ORR was 25% at 6 months. 
This is in line with the 33% rate of ORR by IRR for the pivotal study. The phase 2 studies provide 
supportive evidence of efficacy.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An increase in median PFS for tivozanib vs. sorafenib of 2.8 months is clinically relevant and is supported 
by improvement in the ORR and duration of response and data from phase 2 studies.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The integrated safety analyses were performed for the core RCC monotherapy studies (90-301, 07-201, 
10-202, 12-205 and 09-902); the other monotherapy studies (03-B01, 08-105, 10-112) and the 
extension study (09-901). Supportive safety data is available from combination therapy studies and 
studies not sponsored by the Applicant.   
Patient exposure 
During the core RCC monotherapy studies, patients received tivozanib 1.5 mg daily (3 weeks on, 1 week 
off) which is the proposed dose. A total of 835 patients with RCC received tivozanib monotherapy, of 
which 674 were randomised to receive first-line tivozanib, and 161 crossed over to tivozanib after 
progressing on the comparator sorafenib. 157 patients with RCC have been exposed to tivozanib 
monotherapy for >6 and ≤12 months, 286 patients for > 12 months and 61 patients for > 24 months. 
During the procedure, the applicant provided an updated evaluation of safety from extension study 901. 
An analysis of the relative dose intensity for 4 core RCC monotherapy studies (excluding Study 
AV-951-12-205) is presented in the following table. Relative dose intensity is defined as the actual dose 
relative to the presumed intended dose of 1.5 mg.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The incidence of AEs with an outcome of death in the pivotal study was increased in the tivozanib arm 
compared to the sorafenib arm (10.8% vs 5.8%). This is largely attributable to a higher incidence of 
deaths from neoplasm progression reported as adverse events in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm (9 
patients, 3.5%) compared with the sorafenib arm (2 patients, 0.8%). The deaths that occurred > 30 days 
after drug discontinuation were comparable between tivozanib and sorafenib arms in the pivotal study. 
One death in the tivozanib arm was associated with hypertension following a suspected overdose (3 x 1.5 
mg capsules). No information on cause of death is available for 2 deaths in the tivozanib arm of study 
09-301.   
TEAEs with an outcome of death (deaths within 30 days of the last dose of study drug) occurred in 47 of 
the 674 patients (7%) in the pooled tivozanib group of the core RCC monotherapy studies.  
Serious adverse events 
Overall in the core RCC monotherapy studies, the incidence of SAEs was 19.9%. In the pivotal study 
09-301, the incidence was 28.6% in the tivozanib arm compared to 21.8% in the sorafenib arm. This is 
partly explained by an increase in SAEs related to disease progression. 
In the pivotal study 09-301, the incidence of the SMQ Cerebrovascular ischaemia was 3.5% (9 patients) 
for tivozanib vs. 1.9% (5 patients) for sorafenib. There were 3 ischaemic strokes in the tivozanib arm 
compared to none in the sorafenib arm. The incidence of the SMQ Venous Embolic and Thrombotic Events 
may be increased for tivozanib compared to sorafenib, although the numbers are small. In the pivotal 
study 09-301, 6 patients (2.3%) on tivozanib and 2 patients (0.8%) on sorafenib reported TEAEs in this 
SMQ. There was one death due to PE, and 2 non-fatal PE cases, in the tivozanib arm and 2 deaths due to 
PE in the sorafenib arm. This may be an effect of VEGF pathway inhibition. 
The incidence of haemorrhage events was increased for tivozanib vs. sorafenib in the pivotal study. 33 
patients (12.7%) on tivozanib compared to 18 patients (7.0%) on sorafenib experienced haemorrhage 
TEAEs; there were 6 SAEs in the tivozanib arm compared to none in the sorafenib arm. Haemorrhage is 
a known risk for TKIs, including agents targeting the VEGF pathway, such as axitinib and bevacizumab.  
In the pivotal study, the incidence of cardiac failure TEAEs was 1.5% (4 patients) on tivozanib and 1.6% 
(4 patients) on sorafenib. There were 5 deaths associated with cardiac failure in tivozanib-treated 
patients, of which 3 occurred in the tivozanib arm of the pivotal study. In the sorafenib arm there were 2 
deaths associated with cardiac failure.  
There was one event of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) across the clinical 
development program. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 99/123 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were determined based on TEAEs observed within the tivozanib 
hydrochloride  program  as  well  as  possible  class  effects  seen  with  similar  agents.  Categories  of  AESI 
include: 
•  Hypertension 
•  Noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium (includes PRES) 
•  Arterial embolic and thrombotic events 
•  Venous embolic and thrombotic events 
•  Cerebrovascular ischaemia 
•  Hepatic disorders 
•  Haemorrhage 
•  Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
• 
Thyroid dysfunction 
•  Acute pancreatitis 
•  Cardiac failure 
•  Acute renal failure 
•  Wound healing 
• 
Proteinuria 
•  Hand Food Skin Reaction (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia, PPE) 
•  QT prolongation/Torsade de Pointes 
Hypertension 
In clinical studies with tivozanib hydrochloride, hypertension was the most commonly occurring TEAE. In 
almost half of the patients (39.8%), new or worsening hypertension was observed within the first 2 
months of treatment. Whilst hypertensive TEAEs occurred frequently in treated patients, and often 
required treatment with hypertensive medications, it was an infrequent cause of tivozanib hydrochloride 
discontinuation. Across all the monotherapy studies in cancer patients receiving tivozanib hydrochloride, 
there have been 8 subjects with treatment-emergent hypertensive SAEs (5 patients in the core RCC 
monotherapy studies, 3 patients in the other monotherapy studies), including one fatal TESAE of 
uncontrolled hypertension in Study AV-951-09-301. 
Noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium (includes PRES) 
Of the approximately 1,100 cancer patients treated with tivozanib, PRES, also known as reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), was confirmed in one patient, after approximately 8 
weeks on tivozanib.  
Arterial embolic and thrombotic events 
In clinical studies with tivozanib hydrochloride, arterial thromboembolic events including transient 
ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, (acute) myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 100/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been reported. Some of these events were associated with fatal outcome.  
Venous embolic and thrombotic events 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism, deep 
vein thrombosis and thrombophlebitis have been reported. Pulmonary embolism was associated with 
fatal outcomes in 0.4% of first-line tivozanib hydrochloride treated patients in the core RCC monotherapy 
studies. There were no cases in second-line tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients. 
Cerebrovascular ischaemia 
The incidence of cerebrovascular ischaemia events was 3.5% in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm and 
1.9% in the sorafenib arm in Study AV-951-09-301 and consistent across the studies.  
Haemorrhage 
In clinical studies with tivozanib hydrochloride, haemorrhagic events have been reported, including fatal 
events due to aortic aneurysm rupture and pulmonary haemorrhage.  
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
There was a low incidence (1 patient, 0.1%) of tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients with TEAEs 
relevant to gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation in the core monotherapy studies. The 
incidence was similarly low in sorafenib-treated patients (1 patient, 0.4%).  
Thyroid dysfunction 
In clinical studies with tivozanib hydrochloride hypothyroidism has been observed to occur at any time 
during treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride, developing as early as within 2 months of treatment 
initiation. Risk factors for hypothyroidism include prior history of hypothyroidism and use of anti-thyroid 
medications. Thyroid function should be monitored before initiation of and periodically throughout 
treatment with tivozanib and hypothyroidism should be treated according to standard medical practice. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis was observed infrequently (1.3%) in first-line core RCC monotherapy studies. The 
findings are consistent in Study AV-951-09-301 (0.8% in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm and 0.4% in the 
sorafenib arm). The incidence is similar for that reported with sorafenib (0.7%) (Nexavar, 2007, EPAR), 
pazopanib (0.7%) (Votrient, 2015, SmPC) and sunitinib (<1.0%) (Sutent, 2015, SmPC). Based on the AE 
profile of VEGFR inhibitors, acute pancreatitis was considered an AESI; however, the data described in 
this section are such that the frequency and severity of this AESI do not warrant any special precautions. 
Cardiac failure 
In the first-line tivozanib hydrochloride core monotherapy studies, the incidence was low (1.0%) and 
similar to the sorafenib arm of Study AV-951-09-301 (1.6%).  
Acute renal failure 
Serious impairment of renal function due to VEGFR inhibition appears to occur infrequently, an impression 
borne out in the tivozanib hydrochloride clinical program. Acute renal failure TEAEs were reported in 0.7% 
of tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients in the first-line core monotherapy RCC studies, similar to the 
sorafenib arm of Study AV-951-09-301 (0.4%).  
Wound healing 
In clinical studies, patients were excluded who had unhealed wounds, bone fractures, skin ulcers, 
inadequate recovery from surgery or patients who were undergoing major surgical procedure prior to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 101/123 
 
 
 
 
initiation of tivozanib hydrochloride and no cases of impaired wound healing have been reported during 
clinical studies.  
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported in clinical studies with tivozanib hydrochloride, so monitoring for 
proteinuria before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment is recommended. 
Hand Food Skin Reaction (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia, PPE) 
The incidence of hand foot skin reaction (which was searched for using the PT palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome) was 1.9% of the patients treated with tivozanib hydrochloride in Study 
AV-951-09-301 reported as Grade 3 events compared to 16.7% with sorafenib and which often led to 
dose reductions or interruptions for sorafenib.   
QT prolongation/Torsade de Pointes 
The SMQ QT Prolongation Torsade de Pointes / QT Prolongation identified 1 case of QT prolongation (PT 
was Electrocardiogram QT prolonged) in all core RCC monotherapy studies. The event was Grade 2, 
non-serious, considered unrelated to tivozanib and did not lead to a change in dosing. There were 2 
(4.0%) additional events of QT prolongation reported as TEAEs in the other monotherapy studies (Study 
AV-951-10-112 the cardiac safety study). Neither event was considered serious or led to a change in 
dosing, both events were considered to be related to tivozanib. 
Long-term adverse effects 
An analysis comparing TEAE incidence in the first 2 months, after 2 to 12 months and ≥ 12 months of 
treatment was performed. This analysis included all first-line treatment for patients from the core RCC 
monotherapy studies (including time in extension Study AV-951-09-901), with an additional comparison 
between the 2 treatment groups of Study AV-951-09-301. 
Only 230 first-line patients were evaluated for more than 12 months. Amongst these patients, 70.9% 
(163 patients) experienced the onset of at least one new or recurrent TEAE more than 12 months after the 
first dose of study drug. Most TEAEs increased in incidence in the second two periods evaluated, in line 
with the expected increase in background rates due to the increasing duration of exposure. 
For the on-target TEAE of hypertension and dysphonia the trend was for a decrease in the onset of these 
TEAEs over time. Hypertension tends to occur primarily within the first 2 months of treatment.  
There were no marked increases in TEAE incidence with long-term treatment. 
Although the incidence of the remaining events of interest is low such that conclusions as to whether 
events are more likely to occur within the first 2 months of treatment versus between > 2 months and ≤ 
12 months of treatment, it appears that patients who continue treatment for more than 1 year are not 
more likely to experience an event of interest. 
Most of the fatal TEAEs were reported as disease progression. Of note, during the first 2 months of 
treatment 2 patients died of pulmonary embolism, between 2 and 12 months two patients died of 
myocardial infarction and >12 months 2 patients died of acute cardiac failure. 
Laboratory findings 
Grade 3/4 haematology abnormalities occurred in 6.0% of tivozanib-treated patients across the 
evaluated first-line core RCC monotherapy studies, and had a similar overall incidence in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 102/123 
 
 
 
 
 
tivozanib-treated patients (8.1%) and sorafenib-treated patients (5.4%) in the pivotal study. Low 
haemoglobin (<8.0 g/dL) was the most common abnormality. Thrombocytopenia was more common for 
tivozanib vs. sorafenib (19% vs 13%), but the ≥ Grade 3 (platelets < 50 X 109/L) incidence was low 
(0.4% vs 0% respectively).  
Lipase increased (PT) was reported more commonly for sorafenib compared to tivozanib: 9.3% vs 4.6% 
in the pivotal study. The incidence of amylase increased (PT) was comparable: 4.2% vs 4.3%. The 
difference in lipase increased does not appear to be clinically important, since there were 2 reports of 
pancreatitis in the tivozanib arm compared to one report in the sorafenib arm.

There was one report of hypersensitivity across all monotherapy studies, for a tivozanib-treated patient 
from study AV-951-10-202. This event was Grade 1-2 in severity, was not reported as a SAE, and did not 
lead to discontinuation of study drug.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The Applicant has conducted an analysis according to concomitant use of PPI drugs. The sub-population 
using concomitant PPIs (n=53) consistently reported a higher incidence of TEAEs over the more common 
PTs, including hypertension (74% vs 41%) and dysphonia (38% vs 21%).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal study (09-301), discontinuations were comparable for the tivozanib arm vs the sorafenib 
arm: 14.7% vs 13.2%. 
There was an excess of stroke events leading to discontinuation for tivozanib vs sorafenib in the pivotal 
study. There were 9 stroke events in the tivozanib arm: 3 ischaemic stroke, 3 events of cerebrovascular 
accident, 1 cerebral ischaemia, 1 haemorrhagic stroke and 1 hemiparesis. In the sorafenib arm there 
were 2 events of cerebrovascular accident.   
Dose reduction and/or interruption of therapy due to AEs 
The most frequent PT leading to dose reduction or dose interruption was hypertension across the core 
RCC monotherapy studies (32 reports; 4.7%). In the pivotal study, more patients had a dose reduction 
due to TEAEs in the sorafenib arm vs the tivozanib arm: 37.4% vs 11.6%. In addition, more patients 
reported TEAEs leading to drug interruption in the sorafenib arm vs. tivozanib arm: 37.0% vs 22.4%.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall clinical safety assessment of tivozanib hydrochloride is based on data from the randomised 
controlled pivotal study, AV-951-09-301, and extension study AV-951-09-902 and supported by data 
from the other core RCC monotherapy studies. 
Most patients in the 5 core RCC monotherapy studies (627, 75.0%) have been exposed to single-agent 
tivozanib hydrochloride at a starting dose of 1.5 mg for ≤ 12 months, and a subset of patients from 
AV-951-07-201, AV-951-09-302 (first-line tivozanib hydrochloride treated patients into Study 
AV-951-09-902) as well as patients from extension study, AV-951-09-902 (second-line tivozanib 
hydrochloride treated patients), were exposed for > 24 months. It should be noted that the number of 
patients exposed to first line treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride for more than 24 months was higher 
than that for first line sorafenib. 
The study population consisted mainly of white, Central/Eastern Europe males. Age and Gender based 
analyses showed no major differences between male or female and <65 vs. >65 years old patients. A 
subgroup analysis of white vs. non-white patients was also done, but the small percentage of non-white 
patients (less than 6%) precludes any definitive conclusions regarding a relationship between race and 
TEAEs.   
The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) observed in the RCC population treated with 
tivozanib hydrochloride as first-line therapy were hypertension, dysphonia, fatigue and diarrhoea. Most 
TEAEs were of NCI CTCAE Grades 1-3 and were manageable. The most common ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs were 
hypertension, fatigue and asthenia. Following second-line tivozanib hydrochloride therapy in Study 
AV-951-09-902, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhoea and asthenia occurred with lower incidences than in the 
first-line core monotherapy studies but were still the most common events. 
The most common TEAEs leading to dose reduction or interruption in the RCC population treated with 
first-line tivozanib hydrochloride were hypertension and diarrhoea. The overall incidence of TEAEs leading 
to dose reductions and dose interruptions was lower in tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients than in 
sorafenib-treated patients. The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was similar in both 
treatment groups. The excess of dose interruptions and reductions in the sorafenib arm mainly due to PPE 
suggests that tivozanib may be more tolerable than sorafenib. There were 32 reports (4.7%) of 
hypertension leading to dose reduction or dose interruption across the core RCC monotherapy studies. 
The incidence of ischaemic strokes, venous embolic and thrombotic events, and haemorrhage were low, 
but marginally increased for tivozanib compared to sorafenib.  
In the pivotal study, more patients had a dose reduction due to TEAEs in the sorafenib arm vs the 
tivozanib arm: 37.4% vs 11.6%. In addition, more patients reported TEAEs leading to drug interruption 
in the sorafenib arm vs. tivozanib arm: 37.0% vs 22.4%. The differences were mainly due to an excess 
of PPE cases in the sorafenib arm, for which there was specific protocol guidance. Advice on dose 
reduction and interruption for hypertension is included in the SmPC section 4.4. 
In the Phase 3 pivotal trial (AV-951-09-301), the overall incidence of AEs with an outcome of death in the 
tivozanib hydrochloride group was 10.8% (28 of 259 patients) compared with 5.8% (15 of 257) in the 
sorafenib group. This is largely attributable to a higher incidence of deaths from neoplasm progression 
reported as adverse events in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm (9 patients, 3.5%) compared with the 
sorafenib arm (2 patients, 0.8%).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were determined based on TEAEs observed within the tivozanib 
hydrochloride program as well as possible class effects seen with similar agents. TEAEs with an outcome 
of death (deaths within 30 days of the last dose of study drug) occurred in 47 of the 674 patients (7%) in 
the pooled tivozanib group of the core RCC monotherapy studies.

The overall incidence of the following AESIs was higher in patients in the tivozanib hydrochloride-treated 
arm than in the sorafenib-treated arm in Study AV-951-09-301 (all first-line data into Study 
AV-951-09-902): hypertension (47.5% versus 37.4%), arterial embolic and thrombotic events (4.6% 
versus 3.1%), venous embolic and thrombotic events (2.3% vs 0.8%), cerebrovascular ischaemia (3.5% 
vs 1.9%), haemorrhage (12.7% versus 7.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.5% vs 1.2%), hypothyroidism (5.4% 
versus 2.3%), acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure (each 0.8% versus 0.4%) and proteinuria (9.3% 
versus 8.6%). The overall incidence of the following AESIs was higher in patients in the sorafenib-treated 
arm than in the tivozanib hydrochloride-treated arm in Study AV- 951-09-301 (all first-line data into 
Study AV-951-09-902): non-infectious encephalopathy/delirium including PRES (0.8% versus 1.2%), 
hepatic disorders (8.1% versus 10.1%), cardiac failure (1.5% versus 1.6%) and HFSR (PPE; 13.9% 
versus 54.1%). Rare cases of GI perforation and fistula formation, wound healing complications, and 
acute renal failure were observed.  
Based on the tivozanib hydrochloride clinical development program, the following safety concerns have 
been included as either an important identified or an important potential risk in the RMP (data are 
provided from SMQs and PTs): hypertension (47.5% in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm of Study 
AV-951-09-301 versus 37.4% in the sorafenib arm), arterial embolic and thrombotic events (4.6% 
versus 3.1%), venous embolic and thrombotic events (2.3% versus 0.8%), congestive heart failure 
(1.5% versus 1.6%); haemorrhage (12.7% versus 7.0%), proteinuria (9.3% versus 8.6%), and 
hand-foot skin reaction (13.9% versus 54.1%) identified as important identified risks; and hepatic effects 
(8.1% versus 10.1%), wound healing complications (0.4% in both arms), QT prolongation (none in Study 
AV-951-09-301), GI perforation and fistula formation (0.4% in both arms), PRES (1 patient in Study 
AV-951-09-301), reproductive and developmental toxicity (none reported), overdose (0.4% versus 
0.4%), and toxicities, such as persistent severe hypertension, arising from concomitant administration of 
tivozanib with medicinal products that inhibit transporters (none reported) identified as important 
potential risks in the RMP. 
Hypertension was the most frequently occurring TEAE observed in the tivozanib hydrochloride clinical 
program. There was a higher incidence of hypertension in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm than in the 
sorafenib arm in the pivotal study. One of the best documented and most frequently observed on-target 
effects of agents that target the VEGF pathway, the class of drug to which tivozanib hydrochloride 
belongs, hypertension is related to the effect of these drugs on the vasculature. Hypertension is a known 
risk factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular 
accidents. Hypertension in tivozanib hydrochloride patients was managed with anti-hypertensive 
medications as directed in the study protocols and infrequently led to dose modification; it is considered 
a manageable risk. It is recommended that blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating 
tivozanib hydrochloride therapy and that patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as 
needed with antihypertensive therapy according to standard medical practice. In the case of persistent 
hypertension despite use of antihypertensive medications, the dose of tivozanib hydrochloride should be 
reduced or the treatment interrupted and re-initiated at a lower dose once the blood pressure is 
controlled, according to clinical judgment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in case of 
severe and persistent hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, or other 
complications of hypertension. If tivozanib hydrochloride is interrupted, patients receiving 
antihypertensive medications should be monitored for hypotension (See SmPC section 4.4 and RMP). 
One patient (diagnosed with serious carcinoma) from parent Study AV-951-10-112 treated with tivozanib 
reported PRES in the extension Study AV-951-09-901 following hypertension (see SmPC section 4.8). 
PRES is a neurological disorder that may present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness 
and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. An MRI test is 
necessary  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  of  PRES.  Tivozanib  therapy  should  be  discontinued  in  patients 
developing PRES. The safety of reinitiating tivozanib therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 107/123 
 
 
 
 
not  known.  Risk  factors  for  PRES/RPLS  include  uncontrolled  hypertension  and  noncompliance  with 
antihypertensive treatment (see SmPC section 4.4, 4.8 and RMP). This class effect has been included in 
the RMP as an important potential risk. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) have occurred (see SmPC section 4.4, 4.8 and RMP). Risk 
factors for ATE include malignant disease, age > 65 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, and prior thromboembolic disease. Tivozanib must be used with 
caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of these events (such as myocardial 
infarction, stroke). 
Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been reported including pulmonary embolism and 
deep vein thrombosis (see SmPC section 4.4, 4.8 and RMP). Risk factors for VTEs include major 
surgery, multiple trauma, prior VTEs, advanced age, obesity, cardiac or respiratory failure, and 
prolonged immobility. It is recommended that treatment decision, in patients who are at risk for 
VTEs, should be based on individual patient benefit/risk assessment. 
A risk of prolonged QT/QTc was foreseen based on the findings of the cardiac safety study 10-112, and an 
evaluation of possible QT/QTc-related events in the RCC monotherapy studies. QT/QTc interval 
prolongation has been reported (see SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1). QT/QTc interval prolongation may lead 
to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The risk is adequately reflected in the SmPC (section 4.4 
and 4.8) and it is recommended that tivozanib is used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation or other relevant pre-existing cardiac disease and those receiving other medications known 
to increase the QT interval. Baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of 
electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the normal range is recommended.  
Cardiac failure has been reported; signs or symptoms of cardiac failure should be periodically monitored 
throughout treatment with tivozanib (see SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8). Management of cardiac failure 
events may require temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation and/or dose reduction of 
tivozanib therapy, plus treatment of potential underlying causes of cardiac failure e.g. hypertension.  
In the pivotal study the percentage of patients in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm with Grade 3 or higher 
elevations in ALT and AST was 2-fold less than in the sorafenib arm (ALT: 0.8% vs 3.5%; AST: 1.9% vs 
3.9%).  No  Hy’s  Law  cases  of  hepatotoxicity  were  observed.  The  risk  of  liver  toxicity  is  adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC  (section  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.2).  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  liver  enzyme 
elevations (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) before initiation of and periodically throughout 
treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride. 
PPE was reported at a higher incidence by sorafenib-treated patients than tivozanib hydrochloride-treated 
patients in the pivotal study (54.1% vs 13.9%). This was also true for the incidence of ≥ Grade 3 events 
(16.7% vs 1.9% respectively). This resulted in a lower incidence of dose reductions (5 in the tivozanib 
hydrochloride arm vs 43 in the sorafenib arm) and a lower incidence of dose interruptions (5 versus 45, 
respectively) due to PPE in Study AV-951-09-301. Management of patients experiencing PPE may include 
topical therapies for symptomatic relief with consideration of temporary interruption and/or reduction in 
treatment dose or, in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Dysphonia, another “on target” TEAE, was more common in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm than in the 
sorafenib arm of the pivotal study (21.2% vs 4.7%). All dysphonia events were mild to moderate. No 
TESAE was reported. TEAEs of dysphonia did not lead to study drug discontinuation but led to dose 
reduction or interruption in 1 patient in the sorafenib arm of the pivotal study. 
“Off target” TEAEs that were more common in the sorafenib arm than in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm 
included HFSR (PPE; 54.1% vs 13.9%), alopecia (21.4% vs 2.3%) and diarrhoea (33.1% vs 24.3%). A 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 108/123 
 
 
 
 
 
greater rate of study drug discontinuations and dose reductions and interruption were seen in sorafenib 
patients compared with tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients as a result of these TEAEs.  
Other common TEAEs were similar in both arms, including fatigue, asthenia, and weight decrease (all 
approximately 15% to 20%). Fewer Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in the tivozanib hydrochloride arm 
than in the sorafenib arm (64.1 vs 70.4%).  
Two patients received excessive doses of tivozanib during the monotherapy studies.  A patient with a 
history of hypertension experienced aggravated uncontrolled hypertension that was fatal after taking 
3 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total 4020 microgram).  No adverse reaction was 
experienced by the second patient who took 2 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total 
2680 microgram).  Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating tivozanib and patients 
should be monitored for hypertension during treatment (see SmPC section 4.4, 4.9 and RMP). 
In vitro studies have shown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump 
P-gp. However, the potential for tivozanib to be a substrate of transporters other than P-gp has not been 
studied (see SmPC section 5.2). Other transporters that may be affected by tivozanib include BCRP, 
BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1 transporters. Patients treated with tivozanib and 
co-administered medicinal products that are known to inhibit transporters may be at increased risk of 
toxicities. Toxicities, such as persistent severe hypertension, arising from concomitant administration of 
tivozanib with medicinal products that inhibit transporters is an important potential risk of tivozanib. The 
applicant is requested to perform in vitro studies to evaluate tivozanib as a substrate of OCT1, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP and MRP2. 
As VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis and as seen from nonclinical data, it is not unexpected that 
exposure to tivozanib hydrochloride could result in adverse effects during pregnancy. There have been no 
cases observed in the clinical development program but as studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity is considered an important potential risk (See SmPC 
section 4.6 and 5.3). It is currently unknown whether tivozanib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see 
SmPC section 4.5 and 4.6). As there is no information on the potential of tivozanib excretion in human 
milk, use during lactation is included in the RMP as “missing information” (see also SmPC section 4.6). 
In addition, whilst the following are also recognised VEGF class effects, the assessment of the frequency 
and severity did not warrant inclusion in the RMP as either an important identified or an important 
potential risk; fatigue (20.5% versus 16.3%), asthenia (17.0% versus 17.1%), and hypothyroidism 
(5.4% versus 2.3%). 
The data show a slightly more favourable safety profile of tivozanib compared with sorafenib in terms of 
lower incidence of specific ADRs (e.g. PPE), and lower dose reductions and dose interruptions for tivozanib 
hydrochloride-treated patients compared to sorafenib-treated patients. However in an open-label study, 
treatment comparisons require caution. The reduced incidence of PPE syndrome and diarrhoea is an 
advantage for tivozanib compared to sorafenib, although counteracted to some extent by increased 
incidences of dysphonia and hypertension. The safety profile is in accordance with that expected from 
nonclinical studies and known class effects (see SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8) and is manageable with dose 
reductions as described in the SmPC section 4.2. There is sufficient long-term data, as 286 patients were 
on-treatment over 12 months.  
Co-administration with herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is 
contraindicated (see discussion on interactions under Clinical Pharmacology, SmPC section 4.3 and 4.5). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general, the safety profile is in line with that expected for a specific VEGF inhibitor and appears 
acceptable.  The most common ADRs appear manageable and adequate recommendations are included in 
the SmPC. Serious adverse reactions include ischaemic events, venous thromboembolism, haemorrhage 
and cardiac failure, although the risks are in line with other TKIs including VEGF inhibitors.

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate with active substances 
contained in authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, 
ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate to be a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fotivda (tivozanib hydrochloride 
monohydrate) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2% to 3% of all adult malignancies. Patients with localised 
disease at diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 85% compared with 10% in those with 
metastatic disease at diagnosis (25% to 30% of patients).  
In RCC, overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) promotes neoangiogenesis, which contributes to the development and progression of RCC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 117/123 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In metastatic RCC, targeted therapy is now the first-line standard of care. VEGF inhibitors (e.g. axitinib, 
bevacizumab), multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib) and mTOR 
inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus) are already approved in the EU for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy of tivozanib is supported by an open-label, randomised, controlled pivotal study 
(09-301). Supportive efficacy data comes from two phase 2 studies (10-202, 07-201) and one extension 
study (09-902).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiological review (IRR) in 
the intention to treat population at study end, the median PFS (95% CI) was 11.9 months (9.3, 14.7) for 
tivozanib compared to 9.1 months (7.3, 9.5) for sorafenib. The hazard ratio (stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model) (95% CI) was 0.797 (0.639, 0.993). The p-value was 0.042. The pre-planned sensitivity 
analyses and subgroup analyses of PFS are in line with the primary outcome. 
The overall response rate (ORR) outcome by IRR favours tivozanib over sorafenib, 33% vs 23%. Median 
duration of response by IRR was 15.0 months for tivozanib compared to 12.9 months for sorafenib. 
Some supportive evidence of efficacy is available from the Phase 2 and extension studies. For the Phase 
2 randomised discontinuation study (07-201), the ORR by IRR was 18% after the 16 week open-label 
period. After randomised discontinuation, the PFS rate at 12 weeks (in subjects with <25% tumour 
growth or shrinkage) was 49% for tivozanib vs. 21% for placebo by IRR. For the Phase 2 open-label single 
arm study (10-202), investigator-assessed ORR was 25% at 6 months.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal study only enrolled patients with RCC that included a clear cell component. Patients with 
nccRCC were included in supportive studies 201 and 202. Although the numbers are small, there appears 
to be evidence of activity of tivozanib in nccRCC albeit at a reduced level compared to ccRCC. Given the 
evidence of activity in nccRCC restricting the indication to ccRCC was not considered justified.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The extent of clinical trial exposure at the claimed dose in the relevant disease population was adequate.  
Adverse events (AEs) reported frequently for tivozanib include hypertension (48%), dysphonia (27%), 
fatigue (26%), diarrhoea (26%) and asthenia (18%). These preferred terms and frequencies are in line 
with the known safety profiles of other TKIs for the treatment of advanced RCC including VEGF inhibitors. 
Hypertension was the commonest reported AE. The higher incidence for tivozanib vs. sorafenib is 
expected, since tivozanib specifically targets the VEGF pathway, and the mechanism is believed to be 
related to VEGF pathway inhibition. The incidence is in line with that reported for axitinib, another 
selective inhibitor of VEGF-1, -2 and -3, in a second-line advanced RCC population. Dysphonia, believed 
to be a VEGF inhibitor effect, is also more common in tivozanib patients compared to sorafenib patients.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/437168/2017  
Page 118/123 
 
 
 
 
The lower incidence of diarrhoea with tivozanib, including grade 3-4 events, may represent an advantage 
for tivozanib compared to sorafenib. The incidence of PPE syndrome was significantly lower for tivozanib 
compared to sorafenib (13.9% in the tivozanib arm versus 54.1% in the sorafenib arm).  
Less common but more serious effects include hepatic disorders, arterial thrombotic events, venous 
embolic and thrombotic events, haemorrhage and cardiac failure. The incidences are in line with other 
TKIs. A risk of QT/QTc prolongation cannot be ruled out based on the available data, recommendations for 
periodic monitoring through ECG and maintenance of electrolytes in the normal range is recommended in 
the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.4 and RMP).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In vitro studies demonstrated that no unchanged tivozanib is excreted in the urine, and it is suggested 
that tivozanib is primarily hepatically eliminated. CYP3A4 has been identified as one of the metabolic 
pathways. However the contribution of different elimination mechanisms and routes has not been fully 
assessed. The Applicant will perform the evaluation of tivozanib as a substrate of OCT1, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 and the need for further interaction studies will be assessed (see 
RMP). 
Significant cardiovascular disease (including uncontrolled hypertension), thromboembolic or vascular 
disorders, or bleeding disorders were exclusion criteria for the pivotal study. Therefore the risk of serious 
events may be increased with real world use and needs to be reviewed within the PSURs.  Special 
populations such as older and non-white patients have not been studied adequately; more information is 
expected to come through the PSURs. Use during lactation is an area of missing information in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
An increase in median PFS for tivozanib vs. sorafenib of 2.4 months is clinically relevant. Sorafenib is an 
active comparator and there are supportive data from Phase 2, and ORR and duration of response favour 
tivozanib. Taking these factors into account, the observed primary PFS outcome provides adequate 
evidence of the efficacy of tivozanib in the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.  
In general, the safety profile is in line with that expected for a specific VEGF inhibitor. The most frequent 
ADRs are manageable, although they will affect quality of life. The reduced incidence of PPE syndrome is 
an advantage for tivozanib compared to sorafenib, although on the other hand there were increased 
incidences of dysphonia and hypertension. However, the excess of dose interruptions and reductions in 
the sorafenib arm mainly due to PPE suggests that tivozanib may be more tolerable than sorafenib.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
An increase of 2.4 months in median PFS for tivozanib vs. sorafenib as an active comparator is clinically 
relevant and supported by data from Phase 2, and ORR and duration of response. The safety profile is in 
line with that expected for a specific VEGF inhibitor.  
The benefit – risk balance of tivozanib in the first line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following 
disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC is positive.

N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fotivda in the first line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease 
progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC, is positive. 
The divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Fotivda is not similar to Torisel within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Fotivda is favourable in the following indication: 
First line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and for adult patients who 
are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment 
with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to 
be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
The divergent position to the majority recommendation is appended to this report. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tivozanib hydrochloride 
monohydrate is a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 22 June 2017 
Fotivda EMEA/H/C/004131 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of a marketing authorisation for Fotivda for the following reason(s): 
This application is supported by a single pivotal study. This was a 2-year, open-label, randomized 
controlled trial comparing tivozanib with sorafenib in 517 patients with advanced RCC who had received 
no prior targeted therapy. No specific concerns are raised regarding the pivotal trial methodology. 
However, the study was designed such that only patients randomized to sorafenib were permitted to 
cross over. This has the potential to confound the overall survival (OS) results. The primary endpoint 
was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by independent radiological review (IRR) in the ITT 
population.  
In our view, the clinical efficacy of tivozanib has not been sufficiently established. The results of the single 
pivotal trial are not compelling and it is also of concern that a large proportion of patients started a new 
anti-cancer therapy before progression. Considering the open-label design of the single pivotal study, OS 
needs to be reassuring (in line with scientific advice and EMA guidance). However, all performed OS 
analyses have failed to show any OS benefit, and thus OS results do not support the PFS results. 
Additionally, there is a lack of internal consistency in the PFS result with regard to geographical 
region, with the lack of efficacy in Russia and the Ukraine which cannot be attributed just 
to treatment cross-over since the hazard ratio for the PFS was already close to 1. A post-hoc analysis 
showed that for patients with an ECOG score of 1, the hazard ratio is around 1. This post-hoc analysis also 
suggests that for the patients on sorafenib, ECOG score makes no difference to PFS outcome, and 
therefore may not be a prognostic factor after all. The applicant’s conclusion that the observed 
geographical imbalance in PFS is a reflection of imbalance in ECOG status between treatment groups 
could be questioned since these countries were not considered different to the rest of Central/Eastern 
Europe at randomisation so any separation at this point in time could be seen as data driven. It 
is therefore our opinion that the lack of internal consistency remains. 
In conclusion, the efficacy of tivozanib is not considered robustly demonstrated. Although the safety of 
tivozanib is acceptable, we consider a positive benefit-risk balance for tivozanib not sufficiently 
demonstrated.

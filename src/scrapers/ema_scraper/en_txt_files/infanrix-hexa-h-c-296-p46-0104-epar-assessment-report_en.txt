EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The MAH assessed the long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immune 
response  to  a  hepatitis  B  vaccine  challenge  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years,  previously 
vaccinated with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) 
or  GSK  Biologicals’  DTPa-IPV/Hib  and  HBV  (Engerix-  B)  vaccines  at  the  ages  of  3,  5  and  11 
months  in  clinical  trial  DTPa-HBV-IPV-031  (217744/031).  The  MAH  concluded  that  these  data 
warrant  a  change  in  the  SmPC  of  the  product  to  reflect  anti-HepB  Ab  persistence.  A  type  II 
variation will be submitted in due time in order to update section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
II. 
RECOMMENDATION1 
The data from this study can warrant a change in the SmPC and PL to reflect the data on the 
long-term persistence of the antibody response following Hepatitis B vaccination.

INTRODUCTION 
The  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Infanrix  hexa  to  comply  with  the 
requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products 
for  paediatric  use.  Long-term  persistence  of  anti-hepatitis  B  antibodies  and  response  to  a 
hepatitis  B  vaccine  were  assessed  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years  previously  vaccinated 
with a anti hepatitis B vaccine at the ages of 3, 5 and 11 months in clinical trial DTPa-HBV-IPV-
031 (217744/031).

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
IV.1 
One dose (0.5 ml) of Engerix-B (Lot no.: AHBVB720A, Expiry date: 31 March 2012) contained: 
10 μg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed on 0.25 mg aluminium as aluminium 
hydroxide. 
IV.2  Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
Long-term persistence of anti-hepatitis B antibodies and response to a hepatitis B vaccine were 
assessed  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years  previously  vaccinated  with  a  anti  hepatitis  B 
vaccine  at  the  ages  of  3,  5  and  11  months  in  clinical  trial  DTPa-HBV-IPV-031  (217744/031). 
According  to  the  MAH  these  data  warrant  a  change  in  the  vaccine  SmPC  to  reflect  the  data 
regarding the long-term antibody persistence.

-  To assess the anti-HB antibody response to a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in subjects 
aged 11-12 years, vaccinated in infancy with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 
3, 5 and 11 months of age. 
Secondary: 
-  To  assess  the  persistence  of  anti-HB  antibodies,  10-11  years  after  primary  infant 
vaccination with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 3, 5 and 11 months of age. 
-  To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in terms of 
solicited symptoms, unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
2.1.2  Study design 
Phase IV, open, multi-centre, non-randomised study with the same two groups as in the primary 
study.  All  subjects  previously  vaccinated  with  three  doses  of  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  or  DTPa-
IPV/Hib+HBV  in  the  first  year  of  life  received  a  single  challenge  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals’ 
Engerix-B vaccine in this study. 
The two treatment groups were as follows: 
-  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group:  Subjects  who  previously  received  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 
(Infanrix hexa) at 3, 5 and 11-12 months of age and received a challenge dose of HBV 
vaccine in this study. 
-  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group:  Subjects  who  previously  received  DTPa-IPV/Hib  +  HBV 
(Engerix-B)  at  3,  5  and  11-12  months  of  age  and  received  a  challenge  dose  of  HBV 
vaccine in this study. 
N = Number of subjects planned to be enrolled 
Pre-vacc BS = Pre-vaccination blood sampling, Post-vac BS = Post-vaccination blood sampling 
Two blood samples were drawn: one before, and the other, one month after the challenge dose 
of Engerix-B vaccine. 
2.1.3  Study population /Sample size 
Subjects aged 11-12 years, previously vaccinated with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B 
at 3, 5 and 11 months of age in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031).

2.1.4  Treatments 
Vaccination  schedule/site:  All  subjects  received  a  dose  of  Engerix-B  as  an  intramuscular 
injection into the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm. 
2.1.5  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Anti-HBs antibody concentrations one month after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine: 
-  Percentage of subjects with anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml. 
Secondary endpoints 
Immunogenicity 
Persistence and immune response to the study vaccine: 
-  Percentage of subjects with an anamnestic response to a challenge dose. 
-  Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 3.3 mIU/ml, ≥ 10 mIU/ml, and ≥ 100 mIU/ml before 
and one month after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine. 
Safety and reactogenicity: 
Solicited local and general symptoms. 
-  Occurrence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  during  the  4-day  (Day  0  to  Day  3)  follow-up 
period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine. 
-  Occurrence  of  solicited  general  symptoms  during  the  4-day  (Day  0  to  Day  3)  follow-up 
period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine. 
Unsolicited adverse events. 
-  Occurrence  of  unsolicited  symptoms  during  the  31-day  (Day  0  to  Day  30)  follow-up 
period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine. 
Serious adverse events. 
-  Occurrence of SAEs after the challenge dose of HBV vaccine up to the study end. 
2.1.6  Statistical methods, sample size 
The  sample  size  of  this  challenge  dose  study  was  not  estimated  using  any  power  based 
computations.  A  total  of  312  children  aged  11-12  years,  who  participated  in  the  primary  study 
217744/031  (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031)  were  expected  to  participate  in  this  challenge  dose  study.  It 
was assumed that a range of 15% to 10% of the subjects enrolled in the challenge dose study 
might be non-evaluable at the time of analysis (e.g. dropouts, noncompliance with protocol etc.). 
Therefore, a total of 270 or 280 evaluable subjects were expected to participate in this challenge 
dose study. 
Total vaccinated cohort 
The TVC included all subjects who received the challenge dose of the HBV vaccine. The TVC 
for  the  analysis  of  safety  included  all  subjects  with  study  vaccine  administration  documented. 
The TVC for the analysis of immunogenicity was to include all subjects who received a challenge

dose  of  HBV  vaccine  and  for  whom  data  concerning  immunogenicity  endpoint  measures  were 
available at the post-HBV vaccine challenge blood sampling time point. 
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
The  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity  included  all  evaluable  subjects  (i.e.  those  who 
met all eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination 
criteria  met  during  the  study),  who  had  received  a  challenge  dose  of  Engerix-B  and  for  whom 
data  concerning  immunogenicity  endpoint  measures  were  available  at  the  post-HBV  challenge 
time point. The interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2, considered for inclusion of a subject in the 
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity was 21-48 days. 
ATP cohort for antibody persistence 
The ATP cohort for antibody persistence included all subjects: 
-  aged  11-12  years  (from  and  including  the  11th  birthday  up  to  but  excluding  the  13th 
birthday) at the time of enrolment, 
-  who had received three doses of the combination vaccine (Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B) in 
the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031), 
-  who had not received any additional dose of hepatitis B (containing) vaccine, 
-  with no evidence of hepatitis B infection or disease (including anti-HBc at postchallenge 
- 
dose time point or abnormal increase in anti-HBs concentrations), 
for  whom  serological  results  were  available  at  the  pre-HBV  vaccine  challenge  blood 
sampling time point. 
Analysis of safety: Analysis was performed on the TVC. 
Analysis of demography: At Visit 1, demographic characteristics (age in years and gender) were 
tabulated. The mean age (with the range and standard deviation) of the vaccinated subjects was 
calculated. The distribution of subjects among the study centres was tabulated. 
2.1.7  Derived and transformed data  
Immunogenicity 
-  A seronegative subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations below the cut-off 
level (< 3.3 mIU/ml). 
-  A seropositive subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations above the cut-off 
level (≥ 3.3 mIU/ml). 
-  A seroprotected subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml. 
-  Anamnestic response to the challenge dose was defined as:  
o  At  least  (i.e.  greater  than  or  equal  to)  a  4-fold  rise  in  post-challenge  dose  anti-HBs 
antibody concentrations in subjects seropositive at the pre-challenge dose time point. 
o  Post-challenge  dose  anti-HBs  antibody  concentrations  ≥10  mIU/ml  in  subjects 
seronegative at the pre-challenge dose time point. 
-  The  GMC  calculations  were  performed  by  taking  the  anti-log  of  the  mean  of  the  log10 
concentration  transformations.  Antibody  concentrations  below  the  cut-off of  the  assay  were 
given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. 
-  For  a  given  subject  and  a  given  immunogenicity  measurement,  missing  or  nonevaluable 
measurements were not replaced. Therefore, an analysis excluded subjects with missing or 
non-evaluable measurements. 
Safety/Reactogenicity 
-  For  the  analysis  of  solicited  symptoms,  missing  or  non-evaluable  measurements  were  not 
replaced. Therefore the analysis of the solicited symptoms based on the TVC included only 
subjects with documented safety data.

-  For  the  analysis  of  unsolicited  adverse  events/concomitant  medication,  all  vaccinated 
subjects were to be considered and subjects who did not report an event were considered as 
subjects without an event. 
2.2 Results 
2.2.1 Demography results:  
The  mean  age  of  subjects  for  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  was  11.3  years,  with  a 
standard deviation of 0.46 years. Male subjects constituted 57.1% of the study population. 
2.2.2 Number of subjects 
A total of 312 subjects were enrolled in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031). A 
total of 185 subjects (95 subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 90 subjects in the DTPa-
IPV/Hib+HBV group) were vaccinated in this study after having been checked for the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. The main reasons for non-participation in this challenge dose study were 
attributed to consent withdrawal (not due to AEs/SAEs) and migration of subjects from the study 
area. The number of subjects enrolled into the study as well as the number excluded from ATP 
analyses with reasons for exclusion is presented in Table 9. 
2.2.3 Immunogenicity results 
Immunological  correlate  of  protection:  Antibodies  to  the  HB  antigen  were  measured  using 
ELISA  developed  in-house.  The  cutoff  of  the  test  was  set  at  3.3  mIU/ml.  An  antibody 
concentration  ≥  10  mIU/ml  defined  seroprotection  [Centre  for  Disease  Control,  1991;  World 
Health Organization, 1988].

challenge dose status is presented in Table 12 (of the MAH body report, not shown here) and 
Figure 1. 
- 
In  the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  (Infanrix  hexa)  group,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with 
seropositivity rates increased from 72.6% to 97.9%, the percentage of subjects with anti-
HBs concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml increased from 53.7% to 95.8% and the percentage of 
subjects with anti-HBs concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml increased from 11.6% to 92.6%, one

mIU/ml before and one month after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine. 
Anamnestic response to the HBV vaccine challenge dose (ATP cohort for immunogenicity): 
The anamnestic response to the HBV challenge dose is presented in Table 13. 
-  An anamnestic response to the HBV vaccine challenge dose was mounted by 95.8% and 
the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  groups, 
in 
97.8%  of  subjects 
respectively. 
-  The  percentage  of  subjects  who  were  seronegative  at  the  pre-challenge  time  point  and

2.2.4 Safety results 
Secondary safety objective: To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a challenge dose of 
HBV vaccine in terms of solicited symptoms, unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events 
(SAEs). 
Solicited  local  adverse  events  were  pain,  redness  or  swelling  at  the  injection  site.  All  sollicited 
local (injection site) reactions were considered causally related to vaccination. 
Solicited  general  adverse  events  were  fatigue,  fever,  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain) or headache.  
Serious  adverse  events  were  untowarded  medical  occurrences  that  either  resulted  in  death, 
were  life-threatening,  required  hospitalisation  or  prolongation  of  existing  hospitalisation  or 
resulted in disability/incapacity.  
Solicited local adverse events 
The  incidence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  reported  during  the  4-day  (Day  0  to  Day  3)  post-
vaccination period is presented in Table 16. 
All local symptoms were considered to be causally related to vaccination. 
-  Pain  at  the  injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  symptom  in  both 
groups, reported for not more than 31.6% of subjects during the 4-day (Day 0 to Day 3) post-
vaccination follow-up period. 
-  Grade 3 pain was reported for one subject in each group. 
-  Swelling  was  reported  for  15.8%  and  8.9%  of  subjects  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-
IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively.

respectively. 
-  Solicited general symptoms of Grade 3 intensity (fatigue and headache) was reported for 
one subject in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
The  percentage  of  subjects  for  whom  the  occurrence  of  unsolicited  symptoms  classified  by 
MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31-day (Day 0 to Day 30) 
post-vaccination  period was  reported  is  presented  in  Table  18 (not  shown).  The  percentage of 
subjects  who  reported  the  occurrence  of Grade  3  unsolicited  symptoms  classified  by  MedDRA 
Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  during  the  31-day  (Day  0  to  Day  30)  post-
vaccination period is presented in Table 19 (not shown) . 
-  At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  was  reported  for  5.3%  and  7.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively.

-  Grade  3  unsolicited  AE  (Otitis  media)  was  reported  for  one  subject  in  the  DTPa- 
IPV/Hib+HBV group. 
-  No unsolicited symptoms that were considered to be causally related to vaccination were 
reported during the 31-day follow-up period. 
Serious adverse events 
Fatal events: No deaths were reported during the study. 
Non-fatal events: Over the entire study period (31-days), an SAE, [Infection (not specified)], was 
reported  for  subject  number  287  in  the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group,  two  days  after  vaccination 
which resulted in hospitalisation and lasted for six days. The infection resolved during the course 
of the study and was assessed as not causally related to the vaccination, by the investigator. 
Safety conclusions 
-  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for not more than 7.8% of subjects across 
both groups. 
-  Grade  3  unsolicited  symptom  (Otitis  media)  was  reported  for  one  subject  in  the  DTPa-
IPV/Hib+HBV group. 
-  The SAE reported for one subject (infection) resolved during the course of the study and 
was not assessed as causally related to the vaccination by the investigator. 
-  No fatal SAEs were reported. 
3. Discussion on clinical (immunogenicity and safety) aspects 
The  present  study  was  conducted  to  assess  anti-HBs  antibody  persistence  and  immune 
response to a challenge dose of HBV in children 11-12 years, previously  vaccinated  with GSK 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  vaccine  (Infanrix  hexa)  or  GSK  Biologicals’  DTPa-IPV/Hib  and  HBV 
(Engerix-B) vaccines at the age of 3, 5 and 11 months. The results demonstrate that the immune 
response induced by the three dose primary vaccination course in infancy persisted for at least 
11 years (anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 3.3 mIU/ml was reported in 72.6 % subjects in the 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group  and  75.3  %  subjects  in  the  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group).  An 
anamnestic response to the HBV challenge dose, indicative of an immunological memory to the 
vaccine  antigen,  was  observed  in  the  majority  of  subjects  (anamnestic  response  mounted  by 
95.8%  subjects  in  the  DTPa-HBVIPV/Hib  group  and  97.8%  of  subjects  in  the  DTPa-
IPV/Hib+HBV  group).  The  data  suggests  that  protection  against  hepatitis  B  may  still  be 
conferred through immune memory in all subjects who responded to the primary vaccination but 
subsequently had anti-HB antibody concentrations < 10 mIU/ml. 
Hepatitis  B  response  to  the  challenge  dose  is  comparable  in  children  who  received  the  HBV 
component as part of a combination vaccine or as a monovalent vaccine in infancy. 
Engerix-B  was  confirmed  to  be  safe,  well  tolerated  and  immunogenic  when  administered  as  a 
challenge dose in subjects primed in infancy with Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B. 
4. Conclusions: 
-  One month after the challenge dose, 92.6% and 96.6% subjects had anti-HBs antibody 
concentration  ≥  100  mIU/ml  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group, 
respectively. 
-  Approximately  ten  years  after  the  primary  vaccination,  72.6%  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 
group  and  75.3%  subjects 
in  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group  had  anti-HB  antibody 
concentration  ≥3.3  mIU/ml,  53.7%  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group  and  56.2%  subjects  in 
DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group had anti-HB antibody concentration ≥10 mIU/ml. 
-  An  anamnestic  response  to  the  hepatitis  B  challenge  dose  was  mounted  by  95.8% 
(91/95)  and  97.8%  (87/89)  subjects  in  the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV 
groups, respectively.

-  At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  was  reported  for  5.3%  and  7.8%  subjects  in  DTPa-
HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group,  respectively,  within  the  31  day  (Day  0  to 
Day 30) follow up period after the challenge dose. 
-  An SAE (infection, not specified) was reported for one subject from DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 
group,  which  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  not  causally  related  to  vaccination. 
The SAE was resolved before the end of study. 
V.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH assessed the long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immune 
response  to  a  hepatitis  B  vaccine  challenge  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years,  previously 
vaccinated with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) 
or  GSK  Biologicals’  DTPa-IPV/Hib  and  HBV  (Engerix-  B)  vaccines  at  the  ages  of  3,  5  and  11 
months in clinical trial DTPa-HBV-IPV-031 (217744/031).  
The  presented  data  indicate  that  about  75%  of  subjects  were  seropositive  for  anti-HB  Ab  and 
about 55% displayed seroprotective anti-HB antibody levels 10 years after the last vaccination. 
An anamnestic response to the hepatitis B challenge dose was mounted by 95.8% (91/95) and 
97.8% (87/89) subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively. 
These data highlight the persistence of the anti-HB immune response 10 year after the primary 
vaccination series.  
Recommendation  
The MAH concluded that these data warrant a change in the SmPC of the product to reflect anti-
HepB Ab persistence and will submit a type II variation in due time in order to update section 5.1 
of the SmPC. The corresponding Type II variation will be evaluated upon receipt.  
Fulfilled: 
No further action required.

1.  Introduction 
On 19-04-2016, the MAH submitted a long term safety extension trial (F13CD-3720) where 60 
subjects with congenital FXIII A subunit deficiency of which 16 were children and adolescents were 
administered, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
These data are also submitted as part of the extension safety study of the study F13CD-1725 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The rFXIII was supplied by the MAH as a sterile lyophilised powder for injection in single use vials of 
2500 IU (15 mg) per vial. Each vial was to be reconstituted in 3.2 mL sterile water for injection 
(SWFI). A single dose of reconstituted rFXIII (35 IU/kg) was administered as an intravenous injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study F13 CD 3720: A multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, and multiple dosing trial on safety of 
monthly replacement therapy with recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) in subjects with congenital factor 
XIII deficiency. 
The trial enrolled 60 subjects with congenital FXIII A subunit deficiency in which 16 are paediatric and 
adolescents received recombinant FXIII Novothirteen® (Catridecacog) at a monthly dose of 35 UI/Kg 
body weight.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study F13CD-3720 “A multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, and multiple dosing trial on safety 
of monthly replacement therapy with recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) in subjects with congenital factor 
XIII deficiency”. 
Description 
The study was a multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, and multiple dosing trial on safety of monthly 
replacement therapy with recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) in subjects with congenital factor XIII 
deficiency. 60 subjects with congenital FXIII A subunit deficiency in which 16 are paediatric and 
adolescents received recombinant FXIII Novothirteen® (Catridecacog) at a monthly dose of 35 UI/Kg 
body weight were enrolled. This study was a safety extension study of the study F13CD-1725. 
A total of 60 subjects were enrolled and exposed to trial drug (covering 63 subject IDs, which includes 
3 subjects who withdrew and re-enrolled in the the trial with new subject IDs): 
- 34 subjects enrolled into trial F13CD-3720 from trial F13CD-1725

- 26 new subjects were enrolled 
- 44 subjects completed the trial. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
- To assess the long term safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII when used for prevention 
of bleeding episodes and for the treatment of breakthrough bleeding in subjects with congenital FXIII 
deficiency. 
Secondary objectives: 
- To evaluate the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII when used for the prevention of 
bleeding episodes and for the treatment of breakthrough bleeding in subjects with congenital FXIII 
deficiency. 
- To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetic profile after monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII. 
Assessor’s comment: Primary and secondary objectives are acceptable.  
Study design 
This was as a multi-centre, multi-national, open-label, single-arm and multiple dosing, phase 3b trial 
conducted for the purpose of providing information on the long-term safety and efficacy of rFXIII used 
to treat subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency. The trial design resembled that of the Novo Nordisk 
phase 3a trial F13CD-1725. 
All subjects who completed Trial F13CD-1725 were offered to be enrolled in the extension trial. 
Amendment No. 8 allowed enrolment of new subjects directly in the extension trial 
Subjects were asked to participate for a minimum of 52 weeks, consisting of a screening visit to assess 
subjects’ eligibility followed by monthly administrations of rFXIII. For subjects that participated in trial 
F13CD-1725, visit 1 had to occur on the same day as the end-of-trial visit for trial F13CD-1725. 
With the introduction of Amendment No 14 (14-May-2012), each subject was given the option of 
participating in a PK session once he/she had received a minimum of 5 injections with rFXIII for the 
purpose of assessing the drug’s steady state PK properties. Subjects who took part in the PK 
evaluation provided blood samples for the PK assessment prior to dosing and again at 1 and 2 hours, 
and at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-dose. 
End of the trial: 
As per the protocol, the end of the trial was dependent on the launch of rFXIII, and was defined as the 
LPLV. If the subject had participated in the trial for at least 48 weeks at the time of product launch 
then the end-of-trial visit was to be completed 28 days (± 2 days) after the next appropriate planned

- Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breastfeeding or are not using adequate 
contraceptive methods 
Treatments 
A single dose of reconstituted rFXIII (35 IU/kg) was administered as an intravenous injection. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints:  
- Rate (number per subject year) of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a FXIII containing 
product during the rFXIII treatment period subdivided according to spontaneous, traumatic and 
intracranial bleeding. 
- Haemostatic response to rFXIII after a single dose of 35 IU/kg for treatment of breakthrough 
bleeding episodes. Assessments were based on a 4-point scale as: Excellent, good/effective, 
moderate/partly effective or poor (no improvement or bleeding the same or worsened, other rFXIII 
product required). 
- Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment. 
- Steady-state PK in subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency after monthly replacement therapy with 
rFXIII. The PK parameters were based on: 
– FXIII activity (assessed by the Berichrom® assay) (all parameters) 
- ELISAs (FXIII A2B2 tetramer) (selected parameters as exploratory/supportive analyses) 
Safety endpoints:  
- Serious and non-serious adverse events (primary endpoint) 
- Antibody and inhibitor development (secondary endpoint) 
- Laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation-related parameters, 
immunogenicity) (secondary endpoint) 
- Vital signs and physical examinations (secondary endpoint) 
Statistical Methods 
The primary endpoint and secondary safety endpoints were evaluated descriptively.  
Listings of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the trial period, 
including pertinent clinical information, were provided. The study flagged events related to a diagnosis. 
Any listed AE regarded as a symptom (belonging to a reported diagnosis) was included in the summary 
tables only when the symptom was classified as serious.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included  
1) Rate (number per subject year) of bleeds requiring treatment with a FXIII containing product during 
the rFXIII treatment period and  
2) Number of subjects withdrawn from the trial due to lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment (as judged 
by the investigator). 
The number of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a FXIII-containing product was evaluated by 
a Poisson model (log-link), similar to the model used in trial F13CD-1725 using baseline age as a 
covariate. The model also took into account those subjects withdrawing before the end-of-trial, by 
adjusting the length of time under observation. The estimated rate was based on the average baseline 
age of the subjects in the trial, adjusting for over-dispersion, which was estimated by Pearson’s 
chisquare statistic divided by its degrees of freedom.  
The number of subjects withdrawn from the trial due to lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment was to be 
tabulated and listed. 
The PK endpoints were calculated using non-compartmental methods based on the Berichrom® 
activity assay. PK profiles were not baseline adjusted prior to PK calculations. All PK parameters 
derived from FXIII activity were listed individually and summarised by treatment. Profiles of FXIII 
activity versus time were plotted as individual curves and as mean curves on the original scale and on 
the logarithmic scale. FXIII activity levels were further listed individually and summarised by treatment 
and time point. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The trial enrolled 60 subjects with congenital FXIII A subunit deficiency in which 16 are paediatric and 
adolescents received recombinant FXIII Novothirteen® (Catridecacog) at a monthly dose of 35 UI/Kg 
body weight.  
Baseline data 
The trial population had a mean age of 31.0 years (range 7.0−77.0 years) and most subjects (64%) 
were male. 
The majority (59%) of subjects were White. Weight and height varied considerably as expected for this 
trial population which included both adults and paediatric subjects. None of the subjects were positive 
for anti-rFXIII antibodies at baseline. Most subjects had a normal physical examination at baseline and 
all pregnancy tests for females of childbearing age were negative. 
Efficacy results  
In this extension trial, there were 60 unique subjects (63 subject IDs) with congenital FXIII deficiency 
that received trial drug (rFXIII). Monthly administration of rFXIII was effective in preventing bleeds 
that required treatment with a FXIII containing product in subjects with FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
The geometrical mean terminal half-life was 13.7 days and the geometrical mean trough FXIII activity 
level after 28 days was 0.158 IU/mL.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/18173/2017

The mean trough FXIII activity level at 28 days post-dose (0.173 IU/mL) was almost identical to the 
pre-dose level (0.188 IU/mL), indicative of a steady state situation. 
The annual mean bleeding rate (number of bleeds that required treatment with a FXIII-containing 
product per subject year) was low: 0.043 bleeds/subject/year. 
In 16 subjects below the age of 18 years at enrolment, 5 treatment-requiring bleeds occurred in 4 
subjects (mean rate: 0.104 bleeds/subject/year), whereas the corresponding rate in 47 subjects above 
18 years was 0.022 bleeds/subject/year, as a result of 3 bleeds in 3 subjects 
The estimated mean rate of bleeds treated with a FXIII-containing product was 0.021 bleeds/year 
during the trial period with a 95% CI [0.0062; 0.073] (at the mean age of 31.0 years). 
A total of 53 subjects did not have FXIII treatment-requiring bleeds. 
Assessor’s comments :  
Treatment-requiring bleeds are superior in the 16 subjects below the age of 18. (0.104 
bleeds/subjects/year versus 0.022 bleeds/subjects/year in the patients who are superior of 18). 
Because of the low number of patients, comparison between ages would have been insignificant.  
However, it is asked to the MAH to discuss this point.  
Anyway, the main conclusion on efficacy in the current trial is that the observed rates (both the 
adjusted and the unadjusted) of FXIII-treatment-requiring bleeding episodes were low. 
Safety results 
Demography of trial population 
The trial population had a mean age of 31.0 years (range 7.0−77.0 years) and most subjects (64%) 
were male. None of the subjects were positive for anti-rFXIII antibodies at baseline. Most subjects had 
a normal physical examination at baseline and all pregnancy tests for females of childbearing age were 
negative. 
Exposure 
A total of 60 unique subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency (63 subject IDs, which includes 3 re-
enrolled subjects with new subject IDs) received rFXIII. Of these 60 patients, 16 were children and 
adolescents, 34 had completed study F13CD-1725 and 26 were newly enrolled patients. 
Monthly dose was of 35 IU/kg. The number of exposures was 2,410 in the 60 unique subjects, 
corresponding to 186.5 subject years. Subjects received between 2 and 69 doses per subject.  
Adverse events 
A total of 920 TEAEs were reported in 56 (93.3%) subjects; the majority were mild (785 events in 54 
subjects) or moderate (119 events in 26 subjects) and the most commonly reported were headache 
(77 events in 19 subjects) and nasopharyngitis (50 events in 20 subjects). Sixteen (16) AEs in 12 
subjects were classified as severe, of which 12 serious events. 
Nineteen (19) serious adverse events were observed in 12 subjects and were evaluated as unlikely 
related to trial drug by the investigator:

The atrial septal defect and the ductus arteriosus were associated with the newborn of a subject rather 
than the subject herself. 
The SAEs in paediatric patients were: 
- A headache in a 8 year old (moderate), a second SAE of head injury (severe) occurred in the same 
subject (banging head from a fall) 5 months later. 
- A 12 year-old subject sustained a severe laceration to his forehead. 
- One female subject attempted suicide at age 14 years, approximately 4 years after starting 
treatment with rFXIII. 
Assessor’s comment: 
No concern related to SAEs  in the study population  or  in  the  paediatric patients are  seen  from  these 
data.

Investigators evaluated 8 AEs in 7 subjects as possibly or probably related to the trial product 
including: 
-Four (4) events in 3 subjects evaluated as probably related to rFXIII by the investigator included 2 
events of dosing error (1 event of wrong dose in a 15-year-old male subject and one non-severe event 
of overdose in an 8-year-old male subject), an event of arthralgia/knee pain in the same 8-year-old 
subject starting 22 days since his latest dose and one event of leukopenia in a 15-year-old female 
subject starting 28 days since the previous rFXIII dose and lasting 115 days. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Half  of  the  related  events  occurred  in  paediatric  patients  (who  represent  27%  of  the  entire  study 
population). 
-Two (2) events assessed by the investigator as possibly related to rFXIII including blood detected in 
stool in a 25-year-old female subject 20 days following her latest rFXIII dose and a non-severe limb 
injury (bleeding under the toe nail) in a 22-year-old male subject 28 days since the previous rFXIII 
dose. The event of ‘blood in stool’, considered as possibly related to product, was categorized as a 
non-serious symptom. 
-Two (2) additional ‘possibly related’ events were ALAT increased in a 26-year-old male subject 28 
days after his previous rFXIII dose and ALP increased in a 63-year-old male subject 28 days since the 
previous rFXIII dosing. The younger man had increased ALAT on a few occasions, but most of his ALAT 
results were normal. The older man had alternative aetiologies for the increased ALP including chronic 
hepatitis C and a liver cyst. 
No thromboembolic events, fatal adverse events, anaphylactic or allergic reactions to rFXIII or adverse 
events leading to withdrawal were reported. No subjects were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy of 
rFXIII treatment. 
44 subjects completed the F13CD-3720 trial. Of the 19 subjects withdrawn from the trial (including the 
3 subjects who withdrew and re-enrolled), 3 subjects became pregnant (of which one re-enrolled) and 
1 patient wanted to go on commercially available plasma derived FXIII. None of the subjects withdrew 
due to an AE. 
Twelve medication errors classified as MESIs occurred in 8 subjects, and included 10 events of 
incorrect dose administered, 1 event of wrong reconstitution technique (actual dose ~33.1 IU/kg) and 
1 event of overdose (actual dose 80.03 IU/kg or 2.3 times the planned dose and was evaluated by the 
investigator as mild and probably related to trial product). Medication errors recorded as ‘incorrect 
dose’ were close to the approved dose of 35 IU/kg, ranging from 28.2 IU/kg to approximately 37.6 
IU/kg. As such they were not reported as an under- or overdose.  
Assessor’s comment: 
Medication errors in paediatric patients (42% of the medication error cases) were 1 incorrect dose 
administered in a 15 year old patient (mild, probably related), 2 wrong doses administered in a 7 year 
old patient, 1 overdose (probably related, mild) and 1 incorrect dose administered in a 8 year old. No 
special trend of medication error is detected. 
Through protocol amendment n°6, the investigational product was switched from rFXIIIAvecia (3 batches 
used, 26 subjects received 122 doses) to rFXIIINN (4 batches used in 61 subjects who received 2288 
doses). The majority of subjects were exposed to rFXIIINN. The rates of AEs were similar for the two

rFXIII drug substances when adjusted for exposure (rFXIIINN: 871 events in 56 subjects or 38.1 events 
per 100 exposures; rFXIIIAvecia: 49 events in 15 subjects or 40.2 events per 100 exposures). 
A total of 306 AEs were reported in 24 rFXIII-naïve subjects not previously participating in trial F13CD-
1725, corresponding to 39.9 events per 100 exposures. The AE profile for the treatment-naïve 
population resembled that of the entire trial. 
Assessor’s general comment:  
The MAH did not provide a specific focus on paediatric population, the MAH is requested to provide a 
comparison  of  safety  data  in  paediatric  an  adult  patients  as  regard  to  TEAEs,  TEAEs  assessed  as  at 
least possibly related to rFXIII and serious AEs. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
No anti-rFXIII antibodies were detected. 
Results on safety laboratory parameters and other safety-related examinations did not indicate 
clinically relevant changes as a result of rFXIII administration. Laboratory values remained within 
reference ranges for the majority of measurements. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful 
changes in haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, or coagulation related parameters over time. 
Haematology: 9 results registered as adverse events but none was related to rFXIII except one 
leukopenia in a paediatric patient and all were mild except one severe haemorrhagic anaemia resulting 
from a road traffic accident.  
Assessor’s comment: 
Three of these events occurred in paediatric patients: 1 neutropenia in a 8 year old, 1 leukopenia in a 
15 years old (probably related) and 1 haemoglobin decreased in a 11 year old. No concern rises from 
these data.  
Biochemistry: 3 results were recorded as adverse events all were mild but 2 (increased ALAT and 
increased ALP in 2 adult patients) were assessed as possibly related to rFXIII by the investigators. 
Urinalysis: 8 adverse events were recorded and all were mild and assessed as unlikely related to rFXIII 
by the investigator. 
Assessor’s comment: 
One of the urinalysis events was reported for a 8 years old subject.  
Coagulation parameters: 4 events were recorded and evaluated as unlikely related to rFXIII. In 
addition, an adult patient had an extreme thrombin time value which was not reported as an AE. 
Assessor’s comment: 
One adolescent patient (17 years old) reported a prolonged PT and INR increased and one paediatric 
patient (7 years old) reported a prolonged aPTT.  
Vital signs: 
Mean pulse and mean blood pressure readings remained constant over time and within normal range 
for the population studied. Of note, 3 younger subjects had a low systolic blood pressure reading at 
multiple visits.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/18173/2017

Vital sign readings varied between subjects as expected given the wide range of ages represented in 
this trial.  
Assessor’s comment: 
Three  paediatric  patients  of  8,  10  and  7  years  old  had  systolic  blood  pressures  between  75  and  99 
mmHg, no concern is raised. 
Physical examination 
Overall there were no trends in abnormal physical findings that concerned several subjects within the 
body systems evaluated; however there were a few clinically relevant findings that were clinically 
significant including:  
- bruising on the knee cap of a 10-year-old subject  
- a haematoma in the right forearm of a 16-year-old subject 
- a scalp wound at week 24 in a 27-year-old   
- a bruised palm in a 43-year-old subject 
- a treatment-requiring bleed (from the nostrils) reported in an 8-year-old subject, 19 days post dose, 
after week 132 
Clinically relevant (but not clinically significant) abnormal findings reported during the trial included: 
- a haematoma on one knee in a 52-year-old subject at week 84, and a wound on the left finger of the 
same subject at week 24 that was reported as an AE 
-  a  haematoma  on  the  right  hip  in  a  77-year-old  subject  (week  24)  reported  as  a  non-treatment 
emergent AE 
- a cut on the right hand in a 15-year-old subject at week 24 and contusion on the thumb of the same 
subject reported as an AE at the end-of-trial visit 
- a haematoma on the lower right tibia in a 7-year-old subject at week 48   
- bruising on the left hip in an 8-year-old subject at week 24  
- cuts on the face of 2 young adults at week 24 (lip laceration reported as an AE) 
- bruising on one shin and superficial laceration to the index finger noted for an 8-year-old subject at 
weeks 36 and 84, respectively 
-  mild,  generalized  joint  pain  reported  as  an  AE  (unlikely  related,  not  recovered)  in  a  22-year-old 
subject at the end-of-trial visit.  
Assessor’s comment: 
No trend of physical abnormal observations rises from these data, 7 of these findings were observed in 
paediatric patients but no safety concern emerges.

Pregnancy cases 
Five (5) cases of pregnancy arose during the trial: 
- One subject experienced a “spontaneous” miscarriage at less than 22 weeks gestation. She received 
her last dose of rFXIII 2 weeks prior to losing the pregnancy. She had previously been pregnant 5 
times and had given birth to 3 healthy children. She was withdrawn from the study after being treated 
with rFXIII for 4.5 years. 
- A second subject had a positive pregnancy test at approximately 4 weeks gestation. She received her 
last dose of trial product 27 days before this test result and was withdrawn from the trial the day after. 
Eight months later the subject gave birth to a full-term, healthy infant. No complications were reported 
during the normal pregnancy. The newborn had a small atrial septal defect (ongoing) and a small 
patent ductus arteriosus which has recovered. In both these cases the cause of events was assessed 
as unlikely related to trial product by the investigator. The fetus was exposed to trial product during 
the first trimester of pregnancy. 
- The third case concerned a 27-year old subject who became pregnant after being treated with rFXIII 
for 1 month. She had previously given birth to 2 healthy infants and was not interested in having more 
children. Therefore, the pregnancy was terminated. The subject was withdrawn from the study. She 
later re-enrolled with another ID. 
- The fourth case: The same subject re-enrolled in the trial with another subject ID. She had a positive 
pregnancy test at 32 years of age after being on the trial the second time for approximately 4 years. 
Gestational age at the time of reporting was 3 weeks. She completed her end-of-trial visit at the next 
scheduled visit. She had had 3 previous pregnancies, and had given birth to 2 healthy children at the 
time of reporting. She later gave birth to a full-term, healthy infant. After the delivery the subject 
developed a postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony.  
- The fifth case concerned a 30 year old subject who had a positive home pregnancy test after 
receiving rFXIII for approximately 4 years. Trial product was discontinued when the pregnancy was 
discovered. Gestational age at the time of reporting was 5 weeks 3 days. A routine ultrasound at 
gestational week 7 showed that the pregnancy was ectopic. The pregnancy was terminated as a result. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Safety: 
For the 60 unique subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency who received a cumulative amount of 2410 
administrations, 920 TEAEs were reported (in 56 subjects) and no particular safety concerns were 
identified. No thromboembolic events, anaphylactic/allergic events, fatal adverse events or adverse 
events leading to withdrawal were reported. Serious adverse events were few (19 events in 12 
subjects) and evaluated as unlikely related to trial drug. 
However 12 medication errors classified as MESIs occurred in 8 subjects, including 1 overdose. Five of 
the 12 medication error cases occurred in paediatric patients, but no specific trend of medication error 
has been detected. 
Results on safety laboratory parameters and other safety-related examinations did not indicate 
clinically relevant changes. 
No new significant information was received, no change of SmPC is thus required.

However, the MAH did not provide a specific focus on paediatric population, the MAH should therefore 
provide a comparison of safety data in paediatric an adult patients as regard to TEAEs, TEAEs assessed 
as at least possibly related to rFXIII and serious AEs. 
Efficacy:  
Main efficacy parameters are in concordance with the pivotal F13CD-1725 study and highlight the long 
term efficacy of once-montlhy rFXIII in adult and paediatric subjects.  
Indeed, unadjusted (with regard to age) mean annualised bleeding rates (ABR) was low (0.043 
bleeds/subjects/year).  
However, the MAH is asked to discuss the differences between treatment requiring bleeds on paediatric 
population and non-paediatric population.

recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1-  The MAH should explain the differences between treatments requiring bleeds on paediatric 
population and non-paediatric population. 
2-  An information in the section 5.1 on the SmPC on first results in paediatric population would 
have been interesting. The MAH is asked to discuss this point and to propose a wording.  
3-  The MAH should provide a comparison of safety data in paediatric an adult patients as regard 
to TEAEs, TEAEs assessed as at least possibly related to rFXIII and serious AEs. 
4-  Information on exposed patients and paediatric population should be updated in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC through a type II variation. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Response to question 1 
In the F13CD-3720 trial, there were a total of 2,410 exposures to rFXIII, and the total observation 
period amounted to 186.5 subject years. During this period, 7 subjects experienced 8 bleeds that 
required treatment with a FXIII-containing product making the overall bleeding rate 0.043 bleedings 
per patient per year. The traumatic bleeding rate was 0.032 (n=6) and the spontaneous bleeding rate 
was 0.011 (n=2). 
As traumatic bleeding episodes are normal events also for people who do not have bleeding disorders, 
the spontaneous bleeding rate is the most interesting in this context. A spontaneous bleeding rate of 
0.011 is equivalent to a FXIII congenital factor A-subunit deficiency patient experiencing one 
spontaneous bleed every 91 years. Thus, spontaneous bleeds among patients on prophylaxis with 35

IU/kg rFXIII per month is a very rare event. In these data, the two spontaneous bleeds were 
experienced by a female child of 8 years of age and an adult male of 25 years of age, respectively, and 
thus no difference between spontaneous treatment requiring bleeds in the paediatric population and 
non-paediatric population were detected in the F13CD-3720 trial. When looking at all the bleedings 
that occurred in the trial (n=8), the bleeding rate in patients 6-17 years of age (n=16) was 0.104, and 
the bleeding rate in patients ≥18 years of age (n=44) was 0.022. 
The age-adjusted estimated mean rate of bleeds treated with a FXIII-containing product was 0.021 
bleeds/year during the trial period, estimated at the mean age of 31.0 years, with a 95% confidence 
interval of [0.0062; 0.0734]. Thus the bleeding rate was higher in the lower age group, and younger 
patients tended to bleed more, driven by traumas. 
These results from the F13CD-3720 trial should be seen in the context of the paediatric F13CD- 3835 
trial where 6 children below 6 years of age with FXIII congenital factor A-subunit deficiency were 
followed for a total of 17 patient years and received a total of 214 doses of rFXIII 35 IU/kg. In this trial 
the annual bleeding rate was zero, thus these very small children did not experience any treatment 
requiring bleedings at all, neither traumatic nor spontaneous. 
The F13CD-3835 CTR was submitted as a PAM in September 2015 via sequence 0050 and assessed 
“fullfilled” 01-Apr-2016. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Spontaneous bleeding rates in paediatric population and non-paediatric population are similar. The 
difference between treatment requiring bleeds in paediatric population and non-paediatric population is 
driven by traumatic bleed rate. Thus is expected to be higher in paediatric population. However, 
bleeding rates in both population remain low.

Response to question 2 
NovoNordisk  will  submit  a  general  update  of  the  SmPC  through  a  type  II  variation  no  later  than 
November 2016 to capture the finalisation of the clinical development programme. Section 5.1 of the 
updated SmPC will be updated to reflect the total number of exposed paediatric patients and no longer 
refer to “on-going trials”. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH will submit an update of the SmPC with both information requested in questions 2 and 4 
Point resolved 
Response to question 3 
Data to support the response to question 3 are enclosed in Appendix 1. 
A total of 920 TEAEs have been reported; 413 TEAEs in 14 children and 507 in 42 adults. The reporting 
rate is higher in children than in adults, especially within the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders (5.8 vs. 
1.8%), Injury, Poisoning And Procedural Complications (12.0 vs. 4.3% ), Musculoskeletal and 
Connective Tissue Disorders (9.8% vs. 3.2%), Respiratory, Thoraic and Mediastinal Disorders (11.6 vs. 
1.8%). However, the PTs reported more often in children than in adults are events (e.g cough, 
contusion, ligament sprain, limb injury, arthralgia, pain in extremity, headache and oropharyngeal

pain) which could be expected to occur more often in children than in adults, as children suffer more 
from infections and minor trauma than adults. 
Of these 920 TEAEs 19 were SAEs reported in 12 subjects; 14 SAEs in 9 adults (>18 years) and 5 
SAEs in 3 children (<18 years) were evaluated as unlikely to be related to trial drug. A total of 8 AEs in 
7 subjects including 4 AEs (possible blood in stool, bleed under toenail, elevation of alanine 
aminotransferase and elevation of alkaline phosphatase) in 4 adults and 4 AEs (accidental wrong dose, 
asymptomatic leukopenia, overdose and left knee pain) in 3 children were evaluated as 
possibly/probably related to the trial drug; all AEs were mild in severity and all subjects were 
recovered. 
In conclusion, children have a higher rate of adverse events than adults, as could be expected from the 
general morbidity pattern experienced for children with more infections and minor trauma than adults. 
Assessor’s comment: 
As requested, the MAH provided a comparison of safety data in paediatric and non-paediatric 
population. Concerning TEAEs, the reporting rate was higher in children than those in adults but events 
reported are expected to occur more often in children than in adults. Concerning SAEs, the reported 
rates were similar.

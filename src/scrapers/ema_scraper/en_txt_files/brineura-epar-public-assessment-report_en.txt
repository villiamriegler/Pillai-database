1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant BioMarin International Limited submitted on 27 May 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Brineura, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 August 2014. 
Brineura was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1118 on 13 March 2013 in the following 
condition: Treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Brineura is indicated for the treatment of patients with CLN2 disease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase‑ 1 
(TPP1) deficiency.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Brineura as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
cerliponase alfa was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0260/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0260/2013 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative 
lysosomal storage disorders, which are characterised by accumulations of intracellular lipofuscin-like material 
in multiple organs leading to functional impairments and ultimately death (Mole et al., 2005). The different 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are distinguished by the genetic origin, ultrastructural composition of the 
lysosomal storage material, clinical symptoms, age at disease onset and course of disease. 
Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 2 (CLN2) disorder, formerly also known as 
Jansky-Bielschowsky disease or classical late infantile onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (cLINCL), is a rare, 
paediatric-onset neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by TPP1 enzyme deficiency as a 
consequence of loss-of-function mutation in the CLN 2 gene. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 occurs with an estimated incidence between 0.22 to 9.0 
per 100,000 live births worldwide (Mole and Williams, 2013; Fietz et al., 2016). The estimated worldwide 
prevalence of CLN2 is 0.6 to 0.7 per million population in northern Europe (Claussen et al.,1992; Uvebrant 
and Hagberg, 1997). Recent estimates based solely on genetically diagnosed cases suggest a prevalence of 
0.75 per million with 15-20 new patients born each year (0.22 per 100.000 live births) in Germany. Since the 
epidemiology estimates are based on identified cases, and since access to paediatric neurologists and medical 
genetics is limited, it is likely that there are additional cases that remain undiagnosed. However, even 
assuming that the true prevalence is several folds higher than the current estimates, CLN2 is still a very rare 
disorder.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
So far, 89 different recessive mutations in the autosomal CLN2 gene encoding TPP1 have been identified. The 
mutations mainly result in reduction or loss of TPP1 activity due to impaired lysosomal transport and 
cleavage of the truncated or misfolded pro-enzyme (Kousi et al., 2012). The two most common mutations in 
the Northern European and US populations are the splice site mutation IV5-1G>C and the nonsense R208X. 
Whichever of the common mutations are present, the clinical phenotype is broadly similar. However, 
considerable inter- and intra-familial variation in disease severity has been described in the literature 
(Moleet al., 2005). 
TPP1 deficiency causes progressive intracellular accumulation of lysosomal storage material with 
characteristic autofluorescence under the light microscope and mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c 
(SCMAS) as its major component. This lysosomal storage material shows a “curvilinear profile” during 
electron microscopy. 
The connection between the storage process and neurodegeneration remains unknown. Organ damage has 
been described to be restricted to the central nervous system, although pathologic intracellular storage 
occurs in almost any tissue, including muscle, skin and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Kohlschütter and 
Schulz, 2016).

Page 9/95 
  
  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 2 (CLN2 disease) typically present with 
slowing of development and psychomotor regression, usually in the second or third year of life. The diagnosis 
is on average confirmed at 4 years of age. Epilepsy typically develops early, between 2 and 4 years of age, 
usually presents with variable seizure types and is often refractory to treatment. Patients further develop 
ataxia, myoclonus, impaired speech and cognition as well as developmental regression. The visual, cognitive 
and motor skills decline rapidly. The general decay of psychomotor function is rapid and uniform between the 
third and fourth birthday, however atypical patients with later onset, tending to have a milder course with 
more prominent ataxia and less prominent epilepsy have also been described (Kohlschütter and Schulz, 
2016; Schulz et al., 2013; Steinfeld et al., 2002). Some children become extremely irritable and distressed. 
Limb spasticity may become prominent with truncal hypotonia and loss of head control (Mole et al., 2005). 
In general, patients loose vision, are wheelchair-bound and require gastrostomy feeding at approximately 
6 years of age. They subsequently enter a vegetative state with death occurring between 10 and 16 years of 
age. 
Diagnosis is based on demonstration of TPP1 enzymatic deficiency in dried blood spots, leukocytes or 
fibroblasts. The residual TPP1 activity in fibroblasts is <2%. The last step for confirmation of the diagnosis is 
mutation analysis of the TPP1 gene. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, no curative treatment for late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 exists and the 
diagnosis is invariably fatal. Symptomatic treatments are focused on the treatment of seizures 
(anticonvulsants), motor control loss (bracing or wheelchairs) and feeding/control of aspiration risk 
(gastrostomy tube). Disease management further includes physical and speech therapy, different medications 
aiming at alleviating symptoms like myoclonus, spasticity, dystonia and pain as well as end-of-life care at 
advanced disease stage. 
2.2.  About the product 
Brineura (cerliponase alfa, also referred to as BMN 190 in this report) is an unmodified recombinant form of 
the human serine tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (rhTPP1) that is expressed as inactive 563 amino acid pro-enzyme 
(zymogen) in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. 
The enzyme replacement therapy with the BMN 190 exopeptidase is expected to reduce the inclusions of 
lysosomal storage material in the CNS and attenuate progression of the disease. In order to allow passage of 
the macromolecule across the blood-brain-barrier, BMN 190 is administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) 
into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as an inactive pro-drug by a catheter that is implanted into the lateral 
cerebral ventricle of the non-dominant hemisphere. The post-translational glycosylation of the inactive 
563 amino acid pro-enzyme BMN 190 with N-linked oligosaccharides is critical for the lysosomal uptake of the 
enzyme by the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR). During secretion into 
lysosomes, a 195 amino acid fragment is then cleaved from the 66 kDa zymogen to release the active 46 kDa 
TPP1. Thus, the activity of BMN 190 is confined to the lysosome. 
Brineura has been formulated as 30 mg/ml solution for ICV infusion in 5 ml vials.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on the unmet medical need as currently there are no 
approved treatments for CLN2. The data available from the development programme have demonstrated that 
Brineura as an enzyme replacement therapy delivered via ICV application has a potential to address this 
unmet medical need.   
The Applicant requested marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The applicant argued that 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use could not be provided. As 
outlined in section 2.1.2 of this report, CLN2 is an ultra-rare disease and is encountered so rarely that it 
cannot reasonably be expected that comprehensive evidence will be obtained. The CHMP agreed with this 
argumentation.  
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product, also referred as ‘drug product’ (DP) by the applicant, is presented as a sterile solution 
for ICV infusion containing cerliponase alfa, an unmodified recombinant form of rhTPP1, as active substance, 
also referred as drug substance (DS) by the applicant, formulated at a concentration of 30 mg/mL.  
Cerliponase alfa and rhTPP1 are used interchangeably throughout the dossier and report. 
Other ingredients are: sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, 
sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, calcium chloride dihydrate, and water 
for injection. 
The formulation is packaged in a container closure system consisting of a 10 mL Type 1 clear borosilicate 
glass vial closed with a fluoropolymer coated butyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap and aluminium crimp 
seal. Each vial is supplied as a 150 mg dosage strength vial.  
The pack size consists of 3 vials (two vials with 5 mL solution for ICV infusion of Brineura and one vial with 5 
mL flushing solution for ICV infusion). The contents of two vials of the finished product are combined for a 
volume of 10 mL and are administered to patients for a dose of 300 mg. Following administration the infusion 
set, port needle and ICV device are flushed with 5 mL Flushing Solution (ICV solution) in order to fully 
administer the finished product and maintain patency of the ICV access device.  
The DP is supplied frozen and stored at a temperature of -20 ± 5°C. 
2.4.  Active Substance 
Cerliponase alfa is secreted by recombinant CHO cells as an enzymatically-inactive, 544 amino acid zymogen 
(pro-enzyme), rhTPP1. rhTPP1 has identical primary amino acid sequence to the human tripeptidyl peptidase-
1 (hTPP1) zymogen 
The zymogen can be further processed to form the mature, active protease (amino acids 177 to 544). This 
processing is autocatalytic in vitro upon exposure of the pro-enzyme to low pH, while the in vivo activation 
upon uptake to the lysosome may involve additional proteases. rhTPP1 contains 7 cysteine residues, 6 of 
which are involved in intramolecular disulphide bridges (C92–C103, C346–C507, and C503–C518). One 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 11/95 
  
  
cysteine residue on the mature enzyme (C208) is unpaired. There are 5 N-glycosylation sites on rhTPP1, 
decorated with high mannose, phosphorylated high mannose and complex glycosylation structures. 
The primary activity of the mature rhTPP is as a tripeptidyl exopeptidase with a broad substrate specificity. 
rhTPP1 is taken up and translocated to the lysosomes by target cells through the Cation Independent 
Mannose-6-Phosphate receptor (CI-MPR, also known as M6P/IGF2 receptor). 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Novato Campus/Galli Drive, CA, USA, performs manufacture of rhTPP1 
formulated bulk drug substance (FBDS).  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of cerliponase alfa active substance has been adequately described. rhTPP1 is produced by 
CHO cells that over-express the rhTPP1 transgene. The rhTPP1 manufacturing process consists of fed-batch 
cell culture, harvest recovery, and purification processes, including viral filtration, resulting in FBDS, which is 
a process hold point preceding manufacture of the finished product. 
The FBDS manufacturing process description and the control of critical steps provided in sections S.2.2 and 
S.2.4 has been updated to meet the requirements of a sound regulatory commitment.  
During the procedure, deficiencies were addressed with respect to the upstream process: The process 
parameters that have been defined as critical are adequately reflected in the dossier sections S.2.2 and 2.4. 
Several issues were updated with regard to process description of the downstream process as well. Regarding 
the viral inactivation/ virus reduction steps, the mixing conditions applied are stated and the filter types and 
sizes of the filters used for virus reduction have been defined. 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable and the in-process controls are 
adequately set. 
BioMarin has assessed the suitability of the container closure system for use in the rhTPP1 manufacturing 
process. Studies to evaluate extractables and leachables have been performed. This container closure format 
is used for the stability program for rhTPP1 FBDS using scaled-down versions of the FBDS bottles. Stability 
studies indicate FBDS stability and compatibility with the container closure materials. 
Control of materials 
rhTPP1 is expressed in CHO cells; a two tiered banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a 
working cell bank (WCB) has been established for the production cell line. Full and comprehensible 
information regarding the preparation and testing of MCB and WCB has been provided. All test results were 
satisfactory and the cell banks have been released for production use by Quality Assurance. In addition, 
preparation of cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LCA) has been also included in the dossier. Results for cell 
culture samples obtained at the end of production demonstrate that cells at the LCA are genetically stable, 
and that under the cell culture conditions, no new viral or infectious retroviral particles are expressed or 
introduced that were not detected during screening of the MCB and WCB. Finally, the results of the studies 
performed on cells from the MCB and End of Production Cells (EOPC) to determine genetic identity and 
stability following ICH guidelines confirm the expected genetic characteristics of the cell line.

The raw materials used for cell culture and purification are listed in the dossier. Where applicable, reference 
is made to compendial monographs. No raw materials derived from animal sources are used in the process. 
Information on the qualitative composition of the cell culture media has been provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
BioMarin utilises a control system in the manufacture of rhTPP1 through monitoring of in-process conditions, 
characteristics and release specifications. In-process testing is performed on each lot of rhTPP1. Action limits 
have been defined for bioburden and endotoxin. In case a deviation is encountered, an investigation is 
initiated and corrective actions will be defined and implemented. The hold times stated in this section are 
supported by the process validation (PV) data provided. 
A proper justification for CQAs selection and their related CPPs has been presented. The information provided 
in section S.2.4 comprises critical in-process tests and critical process parameters. Process step yield and 
purity will be monitored on an ongoing basis and defined as critical controls once sufficient manufacturing 
experience is gained. This is considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
Three consecutive FBDS batches were manufactured at commercial scale by the intended commercial 
process. Overall, the consistency of the FBDS manufacturing process has been adequately confirmed. 
Column resin re-use studies and hold time studies have been performed the results of which are adequately 
reflected in the process description/control of critical steps. 
The overall shipping strategy performed by the Applicant is adequate. 
Characterisation 
For the characterisation exercise, the three process qualification (PQ) lots, manufactured using the final 
commercial process, three clinical FBDS lots and the reference material BMN190-0313-001 were analyzed 
head-to-head by the tests included in the specification and additional tests. These studies were also intended 
to establish comparability between clinical batches and batches manufactured by the final commercial 
process.  
In general, the active substance has been comprehensively characterised by orthogonal methods. The 
characterisation studies comprise studies of the primary, secondary and tertiary structure, post-translational 
modifications as well as functional analysis. The extent and the sites of glycosylation of rhTPP1 have been 
adequately investigated. The amino acid sequence of rhTPP1 has been sufficiently confirmed. Disulfide 
linkage determination confirmed the existence of the three disulfide bridges. Charge heterogeneity has been 
determined. The molecular weight of the protein has been determined. Profiling of N-linked glycans has been 
analysed. Overall, glycosylation has been appropriately investigated.  
Cellular uptake of rhTPP1 through the M6P receptor was measured. Enzyme activity was determined with and 
without prior activation of rhTPP1 zymogen. The potency assays are considered adequate to demonstrate 
biological functionality of rhTTP1 comprising receptor binding, cellular uptake and enzymatic activity.  
Samples of rhTPP1 lots were subjected to a set of forced degradation conditions chosen for their expected 
impact on the protein structure. The studies demonstrate that rhTPP1 is sensitive to acid and base hydrolysis, 
oxidation, thermal stress and extreme prolonged exposure to light.  
To characterise the product-related impurities, a panel of analytical methods including release tests as well as 
additional characterization tests have been used.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes test parameters on identity, potency  and content, purity and 
impurities  and microbiological safety. The list of parameters tested at release is considered comprehensive.  
During the procedure, the proposed specification for release and shelf-life was updated and the limits of 
several relevant parameters were tightened. 
Analytical methods 
The appearance, pH, and osmolality assays are performed per Pharmacopoeia, and were qualified for their 
intended use. The in-house analytical methods used for DS release testing have been linked with respective 
SOPs which are also provided. Non-compendial methods are adequately described. Detailed information has 
been provided with regard to the validation of the proposed analytical procedures included in the DS 
specification. All in-house analytical procedures were demonstrated to meet the defined validation 
requirements and have been shown to be suitable for their intended use. Potency is determined using 
different methods.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data have been provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Three primary reference standards have been used through the development of the product. The current 
standard is derived from one batch obtained by the commercial process and is used as primary and 
secondary reference standard.  
Stability 
Stability data are provided. Stability batches have been stored at the proposed long-term storage condition 
and at accelerated conditions which is in accordance with ICH requirements. The proposed stability protocols 
are considered appropriate.  
2.4.1.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The finished product consists of 3 vials: two vials of Brineura and one vial of the flushing solution. These are 
described separately here below. 
2.4.1.1.  Finished Medicinal Product: Brineura 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product, also referred to as BMN 190 in the submission, is a sterile solution for 
intracerebroventricular infusion. It is a clear and colourless to pale yellow liquid containing rhTPP1 protein 
formulated at a concentration of 30 mg/mL.  
The finished product formulation was developed to present the active substance in a simulated cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) without protein stabilisers as there is insufficient knowledge on adverse effects associated with 
foreign substances in the brain. The formulation is finalised at FBDS stage, further formulation steps are not 
applied during finished product manufacturing. In addition to the active substance, the formulation contains 
buffering agents (Sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate and Sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate), 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 14/95 
  
  
an isotonicity agent (sodium chloride), excipients to maintain the level of CSF electrolytes (potassium 
chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate and calcium chloride dihydrate), and water for injection as diluent. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur and/or 
USP standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. As the formulation 
does not contain stabilisers to mitigate protein aggregation, measures to avoid and remove potential 
particulates have been implemented, including using an in-line filter during administration, gentle handling of 
rhTPP1, and appropriate freeze-thaw instructions. 
The container closure system for the DP consists of type 1 glass vials, butyl rubber stoppers with 
fluoropolymer coating and an aluminium seal with color-coded flip caps. The material complies with Ph.Eur. 
and EC requirements. Compatibility of the formulation with the container closure system as well as container 
closure integrity of the frozen product was demonstrated by stability studies.  
The finished product is shipped frozen on dry ice.  
Leachable studies were performed with the container closures system using finished product and flushing 
solution as extraction fluids. All found leachables were evaluated to be of no toxicological concern. 
Furthermore, the vials filled with finished product and flushing solution were not found to be susceptible to 
glass delamination for the proposed shelf life period of 24 months. Studies demonstrated that finished 
product and flushing solution are compatible with the infusion system components which have been used for 
the administration to date. For sterile, drug contacting infusion system components, this consisted of testing 
the components for adverse impact on the quality or potency of the DP, using multiple assays. Studies were 
completed under simulated clinical use conditions for the longest anticipated infusion and contact time. An in-
line, 0.2 µm filter will be required for administration of the finished product to remove proteinaceous 
particulates which are formed in the absence of stabilizing agents in the DP as mentioned above. It has been 
demonstrated that the filter delivers a solution that complies with the requirements for the sub-visible 
particles test in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.9.19. Studies also show that in-line filtration does not have a 
detectable effect on the purity or strength of the finished product.  
The infusion system components used to date are considered sufficiently evaluated for use with the DP and 
FS. The results of compatibility studies of the finished product and flushing solution with application systems 
are reflected in the SmPC, the compatible application systems are included.  
No changes to the formulation have been made between the clinical and commercial manufacturing 
campaigns. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
A GMP Certificate issued by an EEA authority for the proposed finished product manufacturer originally 
included in the MAA is not available. A pre-approval GMP inspection as prerequisite for a GMP Certificate 
resulted in major deficiencies. The deficiencies could not be solved and a GMP Certificate was not provided 
during the ongoing authorisation procedure. Therefore, the original site has been removed from the 
application dossier as required in the respective Major Objection.  
Due to the unmet medical need of Brineura, CHMP agreed to replace the proposed finished product 
manufacturer, during the on-going authorisation procedure. The minimum conditions for the introduction the 
replacement site were discussed and agreed on.  
To support the replacement of the manufacturing site, a detailed description of changes, a full risk 
assessment of the transfer, data supporting analytical methods transfer validation, previous relevant 
experience the applicant has at this site and process validation plans were required and in general provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017

For approval, satisfactory validation and comparability data had been provided. The process validation 
protocol has been provided as requested. Furthermore, the proposed submissions timelines are detailed and 
are accepted.  The applicant has provided acceptable data and documentation concerning the introduction of 
the replacement site.  
The manufacturing process of the finished product is a common fill-finish procedure. 
Process validation data have been provided. The process parameters have been verified, in process controls 
met defined criteria and the final drug product met release specifications. The release results have been 
found to be in line with historical results.  
Product specification  
The finished product specification comprises tests for identity, quality, potency, strength, purity, safety, and 
composition. The specification includes all necessary quality attributes to control the finished product.  
Analytical methods 
Most of the analytical methods are identical to the methods used for the release of the active substance 
which is accepted as FBDS and DP are identical in composition. The descriptions of the additional analytical 
procedures specific for the DP are acceptable and the methods are suitable for their intended use.  
Batch analysis 
Finished product batch analysis data for batches used in clinical, stability and process validation studies were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference material used to test the finished product is the same as that used for testing of FBDS. Refer to 
Section 3.2.S.5 for information regarding reference materials. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed drug product shelf-life of 24 months at -20±5°C is considered acceptable.  
In section 6.3 of the SmPC storage of the unopened vials at 2-8°C is limited to 24 hours. This is accepted 
based on the stability testing results at accelerated storage conditions (5 ± 3°C). 
The applicant demonstrated physico-chemical in-use stability for 12 hours which covers the maximum 
infusion time. In addition, in-use storage of open vials or product held in syringes of 4 hours at 2-8°C prior to 
infusion was claimed based on a microbial challenge study on FBDS. Given the sensitive application way for 
Brineura in-use storage prior to infusion is not considered acceptable. The applicant was requested to revise 
section 6.3 of the SmPC accordingly. Hence, in-use storage of open vials or product held in syringes of not 
more than 4 hours at 2-8°C prior to infusion has been deleted. The requirement that the drug product should 
be withdrawn from the unopened vials only immediately prior to use has been added instead. 
Photostability studies were conducted on the FBDS placed in the same container closure system as the drug 
product demonstrating that the drug product is light sensitive. The photo sensitivity is reflected in labelling 
and SPC: “Store in the original package to protect from light.”

2.4.1.2.  Finished Medicinal Product: Flushing solution 
The flushing solution (FS) is a sterile solution for infusion for ICV administration that will be supplied in a 
Type 1 clear borosilicate glass vial, closed with a fluoropolymer coated butyl rubber stopper and capped with 
an aluminium seal. The FS is clear and colourless. Each vial is filled to a target volume of 5.4 mL to enable 
the withdrawal and delivery of 5 mL of solution. The composition of the FS is the same as of the finished 
product, except the FS does not contain the active substance, rhTPP1. The manufacturing process 
corresponds to that described for the finished product, only the volume filtered and filled is different. 
Validation of the manufacturing process has been performed. The provided information is sufficient.  The 
specification for the flushing solution covers all necessary tests for identity, quality, safety and composition. 
Formal stability study data for FS stored at -20 ± 5 ºC combined with those generated with storage at 25 ± 2 
ºC / 60 ± 5% RH support a cumulative shelf life of 24 months, which may include up to a year at room 
temperature prior to being frozen. 
Adventitious agents 
The finished product does not contain any animal-derived ingredients. Prior to release of the MCB and WCB of 
the production cell line testing was performed to ensure the cell line is free of endogenous infective viral 
particles or other adventitious agents. 
The ability of the rhTPP1 manufacturing process to remove or inactivate potential viruses has been validated. 
The overall inactivation/removal capacity is regarded as sufficient for eliminating potential viral 
contamination. The risk with TSE is considered negligible. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
A GMP Certificate issued by an EEA authority for the originally proposed finished product manufacturer is not 
available (Major Objection). A pre-approval GMP inspection as prerequisite for a GMP Certificate resulted in 
major deficiencies. The deficiencies could not be solved and a GMP Certificate was not provided during the 
ongoing authorisation procedure. Therefore, the site was removed from the application dossier as required.  
Due to the unmet medical need of Brineura, the CHMP agreed to replace the proposed finished medicinal 
manufacturer during the on-going authorisation procedure. The replacement site is appropriately authorised 
for the proposed manufacturing activities and holds a valid MIA. The minimum conditions for the introduction 
of the replacement site were discussed and agreed on. Comparability data and process validation data were 
requested (Major Objection) and satisfactory data was provided. The updated information on development, 
manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
Two recommendations have been included. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.4.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends points for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program consisted of one in vitro study in TPP1-deficient human fibroblasts, and 8 in vivo 
studies; 3 single-dose studies in Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, and 5 repeat-dose studies in TPP1 
KO mice, and juvenile TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs.  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamic properties of BMN 190 were investigated in TPP1-deficient human fibroblasts 
in vitro and in two animal models of human late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2, TPP1 knockout 
mice and TPP1-null longhaired dachshund dogs. 
BMN 190 was taken up into TPP1-deficient human fibroblasts with an average half maximum rate (K uptake) of 
3.1 nM, which is considerably lower than the cmax of BMN 190 in human CSF. This uptake of BMN 190 was 
effectively inhibited by either the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-galactosamine-4-sulfate sulfatase, or high 
levels of mannose-6-phosphate, hence confirming the expected role of the cation-independent mannose-
6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) in the lysosomal uptake of the substance. 
In adult TPP1 knockout mice, three consecutive IT-L infusions of 0.8 mg/day BMN 190 effectively reduced the 
brain levels of SCMAS, a surrogate marker of lysosomal storage material, which is known to accumulate in 
late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2. When the three consecutive IT-L infusions of up to 
0.4 mg/day (~30 mg/kg) were started at an earlier age of 4 weeks, BMN 190 dose-dependently prolonged 
the survival of the TPP1 knockout mice compared to vehicle-treated TPP1 mutant controls from 16 to 
23 weeks. In addition, BMN 190 clearly delayed the impairments in locomotor function, which already 
declined in vehicle-treated TPP1 mutant controls from 14 weeks of age.  
In four investigations in juvenile TPP1-null longhaired dachshund dogs aged 9 weeks to approximately 
4 months, BMN 190 was repeatedly administered by either IT-C bolus injection or as infusions via the ICV 
and IT-L routes, because administration sites had to be changed depending on the patency of the catheter 
and its dislocation due to growth of the animals. 
Three consecutive BMN 190 doses of up to 32 mg effectively reduced the autofluorescent lysosomal storage 
material throughout the brain and spinal cord of one TPP1-null dachshund dog, albeit with variable levels of 
TPP1 activity. After repetitive infusion of 4 to 48 mg BMN 190 at rates of 0.3 to 0.6 ml/h, BMN 190 dose-
dependently attenuated neurological deficits, improved cognitive learning functions in a T-maze apparatus 
and prolonged the lifespan of TPP1-null dachshund dogs in a single case for up 88 weeks of age. Moreover, 
quantitative MRI demonstrated that BMN 190 delayed ventricular enlargement and brain atrophy until 
approximately 16.5 months of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 18/95 
  
  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No investigation of the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of BMN 190 was performed, which was 
justified by its administration as a pharmacologically inactive pro-drug that requires activation in the acidic 
environment of the lysosome. This has been accepted by the CHMP.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were performed with BMN 190, but parameters of cardiovascular 
safety and CNS function were integrated into one single-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys and 
following repetitive administration in TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs in line with the pertinent ICH S6(R1) 
guideline (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998). 
BMN 190 did not adversely affect safety pharmacological parameters of cardiovascular and CNS function, in 
these studies. The absence of the evaluation of respiratory function is accepted given the lack of adverse 
respiratory findings in monkeys, after repeated administration in dachshund dogs and during clinical 
development. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
As BMN 190 is an inactive pro-drug of a recombinant human protein that requires activation in the acidic 
environment of the lysosome, no pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs can be reasonably expected. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic parameters of BMN 190 in CSF and plasma were evaluated in single dose 
toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys and following repeated dosing in the four pharmacodynamic 
investigations in TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs. In addition, the CNS distribution of BMN 190 was 
analysed as part of the studies in dachshund dogs and also after single administration in Beagle dogs. In 
these investigations, BMN 190 concentrations were determined in the different matrices using non-validated 
ELISA assays. 
Maximum BMN 190 concentrations in the CSF of Cynomolgus monkeys and dachshund dogs were achieved 
shortly after the end of ICV infusions and remained above the Kuptake (~3.1 nM or ~183 ng/ml) determined in 
TPP1-deficient human fibroblasts. The intracellular trafficking of BMN 190 to lysosomes has not been 
investigated. The t max was prolonged with the extension of the infusion duration from 2 to 4 h. The AUC 
increased dose-dependently in the CSF of dachshund dogs after the first dose. There was no difference in the 
CSF exposure between TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs following multiple administrations. In addition, no 
influence of the age of the animals at study initiation was apparent. 
Despite the macromolecular size of BMN 190, systemic exposure was evident in both Cynomolgus monkeys 
and dachshund dogs after ICV, IT-L or IT-C administration, although Cmax and AUC values were comparably 
about 230 to 1000-fold lower in plasma than in CSF of both species. Accordingly, BMN 190 not only passed 
the presumably compromised blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in TPP1-null dachshund dogs and human CLN2 
patients, but also crossed the intact BBB in healthy monkeys. In contrast, BMN 190 apparently does not enter 
the eye to ameliorate the retinopathies in TPP1-null dachshund dogs.  
BMN 190 was extensively distributed into various brain and spinal cord regions in Beagle and dachshund dogs 
as well as Cynomolgus monkeys and was commonly found to be enriched in superficial brain regions in 
proximity to CSF flow compared to deep brain layers. In Cynomolgus monkeys, highest BMN 190 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 19/95 
  
  
concentrations were determined in superficial occipital cortex, cerebral cortex and cerebellum as well as in 
deep regions of the medulla, whereas in dachshund dogs, BMN 190 levels were particularly increased in 
hypothalamus, pons, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The majority of BMN 190 in dachshund dogs was 
eliminated from CSF within 168 h and from plasma within 80 h post infusion. 
CHMP accepted the lack of any investigation of the metabolism and excretion of BMN 190 in line with the 
prevailing the ICH S6(R1) guideline (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998). CHMP also considered that 
pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are not required, because no interference with potentially co-
administered small molecule drugs is reasonably expected for the unmodified recombinant human BMN 190 
protein. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Two single dose distribution, toxicity and TK studies were conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys given BMN 190 
via  either  by  ICV  or  IT-L  infusion.  Both  single  dose  toxicity  studies  did  not  reveal  any  BMN  190-related 
findings  in  the  CNS  or  other  organs.  Only  catheter-related  inflammation  was  observed  in  all  animals, 
including vehicle controls, and this was an expected finding due to the route and method of administration. 
After IT-L infusion, mononuclear cell infiltrates were additionally identified in the meninges of the brain and 
spinal cord, which represent common non-adverse findings of CSF-administered drugs.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Instead of performing stand-alone repeated-dose toxicity studies, the safety of multiple doses of BMN 190 
administered either monthly or biweekly for 3 to 18 months was evaluated as part of the abovementioned 
four investigations in juvenile TPP1-null mutant and WT longhaired dachshund dogs. This approach was 
endorsed, because this animal model replicates disease-related aspects of human CLN2 disease, which would 
not be reflected by standard toxicity investigations in healthy species. Moreover, dachshund dogs were 
approximately 2 to 2.5 or 4 months old at study initiation and correspond to the age range of the envisaged 
paediatric patient population.  
Anaphylactoid reactions/hypersensitivity reactions (facial oedema, erythema of the ears and face, urticaria, 
pale mucous membrane, vomiting, diarrhoea, tachycardia and hypotension) emerged shortly after the second 
or third administration of BMN 190 doses greater than 4 mg in TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs, but not in 
vehicle-treated animals. Inflammatory reactions attributable to the catheter administration procedure 
(pleocytosis, infections, astrocytosis, microgliosis) developed after prolonged infusion in all dachshund dogs 
independent of the genotype or treatment with BMN 190 or vehicle. The serum levels of cardiac troponin I, a 
marker for cardiomyopathy, were found to be elevated in the surviving BMN 190-treated male and female 
TPP1-null dachshund dogs from 36, 40 and 43 weeks of age, respectively, whereas cardiac troponin I 
remained within normal ranges in BMN 190-treated WT dogs.  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted with BMN 190. BMN 190 is not anticipated to be genotoxic due to its 
molecular structure and its mechanism of action. BMN 190 is an unmodified recombinant variant of the 
human TPP1 pro-enzyme. BMN 190 is not anticipated to enter the nucleus or interact with DNA, thus the 
genotoxicity risk is negligible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 20/95 
  
  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted for BMN 190 as it is not anticipated to be carcinogenic based on its 
mechanism of action. BMN 190 is not an immunomodulator and is not expected to bind to DNA or influence 
cell  proliferation.  BMN  190  is  administered  as  an  inactive  proenzyme,  and  activated  following  lysosomal 
uptake.  Enzymatic  activity  is  restricted  to  the  lysosome  where  BMN  190  degrades  accumulated  storage 
materials. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproduction toxicity studies were conducted. Reproductive organs were supposed to be analysed in the 
multiple dose dachshund dog studies, but limited histopathological data were only available from two studies. 
Overall, one testis, 4 cervices, 3 ovaries and uteri of 1 male and 4 female TPP1-null dachshund dogs were 
compared with 2 testes and 1 cervix, ovary and uterus of 2 male and 1 female WT dachshund dogs indicating 
lack of any adverse effect of BMN 190. 
Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  studies  were  not  conducted.  In  agreement  with  current  ICH S6(R1)  recommendations 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998),  the  tolerability  of  the  catheter-mediated  drug  delivery  has  been  evaluated 
after  single  administration  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  and  following  repeated  dosing  in  TPP1-null  and  WT 
dachshund  dogs.  Histopathological  assessment  revealed  no  BMN 190-related  effects,  but  neuronal  necrosis 
and inflammation directly associated with mechanical damage from the ICV catheter, that were present in all 
groups including vehicle controls.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
BMN 190 is an unmodified recombinant human protein, which is metabolised to endogenous amino acids. For 
this reason, BMN 190 is not expected to pose a risk to the environment in line with the pertinent European 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 1). 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamic rationale for clinical therapy of human CLN2 disease with BMN190 has been 
adequately demonstrated in two non-clinical in vivo models of CLN 2, TPP1 knockout mice and juvenile TPP1-
null longhaired dachshund dogs. In these investigations, BMN 190 administered by the ICV, IT-L or IT-C 
routes effectively ameliorated the disease symptoms. BMN 190 reduced the lysosomal storage material, 
dose-dependently prolonged the survival and attenuated the impairments in cognitive learning and locomotor 
function of the animals. In TPP1-null dachshund dogs, BMN 190 also delayed ventricular enlargement and 
brain atrophy. Given the demonstration of lysosomal uptake of BMN 190 by TPP1-deficient human fibroblasts 
in vitro and the undoubted efficacy of BMN 190 in two different animal models of human late infantile 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 in vivo, further in vitro investigation of the uptake of BMN 190 in 
neuronal cells of dachshund dogs and humans is not necessary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 21/95 
  
  
 
 
 
It was noted that the TPP1 activity assay used to determine the effective BMN 190 dose revealed a high 
variability between TPP1 knockout mice that had received the same BMN 190 regimen, probably due to the 
technical difficulties in administering BMN 190 to the intrathecal space of TPP1 KO mice. 
The results have also shown that BMN 190 did not reduce lysosomal storage material in the retina of TPP1-
null dachshund dogs and, hence, did not interfere with progressive multifocal retinal detachment lesions in 
these animals. This lack of efficacy has been ascribed to the restricted CSF supply of the eye compared to 
other part of the CNS. BMN 190 is not expected to reach therapeutic concentration in the eye. 
The investigations in juvenile TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs were also used to evaluate the repeated-
dose toxicity of BMN 190. This was endorsed as the animals covered the age range of the intended paediatric 
patient population. In addition, non-compliance with GLP regulations was also accepted, because this animal 
model better reflects the disease-related symptoms of CLN2 than healthy species in standard toxicity studies. 
However, the investigations in dachshund dogs are afflicted by several deficiencies in the design, the 
performance and documentation, which clearly limit the interpretation of the results. Specifically, the overall 
low number of animals, the lack of appropriate controls including historical data as well as the different doses 
and variable number of infusions within studies due to prominent hypersensitivity reactions clearly limit the 
interpretation of the findings. The remarkably different pharmacokinetic results even at the same BMN 190 
doses are most likely attributable to the frequent changes of the CSF administration routes in dachshund dog 
studies due to complications with the catheter device, to the infusion duration, the generally low and variable 
numbers of CSF samples with high inter-individual variability and the use of non-validated ELISA assays. For 
these reasons, the results of the studies in juvenile dachshund dogs are inconclusive.  
As the clinical dose of 300 mg BMN 190 was justified based on the tolerability of the 16 mg dose in 
dachshund dogs, clarification of the different hypersensitivity reactions observed in two dachshund dog 
studies after ICV infusion of 16 mg BMN 190 had been requested. The drug batches used in both studies had 
comparable specifications for endotoxins and high molecular weight species and differed only in low contents 
of polysorbate-80. However, a possible influence of CHOP contaminants and also of the vehicle could not be 
excluded, because hypersensitivity reactions even continued in the absence of BMN 190. As the 
hypersensitivities observed during clinical BMN 190 therapy only partially resemble those noted in animals 
and are also included in the proposed SmPC, the lack of further clarification on the inconsistent tolerability of 
the 16 mg BMN 190 dose is accepted. 
The increased levels of cardiac troponin I, a marker for cardiomyopathy, which were determined in four 
BMN 190-treated TPP1-null dachshund dogs starting between 36 and 43 weeks of age, were attributed to the 
disease progression in these animals. This is agreed, because cardiac myofibre degeneration was additionally 
found only in the BMN 190-treated TPP1-null dachshund dog, which survived for the longest time period of 88 
weeks. Moreover, autofluorescent lipopigments had been previously detected in the heart of another dog 
model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Armstrong et al., 1986) and cardiac hypertrophy was identified in 
human patients (Hofman et al., 2001; Gilbert-Barness, 2004) including also one case of cardiac death of an 
adult CLN2 disease patient (Fukumura et al., 2012). Based on available ECG measurements from therapeutic 
use of BMN 190, the need for routine ECG monitoring will be further pursued clinically. 
The reproduction toxicity of BMN 190 was not investigated, although the drug might potentially be able to 
prolong the survival and quality of life of paediatric CLN2 disease patients. Accordingly, CHMP had 
recommended during scientific advice to perform a fertility assessment. So far, very limited histopathological 
data from male and female reproductive organs of BMN 190-treated TPP1-null dachshund dogs did not 
indicate any adverse effect of BMN 190. The absence of the relevant non-clinical data has been adequately 
labelled in the Product Information.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
BMN 190 is applied as aqueous solution directly into the CSF therefore absolute or relative bioavailability and 
food effect studies were not conducted. The formulation used in the clinical trials has been declared to be 
identical with the marketed formulation. A rapid increase in CSF concentration was observed with Cmax 
occurring after the end of infusion.  Tmax was reached at ~4-5 hours in CSF and ~12 hours in plasma after 
start of infusion. 
After the first ICV administration of 30 mg dose, 100 mg dose and 300 mg dose, Cmax was 0.22·106 ng/ml, 
2.32·106  ng/ml and 1.49·106 ng/ml, respectively. AUC was 1.60 ·106 ng/ml, 24.0 ·106 ng/ml and 9.5·106 
ng/ml after the first ICV administration of 30 mg dose, 100 mg dose and 300 mg dose, respectively. 
Figure 1.  Mean Single Dose BMN 190 CSF Concentration-Time Profile by Dose 
Mean BMN 190 concentration-time profiles by dose level in CSF following the initial ICV infusion in patients with CLN2. Error bars 
represent the standard deviation. Mean representations of the CSF PK profiles are based on between 2 and 3 samples per time 
point from 3 patients for the 30 mg and 100 mg dose level, and between 14 and 18 samples per time point from 18 patients for 
the 300 mg dose level. BQL values were set to one-half the LLOQ of the bioanalytical assay (10 ng/ml). 
Peak BMN 190 concentrations in the plasma were approximately 1000-fold lower than concentrations in the 
CSF, with no apparent correlation between CSF and plasma exposure within patients following ICV 
administration. 
Multiple dose CSF and plasma PK data suggest no apparent accumulation of BMN 190, or time-dependence in 
BMN 190 PK in CSF or plasma with ICV administration of 300 mg every two weeks. This is line with the 
results of the half-life is about 7 hours in CSF. Based on  results of in vitro studies the lysosomal half-life of 
rhTPP1 was estimated to 11.5 days. Consequently steady state can be expected after 8 weeks. In most cases 
there were no quantifiable trough levels in CSF, indicating that no accumulation occur in this compartment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 24/95 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The distribution volumes are up to ~400 ml and support the assumption that BMN190 is absorbed by CNS 
tissue.  
Elimination 
BMN 190 is a recombinant human protein which is metabolised to endogen components (amino acids), 
therefore neither metabolic or excretion studies nor studies in special populations have been conducted. For 
the same reason, the interaction potential with small chemical molecules is considered negligible and no DDI 
studies have been conducted.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In general, BMN 190 single dose CSF exposure increased less than proportionally with dose across the 30 to 
300 mg dose level following the initial ICV infusion. Comparing the 30 mg to 300 mg dose level, mean CSF 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ increased 6.74-fold and 5.27-fold, respectively, with the 10-fold increase in dose. However 
the results are partially inconclusive as the 100m strength showed higher exposure as the 300 mg. This has 
been attributed to the low number of patients treated with the 100 mg strength (n=3) so that a single outlier 
could affect the result. 
Variability 
The intra individual variability was moderate to high in CSF and very high in plasma. There was no apparent 
effect of patient baseline sex, age, race, bodyweight, BMI or CLN2 score on the PK of BMN 190 in CSF or 
plasma with 300 mg Q2W ICV infusions. 
Immunogenicity 
ADAs were detected in the CSF of 5/24 subjects (21%) and in the serum of 19/24 subjects (79%) treated 
with BMN 190 for 49-107 weeks. The presence of ADA in the CSF and serum did not appear to have an 
impact on the PK of BMN 190 in CSF or plasma, respectively. The magnitude of BMN 190 CSF exposure, 
within the range of exposure obtained with 300 mg Q2W administration, did not correlate with the 
development of ADA in CSF. 
There was no apparent correlation between the magnitude of BMN 190 plasma exposure, within the range 
evaluated with 300 mg Q2W dosing, and magnitude of ADA response or the time to ADA development in the 
serum.  
The validity of the analytical method for the determination of IgE used in the clinical study is questionable. A 
new method has been developed by the applicant which is considered reliable and will be used in the future. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
CLN2 disease is autosomal recessively inherited, characterized by the deficiency of TPP1 that is caused by 
mutations in the CLN2 gene. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in Brineura is a recombinant 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 25/95 
  
  
 
 
 
proenzyme form of human lysosomal serine protease tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) which is intended as an 
enzyme replacement therapy for CNL2 patients with insufficient TPP1 activity.  
Primary pharmacology 
TPP1 cleaves the N-terminal tripeptide from polypeptides imported into the lysosome, without any known 
substrate specificity. The pro-enzyme BMN190 is taken up into the lysosome via the cation independent 
mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) where a 176 amino acid pro-peptide fragment is cleaved in the 
acidic environment, yielding the 368 amino acid active enzyme. 
Response to treatment, as described in the Clinical Efficacy section, does not appear to correlate with BMN 
190 exposure in the CSF, within the range of exposures obtained with 300 mg Q2W ICV administration. 
Up to date no predictive biomarkers have been described. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant presented a much reduced PK program. This was justified in regard to the absolute and relative 
bioavailability as the drug product is an aqueous solution directly administered to the CSF. As the drug 
substance is a protein which is expected to be metabolised to endogenous amino acids the lack of excretion, 
interaction studies and data in special populations is considered acceptable.  
Only one clinical study plus an extension was conducted in a small number of patients and therefore 
pharmacokinetic data are limited. There are several uncertainties due to the small number of patients (e.g.  
CSF PK measurements for 100mg strength was highly affected by one patient receiving this dose), so that 
results are partially inconclusive (e.g. dose proportionality, effect of race). However these are considered 
minor deficiencies given the high medical need and the rarity and severity of the disorder to be treated.  
The data derived from study 201 including the extension allow a basic description of the pharmacokinetic 
profile of BMN 190 but are of limited value. No correlation between the exposure in CSF and clinical response 
could be established and provided data in plasma is incomplete and highly variable. 
The immunogenicity has been investigated and the results so far indicate that ADAs occur but have no 
significant effect on PK. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The limited data derived from study 201 including the extension allow a basic description of the 
pharmacokinetic profile of BMN 190 but are of limited value. No correlation between the exposure in CSF and 
clinical response could be established and provided data in plasma is incomplete and highly variable. 
The immunogenicity has been investigated and the results so far indicate that ADAs occur but have no 
significant effect on PK. A fully validated analytical method for the determination of IgE ADA has been 
established in order to evaluate a possible relationship of severe hypersensitivity reactions with drug-specific 
IgE in the future.

2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
A Phase 1/2 dose escalation study (Study 190-201) and its open label extension (Study 190-202) form the 
basis to support the efficacy of BMN 190 (cerliponase alfa) in the treatment of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 
type 2 (CLN2). 
Additionally, a Natural History non interventional study has been conducted and submitted to provide a 
comparator group. A Phase 2 study (Study 190-203) conducted in siblings of subjects enrolled in the other 
two studies is ongoing as agreed in a Paediatric Investigation Plan. Given the very limited exposure (as of 15 
May 2016 only 3 subjects have been enrolled) no data from this study is included in the efficacy assessment.   
2.7.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study in CLN2 patients has been submitted. All information with respect to starting dose, 
timing of dose as well as infusion volume and rate has been derived from the nonclinical programme.  
Findings from the nonclinical program were originally used to support a clinical dose regimen of 300 mg 
every other week by ICV infusion approximately 4 hours in duration. Chronic administration of 16 mg every 
other week BMN 190 by ~4 hour infusion to juvenile TPP1-null dogs resulted in significant attenuation of the 
disease progression. 
BMN 190 concentrations in the CSF remained above the Kuptake (~3.1 nM or 183 ng/mL) for 48-72 hours 
following ICV infusion in monkeys and dogs, enabling the widespread distribution to most superficial and 
deep brain tissues in both species by likely maintaining a concentration gradient across the CSF tissue 
barrier. The CNS tissue half-life of BMN 190 assumed to be between 3-15 days in monkeys, together with the 
11.5 day lysosomal half-life of BMN 190 characterized previously (Lin, 2001, Biochem.J.), was used to 
support ICV administration once every other week. 
As indicated in section 2.4.6 above, however, a No Observed Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be reliably 
determined after repeated administration in the investigations in juvenile TPP1-null and WT dachshund dogs, 
due to the overall low number of animals, the lack of appropriate controls and the different doses and 
variable number of drug infusions. An interspecies comparison of BMN 190 exposure levels (Cmax and AUC0-t) 
in monkeys, juvenile dachshund dogs and human patients further indicated that no relevant safety margin 
between maximum CSF and plasma exposure of animals with respect to the proposed therapeutic regimen of 
human patients exists. For this reason, the proposed clinical dose is not supported by the inconclusive non-
clinical data. Although the proposed dose may not be optimal for the whole target population, it was found to 
be effective in the main clinical study and is thus acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Main study 
A Phase 1/2 Open-Label Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, 
and Efficacy of Intracerebroventricular BMN 190 in Patients with Late-Infantile Neuronal Ceroid 
Lipofuscinosis (CLN2) Disease 
Methods 
This was a single-arm open label study, designed to assess safety and tolerability of Brineura starting at low 
doses (30 mg and 100 mg). All subjects escalated to the therapeutic dose (300 mg) when the lower doses

were deemed to be safe by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC). The study duration for all 
enrolled subjects was 48 weeks of treatment at the therapeutic dose of 300 mg every other week.

was scheduled to receive any investigational drug other than BMN 190 during the course of the study 
•  Had a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, might 
compromise the subject’s ability to comply with the protocol required testing or procedures or 
compromise the subject’s well-being, safety, or clinical interpretability 
Treatments 
Subject participation involved surgical implantation of the ICV access device (reservoir and cannula) followed 
by no more than 14 days of post-operative recovery prior to any dosing with BMN 190. 
BMN 190 was administered every other week by ICV infusion in the morning after a minimum fast of 2 hours. 
BMN 190 was diluted to 10 mL prior to administration of doses lower than 300 mg. The study drug was 
infused ICV at a rate of 2.5 mL/hour to deliver the entire volume over approximately 4 hours. Subjects were 
pretreated with an age-appropriate dose of antihistamine (and antipyretic, if appropriate) medication ~30 
minutes before infusion. Subjects could be pretreated, at the discretion of the Investigator, with age-
appropriate sedative medication approximately 30 minutes before BMN 190 infusion according to institution’s 
standard practices. 
The planned dose levels were 30, 100, and 300 mg. Subjects 1-10 were assigned to the Dose Escalation 
Period and placed in 1 of 3 dose level cohorts to receive dosing at 30 mg, 100 mg, and/or 300 mg. Subjects 
in the Dose Escalation Period received between 4-22 weeks of treatment at 30 mg, 100 mg, and/or 300 mg, 
prior to the start of the Stable Dose Period. Once the Dose Escalation Period was completed, all subjects 
graduating from the Dose Escalation Period, in addition to 14 new subjects who had not yet received 
treatment, were administered a stable dose of BMN 190 (300 mg, the highest tolerated dose) every other 
week for 48 weeks. At the end of the 48-week treatment period, all subjects were eligible to enrol in the 
ongoing extension study (190-202). 
Medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 
days before informed consent were recorded. At each subsequent visit change in any medication was 
recorded.

Exploratory objectives of this study were to: 
• 
Evaluate impact of treatment on disease-related CSF/plasma biomarkers 
•  Assess age-appropriate developmental milestones 
•  Assess CLN2 disease-specific quality of life (QOL) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the score on the 6-point adapted CLN2 motor-language scale (abbreviated as “ML 
scale” throughout this document) 
Primary efficacy analysis: a responder analysis performed to examine the population of responders during the 
300 mg dosing period on the ML scale  
The following subsets of this scale were also measured for analysis: 
•  9-point adapted CLN2 motor-language-vision scale (MLV scale) 
•  12-point adapted CLN2 motor-language-vision-seizure scale (total CLN2 scale) 
Key secondary endpoint was brain atrophy. Changes in brain structure and anatomy related to disease 
progression were assessed by MRI measuring specific parameters: 
•  Whole brain volume (WBV) (in mm3) 
•  Volume of cerebrospinal fluid (in mm3 and as a percentage of WBV) 
•  Volume of total cortical grey matter (in mm3 and as a percentage of WBV) 
• 
Total white matter volume (in mm3 and as a percentage of WBV) 
•  Whole brain apparent diffusion coefficient (mm2/s) 
Exploratory endpoints were as follows: 
•  CSF/plasma biomarkers 
•  Developmental Milestones (measured by the Denver II Development Scale) 
•  Quality of Life (assessed with the following survey instruments: PedsQL- Parent Report for Toddlers,

Sample size 
The sample size estimate was derived from analysis of a natural history database from Hamburg, Germany 
that includes the longitudinal analysis of 29 genotype-proven CLN2 disease patients. 
The primary endpoint was assumed to be the within-subject estimate of slope reflecting the rate of decline in 
the ML scale over time. Based on a review of subjects from the natural history database referenced above, it 
was assumed that untreated patients would decline a mean of 2.0 points per 48 weeks. The actual slopes for 
rate of change estimates using two different modelling methods were both greater than 2 (2.18 and 2.89 per 
year), but 2.0 per 48 weeks was chosen as a conservative estimate for purposes of comparison for the 190-
201 analysis). 
The primary analysis was assumed to be a one-sample t-test against a fixed point alternative: 
H0: μBMN-190 = 2.0 
H1: μBMN-190 ≠ 2.0 
where μBMN-190 represents the population mean rate of decline with treatment with BMN 190. 
If treatment resulted in a mean rate of decline of 0.5, with a standard deviation of 1.8, then 18 evaluable 
subjects were required to achieve 90% power to reject H0 in favour of H1, assuming a 2-sided test with 
significance level α=0.05. This was increased to 22 subjects to allow for a discontinuation rate of ~20%. 
Randomisation 
This was a single-arm study. Eligible subjects were enrolled sequentially into 3 dosing cohorts (and later into 
a stable dosing period) in this single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Oversight of MRI evaluation was performed by independent radiologists at a 
central imaging facility. The interpreting radiologists and software analysis were blinded to subject and time 
on study.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations: 
ITT Population (n=23): all subjects who received BMN 190 and reported any efficacy results excluding one 
subject who withdrew from the study after a single infusion of study drug during the Dose Escalation Period 
due to inability to continue with study procedures.  
Per Protocol Population: Because the ITT and PP populations were determined to be identical, no separate PP 
analysis was performed. 
Populations for Sensitivity Analyses: 
• 
Efficacy Population (n=21): ITT subjects, but excluding 2 subjects who enrolled with a baseline ML 
scale score of 6 (the maximum score) and who showed no decline in their ML scale score at the end 
of 48 weeks of Stable Dose Period treatment with 300 mg BMN 190. These two subjects were 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 31/95 
  
  
 
excluded because the analysis of the rate of decline presupposes that the subject has, in fact, 
entered the period of clinical decline; subjects who achieve the maximum score on the ML scale and 
do not decline from that score during the study are assumed not to yet be in the period of clinical 
decline. 
Subset of Efficacy population (n=18): includes only subjects with a 300-mg baseline ML scale 
of 3, 4, or 5. 
• 
Enrolled Population (n=24): all subjects who provided informed consent for 190-201 
Subset of enrolled population (n=22): includes the single dose subject (with imputed 4-point 
loss), but excludes the 2 subjects with stable ML scores of 6. 
•  Safety Population (n=24): all subjects who had an ICV access device implanted  
Baselines: 
Two different baselines are defined, depending on the analysis:  
• 
• 
For evaluation of efficacy of the 300 mg dose of BMN 190 with respect to adapted CLN2 scale ratings 
and MRI measurements, baseline is the last observation preceding the first 300 mg infusion. This is 
referred to as “300 mg baseline” and is used for primary efficacy analyses and the majority of 
sensitivity analyses in this report. As a result of this definition, the 48-week treatment period for 
efficacy evaluation can extend beyond 48 weeks for subjects enrolled in the dose escalation cohorts.  
For evaluation of efficacy of BMN 190 at any dose, baseline is the last observation preceding the first 
infusion of BMN 190. This is referred to as “study baseline”. Efficacy results that were analyzed over 
the entire dosing period include full Hamburg and WC CLN2 scores versus analysis day (sensitivity 
analysis), PedsQL Generic Core Scale and Family Impact Module, and the CLN2 disease-based QoL 
instrument.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary analysis was a responder analysis based on the ITT population. Response was defined as the 
absence of an unreversed two-point decline or score of zero in CLN2 score by Week 48 (Study Day 340 
relative to first 300 mg infusion). An unreversed 2-point decline was defined as a decline that had not 
returned to within 1-point of baseline at the time of the final study ML assessment.  
The proportion of subjects responding by Week 48 was tested against a fixed-point alternative using a 1-
sample exact binomial test. The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested were: 
H0: p BMN-190 ≤ 0.5 
H1: p BMN-190 > 0.5 
where p BMN-190 represents the percent responding in the BMN 190-treated population. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the analysis was repeated with response defined as the absence of an 
unreversed one-point decline in CLN2 by Week 48. The percent of subjects responding by this definition 
were tested against a fixed proportion of 0.25 using the exact binomial test. 
The boundary values for hypothesis testing, 0.50 and 0.25, were determined as follows: The mean 
estimated rate of decline within natural history patients was approximately 2 units/48 weeks with 
standard deviation 1. Assuming that the rates of decline are normally distributed, one would expect 50% 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 32/95 
  
  
of untreated patients to have rates of decline less than 2 units, and 16% of untreated patients to have 
rates of decline less than 1 unit. Consequently, the null hypotheses for testing 2- and 1-point responder 
rates (RR), namely H0: RR ≤0.50, and H0: RR ≤0.25, respectively, is reasonable. 
The response criterion, a two-point decline in ML score by Week 48, coincides with the population rate of 
decline for natural history patients (2.0 points per 48 weeks). For subjects with a 300 mg baseline score 
of 1 (n = 1), a responder is defined as a subject who did not progress to a 0 in the treatment period. For 
individual motor and language domains, responders were identified as subjects who did not lose a point 
on that domain at time of last assessment. Responder rates were presented as binomial proportions and 
Kaplan-Meier estimates.  
Another important measure of treatment effect was the rate of decline of the subject’s score on the ML 
scale, reported as a point loss per 48-week 300-mg dosing period. Slopes analysis was a comparison of 
the observed rate of decline to a population rate of decline in untreated natural history patients of 2.0 
points per 48 weeks. The rate of decline was estimated for each treated subject, based on comparing the 
last adapted CLN2 rating scale assessment to the baseline assessment and scaling that change to a 48-
week time period. 
In addition to analysis of the ML scale score, analyses of the rate of decline were also performed for the 
MLV scale and the total CLN2 scale scores.  
Analyses of the change in scale scores from the 300 mg baseline to the last recorded observation were 
conducted on the ML, MLV, and total CLN2 scale scores.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

Results 
Participant flow 
Twenty-four subjects were enrolled. Subjects 1-10 were assigned to three 3-subject cohorts to participate in 
a Dose Escalation Period. Subsequent to completion of the Dose Escalation Period, all subjects (including 
Assessment report

Subjects 11 through 24) were administered a stable dose of BMN 190 (300 mg) every 14 days for 48 weeks. 
A single subject enrolled in Cohort 3 (1287-1007) withdrew consent from the study after ICV access device 
placement and a single infusion because of inability to continue with study procedures. All other subjects (n = 
23) who enrolled in 190-201 remained on treatment through the end of the study.

Recruitment 
First patient randomized: 13 September 2013 
Last patient completed: 30 November 2015 (last dose given) 
Conduct of the study 
Five protocol amendments were issued for this study. None of the changes negatively impacted subject 
safety or integrity of the data collected during the course of the study.   
Based on clinical review of the protocol deviation listing, there have been no important protocol deviations 
that were considered to meaningfully impact the welfare of the subjects or the integrity of the data. 
Additional protocol deviations were observed across all subjects. The most frequent of these deviations were 
attributed to procedures which were not done or which were completed outside of the protocol-specified 
windows. 
A total of 616 infusions were performed during the course of the study. Compliance, as measured by 
(infusions given)/(infusions planned), was 99.8%. Of the 616 infusions started during the study, 16 (in 9 
subjects) were interrupted and 8 (in 6 subjects) were not completed. Compliance, as measured by (infusions 
completed)/(infusions planned), was 98.7%. Most incomplete infusions were due to device-related problems 
(such as leaking or dislodgement of the needle).

Baseline data 
Twenty-four subjects were enrolled at 5 clinic sites: University of Hamburg (Germany), Bambino Gesu 
Children’s Hospital (Italy), Evelina Children’s Hospital (United Kingdom), Great Ormond Street Hospital 
(United Kingdom), and Nationwide Children’s Hospital (United States). 
Overall, the treatment group included 9 (38%) males and 15 (63%) females. The mean (SD) age of the 
subjects at enrolment was 4.3 (1.24) years. Twenty-three subjects (96%) were white and 1 (4%) was Asian. 
Table 2.         Demographic Characteristics (Analysis Population: Enrolled Population) 
Overall, the mean (SD) age of disease onset was 3.4 (1.07) years. One or both of the two most common 
alleles (c.622C>T and c.509-1G>C) were present in 17 subjects (71%), and other mutations were present in 
7 (29%) of subjects. 
The baseline characteristics of the population are presented in the Table below.

Concomitant medications and/or nutritional supplements were taken by 100% of the subjects. All subjects 
were taking anticonvulsants. Subjects could also be taking medications for myoclonus, tremor, agitation, and 
pain.  
Numbers analysed 
24 subjects have signed the informed consent. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included 23 patients as one 
patient withdrew from the study after a single infusion of study drug.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The clinical severity of CLN2 disease has been quantified by two related clinical scales, the Hamburg scale 
(Steinfeld, 2002, Am.J.Med.Genet.); (Worgall, 2008, Hum.Gene Ther.) and the Weill Cornell Scale (WC scale) 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 37/95 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
(Dyke, 2012, AJNR Am.J Neuroradiol.); (Worgall, 2007, Neurology). Both scales are 0-12 point inventories of 
disease-based clinical assessments that measure function in children older than 2 years through the course of 
the disease. Each scale consists of four domains: Hamburg (motor, language, vision, and seizures) and WC 
(gait, language, myoclonus, and feeding). Within each domain of both scales, a score from 0 to 3 represents 
age-appropriate best function (3) to essentially no function (0). Overall scores are calculated by summing the 
4 domain scores for a final rating of 0 (severely impaired) to 12 (normal). The scales use similar gradations 
to measure major clinical domains of gross motor and language. These domains are the hallmarks of 
neurological loss of function, are predictive of disease severity, and are scales on which a potential 
therapeutic benefit may be measured.  
However, the total Hamburg and WC scores have limitations that affect interpretation of disease progression. 
Of the 8 domains for the 2 clinical scales, 4 have therefore been excluded for assessment of the primary 
efficacy analysis: Hamburg ‘seizure’ and ‘vision’ domain, WC ‘feeding’ and ‘myoclonus’ domain. 
The primary metric used to quantify disease progression was the aggregate of the Hamburg ‘motor’ and 
‘language’ domains (the ML scale), which was a 0 to 6-point scale in which each point measured a major 
inflection point in the decline of motor and language function from age-defined normal to minimal or no 
function. 
In order to ensure consistency across sites and throughout the 190-201 study, the CLN2 motor-language 
scale was adapted by the Hamburg investigators to include anchor point definitions that would allow 
consistent ratings within the study conduct. These anchor point definitions were minimal, and they were 
proposed by Hamburg investigators to be consistent with those used in the collection of the clinical 
information used in the natural history analysis. The adapted CLN2 ML scale was intended to respect the 
historical application of the Hamburg scale, and allow consistent and harmonized ratings in a multi-national, 
multi-site clinical efficacy study. Differences between the original Hamburg scale and the adapted CLN2 rating 
scale used in 190-201 are outlined in the table below:

Primary endpoint 
The mean score was 3.5 points at 300 mg baseline and declined by 0.4 points to a score of 3.1 points over a 
48 week stable treatment period with BMN 190 300 mg every 14 days. When compared to the expected rate 
of decline based on natural history (2 points per 48 weeks), the study results are statistically significant (p < 
0.0001).

20 of 23 (87%) patients responded as they did not have a 2-point decline on the ML scale at week 48 of 
treatment. The responder population for the ML score in the 300 mg dosing period significantly exceeded the 
predicted untreated responder rate of 50% (p = 0.0002).

A 'response' is defined as the absence of an unreversed two-point decline in the 0-to-6 point ML score at 48 weeks. 
Inference is by an exact binomial test of the null hypothesis H 0: Prob (response) <= 0.50 vs. the alternative hypothesis H 1: Prob 
(response) > 0.50, where Prob (response) denotes the population probability of a response. The confidence interval is an exact 
interval. 
Responder rates for the separate motor and language domain scores for the ITT population during the 300 
mg dosing period showed that eighteen subjects (78%) and 16 subjects (70%) met the definition of a 
responder on the language and motor domains, respectively. 
Fifteen (65%) of the 23 treated patients had no unreversed single point loss. These patients were stable or 
improved over the full duration of 300 mg treatment as measured by the ML scale. As the responder rate for 
the untreated population that has an unreversed single point drop is assumed to be 25%, the estimated 
treated responder rate of 65% significantly exceeds the expected untreated responder rate of 25% (p < 
0.0001). The 8 non-responders include 3 patients with an unreversed 2-point decline and 5 patients with an 
unreserved 1-point decline.  
Table 7.  Responder Analysis: Proportion of Subjects without an Unreversed 1-point Decline in ML Scale 
Score at 48 Weeks (ITT Population, 300 mg Dosing Period) 
All 8 subjects who experienced an unreversed point drop did so during the first 16 weeks on study; after that 
time point, only 3 of the 8 subjects experienced a second unreversed point decline. The remaining 5 subjects 
stabilized after losing a first point on the ML scale.

The Kaplan-Meier analysis performed on the total dosing period from study baseline for the ITT population 
and for the primary efficacy population showed similar results.

Note: An unreversed decline is any decline that had not reverted to the baseline value (or better) as of the last recorded 
observation. Analysis Day 1 is the date of the first 300 mg infusion.

Analysis of 9-point adapted CLN2 motor-language-vision scale (MLV scale) has shown that no benefit was 
received in the vision domain during the 48 week period.  
Secondary endpoints 
The results observed in Magnetic Resonance Imaging are as follows:   
•  Over 48 weeks of 300 mg dosing, there were some changes across the population in the proportion 
of whole brain volume (WBV) occupied by CSF and by cortical grey matter: the percent total volume 
occupied by CSF increased by 2.1%, while a mean decline of 2.2% (1.89) was shown in the 
proportion of WBV occupied by cortical grey volume.  
•  Whole brain volume (WBV) decreased by 4.4% 
•  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased by 3.6% 
•  A loss in volume was shown for the cortical grey matter (9.7%)  
•  A loss in volume was shown for the white matter (4.2%)  
Overall, when these results were compared to the clinical response, MRI results did not change in the same 
direction over the 48 weeks of 300 mg stable treatment.

Scatter plots compared the change from 300 mg baseline ML scale score at week 49 with MRI changes at 
Week 49. Overall, the provided analysis did not show a very obvious correlation between ML score and total 
cortical grey matter volume (r = 0.20), total white matter absolute volume (r = 0.27), total white matter 
percentage (r = -0.17), or whole brain ADC (r = 0.12). There was a modest correlation between ML score 
and absolute CSF fluid volume (r = 0.61), percent total cortical grey matter (r = -0.48) and whole brain 
volume (r=0.52).

Supportive studies 
Long-term extension Study 202 
Study 190-202 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label, multi-centre, extension study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of BMN 190 treatment in subjects with CLN2 who completed study 190-201. All subjects who enrolled 
in study 202 continued dosing at 300 mg every other week for up to 240 additional weeks. The analyses for 
the provided interim report include data up to 03 June 2016. All patients were treated with the 300 mg dose 
for a minimum of 72 weeks, thus complete data were available up to 72 weeks. Thereafter, the maximum 
time of exposure until the new data cut-off ended individually.

Efficacy measurement tools used in study 202 are similar to those from study 201. CLN2 rating scale 
assessments were performed every 8 weeks (videotaping every 24 weeks). MRI assessments were also 
performed every 24 weeks. The Denver II instrument and QoL tests were done every 24 weeks; in addition 
to the PedsQL and CLN2-specific QoL instruments used in study 201, subjects in study 202 were also 
assessed by the EQ-5D-5L QoL test. In addition, adapted motor-language CLN2 score and MRI correlation 
analyses (week 49 change from baseline) have been performed. 
Primary endpoint 
Overall, there was no change in the responder rates with regard to the primary analysis defined (i.e. the 
proportion of subjects without a 2-point decline in ML scale score, 1-point decline in motor domain score or 
1-point decline in language domain score).  
As of the data cut-off date, the responder population for the ML score in the 300 mg dosing period 
significantly exceeded the predicted untreated responder rate of 50% for an unreversed 2-point decline (p = 
0.0002) with 87% responders and 13% non-responders. 
Responder rates for the individual motor and language domains were comparable to those seen in study 201, 
with 65% responders on motor and 70% responders on language. 
A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the ITT population to examine the timing at which subjects had 
unreversed declines of 2 points or ML score of 0 (unresponsive to treatment). The graph was flat beyond 
Study Week 48, indicating that there were no additional unreversed 2-point declines or score of 0 after Week 
48. 
Eight subjects had unreversed 1-point declines in CLN2 score within 120 days of first 300 mg dose. After 120 
days, the curve remained flat over the first year and then 3 additional subjects had unreversed 1-point 
declines in CLN2 score after the first year of therapy. Three of the 8 subjects with 1-point unreversed decline 
within the first 120 days experienced a second unreversed point decline. 
The slopes analysis of the ITT population (n = 23) ML endpoint showed that treatment with BMN 190 300 mg 
every other week for over 1 year demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the mean rate of 
decline on the ML scale when compared with a population rate of decline in untreated subjects of 2.0 points 
per 48 weeks (p < 0.0001). The mean rate of decline was 0.32 points per 48 weeks. These preliminary 
results are better than the mean rate of decline seen in study 201 (0.40 points/48 weeks). 
This result was supported by multiple sensitivity analyses (all p<.0001).  
Secondary endpoints 
MRI measurements from baseline till Last recorded observation prior to the 03 June 2016 data cut off were as 
follows:  
• 
The percent total volume occupied by CSF increased by 3.2%, while a mean decline of 3.2% was 
shown in the proportion of WBV occupied by cortical grey volume over the 300 mg treatment period.  
•  Whole brain volume (WBV) decreased by 3.7% 
•  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Mean absolute increase of 8.6% 
•  A loss in volume was shown for the cortical grey matter (11.4%)  
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 45/95 
  
  
 
•  A loss in volume was shown for the white matter (3.8%)  
Results at 72 weeks positively compare to those estimated by Lobel et al (2016) from a group of 13 patients 
from a prospective natural disease cohort of patients. Whereas no differences were seen during the first year 
of treatment, data suggest a slower loss of cortical grey matter at Week 72. This means that anatomical 
changes may be noticeable only after 18 months of treatment.  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
The Quality of Life outcomes were as follows:  
PedsQL Parent Report for Toddlers: All subjects had reached Week 25 in Study 202; 21 subjects (91.3%) 
with a PedsQL score at Week 25 showed a mean (SD) change of -1.7(13.69) points from study baseline to 
Week 25. Only 12 subjects (52.2%) had a PedsQL score assessed at Week 49 in Study 190-202; these12 
subjects showed a mean (SD) change of -14.1 (13.08) points from study baseline to Week 49. 
PedsQL Family Impact Module: 22 subjects (95.6%) with a PedsQL score at Week 25 in Study 202 showed a 
mean (SD) increase of 4.1 (19.52) points from study baseline to Week 25. Only 12 subjects (52.2%) had a 
PedsQL score assessed at Week 49 in Study202; these 12 subjects showed a mean (SD) change of -1.3 
(18.09) points from study baseline to Week 49. 
CLN2 Disease-based QoL Instrument: 21 subjects (91.3%) with a CLN2 Disease-based QoL score at Week 25 
in Study 202 showed a mean (SD) increase of 6.5 (14.75) points from study baseline to Week 25. Twelve 
subjects (52.2%) with a PedsQL score at Week 49 in Study 202 showed a mean (SD) change of 1.9 (15.15) 
points from study baseline to Week 49. 
As of the 03 June 2016 data cut, only a subgroup of 12 subjects (52%) had a Denver II test when they 
reached the Week 49 time point in Study 202. All 12 subjects had no change in classification from study 201 
assessments (baseline and end of study). 
Natural History Studies 
Study 190-901: 
The original 190-901 natural history analysis included 78 patients from cohorts in Hamburg, Germany (n=29) 
and at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) in New York, USA (n=49) and was started prior to the initiation 
of the 190-201 treatment study.   
The intention of the natural history analyses was to examine disease onset, symptoms and rate of 
progression in the context of genotype and imaging biomarkers. Both cohorts had been administered reliable 
clinical scales to quantify disease severity. 
Hamburg cohort 
Hamburg cohort included patients with longitudinal assessment of clinical severity using the HML scale. The 
clinical course prior to diagnosis was constructed retrospectively from family interviews and integrated with 
prospectively gathered data from the time of diagnosis from clinical rater assessments. This dataset was 
evaluated to determine rate of progression, age of onset, and first clinical symptom.

The mean rate of decline was 2.18 units per year and the middle 50% of the distribution had rates of 
progression ranging from only -1.5 to -2.7 units per year. 
Analyses confirm that the large majority of patients decline rapidly in a predictable manner in terms of age of 
onset and rate of decline. This population has only a few outliers for each parameter. Based on these 
findings, an estimate of a 2.0-point loss per 48 weeks was used as the basis for comparison for treated 
patients in the ML scale analysis for study 201. 
WCMC cohort 
WCMC cohort originated from screening data for two clinical trials (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and included 49 
CLN2-confirmed patients with clinical and MRI data. The cohort was cross-sectional; all patients had just one 
or two clinical ratings in a relatively short time frame, and therefore did not contribute to the longitudinal 
analysis. For patients with two clinical ratings, the analysis used the first assessment by convention. The 
WCMC rating scale quantified clinical severity and was used in correlations with patient age and with MRI 
findings. 
The Weill Cornell group collected a number of MRI parameters that were compared to clinical severity and 
patient age. For each of the parameters, e.g. intracranial cerebrospinal fluid, subcortical white matter and N-
Acetyl Aspartate, a good correlation between worsening MRI/MRS findings and increased clinical severity (as 
measured by the WCMC gait-language scale) was noted (r2 values ranged from 0.49 to 0.65). Similar results 
were obtained when these measurements were compared to patient age and to the total WCMC scores.  
A composite MRI score, including contributions from all of the parameters listed above (percent CSF, MRS 
and normalized NAA concentrations), showed a strong relationship (r2=0.71) to clinical severity. However, 
this has to be interpreted carefully, given the fact that the MRI composite was developed on the same data 
set and external validation would be needed for robust conclusions on the correlation. 
Study 190-901 supplement 
A new collaborative database (DEM-CHILD) has been formed from a consortium of investigators of expert 
clinical sites organized by a charter intended to collect and analyse clinical, genetic, and biomarker data in 
patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) diseases (including CLN2). This new database has 
expanded the number of patients that was available at the time of the original 190-901 report.  
The DEM-CHILD database included 74 CLN2 patients, 63 evaluated at Hamburg and 11 from Verona. Of the 
74 patients available in the DEM-CHILD database as of February 2015, 41 were ultimately included in the 
evaluable population for the 901 supplemental analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 47/95 
  
  
 
 
 
In order to be included in the untreated comparison group, patients needed to have HML scale score ratings 
at least 6 months apart. Furthermore, to match the study inclusion criteria to the population, the patients 
must have had at least two HML scale ratings at age ≥ 36 months and have at least one rating score of 3 or 
better. The eligibility criteria as presented excluded 30 patients from the Hamburg cohort and 3 patients from 
the Verona cohort. Of the 33 excluded patients, 32 were excluded for failing one or more of the HML scale 
score filters (the remaining excluded patient was an identical twin of a patient also in the DEM-CHILD 
database). Patients from the Verona site were assessed by the HML scale. 
The original 901 analysis report included 29 patients from the Hamburg site. 26 of the original 29 Hamburg 
patients were included in the evaluable population for the 901 supplemental report. The 3 excluded patients 
from the original 901 analyses did not meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the evaluable population: 2 
patients did not have an otherwise evaluable post-baseline HML scale assessment that was at least 6 months 
after the baseline assessment; and 1 Patient had no otherwise evaluable HML scale assessments ≥ 3. 
Thus, of the 41 patients in the evaluable population, 26 were included in the original 901 analysis and 15 (7 
from the Hamburg site and 8 from the Verona site) are new patients that contribute to this supplemental 
analysis.

Updated 190-901 supplemental report 
The updated data included additional 8 evaluable subjects for Study 901 (n=49), based on an updated data 
transfer from the DEM-CHILD collaborative natural history database as of 11 August 2016. 
Since the previous data transfer summarized in the 901 supplement report (March 2015), the total CLN2 
patient population has decreased from 74 to 69. This change is based on the removal of 9 patients previously 
in the Hamburg database and the addition of 4 patients new to the database. Of the 9 patients removed, only 
1 was in the evaluable population (the patient was removed after withdrawing consent to be included).

Evaluable Population 
Table 11.  Patient Evaluability (DEM-CHILD Population) 
The total evaluable patients increased from 41 to 49 based on the removal of one previously evaluable 
patient who withdrew informed consent, the addition of 3 new, evaluable patients and the conversion of 6 
patients previously unevaluable to evaluable based on the availability of additional data.  
Results (Disease progression) 
Table 12.  Rate of Decline of the HML Scale Score (Evaluable Population) 
Compared to the previous natural history dataset (n=41 evaluable population), the mean (SD) rate has 
changed from 2.09 (0.966) points/48 weeks to 2.02(0.971) points/48 weeks.  Removing the patient who 
withdrew consent, the rate of decline of the remaining patients from the Study 901 supplement population 
(n=40) is 2.11 (0.970) points/48 weeks. 
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the most current natural history dataset, generated after the 
addition of more contemporaneous data, comprises a similar patient cohort with similar clinical characteristics 
compared to the natural history dataset described in the original 901 report.

Analysis performed across trials  
Integrated summary of effectiveness (ISE): 
To evaluate the effectiveness of BMN 190 300 mg every other week, outcomes of treated subjects in studies 
190-201/202 were compared with the outcomes of the untreated patients in the evaluable population of the 
study 901 supplemental report.  
Study 201/202: 23 patients of 24 patients who completed study 201 and continued into study 202. The one 
subject who discontinued did so after a single dose. There were no drop outs or discontinued subjects due to 
safety reasons or lack of efficacy. 
901 supplement: the total population of possible natural history subjects (n=74) was reduced to an evaluable 
population (n=41) by removing patients in whom the rate of decline could not be robustly estimated.  
Primary Analysis: HML/ML score is the primary endpoint and the primary analysis is a responder analysis 
based on the 1-1 matching using Method #1. Response was defined as a rate of decline < 2 points per 48 
weeks. The rate of decline is estimated as the change in HML/ML score from baseline assessed at the last 
visit and scaled to a 48 week period.  
22/23 subjects in the 190-201/202 ITT population were matched; one subject could not be matched because 
the subject’s closest match had an age difference of 21 months. That subject has been omitted from these 
analyses; thus, the ITT population for these 1:1 matching analyses has an n=22. 
Sensitivity analyses relating to the primary analysis: As the primary analysis is a single 1-1 matching analysis 
using Method #1, and as there may be other potential matchings that achieve similar quality of matching, a 
supportive simulation was performed. 1000 simulated matchings were performed using a simpler variation of 
matching Method #1. The responder analysis was repeated for each of the 1000 simulated matchings and 
described by summary statistics for the realized treatment effects and p-values. 
For sensitivity analyses subjects with a baseline value of 6 that does not decline during the course of the 
study and subjects with a baseline HML value <3 (that was ≥3 at screening) were excluded. 
1:1 Matching: 
The primary responder analysis showed a relevant and statistically significantly higher proportion of 
responders with a decrease in the rate of disease progression (rate < 2/48 weeks) under active treatment 
(91%) as measured by the ML scale compared to untreated patients (historical data) (45%).

The mean of the estimated difference in response rates over 1000 matchings in a simulation study was 
41.7% with test of statistical significance ranging (1-sided) from p < 0.0001 - 0.033. Further, all 1000/1000 
matchings showed at least a 90.0% response rate in the treated subjects, while the maximum response rate 
(out of 1000 matchings) for the untreated patients was only 61.9%. 
Sensitivity analyses support the findings from the primary analysis of a statistically significant difference in 
response between treated subjects and natural history patients (p=0.0031 to 0.0074).

Population, 901 Evaluable Population, 300 mg Dosing Period) 
190-901 baseline was calculated using the set of contiguous visits with an ML scale score equal to the earliest ML scale score (< 6); 
190-901 baseline was defined as the midpoint between the first and last of these contiguous visits. 
Source: ISE Figure 3.2.7 
Regardless of the baseline ML scale starting point in unmatched 901 population, all patients declined at a fast 
rate with very similar trajectories (in comparison to the treated 190-201/202 subjects who show few 
unreversed 2-point declines). This leads to the conclusion that the relative efficacy under treatment is 
independent from baseline ML scale at start of the treatment. 
The estimated mean (SD) rate of decline in the ML/HML scale score (in points/48 weeks) was 2.06 (1.379) 
for the 901 supplement patients and 0.53 (0.737) for the 190-201/202 subjects, a difference of 1.53 
points/48 weeks (p<.0001). There was no overlap for the 95% CI for the estimated rate of decline for the 
190-201/202 (0.20, 0.86) and 901 supplement (1.45, 2.68) patients. 
Sensitivity analyses support the findings from slopes analysis on the ITT 1:1 matched population. 
The rate of decline on the individual domains showed a treatment difference in favour of the 190-201/202 
treated subjects. The mean treatment difference for the motor domain was 0.72 (0.240) points/48 weeks 
(p=0.0055) and the mean treatment difference for the language domain was 1.01 (0.200) points/48 weeks 
(p<.0001).

Integrated Efficacy Analyses Addendum: 
Following DEM-CHILD registry update, two different natural history evaluable populations were examined: 
• 
• 
The n=49 population described above 
The n=42 population, which excludes 7 subjects from the n=49 population who later entered a BMN 
190 study for treatment. 
The focus of the integrated efficacy analysis is on the n=42 history population; however, the n=49 data 
results were also provided. A comparison of the results of matching using each of the two different 
populations revealed no substantial differences for the various matching analyses. 
As in study 201/202, the primary integrated efficacy analysis is a responder analysis, here based on the ITT 
population for 190-201/202 and the updated natural history population, using a 1:1 matching method based 
on age as closely as possible (but no more than 12 months apart) and baseline ML scale scores (for 190-
201/202subjects)/HML scale scores (for natural history patients). The method is designed to allocate, to a 
maximal number of 190-201/202 subjects, a unique DEM-CHILD patient (no sharing). Using this method, 
21/23 subjects in the 201/202 ITT population were matched; two subjects could not be matched to a natural 
history comparator as for the ISE update, matching based on stricter age definition for 12 patients .

in the treated subjects when compared with the natural history patients over a course of time approximating 
the 300 mg treatment time in 201/202. No subjects in 201/202 have experienced an additional unreversed

2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No specific dose finding studies were performed. Dose selection was based on results from nonclinical 
studies, which were originally used to support the dose of 300 mg to be tested in the clinical study. Two 
additional doses of 30 mg and 100 mg were administered only for safety (tolerability) purposes.  
Study 190-201 is considered pivotal in this clinical programme. This study was extended in 190-202 with a 
very similar design and study objectives. In addition, a natural history study 190-901 (with a supplement) 
was performed to facilitate comparisons of untreated patients with treated patients in study 201.  
Study 190-201 
Study 201 was a single-arm, open-label study which cannot generate evidence at the usually expected level 
with regard to potential bias and a confirmatory approach with control of type I error for the primary 
analysis. This is acceptable considering CLN2 is a very rare disease, with fast and debilitating progression 
leading to death and no available treatment options. Therefore, the important evidence of efficacy comes 
from comparisons with untreated natural history patients performed for the Integrated Summary of 
Effectiveness (ISE). 
Included CLN2 patients were aged 3-15 years. Most of patients (79%) had symptom onset below 5 years (7 
patients below 3 years, 12 patients 3-5 years of age). Mean age at enrolment was 4.3 years. Of note, at 
recruitment one of the patients was 8 years old and three other patients were aged 6 years. The age of 
disease onset (symptoms) was over age 5 years in these four cases. It is described in the literature that, by 
the age of 6 years, the affected children are usually unable to walk and sit unsupported (Worgall 2007). 
Several clinical variants of LINCL have been reported. In some of them, the symptoms are similar to those of 
the classical type but tend to occur somewhat later. Their overall course may be more protracted. One 
additional patient was enrolled during the pre-symptomatic phase of his condition.  
Although a few patients (n = 4) with a rather late onset of the disease and a potentially protracted disease 
course may have been included in the study, the one-to-one matching in the comparative analysis reduces 
potential bias and the sensitivity analyses suggest that the results are robust. 
Three patients, two with a baseline ML score of 3 and one with a baseline ML score of 6 were detected of 
which all three patients had no change in the ML score at week 72 compared to baseline. As these three 
patients only comprise 12.5 percent out of 24 patients, they have a limited impact on the overall positive 
results.  
According to the selection criteria, mild to moderate patients were to be recruited (ML Scale Score from 3 to 
6). Two patients entered the study with a baseline ML score of 6, which in principle corresponds to normal 
function. Disease was detected early because both had affected siblings. However, exclusion of these patients 
in a sensitivity analysis did not affect the study results. 
The evaluation of efficacy mainly relies on the effect on two main clinical features of the disease (motor 
function and language). The main variable of the study was expressed as a responder rate (the proportion of 
patients without an unreversed two-point decline or score of zero in Motor/Language scale by Week 48). This 
was an ad-hoc developed scale based on two already existing clinical rating scores: the Hamburg Late 
Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Scale (4 functional domains: motor function, seizure activity, 
language skills and vision) and the Weill Cornell Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Scale (4 
functional domains: swallowing dysfunction, gait, motor and language abnormalities). The selected Adapted 
Assessment report

CLN2 disease rating scale included the motor (gait in the WCMC Scale) and language scales, present in both 
primary scales. The experts consulted by the CHMP considered the scale acceptable and stated that the mean 
decline of 2 points per year is the expected deterioration rate in CLN2 disease.  
Study 190-202 
Study 190-202 is the extension study for 190-201. Subjects who completed 48 weeks of dosing in the Stable 
Dose Period of 190-201 are eligible to enrol in 190-202. All subjects who enrolled in 190-202 continued 
dosing at 300 mg every other week for up to 240 additional weeks. Objectives of the study as well as efficacy 
outcome measures were very similar to those of the pivotal study 201 and considered adequate to evaluate 
the long-term treatment effect.  
Until June 2016 the mean exposure at any dose over the total studies 201/202 dosing period was 96.4 
weeks. Subjects were treated at the 300 mg dose for a minimum of 72 weeks and a maximum of 124.4 
weeks.  
Natural History Studies 
Study 190-901 
Study 901 included 2 cohorts that had been administered reliable clinical scales to quantify disease 
severity: Hamburg cohort: included 30 CLN2 genotype-confirmed patients with longitudinal assessment of 
clinical severity using the HML scale. The clinical course prior to diagnosis was constructed retrospectively 
from family interviews and integrated with prospectively gathered data from the time of diagnosis from 
clinical rater assessments. This dataset was evaluated to determine rate of progression, age of onset, and 
first clinical symptom. 
WCMC cohort (originated from screening data for two clinical trials (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2): 
49 CLN2-confirmed patients with clinical and MRI data. The cohort was cross-sectional; all patients had just 
one or two clinical ratings in a relatively short time frame, and therefore did not contribute to the longitudinal 
analysis. For patients with two clinical ratings, the analysis used the first assessment by convention. The 
WCMC rating scale quantified clinical severity and was used in correlations with patient age and with MRI 
findings. 
Overall, the clinical course determined by the analysis of the Hamburg cohort confirms published information.  
Study 190-901 supplement 
Study 901 supplement included 2 Study Sites: University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, 
Germany) and Universita degli Studi di Verona (Verona, Italy). A total of 7 patients took part in both, the 
natural history study and study 201/202. 
The updated data included additional 8 evaluable subjects for Study 901 (n=49), based on a data transfer 
from the DEM-CHILD collaborative natural history database. Unfortunately, recently included patients had no 
longitudinal MRI analyses that could be compared to the data derived from study 201.  
For purpose of the ISE analyses, two different natural history evaluable populations were examined: 
• 
The n=49 population described above 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 58/95 
  
  
 
 
• 
The n=42 population, which excludes 7 subjects from the n=49 population who later entered a BMN 
190 study for treatment. 
It is considered acceptable that the new integrated efficacy analyses focuses on analyses including 42 
patients of the natural history population, excluding 7 patients from the natural history cohort later treated in 
study 201/202. Excluding these patients is a logical step, as the resulting analyses are pure between-groups 
comparisons, avoiding a component of intra-individual comparisons and using individual patient data twice. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The applicant demonstrated statistically significant (p = 0.0002) and clinically relevant effects for the primary 
outcome measure of the pivotal study. 20 of 23 (87%) patients responded as they did not have a 2-point 
decline on the adapted motor-language scale (ML scale) at week 48 of treatment. This responder population 
for the ML score in the 300 mg dosing period significantly exceeded the predicted untreated responder rate of 
50% and therefore strongly favour treatment in comparison to no treatment based on the untreated decline 
of natural history CLN2 children. Several sensitivity and supportive analyses confirmed these results.  
The rate of decline was 0.40 points/48 weeks (95% CI Limit 0.05, 0.75). After 1 year (48 weeks) 15 of 23 
patients treated experienced a stabilisation (no change) and in two cases improvement of the studied 
functions. 
The Kaplan Meier analysis showed that 8 of 23 patients experienced a decline of at least one point during the 
48 weeks dosing period. This deterioration took place in the first part of the study followed by an apparent 
stabilisation until the end of the observation period.  
Although vision deterioration is a relevant component of the disease no specific examination (OCT, electro 
retinogram, visual evoked responses) was conducted. This was justified by the Applicant by the fact that the 
ICV administration does not allow reaching therapeutic drug concentrations to eye (retina) tissues. This is in 
line with the findings in the animal models. Since very low systemic exposure to BMN 190 has been detected 
after each administration, an effect cannot be totally excluded. When the vision function was recorded as part 
of the Hamburg LINCL Scale some effect was observed: -0.7 points of difference in the 9-point 
Motor/Language/Vision Scale compared to -0.4 points in the 6-point Motor/Languaje Scale). A close 
correlation between ophthalmic manifestations of CLN2 disease with the degree of neurological function and 
the age of the patient has been described in literature (Orlin, 2013). Ophthalmological evaluations have been 
suggested as an objective marker of disease severity and disease progression. A positive trend in an 
ophthalmic functional endpoint (e.g. OCT) would have given additional plausibility to the changes detected in 
the clinical evaluation; however, it is not clear whether drug concentrations in the retina are high enough to 
elicit a beneficial effect. Study 203 (currently ongoing as a PIP measure) will include ophthalmic evaluation, 
including optical coherence tomography. 
MRI parameters can support the clinical efficacy outcome, especially if those patients showing better 
apparent clinical response are also those showing better MRI results. However, changes in brain volume 
parameters and clinical response were not observed consistently in the same direction over the 48 weeks of 
300 mg stable treatment. It has been suggested that this discrepancy in relation to data derived from natural 
history data (which suggest a good correlation between clinical disease severity and several MRI outcome 
parameters) may be potentially explained by not yet understood re-modelling effects of the treatment (e.g. 
debulking of lysosomal storage material in the early phase of treatment). However, for successfully treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 59/95 
  
  
 
patients, overall changes from baseline to endpoint are expected to be smaller than in untreated patients, as 
shown in the natural history analyses where all of the patients were untreated and declined rapidly.  
Brain volume measurements in treated patients showed a progressive decline of brain volumes in both grey 
and white matter, and an increase of ventricular volumes. Changes of -5.3% at 24 weeks, -9.7% at 48 
weeks, and -10.6% at 72 weeks in cortical grey matter have been estimated. However, whereas a clear 
reduction in cortical grey matter was observed during the first year of treatment the loss of cortical grey 
matter appeared to slow down at Week 72. This means that anatomical stabilisation under treatment may 
only become obvious beyond 12 months of treatment. Overall, the assessment of the anatomical parameters 
(MRI brain volumes) suggest a reduction of the rate of volume loss in treated vs. untreated patients and 
therefore further support the benefit (stabilisation) observed in motor and language function compared to 
untreated controls (Lobel, 2016).  
Conclusions on quality of life parameter assessments are difficult on the basis of small changes and lack of an 
untreated comparator arm. Overall, the results can be interpreted as stabilisation of QoL. However, as also 
pointed out by the ad hoc expert group meeting, QoL results were not surprising: as the treatment appears 
to largely halt disease progression but is not curative, it is not expected that QoL measurements will 
considerably improve compared to baseline. The consulted experts considered this stabilisation as benefit 
compared to the considerable QoL deterioration regularly experienced with disease progression.  
The results of extension study 202 show for the majority of treated subjects overall stability of ML scores, 
indicating continued durability of treatment effect. The decline rate estimates showed lower values compared 
to the earlier interim results, indicating a further slowing of the disease. 
The supplementary information provided by the DEM-CHILD database was consistent with those reported by 
Hamburg/WCMC cohorts. A total of 41 out of 74 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 15 new patients in 
the cohort in comparison with the original one. The estimated rate of decline was 2.09 points per 48 weeks 
although differences were detected between participating centres: Verona (rate of 1.54 points/48 wk) and 
Hamburg (rate of 2.23 points/48 wk). These differences have been justified by the low number of patients 
(n=8) and the relative paucity of data available from the Verona site.  
Comparisons of untreated patients (901 supplement) with treated patients from study 201 in the initial ISE 
showed a clinically relevant and statistically significantly higher proportion of responders with a decrease in 
the rate of disease progression (rate < 2/48 weeks) under active treatment (91%) as measured by the ML 
scale compared to untreated patients (historical data) (45%) (primary responder analysis). Additionally, a 
high number of sensitivity and supportive analyses showed that the effect was not dependent on the analysis 
method. 
The focus of the updated integrated efficacy analysis was on the n=42 history population; however, the n=49 
data results were also provided. A review comparing the results of matching using each of the two different 
populations revealed no substantial differences for the various matching analyses. 
With regards to responder analysis, the estimated response rate for the 201/202 ITT population was 100%. 
The estimated response rate for the matched DEM-CHILD population was 43% (9/21). The estimated 
difference in response rates was 57% (p<0.0001). Analyses of the estimated rate of disease progression, 
analyses of time to unreversed declines, and simple analyses of change from baseline all yield similar results 
confirming the improvement in disease progression seen in the treated population versus untreated patients.  
Subjects of less than 3 years of age were not included in 201/202 study since certain degree of deterioration 
was required at entry in order to demonstrate a detectable change. This was deemed acceptable in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017

context of the clinical study, especially as the diagnosis is usually made in the symptomatic phase of the 
disease. However, it can be expected that patients diagnosed at presymptomatic stage (e.g. when there is 
already a known, affected family member) and those with an earlier onset of the disease may require 
treatment when they are younger than 3 years. In these cases and given the nature of the product (aimed to 
restore the enzymatic defect) the treatment would be expected to have better outcome (as work in animal 
model suggests). The proposed dose in these patients is based on brain mass and was found to be 
sufficiently justified. Therefore, the CHMP has agreed to grant Brineura an unrestricted indication. Further 
data on efficacy, PK and dose selection for the 0-3 population will be collected post-approval.  
Additional expert consultation 
The discussions from the convened Ad-hoc Experts meeting are summarised below.  
1. In the experts' experience, is the natural history of CLN2 disease as homogeneous as it has 
been described in the Natural History Study 190-901? 
Based on the experts’ experience and data from the parents’ association database, the CLN2 disease is fairly 
homogeneous. The usual age of onset and progression rates are comparable to those described in the Natural 
History Study.  
2. The Applicant has presented an adapted CLN2 rating scale (covering language and motor 
functions) as a valid reference to assess the clinical effect of Brineura. In the experts' view, are 
these two functions relevant enough in the clinical picture of the disease to serve as the primary 
endpoint for efficacy? 
Majority of the experts were of the opinion that the adapted ML scale is appropriate as a primary endpoint 
and can be used to assess the course of the disease. Omitting vision and seizures as criteria prevented a 
complete description of the clinical situation. However, since treatment effects on vision were not expected 
and there is no evidence for it, and since effects on seizure were beneficial (if any) the data set was 
considered suitable to measure treatment effects.   
Some of the scores were defined differently in active and historical control group but as the changes were 
only minor no significant impact was expected on the overall results.  
The patients’ representatives emphasized that the motor and language aspects that were assessed are the 
most important ones in the daily life of the children and their families. 
Some of the experts thought that the scale is not appropriate as it does not cover cognition and 
developmental aspects. Nevertheless, the scale results seem adequate to capture changes in relation to 
disease regression (decline from maximum stage of development) but not on progression to new milestones; 
prior to the trial the company assumed that it won’t be possible to observe any development improvement . 
It was also noted that in several of the children it is not possible to assess cognition at the time of diagnosis.  
The experts also stated that although the short term effect is clear, there is a need to generate long term 
data post-approval with appropriate endpoints.

3. If the adapted scale is considered acceptable by the experts, is a mean decline of 2-points per 
year the expected deterioration rate in CLN2 disease?  What range of decline might be expected in 
this population? 
The experts who found the scale acceptable thought that the mean decline of 2 points per year is the 
expected deterioration rate in CLN2 disease.   
It was noted that, on rare occasions, some children can be stable for a few months without any intervention. 
However, the duration of stabilisation is never as long as the stabilization effect observed in the clinical trial 
in some children.  
4. In the experts' view, can the reduction in rate of decline observed in study 190-201 vs. the 
natural history study 190-901 (estimated difference (with 1:1 matching) of 1.56 points/48 
weeks) be considered clinically relevant in the whole clinical picture of the disease? 
The experts concluded that the observed effect size is clinically relevant.  
5. How is the (lack of) effect on MRI parameters or QoL scales interpreted by the experts? 
The experts believed that the value of the MRI measurements is not as high as the clinical outcomes 
observed in the trials.  
The experts also stated that although there was no improvement in MRI measurements as compared to the 
individual baseline, stabilisation was still observed. Moreover, the usual rate of cortical grey matter loss was 
significantly greater in the untreated cohort (as measured at the Hamburg site).  
One of the experts also noted that PET scan would have been preferable as imaging technique as it allows 
assessing brain metabolism. 
With regards to Quality of Life outcomes, the results were not seen as surprising. The CLN2 diagnosis is a 
major challenge for a family and the participation in a trial was expected to bring additional burden e.g. 
necessity to move to a different country. As the treatment is not curative and stabilises the clinical situation, 
it is not expected that the drug effect will bring significant improvements compared to the baseline QoL 
measurements. However, if the progression of disease is halted, the QoL is likely to be better in comparison 
to untreated control group. 
The experts discussed the potential stopping criteria in the case of apparently ineffective treatment and 
possible QoL consequences in cases when stabilisation was achieved in a patient with a low score. It was 
acknowledged that any decision to continue or discontinue treatment would have to be made on an individual 
case by case basis by the affected family supported by their physicians.  
6. In the experts’ view, what are the biological, pharmacological and clinical considerations for 
drawing inferences from these trial results to children younger than 3 years of age? 
The experts were unanimous in their opinion that presymptomatic young children with confirmed genetic 
diagnosis (e.g. siblings of index cases) should be eligible for treatment.  It is assumed that earlier treatment 
initiation will limit the development of the disease.  This preference was confirmed by patients’ 
representatives.

With regards to posology, the experts discussed possible dose adjustments. The dose used in clinical trial for 
patients older than 3 years old was extrapolated from the preclinical data and adjusted for the average brain 
weight. Similar approach could be used for the younger population. One of the experts has also raised the 
possibility to increase administration frequency as the younger children’s brains grow at a higher rate. 
Experience with other lysosomal diseases could also be taken into account. The experts concluded that the 
company is best placed to propose alternative dose schedule, as they already developed them for the 203 
study.  
The experts also reported that the neurosurgeons at their sites do not perceive changes of the catheters, 
which would be necessary in the younger population, as a problem. Similarly, the required volume of infusion 
is not expected to cause safety or tolerability problems.   
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
As a specific obligation the applicant will conduct and submit results of the Phase 2 study (190-203) in order 
to further evaluate the treatment effectiveness as a delay in progression of CLN2 motor-language clinical sale 
and to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of cerliponase alfa. This study will include at least 5 
patients below the age of 2 years. 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, BMN 190 treatment over 48 weeks demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect on disease 
progression as measured by response rate and rate of decline in the ML score. Results observed for the 
majority of treated subjects represent overall stability of ML scores. Based on the results derived from the 
long-term extension study, efficacy results after prolonged treatment confirm the findings from study 201. 
Sustained treatment effect was observed for more than 1 year and occurred even when there was significant 
pre-existing burden of disease.  
Overall, the available data on the effect of Brineura in CLN2 children show a sufficiently convincing beneficial 
effect. Further long-term efficacy and safety data will be provided post-approval. Particularly relevant will be 
the study intended to assess the effect of Brineura in children that are pre-symptomatic or at very early 
stages of the disease (Study 190-203). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data and to be 
considered a specific obligation in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
The Applicant will conduct and submit the results of the Phase 2 study (190-203) in order to further evaluate 
the treatment effectiveness as a delay in progression of CLN2 motor-language clinical sale and to further 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of cerliponase alfa. This study will include at least 5 patients below the 
age of 2 years.

2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
24 subjects with CLN2 were exposed to BMN 190.  All of them received at least one 300 mg dose of BMN 
190. 1 subject has received only 1 single infusion of ICV BMN 190 and 23 subjects have received at least 72 
weeks of treatment with 300 mg ICV BMN every other week during study 201/202. 
Over the total 201/202 dosing period median time of exposure at any dose as well as at the 300 mg dose 
was 95.1 weeks, with a maximum of 141 weeks at any dose and a maximum of 124.4 weeks at the 300 mg 
dose.  
All 23 subjects who completed study 201 entered study 202 and were continuing it as of 3 Jun 2016.   
Baseline data 
The most commonly reported medical history findings by PT for nervous system disorders were epilepsy 
(75%), ataxia (58%), language disorder (46%), and psychomotor skills impaired (42%). Either epilepsy or 
seizures was reported in 22/24 (92%) of subjects. 
Severity of Disease 
All subjects enrolled in study 201 had early-to-moderate CLN2 disease at Screening, as defined by a score of 
3-6 on the ML scale (with at least 1 point in both the motor and language domains). 
Concomitant medication 
Concomitant medications were reported for all 24 subjects (100%) in 201/202. The most common 
concomitant medications were acetaminophen (92%), propofol (79%), midazolam (75%), valproate sodium 
(75%), diazepam (71%), cetirizine (67%), ibuprofen (67%), levetiracetam (50%), prednisolone (50%), 
sevoflurane (46%), and valproic acid (46%). 
Adverse events 
In studies 201/202, an MRI-compatible ICV reservoir and cannula leading to the lateral ventricle of the right 
hemisphere were implanted surgically. Following informed consent, but prior to ICV access device 
implantation, only SAEs related to study-mandated procedures were reported. Treatment emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs) were defined as any events occurring after the placement of the ICV access device, i.e. 
following the surgery for ICV access device implantation. 
Overall summary of adverse events  
All subjects experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE, 23 (96%) of subjects experienced at least one 
drug-related AE (ADR) and 19 (79%) of subjects experienced at least one SAE. 
The majority of subjects (N=14; 58%) had ADR with moderate severity as highest severity level, 6 (25%) 
subjects had ADRs with only mild severity, at least 1 severe ADR occurred in 3 (13%) subjects. Drug related 
SAE occurred in 8 (13%) subjects.  
The most common AEs were pyrexia (71%), seizure (58%), vomiting (58%) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (50%). Other common events included epilepsy and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (46% each), 
rhinitis (42%) and hypersensitivity and nasopharyngitis (38% each).  
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 64/95 
  
  
 
 
Related Adverse Events/Adverse Drug Reactions 
Twenty-three subjects (96%) experienced an AE assessed as related to BMN 190 treatment by the 
investigator. The most common related AEs included pyrexia (46%), hypersensitivity (38%), seizure (38%), 
epilepsy (17%), vomiting (13%), and headache (13%); feeling jittery and myoclonus were reported in 2 
subjects (8%) each, and the following PT for related AEs were reported in 1 subject (4%) each: bradycardia, 
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disorder, nausea, oral mucosal blistering, tongue blistering, device leakage, 
needle issue, gait disturbance, pain, conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infection, infusion related reaction, 
body temperature increased, CSF test abnormal, atonic seizures, dropped head syndrome, dyskinesia, 
dystonia, generalised-tonic clonic seizures, partial seizures, pleocytosis, tremor, irritability, staring, rash and 
urticaria. 
A total of 15 events with the PT of hypersensitivity were reported, including 5 events with Grade 3 severity. 
86 of the 175 (49%) total treatment-related events reported had the PT of pyrexia. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
Prospective selection of adverse events of special interest (AEOSI) was based on nonclinical findings, known 
effects of enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs), and literature review of AEs associated with ICV delivery 
systems. 
AEOSI - Hypersensitivity Adverse Events (HAEs): 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and less severe allergic reactions, are an identified risk for 
enzyme replacement therapy and investigators were instructed to pre-treat subjects with an age-appropriate 
dose of antihistamines (and antipyretics, if appropriate) ~30 minutes before infusion. 
A hypersensitivity adverse event (HAE) was defined as any AE that maps into either: 
- 
- 
The broad “hypersensitivity” Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) standardized 
MedDRA query (SMQ), or 
the broad algorithmic “anaphylactic reaction” SMQ with onset within 24 hours of start of a study drug 
infusion, as defined by MedDRA. 
No HAEs were identified by the broad algorithmic anaphylactic reaction SMQ. 
Fourteen of 24 subjects (58%) had a total of 36 HAEs in 201/202 identified by the hypersensitivity SMQ. It 
was the most common PT reported, occurring in 9 of the 14 subjects and accounting for 15 of 36 total 
events. The broad hypersensitivity SMQ also identified the following preferred terms: conjunctivitis 
(experienced by 4 subjects), contact dermatitis, rash, and urticaria (experienced by 2 subjects each) and 
stomatitis, dermatitis, and seasonal allergy (experienced by 1 subject each). Of the 36 hypersensitivity 
events, 9 (25%) (all events with the PT of hypersensitivity) were reported as SAEs. 
Fourteen of the 15 events with the PT of hypersensitivity (including all events with Grade 3 severity) occurred 
during 201, no new events with the PT of hypersensitivity were reported in 202. 
For reports of hypersensitivity, the most common manifestations were pyrexia, vomiting, pleocytosis, or 
irritability. According to the presented narratives, symptoms reported in the context of serious 
hypersensitivity AEs or infusion related reactions, respectively or grade 3 hypersensitivity AEs included: 
fever, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, motor agitation, increased heart rate, leucocytosis, increase in CRP, 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 65/95 
  
  
 
 
increase in serum total IgE (but no drug specific IgE positivity), CSF pleocytosis, increased protein in CSF, 
increase in IL-6 in CSF. HAEs were observed during or within 24 hours after completion of the BMN 190 
infusion. 
AEOSI - Temporally Related Events (TREs) (as of 03 Jun 2016): 
A TRE was defined as any AE with onset after initiation of BMN 190 infusion and within 24 hours after start or 
restart of infusion, regardless of the investigator’s assessment of relatedness to study drug administration. 
The most common TREs (incidence > 10%) by PT were pyrexia (46%), hypersensitivity (38%), seizure 
(33%), vomiting (29%), tremor (25%), needle issue (21%), constipation, gait disturbance, upper respiratory 
tract infection, headache, myoclonus (17% each), diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, fall, and generalised tonic clonic 
seizure (13% each). 
Most TREs were mild to moderate in severity (CTCAE Grade 1 to 2). Seven subjects (29%) had at least one 
grade 3 TRE over the total dosing period. Grade 3 TREs included acidosis (1 subject), anaemia (1 subject), 
thrombocytopenia (1 subject), hypersensitivity (5 events in 3 subjects), pharyngitis bacterial (1 subject), 
Propionibacterium infection (2 events in 1 subject), and skin infection (1 subject). Of the grade 3 TREs, only 
hypersensitivity events were considered related to the study drug itself. The events of Propionibacterium 
infection were device related events. 
AEOSI - Device Related Events 
Eleven subjects (46%) in 201/202 experienced a total of 30 device-related AEs over the total dosing period. 
Needle issue (5 events in 4 subjects), device leakage (5 events in 1 subject), and pleocytosis (3 events in 3 
subjects), device malfunction (2 events in 2 subjects), and Propionibacterium infection (2 events in 1 subject) 
are the only device-related AEs to occurred more than once. 
2 subjects had 3 ICV access device infections, both serious. All device infectious events resolved after 
treatment with antibiotics and removal/replacement of the ICV access device. Neither subject required 
discontinuation from study participation as a result of the events. 
As of now, 4 device replacements in 2 subjects became necessary: Apart from 3 device replacements due to 
infectious events, one non-infectious device-related SAE (i.e. incorrect positioning/malfunctioning) required 
surgical device revision. 
All other device-related AEs were grade 1 in severity. 
12 infusions were interrupted and not completed. 7 of these cases were secondary to device-related AEs (3 
events of needle issue, 1 with multiple events reported (needle issue and device malfunction), and 1 event 
each of device infusion issue, complication associated with device, and Propionibacterium infection). Two 
additional incomplete infusions were secondary to device problems that were not reported as AEs (1 instance 
of the needle being dislodged, and 1 instance of problem with the port). The remaining 3 instances of 
incomplete infusions were secondary to non-device related reasons.

Additional operation-related findings of study 201/202: 
Of the 3 SAEs that occurred before the first BMN 190 infusion, 2 occurred in close temporal relationship with 
the device implantation: 
•  Subject 1287-1007 experienced a grade 3 peri-operative intracranial hemorrhage from Day -11 to Day -
9 (at the time of ICV access device surgery). 
•  Subject 1323-1018 experienced two grade 2 pre-dosing events: epilepsy (Day -33 to Day -32, i.e. 
before device implantation) and pyrexia without evidence of device infection (Day -17 to Day -13; 
starting 1 day after device implantation). 
Further AEs described after ICV surgery and before first BMN 190 infusion included vomiting, seizure/atypical 
focal seizure, agitation, peri-/post-operative pain, fever, minor head injury, mild cough, granulocytic 
pleocytosis [CSF], myoclonus, (grade 1 and reversible) alteration of venous flow detected at the level of the 
superior sagittal sinus. These AEs are largely compatible with the known risks of device implantation and 
CLN2 disease characteristics. 
AEOSI -Convulsion/Status Epilepticus: 
Seven subjects (29%) experienced 14 AEs meeting the AE of special interest definition of status epilepticus 
(includes MedDRA PTs petit mal epilepsy and status epilepticus). 13 of the 14 reported events had the PT of 
petit mal epilepsy, were non-serious and Grade 1 in severity, and were reported as not related to study 
treatment. The remaining event was reported as a serious Grade 4 event of status epilepticus. No events 
required dose modification. 
Overall, 23 (96%) subjects experienced 362 AEs that map to the Convulsions Standardized MedDRA Query. 
The majority of convulsion AEs (>90%) were grade 1 or 2 in severity, and 94 % were considered unrelated 
to study drug. There was no clear pattern of reporting of convulsion events as drug related; the most 
commonly reported drug-related convulsion events included seizure (14 events in 9 subjects) and epilepsy (4 
events in 4 subjects). Six subjects (25%) experienced 7 convulsion AEs that occurred after ICV implantation 
but before first dose of BMN 190. 
Four subjects (17%) experienced 4 convulsion SAEs: a Grade 4 event of status epilepticus, a Grade 3 event 
of seizure, and 2 Grade 2 events of epilepsy. None of the SAEs were judged to be related to study drug. No 
further convulsion SAEs were reported during the update period. 
59 out of 362 overall reported convulsion AE occurred temporally related to BMN 190 infusion (within 24 
hours of start of infusion). 
AEOSI – Hydrocephalus 
No events meeting the pre-specified definition of hydrocephalus have been reported.  
AEOSI – Meningitis: 
No events meeting the pre-specified definition of meningitis have been reported.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
A total of 19 subjects (79%) had at least 1 reported SAE during 201/202. A total of 51 SAEs were reported 
over the total dosing period, including 31 SAEs during 201 and 20 SAEs during 202. The most commonly 
reported SAEs were hypersensitivity (9 events in 7 subjects), upper respiratory tract infection (4 events in 
4subjects), epilepsy (3 events in 3 subjects), bacterial pharyngitis (3 events in 2 subjects), gastroenteritis (3 
events in 2 subjects), pyrexia (2 events in 2 subjects), Propionibacterium infection (2 events in 1 subject), 
and infusion related reaction (2 events in 1 subject). No other SAE was reported more than once. 
The most common SOCs with SAEs were Infections and Infestations (22 events in13 subjects), Immune 
System Disorders (9 events in 7 subjects), and Nervous System Disorders (7 events in 6 subjects). 
Eleven subjects (46%) had Grade 3 SAEs. Four subjects (17%) reported multiple Grade 3 SAEs: 
• Subject 1244-1006 experienced 5 Grade 3 SAEs (1 event of pneumonia in 201, and events of bacterial 
pharyngitis, dysphagia, skin infection, and tonsillar hypertrophy in 202). 
• Subject 1323-1015 experienced 4 Grade 3 SAEs: events of motor dysfunction, pharyngitis, and 
Propionibacterium infection during 190-201, and an additional Grade 3 event of Propionibacterium infection 
during 190-202. 
• Subject 1287-1005 experienced a Grade 3 SAE of vaginal discharge during 201 and a Grade 3 SAE of 
seizure during 202. 
• Subject 1244-1002 experienced a Grade 3 SAE of hypersensitivity during 201 and a Grade 3 SAE of upper 
respiratory tract infection during 202. 
One subject (4%) had a Grade 4 SAE of status epilepticus, assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study 
treatment and not temporally related to BMN 190 infusion. 
Eleven SAEs in 8 subjects were assessed by the investigator as related to treatment with BMN 190 - 9 SAEs 
of hypersensitivity and 2 SAEs of infusion related reaction. All 11 drug-related SAEs resolved with appropriate 
medical management, and all subjects with drug-related SAEs tolerated subsequent dosing and remained in 
the study.  
No deaths were reported during study drug treatment or during follow-up in either study 201 or 202.  
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Treatment-emergent abnormal hematology test results occurred in 100% of subjects. The most common 
abnormalities were low lymphocyte (71%) and low leukocyte (67%) level, low hematocrit (50%) and low 
platelet count (46%).  
Nine abnormal laboratory reports were reported as Grade 1 AEs (2 anemia, hemolysis, 2 thrombocytopenia, 
platelet count decreased, RBC count decreased, hemoglobin decreased, hematocrit decreased), and 2 
abnormalities were reported as Grade 3 AEs (anemia, thrombocytopenia). None of these events were

reported as study drug related and no action was taken with BMN 190 treatment. The nature of these 
changes is also not consistent with immunologically-induced effects on red blood cells or platelets. 
Overall, mean changes in median, maximum and minimum hematology values from baseline did not reveal 
any clinically significant trends. However, in the safety population as a whole, there was a trend towards a 
decrease in the platelet count over the study duration. The change from study baseline to within value was -
63 (109 cells/L). There were no similar changes in other hematology labs as the mean change for 
hemoglobin, hematocrit and red blood cells were overall stable. 
Hematology shift tables revealed > 25% of subjects had post-baseline thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, or 
lymphopenia. However, platelet clinical laboratory results were variable over the course of the study and six 
of the 11 subjects who had low platelet laboratory, had a single low platelet value during 201 / 202, preceded 
and followed by normal value.  Bleeding events were noted in 11 subjects and included bone contusion, 
contusion, hematoma, epistaxis, post procedural hematoma, traumatic hematoma, subdural hematoma, 
coagulopathy wound haemorrhage (all grade 1) and peri-operative intracranial haemorrhage (grade 3). All of 
them appear not to be associated with decreased platelet counts.  
Hemoglobin levels were abnormally low in 6/24 subjects, and abnormally high in 7/24 subjects.  
Clinical chemistry 
Treatment-emergent abnormal chemistry test results occurred in 100% of subjects. Common abnormalities 
included low urate (74%), high chloride (63%), high AST (63%), high carbon dioxide (61%), high blood urea 
nitrogen (58%), low cholesterol (58%), low bilirubin (54%), and high lactate dehydrogenase (52%). Two 
abnormal laboratory reports were reported as AEs: blood alkaline phosphatase increased (Grade 2) and liver 
function test increased (Grade 1). None of these events were reported as study drug related and no action 
was taken with BMN 190 treatment. 
Mean changes in median, mean, maximum, and minimum values from baseline did not reveal any clinically 
significant trends. 
Urine-analysis 
Treatment-emergent abnormal urinalysis test results occurred in 92% of subjects; the majority (75%) were 
high pH values. None of these abnormalities were reported as AEs. 
Mean changes in median, mean, maximum, and minimum values from baseline did not reveal any clinically 
significant trends. 
Cerebrospinal fluid 
Treatment-emergent abnormal CSF test results occurred in 83% of subjects. For the 5 CSF parameters (cell 
count, protein, glucose, lymphocytes/leukocytes (%), monocytes/leukocytes (%)), 4%-71% of subjects had 
abnormal values. The most common treatment-emergent abnormalities were low CSF protein (71%) and

high CSF cell count (75%). Four subjects (17%) were noted to have CSF pleocytosis prior to first infusion, 
with a cell count ranging from 8 to 739 cells/μL. Of these subjects, the cell counts of 2 subjects remained 
elevated in the treatment period, while 14 subjects developed new CSF pleocytosis during the treatment 
period. These post-infusion abnormalities in CSF cell count were typically mild elevations, peaking between 7 
and 25 cells/μL. The cell type was variable, but (where differentials were collected) was usually neutrophil 
predominant. 
Vital sings/physical findings 
AEs related to vital signs included Grade 1 pyrexia (9 subjects [38%]), Grade 2 pyrexia (8 subjects [33%]), 
Grade 1 bradycardia (2 subjects [8%]), Grade 1 sinus bradycardia (1 [4%]), Grade 2 postoperative fever (1 
[4%]), Grade 1 oxygen saturation decreased (1 [4%]), Grade 2 oxygen saturation decreased (1 [4%]), 
Grade 1 hypotension (1 [4%]), and Grade 2 hypotension (1 [4%]). Of these, the Grade 1 bradycardia (1 
[4%]), Grade 1 pyrexia (8 [33%]), and Grade 2 pyrexia (3 [13%]) were the only AEs reported to be study 
drug related. Sporadic transient changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed during 
periods of frequent monitoring during and following infusions of BMN-190, but were non-progressive, non-
sustained, and not associated with clinical sequelae. 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
At baseline, 18 subjects (75%) had normal and 4 subjects (17%) had abnormal ECG results. Post-baseline, 
16 subjects (67%) had 1 or more abnormal ECG, and 8 subjects (33%) had all normal ECGs. In the change 
from baseline to post-baseline, 6 subjects (25%) retained normal ECGs, 12 subjects (50%) were reported to 
shift from normal to one or more abnormal ECG. One subject (4%) had an abnormal baseline ECG that was 
normal post-baseline, and 3 subjects (13%) had an abnormal baseline ECG that shifted to 1 or more 
abnormal post-baseline.  
Mean changes in ECG heart rate and RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals and QTcF intervals did not reveal any 
clinically meaningful trends. There was a single patient with a QTcF interval > 450 msec, which was a 50 
msec increase compared to the baseline measurement.  
From the details of reported ECG abnormalities no clear patterns suggesting myocardial damage are seen. 
However, in one subject ECG signs of a possible left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy were reported during study 
202 but not during the preceding study 201. In this subject grade 2 hypotension was reported 8 hrs after 
BMN 190 infusion and was reportedly resolved.  
As of now, 9 cardiac AEs occurred in 5 subjects, one of which was considered related to study drug, i.e. 
bradycardia during infusion in one subject with a history of bradycardia and hypotension.  
Electroencephalograms (EEGs) 
Compared with baseline, there were changes in epileptiform activity and frequency slowing. Three subjects 
(13%) showed new focal epileptiform activity, while 6 subjects (25%) showed new generalized epileptiform 
activity and 6 subjects (25%) showed both new focal and generalized activity. 
Eight subjects (33%) showed new focal frequency slowing. Three subjects (13%) showed new generalized 
frequency slowing, and 4 subjects (17%) showed both new focal and generalized frequency slowing.

Safety in special populations 
Age of study subjects at enrolment in study 201 ranged from 3-8 years, with a median age of 4. From the 
presented analysis of AEs categorized by < 4 years and ≥ 4 years of age, no clear difference in the reported 
AE frequency can be derived. Vomiting occurred approx. twice as often in older compared to younger 
subjects, however, as the subgroup of subjects < 4 years was low (N=6), these data must be interpreted 
with caution. 
There was no apparent gender difference in the severity of AEs or the occurrence of drug-related AEs, device-
related AEs, or hypersensitivity AEs.  Differential incidences of AEs by race/ethnicity could not be ascertained 
because 23/24 subjects were in the same racial and ethnic groups. 
Studies 201/202 were conducted in 4 countries, with exposure in subject years being 18.4 in Germany, 6.3 in 
Italy, and 2.7 each in the UK and US, respectively. No apparent regional differences can be derived from the 
provided safety data by country. 
Immunological events  
Immunogenicity assessment included characterizing the anti-drug antibody (ADA) response and assessing 
the impact of ADA on safety, exposure and efficacy. Routine immunogenicity tests included TAb in the serum 
and CSF and neutralizing antibody (NAb) in the CSF. NAb testing was not performed if the CSF TAb was 
negative. 
ADAs were detected in the serum of 9/24 subjects (79%) by 73-133 weeks of treatment. ADA were first 
detected between Weeks 5-13, and in subjects who developed an ADA response, the response was either 
sustained (12/19, 63%) or declined (7/19, 37%), of which 5/19 (26%) reverted to undetectable by week 
133.  
ADAs were detected in the CSF of 6/24 subjects (25%) treated with BMN 190 for 73-133 weeks. The ADA 
titres were sustained in 2/6 (33%) and declined to undetectable in 4/6 (66%) of the subjects that developed 
antibodies by Week 133. The earliest time to onset of ADA development in the CSF was Week 13. Anti-BMN 
190 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not detected in the CSF of any BMN 190-treated subjects (0/24) for 
up to 133 weeks. 
No association was found between serum ADA titre and incidence or severity of hypersensitivity AEs. All 
subjects who experienced a serious or grade 3 hypersensitivity adverse event were reported to be negative 
for drug-specific IgE, however, the test used for evaluation of drug-specific IgE was not considered reliable. 
During the marketing authorization procedure the applicant submitted a valid test method which will be used 
for further evaluation of immunogenicity post-marketing.  
A comparison of CSF and serum ADA negative and positive subjects showed no association between ADA titre 
and treatment outcome as measured by the ML scale.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal studies of drug-drug or drug-disease interactions were performed. The catabolism of BMN 190 is 
not expected to be affected by another drug or disease.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to adverse events.

N/A 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The clinical dossier submitted in support of Brineura MAA contained safety data of the completed uncontrolled 
study 201 conducted in 24 subjects and the ongoing extension study 202. As of 3 June 2016, all 23 subjects 
who completed study 201 entered study 202 and were continuing participation.  
The clinical safety database is very limited.  During the course of the evaluation, the applicant has informed 
CHMP that 4 subjects have additionally been enrolled in the sibling study 203, and that 16 subjects have 
been treated since 12 Aug 2016 in compassionate use programs. Although additional information is very 
limited, no new safety issues have been reported. 
All 24 subjects experienced TEAEs. The most frequent TEAEs were pyrexia (71%), seizure (58%), vomiting 
(58%), and upper respiratory tract infections (50%). Other common events included epilepsy and tonic-clonic 
seizures (46% each), rhinitis (42%) and hypersensitivity and nasopharyngitis (38% each).  
Causality assessment of the reported AEs is made difficult by the fact that studies 201/202 were uncontrolled 
and that several AEs may have multiple causes, e.g. can be related to the drug, device, device implantation, 
ICV infusion, underlying disease and/or concomitant medication. Furthermore, BM190 is a first in class 
compound and the pre-clinical data package is very limited and with restricted transferability to humans.   
Hypersensitivity AEs (HAEs) are currently considered the most relevant safety concern related to the drug 
itself. The majority of study subjects (58%) had hypersensitivity AEs (HAEs) identified by the broad 
“hypersensitivity” SMQ, 5 HAEs in 3 subjects were rated as grade 3. All 9 AEs (in 7 subjects) with the PT 
hypersensitivity were reported as SAEs. It is currently reassuring, that all hypersensitivity reactions were 
manageable (mainly with antihistamines, antipyretics and/or steroids) and did not lead to dose reduction or 
withdrawal from treatment with BMN 190, and that no anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been 
reported. However, the occurrence of life threatening anaphylactic reactions due to ICV BMN 190 can 
currently not be excluded. Therefore, precautionary measures during drug administration have been included 
in the SmPC. 
Further evaluation revealed no increase of hypersensitivity AEs over time, with a trend towards decreasing 
severity of hypersensitivity reactions. From the provided data, it appears that the results regarding ADA 
development and risk of hypersensitivity are also valid for subjects without residual TPP1 (who may be at 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 72/95 
  
  
 
 
potentially higher risk of hypersensitivity). In order to reduce the risks of hypersensitivity reactions, pre-
treatment with antihistamines with or without antipyretics 30-60 minutes before each BMN 190 infusion is 
recommended in the SmPC.  
30 device-related AEs occurred in 11 (46%) subjects and were generally in line with known risks of ICV 
devices. The presented data and available literature indicate that infection appears to be the most significant 
device-related safety risk. ICV drug delivery is an effective route of administration into the CNS but stringent 
measures are necessary to prevent complications. The Applicant will develop educational materials for Health 
Care Professionals (HCPs), describing the correct infusion preparation, the intracerebroventricular (ICV) drug 
administration and the monitoring of the patients in order to reduce the risk of device-related infections. 
Besides the 3 infection-related device replacements, a 4th device replacement was necessary due to an event 
of incorrect positioning/malfunctioning. All other non-infectious device-related complications were reported as 
mild. During an acute device-related infection, ICV administration of Brineura is considered to pose an 
unacceptably high risk. Device malfunction and leakage may further lead to reduced availability of BMN 190 
in the targeted areas or lead to increased risk of hypersensitivity due to increased off-target exposure. 
Therefore, Brineura is contraindicated in case of signs of acute ICV access device leakage, failure or device-
related infection. 
In addition to AEs classified as device-related, 2 SAEs occurred in close temporal relationship with device 
implantation but before first study drug administration, i.e. intracranial hemorrhage (associated with the 
reversible symptoms of fever, lethargy, vomiting and seizure) and pyrexia without evidence of device 
infection. These SAEs as well as further non-serious AEs reported after device implantation were generally 
compatible with the known risks of ICV device implantation. In order to reduce device related risks, 
instructions and precautionary measures have been included in the SmPC.  
Seizures and epilepsy were among the most common TEAEs. However, seizures and/or epilepsy occur in the 
vast majority of CLN2 patients, often as the first symptom, and were reported in 92% of subjects at 
screening. Besides being related to the underlying disease, seizures could potentially also be caused by the 
ICV device, ICV drug administration or protein administration. Therefore, interpretability of the results of the 
uncontrolled study 201/202 is very limited. Whereas seizures were not counted with seizure diaries during 
study 201/202, it is generally reassuring that the mean change in total CLN2 score suggests improvement in 
the seizure domain and that the majority (>90%) of convulsion AEs were graded as mild or moderate. Of the 
14 AEs that met the AEOSI definition of status epilepticus, only 1 AE was coded with the PT status epilepticus 
considered unrelated to study drug, the other 13 AEOSI were related to absence type seizures. On the other 
hand, in analyses presented as of cut off of 15 Oct 2015, compared to baseline, new (focal and/or 
generalised) epileptiform EEG activity was reported in 62.5% of subjects. Further (and in contrast to the 
applicant’s argumentation that only “few” subjects experienced convulsion events within 24 hours of study 
drug administration), 18.5% of all convulsion AEs were temporally related to BMN 190 infusion (i.e. 48 out of 
260 convulsion AEs), which is considerably above the overall average of convulsion AEs expected, i.e. 1 in 14 
days (approx. 18.6 out of 260; 7.1%). The updated data still revealed a clearly increased rate of temporally 
related convulsion AEs (59/362, 16.3% of all convulsion AEs) and 6% out of 362 seizures (N > 20) were 
considered treatment related by the investigator. 
Although interpretability of convulsion AEs reported in studies 201/202 is difficult and there appears to be an 
overall beneficial effect of BMN 190 with regard to seizures, general plausibility of a causal relationship with 
BMN 190 treatment as well as a considerably increased rate of convulsion AEs reported to be temporally 
related with BMN 190 infusion, strongly point to the possibility that some seizures may also be provoked by 
BMN 190 treatment. Adequate information has been presented in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Currently, due to the limited number of treated patients as well as time of exposure, the risk for 
hydrocephalus due to treatment with BMN (i.e. protein administration via ICV device) cannot be quantified. 
However, it is reassuring that so far no cases of hydrocephalus have occurred. Subjects prone to 
complications from ICV drug administration (e.g. with ventricular shunts) were excluded from participation in 
studies 201/202. As ventricular shunts which bypass CSF to the body system are presumed to reduce 
exposure to BMN 190 in the CSF and in the targeted brain areas while increasing the systemic exposure to 
BMN 190, which may reduce efficacy and increase hypersensitivity risk at the same time, treatment with BMN 
190 has been contraindicated in subjects with these shunts.  
CSF pleocytosis was seen in 75% of subjects and emerged as isolated finding which was often rather mild 
and could be related to the placement of the ICV device; however, in some subjects higher CSF cell counts 
(up to 4646.6/ μL) were also reported during treatment without any associated AEs reported. In 8 (33%) 
subjects, CSF pleocytosis was persistent with > 20% of their follow-up labs also demonstrating CSF 
pleocytosis. Predominantly more pronounced CSF pleocytosis occurred in association with hypersensitivity, 
fever and device-related infection. Elevated CSF protein, reported in 4 (17%) subjects may be indicative of a 
device related infection but appears also to occur as isolated finding. Low CSF protein was reported in 71% of 
subjects and could be caused by loss of CSF, either by CSF sampling or by device related CSF leakage. 
However, the AE of device leakage has been reported in only 1 subject (5 events), no case of low CSF protein 
was reported as AE and the exact reason for decreased CSF protein is currently not clarified.  
Immunogenicity evaluations revealed a very high percentage (79%) subjects who developed anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) in serum, and the ADA response was sustained in approx. 2/3 of subjects. A lower 
proportion of subjects (25%) developed ADAs in CSF. Descriptive as well as graphical correlation analyses 
showed no apparent correlation between the serum ADA titres and the incidence or severity of 
hypersensitivity AEs or treatment effect.  The clinical relevance of sustained ADA response in serum and CSF 
remains unclear. Until further elucidation of the potential role of antibodies in serum/CSF, the routine 
monitoring does not appear to be necessary. However, further data regarding ADA should be collected in the 
ongoing clinical studies. 
There appears to be no relationship of thrombocytopenia observed in 11 out of 24 treated children and the 
trend towards a decrease in platelet count in the overall study population over the study period. 
Thrombocytopenia was mostly mild and without clear pattern and occurred in a patient group with potential 
confounders. There were only 2 observed thrombocyte values below 100 (109 cells/L) and none of the 4 AEs 
(3 grade 1 and 1 grade 3) was reported as drug related. There are potential confounders to a possible 
mechanism-based effect on platelets, including concomitant medications and a patient population of 
chronically ill pediatric patients with inter-current illnesses, polypharmacy, and potential nutrition issues 
during the study period which may affect platelet count. 
The type of the 11 bleeding events observed in the 201/202 (bone contusion, contusion, hematoma, 
epistaxis, hemorrhage intracranial grade 3, post procedural hematoma, traumatic hematoma, subdural 
hematoma, epistaxis, coagulopathy, and wound hemorrhage) is not typical for bleeding events associated 
with thrombocytopenia but seems to be rater related to surgery and CLN2 associated symptoms like seizures 
and gait disturbance. Inclusion of thrombocytopenia in the RMP is therefore not considered warranted.  
In non-clinical studies, increased Troponin I was found in dogs after intrathecal BMN 190 application. 
Although this finding may be a symptom of the CLN2-model (i.e. due to lysosomal storage in heart tissue) 
and although systemic exposure to BMN190 is very low, a causal relationship with BMN 190 administration 
cannot be excluded based on limitations of the respective study data. Cardiotoxicity has not been particularly 
addressed and troponin has not been measured in the clinical studies. From the presented details of reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 74/95 
  
  
ECG abnormalities, no clear patterns suggesting myocardial damage are seen. However, one subject 
developed a possible left-ventricular hypertrophy during the course of study 202. In another subject, a 
cardiac AE of bradycardia during BMN 190 infusion was considered related to treatment. As currently no clear 
safety signal regarding cardiotoxicity can be derived from the pre-/clinical data, 12-lead ECG evaluations 
every 6 months as routine monitoring in cardiac normal subjects are considered sufficient. However, since 
some of these CLN2 patients may develop conduction disorders or heart disease, ECG monitoring during 
infusion is recommended in patients with present or past bradycardia, conduction disorders, or with structural 
heart disease. Cardiac AEs will be monitored as AEs of special interest and further evaluation of potential 
acute cardiac effects will be implemented in the ongoing clinical studies.  
As only one dosing regimen has been tested, it remains unclear whether the evaluated dose and infusion rate 
could have been further optimized. From the safety point of view, a lower dose and infusion rate might be 
associated with a lower hypersensitivity risk as the systemic exposure of BMN 190 would be anticipated to be 
lower. On the other hand, a longer infusion procedure might increase the infection risk as well as the 
discomfort for the patients.   
No AEs of increased intracranial pressure have been reported. However, as intracranial pressure has not been 
measured during the study, it cannot be excluded that in some cases symptoms such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting or seizures may have been caused by a temporary increase in intracranial pressure. As a 
precautionary measure, which is of particular importance with regard to children below 3 years of age, the 
CHMP advised that appropriate information should be added to section 4.2 of the SmPC:  the infusion should 
be interrupted and/or the infusion rate slowed, in case symptoms would occur, which in the judgment of the 
treating physician are considered caused by an increase in intracranial pressure. 
During the MAA evaluation,  concerns were raised with regards to the safety of ICV devices in very young 
children (in particular < 1 year of age) compared to children ≥ 3 years which also concerned differences in 
diagnosis and prognosis of device related infections, need for catheter changes due to brain growth as well as 
vulnerability of the very fast developing brain. 
As of now, two subjects aged 2 years have been included in the ongoing study 203 and have received 8 BMN 
190 infusions (at the same posology as studied and proposed for older children). They appeared to tolerate 
the treatment well so far. The applicant has provided some reassurance that the infusion of BMN 190 in these 
young children would not be expected to bear an unacceptably high risk of increased intracranial pressure as 
the Brineura infusion rate of 2.5 mL/h is still below the CSF production rate of 3.1 mL/h calculated for a 2-
year old female at the 3rd percentile according to the formula developed by Yasuda et al. (2002).  
The applicant has also proposed a posology for treatment of children < 2 years (which is in line with the 
posology scheduled for evaluation in study 203) and provided argumentation that this dose is anticipated to 
provide an acceptable safety profile in very young children: BMN 190 should be infused ICV every 14 days at 
the same infusion rate but at a reduced dose of 100 mg in children from birth up to < 0.5 years and of 150 
mg in children from 0.5 to 1 year of age, as well as at a reduced dose of 200 mg for the first 4 infusion in 
children from > 1 to 2 years. These reduced dosages are calculated based on lower brain mass in younger 
children. Further argumentation supporting a low risk of increased intracranial pressure due to the proposed 
infusion volume referring to total CSF volume and turnover rate has been found reassuring.  
In the absence of clinical data with BMN 190 in these age groups, this approach to posology currently 
appears reasonable with regard to safety. However, further PK data will need to be collected in the ongoing 
study 203, in order to allow for confirmation of the appropriateness of this approach or lead to further

optimization of posology and for comparison of PK parameters in CSF and plasma between children < 2 y and 
children > 2y. Of these latter Cmax is considered particularly important with regard to safety (as e.g. an 
immature blood-brain-barrier in newborns and very young infants might lead to disproportionately high BMN 
190 exposure in plasma).  
As all subjects enrolled in study 201 had early-to-moderate CLN2 disease at screening (defined by a score of 
3-6 on the ML scale), safety data in subjects with advanced CLN2 disease is missing. It can currently not be 
excluded that the risk of hypersensitivity/immunogenicity increases in these patients. Disturbance of the 
blood brain barrier, which is commonly described in advanced neurodegenerative disease, might occur in 
these patients and would be anticipated to be associated with higher plasma exposure of BMN 190. 
Therefore, SmPC includes caution that no clinical data is available in subjects with advanced CLN2 disease. 
Although Brineura is intended for chronic treatment, long-term safety data is currently limited. An ongoing 
benefit/risk evaluation is necessary in individual patients. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
In the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances, specific obligations are included in the terms of the 
Marketing Authorisation. The applicant will conduct as a specific obligation a Phase 2 study (190-203) in 
order to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of cerliponase alfa. The applicant will also monitor the 
long term safety in patients treated with Brineura from a patient registry for which details are reflected in the 
risk management plan. Reports on recruitment progress of the registry will be reported at the time of PSURs 
and Annual Re-assessments. Progress and results from the registry will form an important element of the 
annual reassessments of the benefit/risk profile of Brineura. The CHMP is of the opinion that the value of the 
registry data would be increased if the Applicant established a formal cooperation with a well-established 
international disease registry.  
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety database derived from studies 201/202 is considered limited. Causality assessment of 
reported AEs is difficult as the clinical studies were uncontrolled and several AEs may have different causes 
including active substance, device and underlying disease, respectively. Further, BMN 190 is a first in class 
compound and the pre-clinical safety data package is very limited and with restricted transferability to 
humans. Although ICV treatment with Brineura is associated with potentially serious adverse drug reactions 
and device-related issues, these were so far manageable. 
Given the rarity, as well as the rapidly progressive and invariably fatal character of CLN2 disease and the 
absence of disease specific treatment options, the uncontrolled and limited safety data base is considered 
sufficient in order to grant approval under exceptional circumstances.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a 
MA under exceptional circumstances:  
The Applicant will monitor the long term safety of Brineura in the treatment of CLN2 on the basis of the 
registry. Additional data collected this way will help broaden knowledge of identified and potential risks of 
cerliponase alfa, as well as provide new information on long-term safety and tolerability.

2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.11.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that cerliponase alfa has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cerliponase alfa to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.12.  Product information 
2.12.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.12.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials 
will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.12.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance and has been approved under exceptional 
circumstances.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative 
lysosomal storage disorders, which are characterised by accumulations of intracellular lipofuscin-like material 
in multiple organs leading to functional impairments and ultimately death (Mole et al., 2005). The different 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are distinguished by the genetic origin, ultrastructural composition of the 
lysosomal storage material, clinical symptoms, age at onset and course of disease. 
Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 2 (CLN2) disorder, formerly also known as 
Jansky-Bielschowsky disease or classical late infantile onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (cLINCL), is a rare, 
paediatric-onset neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by TPP1 enzyme deficiency as a 
consequence of loss-of-function mutation in the CLN 2 gene. 
Affected patients usually become symptomatic in the second or third year of life and present with slowing of 
development and with psychomotor regression. Epilepsy typically develops early and is often refractory to 
medical treatment. The visual, cognitive and motor skills decline rapidly. In general, patients lose vision, are 
wheelchair-bound and require gastrostomy feeding at approximately 6 years of age and subsequently enter a 
vegetative state with death between 10 and 16 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No curative treatment for classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 exists and the diagnosis is 
invariably fatal. Clinical management guidelines for CLN2 disease have not been developed yet. Symptomatic 
treatments are focused on the treatment of seizures (anticonvulsants), motor control loss (bracing or 
wheelchairs) and feeding/ control of aspiration risk (gastrostomy tube). Disease management includes 
physical and speech therapy, different medications aiming at alleviating symptoms such as myoclonus, 
spasticity, dystonia and pain as well as end-of-life care at advanced disease stage. Therefore, there is 
currently a high unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence of the efficacy of BMN 190 in the treatment of CLN2 is mainly based on data from two studies: 
a Phase 1/2 open-label dose escalation study (Study 190-201) and its extension (Study 190-202). 
• 
• 
Study 190-201 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose escalation study of BMN 190 administered via an 
intracerebroventricular access device for at least 48 weeks at 300 mg every other week. 
Study 190-202 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label extension study which enrolled subjects who 
completed treatment in 190-201. 
Included patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CLN2 disease by TPP1 enzyme activity and genotype 
information, mild-to-moderate progression of CLN2 disease, as measured by a 2-domain (motor/gait and 
language) score (ML scale score) of 3-6 on the adapted CLN2 disease rating scale, including a score of at 
least 1 in each of the two domains and were 3-15 years of age at study enrolment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 80/95 
  
  
 
Additionally, a Natural History non interventional study (study 190-901) has been conducted and submitted 
to provide a comparator group. A Phase 2 study (Study 190-203) in siblings of subjects enrolled in 201/202 
studies is ongoing. Given the very limited exposure (as of 15 May 2016 only 3 subjects have been enrolled) 
no data from this study is included in the efficacy evaluation of Brineura. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study 190-201, 20 of 23 (87%) patients responded to treatment as they did not have a 2-point Decline on 
the ML scale at week 48. The responder population for the ML score in the 300 mg dosing period significantly 
exceeded the predicted untreated responder rate of 50% (p = 0.0002). 
Responder rates for the separate motor and language domain scores for the ITT population during dosing 
period showed that eighteen subjects (78%) and 16 subjects (70%), respectively, met the definition of a 
responder. 
Fifteen (65%) of the 23 treated patients had no unreversed single point loss. These patients were stable or 
improved over the full duration of 300 mg treatment as measured by the ML scale. The estimated responder 
rate of 65% in treated patients significantly exceeds the expected responder rate of 25% in untreated 
patients (p < 0.0001).  
As shown by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, all patients with an unreversed single point decline lost function early 
under active treatment and were stable afterwards. Thus, the disease-modifying effect of Brineura may not 
become obvious immediately. 
In comparison to untreated patients (Integrated summary of effectiveness, 1:1 Matching based on age and 
baseline ML scale scores (for 190-201/202 subjects)/HML scale scores (for natural history patients), the 
primary responder analysis showed a relevant and statistically significantly higher proportion of responders 
with a decrease in the rate of disease progression (rate < 2 points/48 weeks) under active treatment (91%) 
as measured by the ML scale compared to untreated patients (historical data) (45%). 
During the procedure, the applicant identified 7 children that had participated in the natural history study 
190-901 before having been recruited into study 190-201. Excluding these patients from the comparative 
analyses did however not change the overall study results. In addition, the decline in ML score of these 
patients showed a clear favourable deflection during treatment compared to the previous untreated phase. 
With respect to results derived from the long-term extension study 202 (cut-off date 03 June 2016), the 
observed effect was stable, and seemed to be independent from baseline ML scale score at the start of the 
treatment. In comparison to untreated patients (updated Integrated summary of effectiveness; 1:1 
Matching), the primary responder analysis showed a statistically significantly higher proportion of responders 
with a decrease in the rate of disease progression (rate < 2/48 weeks) under active treatment (100%) as 
measured by the ML scale compared to untreated patients (historical data) (43%). 
With regards to MRI findings, the assessment of the anatomical parameters (MRI brain volumes) suggest a 
reduction of the rate of volume loss after 72-week treatment compared to untreated patients and therefore 
further support the stabilisation observed in motor and language function compared to untreated controls. 
However, as also confirmed by the ad hoc expert group, the value of the MRI measurements is not as 
relevant as the clinical outcomes. 
Scatter plots compared the change from 300 mg baseline ML scale score at week 49 with MRI changes at 
Week 49. Overall, the provided analysis showed no clear correlation between ML score and total cortical grey 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 81/95 
  
  
matter volume (r = 0.20), total white matter absolute volume (r = 0.27), total white matter percentage (r = 
-0.17), or whole brain ADC (r = 0.12). There was a modest correlation between ML score and absolute CSF 
fluid volume (r = 0.61), percent total cortical grey matter (r = -0.48) and whole brain volume (r=0.52). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dose selection was based on results from non-clinical studies and no specific dose finding studies were 
performed. Only one dose was studied and no dose adjustment is proposed according to age, severity of the 
condition or relative volume of the CSF/brain (brain atrophy). Although the proposed dose may not be 
optimal for the whole target population, it was found to be effective and is thus acceptable. 
Study 201 was a small single-arm open-label study which cannot generate evidence at the usually expected 
level with regard to potential bias and a confirmatory approach with control of type I error for the primary 
analysis. However, this is acceptable considering that CLN2 is a very rare paediatric disease, with fast 
debilitating progression until death and no available treatment options. The important evidence of efficacy 
comes from comparisons with a longitudinal untreated historical control group. The applicant has applied 
acceptable methods (most importantly the 1:1 matching) to account for potential bias and provided several 
sensitivity analyses that support the robustness of the findings. 
Three patients recruited into the study 201 showed a presumably atypical protracted progression course 
compared to that described for the classic form: these patients were 5.0-5.8 years old at disease onset, while 
usually first symptoms are noticed in the second or third year of life. One additional patient was enrolled 
during the pre-symptomatic phase of his condition. Two patients, 3 and 6 years old, entered the study with a 
baseline ML score of 6, which in principle corresponds to normal function. In these cases, disease was 
detected early because both had affected siblings.  
The applicant has addressed the concerns of bias that may arise from the inclusion of such patients with a 
potentially “milder” disease course. Most importantly, the relevant comparison between treated and 
untreated patients was based on a 1:1 matching for age and baseline disease scores. In this analysis, one 
treated patient could not be included due to the lack of a matching control. Further sensitivity analyses were 
provided (e.g. one to many matching, or excluding the two patients with a baseline score of 6) all of which 
supported the primary comparison. The 3 patients with first disease symptom onset ≥ 5 years of age, two 
with a baseline ML score of 3 and one with a baseline ML score of 6, had no change in the ML score at week 
72 compared to baseline. As these three patients only comprise 12.5 percent out of 24 patients, they have a 
limited impact on the overall positive results.  
Given the absence of a concurrent control arm, the effect of the treatment on the natural course of the 
disease in comparison to the untreated period before entering the study would have been of help. In this 
respect, data on 7 patients who participated in both study 901 and 201 are available and show a clear 
amelioration of disease progression with BMN190 treatment.  
No benefit was observed for the vision domain during the 48 week 300 mg period. There was even a small 
addition to the clinical decline when the vision domain was added to the ML score (-0.7 vs -0.4 points). 
Although vision deterioration is a relevant component of the disease, no specific examination (OCT, electro-
retinogram, visual evoked responses) was conducted as Brineura was not expected to reach therapeutic drug 
concentrations in the eye. However, more information with respect to potential effects on the vision domain 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 82/95 
  
  
 
is expected from study 203 that will include ophthalmic evaluation, including optical coherence tomography, 
and preclinical (animal) studies. 
Changes in MRI parameters and clinical response were not consistently in the same direction over the 48 
weeks of 300 mg stable treatment. However, this discrepancy in relation to data derived from natural history 
data (which suggest a good correlation between clinical disease severity and several MRI outcome 
parameters) may be potentially explained by not yet understood re-modelling effects of the treatment (e.g. 
debulking of lysosomal storage material in the early phase of treatment). Overall, for successfully treated 
patients, changes from baseline to endpoint are expected to be smaller than in untreated patients, as 
observed in the natural history study where all of the patients declined rapidly.  
Achievement of developmental milestones was assessed by the Denver II Development Scale. While 22 
patients showed no change in their overall interpretation of development, one subject was categorised as 
untestable at 201 study completion (week 48). Quality of life assessments showed only a small increase and 
can overall be interpreted as stabilisation. As in principle and confirmed by the patient representatives, QoL 
deteriorates with disease progression, a clear decline would have been expected in case of insufficient/lack of 
efficacy of Brineura. 
No quality of life measurements of untreated patients exist in CLN2 disease, neither from the natural history 
cohorts nor from the published literature. As also pointed out by the ad hoc expert group, study results with 
regard to quality of life were not surprising: as the treatment appears to largely halt the disease progression 
but is not curative, it is not expected that QoL measurements will relevantly improve compared to baseline. 
The experts considered this stabilisation as benefit compared to the considerable QoL deterioration regularly 
experienced with disease progression. 
An external control arm comprised by untreated patients from a cohort from Hamburg and a cohort from New 
York was intended to solve the main issue of lack of placebo/active comparator. These databases provided 
valuable information of reference although with several limitation. They were non concurrent, the information 
was partially retrospective and different patient information was gathered in each cohort so that only a 
restricted number of items reflect the data from the pooled cohort. The longitudinal analysis (progression of 
the condition) was based on the Hamburg cohort whereas cross-sectional information from the WCMC cohort 
was mainly considered for demographics and brain imaging analysis. Some differences between the two 
natural history cohorts have been observed with respect to demographic characteristics. WCMC Cohort 
included 38% of males vs 63% in Hamburg cohort, which is likely not relevant. Similarly, a relevant 
percentage of children from the Hamburg cohort were born before the year 2000. However, the applicant 
could show that improvements in standard of care did not affect the functional decline in patients recruited 
earlier vs later. The Applicant has justified the differences in the reported rate of decline between the 
Hamburg (-2.09) and the Verona cohort (-1.54). The difference in the density of the data between cohorts 
(at the Verona site, 5 of the 8 included patients had only two measurements) and the existing variability in 
the clinical phenotype may explain these variations. However, it is also possible that the expected decline per 
48 weeks could be more variable than that initially estimated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of study subjects (58%) have experienced hypersensitivity AEs (HAEs), 5 HAEs in 3 subjects 
were rated as grade 3. The most common manifestations of hypersensitivity were: pyrexia, vomiting, 
pleocytosis, or irritability. In addition, symptoms reported in the context of serious hypersensitivity AEs, 
infusion related reactions, or grade 3 hypersensitivity AEs included: nausea, tiredness, motor agitation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 83/95 
  
  
increased heart rate, leucocytosis, increase in CRP, increase in serum total IgE (but no drug specific IgE 
positivity), increased protein in CSF, increase in IL-6 in CSF. All hypersensitivity reactions were manageable 
(mainly with antihistamines, antipyretics and/or steroids) and did not lead to dose reduction or withdrawal 
from treatment.  
Seizures or epilepsy were reported in 22 (92%) of study subjects at screening. 23 (96%) subjects 
experienced 362 AEs that map to the Convulsions SMQ, the majority of convulsion AEs (>90%) were grade 1 
or 2 in severity. 6% of 362 overall convulsion events were considered related to treatment. A considerably 
increased rate of convulsion AEs was found to be temporally related to BMN 190 infusion (more than twice 
the overall average rate). In EEG examinations during study 201/202 new (focal and/or generalised) 
epileptiform activity was seen in 62.5% of subjects. 
Treatment with BMN 190 requires surgical implantation of an ICV reservoir and cannula leading to the lateral 
ventricle of the non-dominant hemisphere. Known risks associated with ICV devices (including device 
implantation) involve infections, intracerebral hemorrhage, device/CSF leakage, disconnection of ventricular 
catheter, catheter malpositioning, wound dehiscence, and seizures as well as risks associated with 
anaesthesia.  
In studies 201/202, 30 device-related AEs occurred in 11 (46%) of subjects. In 2 subjects, a total of 3 
serious cases of device infection and 1 serious event of device malfunction due to incorrect positioning 
occurred, each requiring explantation of the device. Other device related AEs were rated grade 1 events. The 
needle issue, device leakage, CSF pleocytosis, device malfunction and Propionibacterium infection, were 
reported more than once. 7 of 12 incomplete BMN 190 infusions were attributable to device related AEs.  
In addition, 1 SAE of intracranial haemorrhage (without significant mass effect) was attributed to the 
implantation of the device. 
CSF pleocytosis occurred in 75% of subjects, in 4 (17%) subjects, CSF pleocytosis occurred after device 
implantation prior to first infusion. CSF pleocytosis could be an isolated finding which was often mild, 
however, in some subjects, higher CSF cell counts (up to 4646.6/μL) were also reported during treatment 
with BMN 190 without associated AEs reported. In 8 (33%) subjects CSF pleocytosis was persistent with > 
20% of their follow-up labs also demonstrating CSF pleocytosis. Predominantly more pronounced CSF 
pleocytosis occurred also in association with hypersensitivity, fever and device-related infection. 
Immunogenicity evaluations revealed positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in serum in 19 (79%) and in CSF in 
6 (25%) subjects. ADA response in serum was sustained in approx. 2/3, in CSF in approx. 1/3 of subjects. 
Incidence or severity of hypersensitivity AEs appeared not to be associated with serum ADA titres. Anti-BMN 
190 neutralizing antibody (NAb) was not detected in the CSF in any treated subject so far. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
General uncertainties regarding the unfavourable effects result from the limited clinical safety data base (24 
subjects exposed for a median time of 95.1 weeks, maximum 141 weeks in studies 201/202), the fact that 
clinical studies were uncontrolled, and that several AEs may have multiple causes, e.g. can be related to the 
drug, device, including device implantation, ICV infusion, underlying disease and/or concomitant medication. 
Furthermore, BMN 190 is a first in class compound and the preclinical safety data package is very limited with 
restricted transferability to human patients.  
So far, no anaphylactic reactions have been identified. However, the occurrence of more severe 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions can currently not be excluded. The overall study 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 84/95 
  
  
results regarding risk of hypersensitivity appear to be also valid in subjects without residual TPP1 protein.  It 
can further not be excluded that the risk of hypersensitivity is increased in subjects with advanced CLN2 
disease, as disturbance of the blood brain barrier, which is commonly described in advanced 
neurodegenerative disease, might occur in these patients and would be anticipated to be associated with 
higher plasma exposure of BMN 190. 
Up to now, no cases of hydrocephalus or septic/aseptic meningitis have been reported in studies 201/202. 
However, ICV treatment has been associated with these risks (e.g. via intraventricular haemorrhage, device 
infection). As ventricular shunts which bypass CSF to the body system (e.g. ventriculo-peritoneal shunts) are 
presumed to reduce exposure to BMN 190 in the CSF and in the targeted brain areas while increasing the 
systemic exposure to BMN 190, which may reduce efficacy and increase hypersensitivity risk at the same 
time, treatment with BMN 190 has been contraindicated in subjects with these shunts.  
A possible causal relationship of temporally related AEs like headache, vomiting and seizures, respectively 
with a possible transient increase in intracranial pressure due to the total infusion volume cannot be fully 
excluded.  
The reason for the high incidence of low CSF protein (71%) remains unclear.  
Whereas in non-clinical studies increased troponin I was found in dogs after intrathecal BMN 190 application, 
cardiotoxicity has not been particularly addressed in clinical studies. From the presented ECG evaluations, no 
clear patterns suggesting myocardial damage are seen, however, cardiac findings of studies 201/202 
included possible left-ventricular hypertrophy and related bradycardia during infusion. The potential risk of 
cardiotoxicity of Brineura will be further evaluated post-marketing. 
No clinical data is available in patients below 2 as well as in subjects with advanced CLN2 disease and limited 
experience is available in subjects above 8 years of age. Long-term safety data for ICV BMN 190 treatment is 
limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CLN2 disease is a rare, debilitating, fast progressing and invariably deadly lysosomal storage disease caused 
by mutated or absent TPP1 enzyme. Currently no disease-modifying treatment is available. Therefore, a high 
medical need exists that can, at least partially, be addressed by enzyme replacement therapy with Brineura. 
This treatment is expected to slow or even halt the psychomotor decline caused by loss of brain tissue of 
affected children but not necessarily to restore functions. Therefore, early treatment initiation is considered 
important. 
The mechanism of action of cerliponase alfa in the treatment of CNL2 disease is clear and undisputed and has 
been confirmed in two animal CLN2 disease models. In the human study 201, treatment with Brineura 
demonstrated statistically significant (p = 0.0002) and clinically relevant effects for the primary outcome 
measure of the pivotal study 201: 20 of 23 (87%) patients responded as they did not have a 2-point decline 
on the adapted motor-language scale (ML scale) at week 48 of treatment.  
The clinical relevance of a two-point decline in the ML scale was accepted by the ad hoc expert group as a 
mean decline of 2 points per year is the expected deterioration rate in CLN2 patients. Already a 1-point 
decline can be considered clinically relevant as it reflects the loss of a developmental milestone in the 
respective domain.  
Outcomes of treated patients in study 201 and from the long-term extension study 202 were also compared 
with the outcomes of the untreated patients in the evaluable population of the study 901 supplemental 
report. The primary responder analysis showed a relevant and statistically significantly higher proportion of 
responders with a decrease in the rate of disease progression (rate < 2-point decline/48 weeks) under active 
treatment (91%) as measured by the ML scale compared to untreated patients (study 901) (45%).  
Overall, BMN 190 treatment demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect over 48 weeks of stable treatment 
on disease progression as measured by response rate and rate of decline in the ML CLN2 score. The trend 
observed for the majority of treated subjects is overall stability of ML scores. On the other hand, no 
improvement from baseline was observed on vision, seizures, MRI parameters and QoL. However, during the 
ad hoc expert meeting, it was emphasized that the motor and language aspects of the disease are the most 
important ones in the daily life of the children and their families. Moreover, the treatment with Brineura 
cannot be expected to regain brain tissue and lost functions, and therefore no improvement of MRI 
parameters, developmental scores or QoL should be anticipated. Stabilisation could already be considered a 
major success. Therefore, the lack of clear effects on these parameters does not invalidate the positive 
clinical results found in comparison to untreated patients from the natural history group.   
The clinical safety data base for Brineura is still limited, owing to the small target population in this rare 
disorder, restricted time of exposure, uncontrolled study design, difficulties in interpretability of AE causality 
as well as the limited informational value of the pre-clinical study program regarding safety. As of data cut-
off (03 Jun 2016) only 1 out of 24 subjects withdrew from studies 201/202 and AEs were not given as direct 
reason for withdrawal in this case.  
A clinical study without lower age limit is currently ongoing (203) and two subjects aged 2 years included in 
this study appeared to tolerate BMN 190 treatment well.  
As of now, no clinical data is available in patients below 2 years of age. However, the applicant has provided 
a rationale for an efficacious and safe dose of BMN 190 for children below 2 years of age, based on reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/312226/2017 
Page 89/95 
  
  
dose scaled by brain mass. Further argumentation referring to total CSF volume and turnover rate has been 
presented by the applicant which supports a low risk of increased intracranial pressure due to the proposed 
infusion volume. In addition, as a precautionary measure slowing/interruption of BMN 190 infusion is 
recommended in the SmPC in case symptoms occur which are interpreted as indicative of increased 
intracranial pressure by the treating physician. There is further clear indication that earliest possible 
treatment with BMN 190 in confirmed CLN2 may provide a maximum benefit. Accordingly, the consulted 
experts were unanimous in their opinion that pre-symptomatic children should be eligible for treatment 
without age restriction. Based on these considerations, the proposed posology is currently regarded 
sufficiently justified and expected to provide a positive benefit/risk balance of Brineura also in children below 
2 years. However, further post marketing data collection is mandatory in order to substantiate or optimize 
the dose in the youngest age group. The applicant has therefore committed to include at least 5 subjects < 2 
years in study 203.   
Adequate information has been included in the SmPC that limited clinical data is available in patients above 8 
years, that no clinical data is available in subjects with advanced CLN2 disease (including the fact, that it can 
currently not be excluded that the hypersensitivity risk may be increased in these patients), and that regular 
assessment during long-term treatment is recommended, whether the benefit is considered to outweigh 
adverse effects and potential harms in individual patients.    
As an obligation to the approval under exceptional circumstances, the safety concerns regarding 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxia, immunogenicity, hydrocephalus, meningitis, cardiotoxicity as well as general 
uncertainties regarding safety resulting from the small safety population, limited time of exposure and 
uncertainties regarding posology in children below 2 years of age will be addressed by post-marketing data 
collection as well as by continuation of ongoing clinical studies 202 and 203. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R balance for Brineura in the treatment of CLN2 disease is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Although the data base is limited, the safety profile resulting from studies 201/202 did not unveil 
unacceptable safety concerns which would preclude authorisation of Brineura. Given the rarity as well as the 
rapidly progressive and invariably fatal character of CLN2 disease and the absence of disease specific 
treatment options, the uncontrolled and limited data base is considered sufficient in order to grant approval 
under exceptional circumstances, subject to the conditions:  
- 
that the ongoing study 203 (scheduled study population: subjects from birth to less than 18 years of 
age; not less than 10 patients; proposed completion date: July 2020) will be completed and resulting 
data will be reported regularly. The 203 study will include at least 5 subjects < 2 years. 
- 
That further data collection and analysis will be performed post-marketing by conducting a registry-
based PASS in order to address the safety concerns regarding hypersensitivity/anaphylaxia, 
immunogenicity, hydrocephalus, meningitis, cardiotoxicity as well as general uncertainties regarding 
safety resulting from the small safety population, limited time of exposure and uncertainties 
regarding posology in children below 2 years of age.

Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission.  
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brineura is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority that the 
risk-benefit balance of Brineura is favourable in the following indication: 
“Brineura is indicated for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, also known 
as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of BRINEURA in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational materials, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where BRINEURA is marketed, all HCPs who are expected to handle / 
administer the product are provided with an educational programme (i.e. a dosing and administration guide), 
aiming  at  preventing  and/or  minimising 
the 
important 
identified 
risk  of  Device 
issues 
(infection/blockage/dislocation), containing information about: 
- How to store BRINEURA; 
- The device-related complications (i.e. infections, device’s leakage and/or failure; the integrity of the device 
should be confirmed by a neurosurgeon); 
 - How to prepare BRINEURA and the flushing solution; 
- A detailed step-by step description of BRINEURA intra-cerebro-ventricular infusion and the administration of 
the flushing solution (provided after BRINEURA infusion is complete) 
- How to monitor the patients receiving BRINEURA. 
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the  marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances 
This being an approval under exceptional circumstances and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS): Study 190-501. In order 
to evaluate the long-term safety of cerliponase alfa, including the occurrence of 
serious hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, the MAH should submit the 
results of a study based on adequate source of data deriving from a registry of 
patients with neuronal ceroid lipfuscinosis Type 2 (CLN2).

Divergent position 
The undersigned member(s) of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of cerliponase alfa indicated for the treatment of neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency. 
The reason for the divergent opinion was as follows: 
As the submitted studies do not clearly demonstrated an increased degradation of ceroid lipofuscin (i.e. no 
increase in degradation products or a clear indisputable decrease in the brain volume due to the decrease in 
accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin is observed) it cannot be concluded that, using the studied dosing 
regimens, cerliponase alfa has a pharmacological effect in men. Given the absence of a clear 
pharmacodynamic effect the positive findings in the motor and language scale cannot be directly related to 
the treatment. The effect of cerliponase alfa on quality-of-life is considered an important aspect for patients 
and parents/caretakers and is unclear. Cerliponase alfa does not show any effect on epileptic insults 
(myoclonic epilepsy due to the disease) or on the development of blindness. The appearance of pleocytosis, 
irritability as well as the new focal and generalised epileptiform activity during treatment with cerliponase 
alfa are of major concern. The procedural burden (e.g. invasive surgery, biweekly infusions) is associated 
with further severe safety concerns (among others epileptic insults). Finally, the consequences of the 
administration of cerliponase alfa in the long-term, in terms of safety and efficacy, are unknown as the 
duration of exposure is limited. Therefore the results are difficult to translate into a clinical meaningful 
benefit for the patient/caregiver. Optimal dose selection is questioned because it was only based on findings 
from nonclinical studies.  No data is available in patients in the lower age ranges and the risks associated 
with cerliponase alfa treatment are considered especially high in the very young patient population. Based 
on the uncertain benefit for the patient/parents/caregiver and the evident risks associated with treatment, 
the benefit risk balance of cerliponase alfa is considered negative.

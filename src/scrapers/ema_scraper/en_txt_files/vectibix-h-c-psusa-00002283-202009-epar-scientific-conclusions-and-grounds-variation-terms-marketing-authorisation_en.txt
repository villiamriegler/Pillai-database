Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for panitumumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on medication errors, the PRAC concluded that the product information of 
products containing panitumumab should be amended accordingly.  
The text regarding the handling of panitumumab should be amended to include information regarding 
the filter, as already included in Section 4.2, ‘Method of administration’ of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for panitumumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing panitumumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

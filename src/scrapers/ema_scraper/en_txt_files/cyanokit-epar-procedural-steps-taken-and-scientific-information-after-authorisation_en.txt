Oxalate crystals have been observed in the urine of healthy 
add a warning on renal disorders and to update the 
safety information on skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, renal and urinary disorders following a 
safety signal on renal disorders and based on a safety 
review including review of clinical data, preclinical 
data, literature and cumulative review of renal 
disorders cases occurring after hydroxocobalamin 
administration. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly.

volunteers given hydroxocobalamin. Cases of acute renal 
failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment and 
urine calcium oxalate crystals present have been reported in 
patients treated with hydroxocobalamin following known or 
suspected cyanide poisoning. In some situations, 
hemodialysis was required to achieve recovery. Therefore, as 
a precaution, after Cyanokit administration, regular 
monitoring of renal function (including blood urea nitrogen 
and serum creatinine) should be performed until 7 days after 
drug onset. 
Most patients will experience a reversible red colouration of 
the skin and mucous membranes that can last up to 15 days 
after administration of Cyanokit. 
Chromaturia is also an undesirable effect observed following 
treatment with Cyanokit. All patients will show a dark red 
colouration of the urine quite marked during the first three 
days following administration. Urine colouration may last up 
to 35 days after administration of Cyanokit.

Cyanokit, only limited data were available to evaluate the 
embryo-fetotoxic potential of hydroxocobalamin. The 
applicant agreed to perform new studies in line with current 
guidelines and these studies showed that hydroxocobalamin 
administered daily throughout organogenesis was 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits.  
The product information and the Risk Management Plan have 
been amended to reflect this information. 
Overall, the benefit-risk ratio of Cyanokit is still positive, and 
considering the potentially life-threatening situations in 
which hydroxocobalamin can be administered the updating 
of the SCP and package leaflet is sufficient as risk 
minimization measure. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered 
that a follow-up of any exposed pregnancies is needed. The 
routine pharmacovigilance activities now include the sending 
to the reporting physicians of 2 follow-up pregnancy forms, 
one sent after initial report and one after the expected date

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Xenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is 
considered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial 
treatment of CAP or when these have failed (see section 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dosage of Xenleta is described in Table 1. 
Patients may be treated throughout with oral lefamulin according to their clinical condition. Patients 
who commence treatment by the intravenous route (see the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
Xenleta solution for infusion) may be switched to the oral tablets when clinically indicated. 
Table 1: Dosage of Xenleta 
Dosage 
Oral lefamulin only: 
600 mg Xenleta tablet orally every 12 hours 
Intravenous lefamulin with option to switch to oral lefamulin: 
150 mg of Xenleta every 12 hours by intravenous infusion over 60 
minutes with option to switch to 600 mg Xenleta tablet orally every 12 
hours 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Treatment duration

Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in renally impaired patients, including those receiving haemodialysis 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lefamulin in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Xenleta should be taken on an empty stomach. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to any other members of the pleuromutilin class. 
Coadministration with moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampicin) 
or with strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.gclarithromycin, itraconazole, ritonavir) (see section 4.5). 
Coadministration with CYP3A substrates (e.g. antipsychotics, erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants) 
that prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). 
Coadministration with medicinal products that prolong the QT interval such as Class IA (e.g. 
quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products (see 
section 4.5). 
Known QT prolongation. 
Electrolyte disturbances, particularly uncorrected hypokalemia. 
Clinically relevant bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or history of symptomatic 
ventricular arrhythmias. 
Coadministration with sensitive CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide) (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Prolongation of QTc interval and potential QTc-interval prolongation-related clinical conditions 
Changes in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed in non-clinical and clinical studies with 
lefamulin. In clinical trials in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the mean change in QTcF 
from baseline to Day 3 to 4 was 11.4 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec and >60msec 
were seen in 17.9% and in 1.7% of patients, respectively, and were more frequent following 
intravenous lefamulin dosing compared to oral dosing. 
Lefamulin should be used with caution in patients with renal failure who require dialysis because 
metabolic disturbances associated with renal failure may lead to QT prolongation. 
Lefamulin should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe cirrhosis because 
metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation.

Clostridioides (formerly known as Clostridium) difficile- associated diarrhoea 
C. difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with lefamulin and may range in severity 
from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with 
diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of lefamulin (see section 4.8). Careful medical 
history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration 
of antibacterial medicinal products. 
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial medicinal product use not directed against 
C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate supportive measures together with the 
administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. 
Non-susceptible microorganisms 
Prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms which may require 
interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. 
Effects on hepatic transaminases 
Monitoring of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST) is recommended during treatment, especially in 
patients whose transaminases are elevated at baseline (see section 4.8). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment have 
reduced lefamulin protein binding compared to healthy subjects or subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 
Class A) hepatic impairment. Treatment should be initiated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment only after a careful benefit/risk evaluation, due to possible adverse reactions related to 
higher free concentrations of lefamulin, including prolongation of the QTcF interval. Patients should 
be monitored closely during treatment. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- 
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Co-administration of lefamulin with other medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other products on lefamulin 
Use with moderate and strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin, St John´s wort 
[Hypericum perforatum], carbamazepine, phenytoin, bosentan, efavirenz, primidone) could 
significantly decrease lefamulin plasma concentration and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of 
lefamulin. Co-administration of such medicinal products with lefamulin is contraindicated (see section 
4.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors 
Medicinal products that are strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, diltiazem, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, ritonavir-containing regimens, voriconazole) 
may alter absorption of lefamulin and therefore increase lefamulin plasma concentrations. Co- 
administration of such medicinal products or grapefruit juice with lefamulin is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Potential for lefamulin to affect other medicinal products 
Lefamulin is a moderate CYP3A inhibitor but has no induction potential. 
Co-administration of oral lefamulin with agents metabolised by CYP3A such as alprazolam, alfentanil, 
ibrutinib, lovastatin, simvastatin, , triazolam, vardenafil, and verapamil may result in increased plasma 
concentrations of these medicinal products. See Table 2. 
Co-administration of lefamulin with agents metabolised by CYP2C8 (e.g. repaglinide) may result in 
increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Co-administration with sensitive 
substrates of CYP2C8 is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and Table 2). 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study, no clinically relevant interaction was observed when 
lefamulin was co-administered with the P-gp substrate digoxin. Clinical drug interaction studies with 
lefamulin and substrates of other transporters have not been performed. In vitro studies indicated that 
lefamulin acts as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT1 and MATE1 transporters. 
Therefore, caution is recommended when co-administering lefamulin with sensitive substrates of these 
transporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. 
Table 2 summarises effects on plasma concentrations of lefamulin and on co-administered medicinal 
products expressed as least-square mean ratios (90% confidence interval). The direction of the arrow 
indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax and AUC), where ↑ indicates an increase 
more than 25%, ↓ indicates a decrease more than 25%, and ↔ indicates no change (equal to or less 
than 25% decrease or increase). The table below is not all inclusive.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Xenleta. 
Women taking oral contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of lefamulin in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown increased incidence of stillbirth (see section 5.3). 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development (see section 5.3). 
Xenleta is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lefamulin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of lefamulin/metabolites in milk (see 
section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

Lefamulin caused no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Xenleta has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are diarrhoea (7%), nausea (4%), vomiting (2%), 
hepatic enzyme elevation (2%), headache (1%), hypokalaemia (1%), and insomnia (1%). 
Gastrointestinal disorders were predominantly associated with the oral formulation of lefamulin and 
led to treatment discontinuation in <1%. 
The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction is atrial fibrillation (<1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Based on pooled data from Phase 3 trials for both intravenous and oral formulations, the following 
adverse reactions have been identified with lefamulin. Adverse reactions are classified according to 
System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

ULN occurred in 4% and 1% of Xenleta patients compared with 2% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. 
Those affected were asymptomatic with reversible clinical laboratory findings that typically peaked 
within the first week of Xenleta dosing. No Xenleta patient met Hy’s Law criteria. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest single doses of lefamulin administered in clinical trials were 750 mg oral in healthy 
subjects which were not associated with any serious adverse reactions. The QT interval may increase 
with increasing exposure to lefamulin. Treatment of overdose with lefamulin should consist of 
observation and general support measures. Haemodialysis will not significantly remove lefamulin 
from the systemic circulation. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, pleuromutilins, ATC code: J01XX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibacterial agent. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting 
with the A- and P- sites of the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) in the central part of domain V of the 
23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing correct positioning of the tRNA. 
Resistance 
Resistance to lefamulin in normally susceptible species may be due to mechanisms that include 
specific protection or modification of the ribosomal target by ABC-F proteins such as vga (A, B, E), 
Cfr methyl transferase, or by mutations of ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 or in domain V of 23S rRNA. 
Cfr generally confers cross-resistance with oxazolidinones, lincosamides, phenicols and group A 
streptogramins. ABC-F proteins can confer cross-resistance with lincosamides and group A 
streptogramins. 
Organisms resistant to other pleuromutilin class antibacterial agents are generally cross-resistant to 
lefamulin. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The activity of lefamulin is not affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to beta-lactams, 
macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, folate-pathway inhibitors, mupirocin and glycopeptides. 
Inherent resistance to lefamulin occurs in Enterobacterales (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) and non- 
fermenting Gram-negative aerobes (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). 
Antibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents 
In vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between lefamulin and amikacin, azithromycin, 
aztreonam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, tigecycline, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. 
Susceptibility testing interpretive criteria 
The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommended interpretive criteria are: 
Organism 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/L) 
Susceptible (≤S) 
0.5 
0.25 
Resistant (>R) 
0.5 
0.25 
PK/PD relationship 
The antimicrobial activity of lefamulin against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus correlated best with the 
ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of free drug over 24 hours to the minimum 
inhibitory concentration (24-h AUC/MIC ratio). 
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against pathogens susceptible to lefamulin in vitro 
listed under each indication: 
Community-acquired Pneumonia 
•  Gram-positive bacteria: 
- 
- 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
•  Gram-negative bacteria: 
-  Haemophilus influenzae 
-  Legionella pneumophila 
•  Other bacteria: 
-  Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
-  Chlamydophila pneumoniae 
Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the 
approved indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to lefamulin in 
the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance: 
•  Gram-negative bacteria: 
-  Haemophilus parainfluenzae 
-  Moraxella catarrhalis 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xenleta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in community-acquired pneumonia (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Information from clinical trials 
In a post-hoc, subgroup analysis from two Phase 3 trials in patients with community-acquired 
pneumonia, the clinical cure rates at a post-treatment visit in patients with any of a positive sputum 
culture, positive blood culture or positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae were lower for 
patients treated with lefamulin compared to patients treated with moxifloxacin. When treatment 
commenced by the intravenous route the cure rates were 28/36 [77.8%; (95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) 60.8% to 89.9%)] for lefamulin vs. 26/31 [83.9%; (95% CI 66.3% to 94.6%)] for moxifloxacin. 
When treatment commenced by the oral route, the cure rates were 19/25 (76%; 95% CI 55.9% to 
90.6%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%; 95% CI 79.2% to 99.2%), respectively. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration of an immediate-release 600 mg tablet formulation, oral bioavailability of 
lefamulin under fasted conditions was 25.8%. Exposure on Day 1 (AUC0-12h) was equivalent to the 
exposure obtained with lefamulin 150 mg administered intravenously. 
The concomitant administration of a high-fat, high calorie breakfast with a single oral dose of 600 mg 
lefamulin (immediate release tablet) resulted in a slightly reduced absolute bioavailability (21.0%). 
Distribution 
Lefamulin is moderate to highly bound to plasma proteins (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein > human serum 
albumin) within a range of 88-97% at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, 83-94% at 3 µg/mL, and 73-86% 
at 10 µg/mL (depending on assay), demonstrating saturable, non-linear binding between 1-10 µg/mL. 
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 2.5 L/kg. Rapid tissue distribution of 
lefamulin into skin and soft tissues was demonstrated using microdialysis, and into the epithelial lining 
fluid (ELF) using bronchoalveolar lavage. 
Biotransformation 
In plasma, between 24 and 42% of lefamulin is metabolised primarily by CYP3A phase I reactions, 
leading mainly to hydroxylated metabolites devoid of antibacterial properties, most notably the main 
metabolite BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy lefamulin). BC-8041 is the only metabolite in plasma accounting for 
>10% (13.6% to 17.3%) of total drug related material after oral dosing while no metabolites exceeded 
10% (≤6.7%) after intravenous dosing. 
Elimination 
Elimination was multiphasic and the terminal t1/2 ranged between 9-10 h after a single oral or 
intravenous administration. Overall, lefamulin was primarily eliminated via the non-renal route. 
Between 9.6%-14.1% of an intravenous dose of lefamulin was excreted as unchanged drug in the 
urine. The total body clearance and the renal clearance following 150 mg intravenous infusion were 
approximately 20 L/h and 1.6 L/h, respectively. 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin were observed based on 
gender, race, or weight. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
In CAP patients there was a trend of increasing lefamulin exposure with increasing age, with a~50% 
increase in AUC0-24 at steady-state in patients aged ≥85 years compared to patients aged <65 years. 
Renal impairment 
A study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration 
of 150 mg in 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and 7 matched healthy control subjects. Another 
8 subjects requiring haemodialysis received 150 mg lefamulin intravenously immediately before 
dialysis (on-dialysis) and on a non-dialysis day (off-dialysis). The AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin 
and its main metabolite were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched 
healthy subjects, and in subjects requiring haemodialysis whether on- or off-dialysis. Lefamulin and 
its main metabolite were not dialyzable. Renal impairment did not impact lefamulin elimination. 
Hepatic impairment 
A study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration 
of 150 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), 8 subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), and 11 matched healthy control subjects. No 
clinically meaningful changes in the total AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin and its main metabolite 
were observed between subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and matched healthy 
control subjects. Hepatic impairment did not meaningfully impact lefamulin elimination. Plasma 
protein binding decreased with increased impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
In rats, there were no effects on male or female fertility that were considered related to lefamulin. 
Lefamulin/metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Maximal concentrations of 
radioactivity in plasma and milk were 3.29 and 10.7 µg equivalents/g, respectively, following a single 
dose of 30 mg/kg radio-labelled lefamulin. Lefamulin/metabolites crossed the placenta in pregnant 
rats. In the plasma of suckling rat pups, lefamulin exposure was demonstrated in only 1 of 3 litters of 
treated dams in each of the mid and high dose groups on post-natal day 4. No test item was quantified 
in pup’s plasma on post-natal day 20. 
Adverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with 
possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In the rat embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-17) there were 
1, 0, 2, and 1 malformed foetuses in control, low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. Findings 
included malformations (cleft palate, short lower jaw, vertebral and rib malformations, and a cyst in 
the neck region) at the mid and high doses, but the relationship to treatment is considered equivocal. 
Decreased or no ossification in a number of skeletal elements in all treated groups may indicate 
treatment-related developmental delay at all doses evaluated. 
In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-18), low 
numbers of live foetuses in utero in treated groups limited the interpretation of the study. Additional 
findings in the high dose group included decreased foetal weight and decreased or no ossification of 
skeletal elements, which may be indicative of developmental delay. 
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats the pup live birth index was reduced (87.4%) in 
the high dose group. In the absence of related findings at the same dose level in the rat embryo-foetal 
development study, stillbirth was considered to be a late stage pregnancy or delivery effect. 
Evidence of dose-dependent regenerative anaemia in both species indicated lefamulin was potentially 
haemolytic at concentrations that are higher than the concentration of the infusion solution which will 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be used clinically. This effect was not apparent from an in vitro evaluation of blood compatibility 
using human blood at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Prolongation of QTc interval and potential QTc-interval prolongation-related clinical conditions 
Changes in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed in nonclinical and clinical studies with 
lefamulin. In clinical trials in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the mean change in QTcF 
from baseline to Day 3 to 4 was 11.4 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec and >60msec 
were seen in 17.9% and in 1.7% of patients, respectively, and were more frequent following 
intravenous lefamulin dosing compared to oral dosing. 
The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of lefamulin or 
increasing the rate of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore, the recommended dose and 
infusion rate should not be exceeded. 
Lefamulin should be used with caution in patients with renal failure who require dialysis because 
metabolic disturbances associated with renal failure may lead to QT prolongation. 
Lefamulin should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe cirrhosis because 
metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. 
Clostridioides (formerly known as Clostridium) difficile- associated diarrhoea 
C. difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with lefamulin and may range in severity 
from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with 
diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of lefamulin (see section 4.8). Careful medical 
history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration 
of antibacterial medicinal products. 
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial medicinal product use not directed against 
C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate supportive measures together with the 
administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. 
Non-susceptible microorganisms 
Prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms which may require 
interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. 
Effects on hepatic transaminases 
Monitoring of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST) is recommended during treatment, especially in 
patients whose transaminases are elevated at baseline (see section 4.8). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment have 
reduced lefamulin protein binding compared to healthy subjects or subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 
Class A) hepatic impairment. Treatment should be initiated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment only after a careful benefit/risk evaluation, due to possible adverse reactions related to 
higher free concentrations of lefamulin, including prolongation of the QTcF interval. Patients should 
be monitored closely during treatment. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 1,055 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 52.75% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Co-administration with other medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other products on lefamulin 
Use with moderate and strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin, St John´s wort 
[Hypericum perforatum], carbamazepine, phenytoin, bosentan, efavirenz, primidone) could 
significantly decrease lefamulin plasma concentration and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of 
lefamulin. Co-administration of such medicinal products with lefamulin is contraindicated (see section 
4.3). 
Potential for lefamulin to affect other medicinal products 
Co-administration of lefamulin with sensitive CYP2C8 substrates such as repaglinide may result in 
increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Co-administration with sensitive 
substrates of CYP2C8 is contraindicated (See section 4.3 and Table 2). 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study, no clinically relevant interaction was observed when 
lefamulin was co-administered with the P-gp substrate digoxin. Clinical drug interaction studies with 
lefamulin and substrates of other transporters have not been performed. In vitro studies indicated that 
lefamulin acts as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT2 and MATE1 transporters. 
Therefore, caution is recommended when co-administering lefamulin with sensitive substrates of these 
transporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. 
Table 2 summarises effects on plasma concentrations of lefamulin and on co-administered medicinal 
products expressed as least-square mean ratios (90% confidence interval). The direction of the arrow 
indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax and AUC), where ↑ indicates an increase 
more than 25%, ↓ indicates a decrease more than 25%, and ↔ indicates no change (equal to or less 
than 25% decrease or increase).The table below is not all inclusive.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Xenleta. 
Women taking oral contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of lefamulin in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown increased incidence of stillbirth (see section 5.3). 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development (see section 5.3). 
Xenleta is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lefamulin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of lefamulin/metabolites in milk (see 
section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Xenleta. 
Fertility 
The effects of lefamulin on fertility in humans have not been studied.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are administration site reactions (7%), diarrhoea (7%), 
nausea (4%), vomiting (2%), hepatic enzyme elevation (2%), headache (1%), hypokalaemia (1%), and 
insomnia (1%). 
Administration site reactions apply to intravenous administration and led to treatment discontinuation 
in <1%. Gastrointestinal disorders were predominantly associated with the oral formulation of lefamulin 
and led to treatment discontinuation in <1%. 
The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction is atrial fibrillation (<1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Based on pooled data from Phase 3 trials for both intravenous and oral formulations, the following 
adverse reactions have been identified with lefamulin. Adverse reactions are classified according to 
System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

5% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. Post-baseline aspartate aminotransferase values >3x and >5x 
ULN occurred in 4% and 1% of Xenleta patients compared with 2% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. 
Those affected were asymptomatic with reversible clinical laboratory findings that typically peaked 
within the first week of Xenleta dosing. No Xenleta patient met Hy’s Law criteria. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest single doses of lefamulin administered in clinical trials were 400 mg intravenous in 
healthy subjects which were not associated with any serious adverse reactions. The QT interval may 
increase with increasing exposure to lefamulin. Treatment of overdose with lefamulin should consist 
of observation and general support measures. Haemodialysis will not significantly remove lefamulin 
from the systemic circulation. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, pleuromutilins, ATC code: J01XX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibacterial agent. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting 
with the A- and P- sites of the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) in the central part of domain V of the 
23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing correct positioning of the tRNA. 
Resistance 
Resistance to lefamulin in normally susceptible species may be due to mechanisms that include 
specific protection or modification of the ribosomal target by ABC-F proteins such as vga (A, B, E), 
Cfr methyl transferase, or by mutations of ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 or in domain V of 23S rRNA. 
Cfr generally confers cross-resistance with oxazolidinones, lincosamides, phenicols and group A 
streptogramins. ABC-F proteins can confer cross-resistance with lincosamides and group A 
streptogramins. 
Organisms resistant to other pleuromutilin class antibacterial agents are generally cross-resistant to 
lefamulin. 
The activity of lefamulin is not affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to beta-lactams, 
macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, folate-pathway inhibitors, mupirocin and glycopeptides. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inherent resistance to lefamulin occurs in Enterobacterales (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) and non- 
fermenting Gram-negative aerobes (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). 
Antibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents 
In vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between lefamulin and amikacin, azithromycin, 
aztreonam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, tigecycline, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin). 
Susceptibility testing interpretive criteria 
The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommended interpretive criteria are: 
Organism 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/L) 
Susceptible (≤S) 
0.5 
0.25 
Resistant (>R) 
0.5 
0.25 
PK/PD relationship 
The antimicrobial activity of lefamulin against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus correlated best with the 
ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of free drug over 24 hours to the minimum 
inhibitory concentration (24-h AUC/MIC ratio). 
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against pathogens susceptible to lefamulin in vitro 
listed under each indication: 
Community-acquired Pneumonia 
•  Gram-positive bacteria: 
- 
- 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
•  Gram-negative bacteria: 
-  Haemophilus influenzae 
-  Legionella pneumophila 
•  Other bacteria: 
-  Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
-  Chlamydophila pneumoniae 
Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the 
approved indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to lefamulin in 
the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance: 
•  Gram-negative bacteria: 
-  Haemophilus parainfluenzae 
-  Moraxella catarrhalis 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xenleta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in community-acquired pneumonia (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Information from clinical trials 
In a post-hoc, subgroup analysis from two Phase 3 trials in patients with community-acquired 
pneumonia, the clinical cure rates at a post-treatment visit in patients with any of a positive sputum 
culture, positive blood culture or positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae were lower for 
patients treated with lefamulin compared to patients treated with moxifloxacin. When treatment 
commenced by the intravenous route the cure rates were 28/36 [77.8%; (95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) 60.8% to 89.9%)] for lefamulin vs. 26/31 [83.9%; (95% CI 66.3% to 94.6%)] for moxifloxacin. 
When treatment commenced by the oral route, the cure rates were 19/25 (76%; 95% CI 55.9% to 
90.6%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%; 95% CI 79.2% to 99.2%), respectively. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Not applicable. 
Distribution 
Lefamulin is moderate to highly bound to plasma proteins (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein > human serum 
albumin) within a range of 88-97% at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, 83-94% at 3 µg/mL, and 73-86% at 
10 µg/mL (depending on assay), demonstrating saturable, non-linear binding. The steady-state volume 
of distribution (Vss) is approximately 2.5 L/kg. Rapid tissue distribution of lefamulin into skin and 
soft tissues was demonstrated using microdialysis, and into the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) using 
bronchoalveolar lavage. 
Biotransformation 
In plasma, between 24 and 42% of lefamulin is metabolised primarily by CYP3A phase I reactions, 
leading mainly to hydroxylated metabolites devoid of antibacterial properties, most notably the main 
metabolite BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy lefamulin). BC-8041 is the only metabolite in plasma accounting for 
>10% (13.6% to 17.3%) of total drug related material after oral dosing while no metabolites exceeded 
10% (≤6.7%) after intravenous dosing. 
Elimination 
Elimination was multiphasic and the terminal t1/2 ranged between 9-10 h after a single oral or 
intravenous administration. Overall, lefamulin was primarily eliminated via the non-renal route. 
Between 9.6%-14.1% of an intravenous dose of lefamulin was excreted as unchanged drug in the 
urine. The total body clearance and the renal clearance following 150 mg intravenous infusion were 
approximately 20 L/h and 1.6 L/h, respectively. 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin were observed based on 
gender, race or weight. 
Elderly 
In CAP patients there was a trend of increasing lefamulin exposure with increasing age, with a~50% 
increase in AUC0-24 at steady-state in patients aged ≥85 years compared to patients aged <65 years. 
Renal impairment 
A study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration 
of 150 mg in 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and 7 matched healthy control subjects. Another 
8 subjects requiring haemodialysis received 150 mg lefamulin intravenously immediately before 
dialysis (on-dialysis) and on a non-dialysis day (off-dialysis). The AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin 
and its main metabolite were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healthy subjects, and in subjects requiring haemodialysis whether on- or off-dialysis. Lefamulin and 
its main metabolite were not dialyzable. Renal impairment did not impact lefamulin elimination. 
Hepatic impairment 
A study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration 
of 150 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), 8 subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), and 11 matched healthy control subjects. No 
clinically meaningful changes in the total AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin and its main metabolite 
were observed between subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and matched healthy 
control subjects. Hepatic impairment did not meaningfully impact lefamulin elimination. Plasma 
protein binding decreased with increased impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
In rats, there were no effects on male or female fertility that were considered related to lefamulin. 
Lefamulin/metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Maximal concentrations of 
radioactivity in plasma and milk were 3.29 and 10.7 µg equivalents/g, respectively, following a single 
dose of 30 mg/kg radio-labelled lefamulin. Lefamulin/metabolites crossed the placenta in pregnant 
rats. In the plasma of suckling rat pups, lefamulin exposure was demonstrated in only 1 of 3 litters of 
treated dams in each of the mid and high dose groups on post-natal day 4. No test item was quantified 
in pup’s plasma on post-natal day 20. 
Adverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with 
possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In the rat embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-17), there were 
1, 0, 2, and 1 malformed foetuses in control, low, mid, and high dose groups. Findings included 
malformations (cleft palate, short lower jaw, vertebral and rib malformations, and a cyst in the neck 
region) at the mid and high doses, but the relationship to treatment is considered equivocal. Decreased 
or no ossification in a number of skeletal elements in all treated groups may indicate treatment-related 
developmental delay at all doses evaluated. 
In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-18), low 
numbers of live foetuses in utero in treated groups limited the interpretation of the study. Additional 
findings in the high dose group included decreased foetal weight and decreased or no ossification of 
skeletal elements, which may be indicative of developmental delay. 
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats the pup live birth index was reduced (87.4%) in 
the high dose group. In the absence of related findings at the same dose level in the rat embryo-foetal 
development study, stillbirth was considered to be a late stage pregnancy or delivery effect. 
Evidence of dose-dependent regenerative anaemia in both species indicated lefamulin was potentially 
haemolytic at concentrations that are ten times higher than the concentration of the infusion solution 
which will be used clinically. This effect was not apparent from an in vitro evaluation of blood 
compatibility using human blood at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Xenleta 600 mg film-coated tablets 
lefamulin 
This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Xenleta is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you take Xenleta 
3.  How to take Xenleta 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Xenleta 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xenleta is and what it is used for 
Xenleta is an antibiotic medicine containing the active substance lefamulin. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called ‘pleuromutilins’. 
Lefamulin works by killing certain bacteria which cause infections. 
Xenleta is used to treat adults who have bacterial infections in the lung, also known as pneumonia, 
when other treatments for pneumonia are not considered to be suitable. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Xenleta 
Do not take Xenleta 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class 
if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with Xenleta. This is because some 
medicines may stop Xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with Xenleta. See 
below under Other medicines and Xenleta for examples. 
if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart’s electrical activity seen with an 
ECG (see below under Other medicines and Xenleta). This is because lefamulin can cause a 
condition called QT interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart’s 
rhythm. 
if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) 
if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ECG finding called QT 
prolongation 
if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) 
if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Xenleta 
- 
- 
if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. 
if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease.) 
If any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before taking Xenleta. 
If you develop severe diarrhoea during or after taking Xenleta tablets, talk to your doctor because 
you may need to stop your medicine, or you may need to take another medicine to treat the diarrhoea. 
Antibiotics can lead to excessive growth of certain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the 
bowel and cause severe diarrhoea. 
If you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk 
to your doctor because you may need to stop taking Xenleta or other medicines. 
Other infections 
There is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or 
after treatment with Xenleta. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give 
you another treatment if necessary. 
Children and adolescents 
Xenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Xenleta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, as some of them could affect or be affected by Xenleta. The lists below provide only some 
examples of medicines that should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. 
Your doctor will a dvise you if lefamulin is suitable for you. 
You must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin: 
-  carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone (for epilepsy) 
-  efavirenz, ritonavir- (for HIV) 
-  St. John’s Wort, an herbal remedy (for depression or low mood) 
-  bosentan diltiazem, amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide (for angina, high blood 
pressure or heart rhythm disturbances) 
rifampicin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (for bacterial infections) 
fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (for fungal infections) 
- 
- 
-  ketoconazole (for Cushing’s disease) 
- 
-  nefazodone, amitryptylline or pimozide (for depression or other mental illness) 
repaglinide (for diabetes) 
Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of some medicines while you are taking lefamulin. These 
medicines include: 
*  alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam or other drugs called benzodiazepines (for anxiety) 
*  alfentanil (an opioid for pain) 
*  vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction)

*  verapamil (for high blood pressure) 
Xenleta with food and drink 
Xenleta should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. This is 
because food and some drinks can affect the way medicines work. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You must not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while on treatment with Xenleta as it might 
interact with Xenleta and increase side effects. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding 
Do not take Xenleta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Taking Xenleta will not influence the ability to drive or use machines. 
Xenleta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially, ‘sodium 
free’. 
3. 
How to take Xenleta 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one 600-mg Xenleta tablet taken every 12 hours for 5 days. The tablets 
should be swallowed whole with water. 
Xenleta tablets may also be taken after starting treatment with Xenleta infusion via an intravenous 
drip. The number of days you then need to take Xenleta tablets will depend on how many days you 
had treatment by a drip. 
Your doctor will tell you for how long you should take Xenleta. It is important that you complete the 
course. 
If you take more Xenleta than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to take Xenleta 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. You should continue with your course 
from the next scheduled dose. 
If you stop taking Xenleta 
Take the complete course of tablets prescribed by your doctor, even if you begin to feel better before 
you have finished them all. If you stop taking the tablets too soon, the infection may return, or your 
condition may get worse. 
Some bacteria may remain and become resistant to antibiotics if you do not complete the course or if 
you do not take your tablets at the right time. This can result in the infection returning or in the 
antibiotic not working if the infection returns. 
If you get a side effect that concerns you, tell a doctor immediately to get advice before taking the next 
dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xenleta is and what it is used for 
Xenleta is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance lefamulin. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called ‘pleuromutilins’. 
Lefamulin works by killing certain bacteria which cause infections. 
Xenleta is used to treat adults who have bacterial infections in the lung, also known as pneumonia, 
when other treatments for pneumonia are not considered to be suitable. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Xenleta 
You must not be given Xenleta 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class 
if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with Xenleta. This is because some 
medicines may stop Xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with Xenleta. See 
below under Other medicines and Xenleta for examples. 
if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart’s electrical activity seen with an 
ECG (see below under Other medicines and Xenleta). This is because lefamulin can cause a 
condition called QT interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart’s 
rhythm. 
if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) 
if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ECG finding called QT 
prolongation 
if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) 
if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Xenleta 
- 
- 
if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. 
if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease) 
If any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before you are given Xenleta. 
If you develop severe diarrhoea during or after being given Xenleta, tell your doctor immediately 
since it may be necessary to interrupt your treatment. Antibiotics can lead to excessive growth of 
certain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the bowel and cause severe diarrhoea. 
If you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk 
to your doctor because you may need to stop taking Xenleta or other medicines. 
Other infections 
There is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or 
after treatment with Xenleta. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give 
you another treatment if necessary. 
Children and adolescents 
Xenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Xenleta 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, as some of 
these could affect or be affected by Xenleta. The lists below provide only some examples of medicines 
that should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. Your doctor will a dvise 
you if lefamulin is suitable for you. 
You must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin:

Your doctor may decide to switch you from having Xenleta through a drip to taking Xenleta tablets to 
complete your treatment for a total (drip and tablet) of 7 days of treatment. 
If you are given more Xenleta than you should receive 
Xenleta will be given to you in hospital by a doctor or nurse. It is, therefore, unlikely you will be given 
too much. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are concerned that you may have been given too much 
Xenleta. 
If you miss a dose of Xenleta 
Xenleta will be given to you in hospital by a doctor or nurse. It is therefore unlikely you will miss a

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Reyataz 
atazanavir / atazanavir sulfate 
On 28 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Reyataz. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows2:  
“REYATAZ oral powder, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with 
other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients at 
least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg (see section 4.2). 
Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in 
patients with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations). There are very 
limited data available from children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The choice of REYATAZ in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on 
individual viral resistance testing and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
In addition, Reyataz will also be available as an oral powder. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
HBVAXPRO is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known
subtypes in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B
virus.
The specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official
recommendations.
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals from birth through 15 years of age: 1 dose (0.5 mL) at each injection:
Primary vaccination:
A course of vaccination should include at least three injections.
2
Two primary immunisation schedules can be recommended:
0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the first
administration.
0, 1, 2, 12 months: three injections with an interval of one month; a fourth dose should be administered at
12 months.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated. Infants receiving the
compressed regimen (0, 1, 2 months dosing schedule) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher
antibody titres.
Booster:
Immunocompetent vaccinees
The need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course
has not been established. However, some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation
for a booster dose and these should be respected.
Immunocompromised vaccinees (e.g. dialysis patients, transplant patients, AIDS Patients)
In vaccinees with an impaired immune system, administration of additional doses of vaccine should be
considered if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) is less than 10 IU/l.
Revaccination of nonresponders
When persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated, 15-25 % produce an
adequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 % after three additional doses. However,
because data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis B vaccine when additional doses in excess
of the recommended series are administered, revaccination following completion of the primary series is
not routinely recommended. Revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals, after weighing
the benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse
reactions.
Special dosage recommendations:
Dosage recommendation for neonates of mothers who are hepatitis B virus carriers
- 
- 
- 
At birth, one dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (within 24 hours).
The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of birth and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.
Subsequent  doses  of vaccine  should  be  given  according  to  the  locally  recommended  vaccination
schedule.
Dosage recommendation for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick with
contaminated needle)
- 
- 
- 
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).
The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.
Serologic testing is also recommended, with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine, if
necessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.
3
- 
In the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals, additional doses should be
given as in the recommended immunisation schedule. The accelerated schedule including the
12 month booster dose can be proposed.
Method of administration
This vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.
The anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection in neonates and infants. The deltoid muscle is the
preferred site for injection in children and adolescents.
Do not inject intravascularly.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or
bleeding disorders.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
- 
- 
History  of  hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance,  or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  or  trace  residuals
(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 6.2.
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of
the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case
of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).
This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate, which are used during the
manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).
Use caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the vial stopper contains dry natural latex
rubber that may cause allergic reactions.
For clinical or laboratory monitoring regarding immunocompromised individuals or individuals with
known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus, see section 4.2.
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be
considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born
≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity (see
section 4.8). As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be
withheld or delayed.
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to
be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. 
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis
E and other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
4
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).
Excipient(s) with known effect:
This medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be
essentially sodium free.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
This vaccine can be administered:
- 
- 
with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.
to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously
received another hepatitis B vaccine.
concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.
- 
The concomitant administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PREVENAR) given with hepatitis B
vaccine using the 0, 1 and 6 and 0, 1, 2 and 12 month schedules has not been sufficiently studied.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Fertility:
HBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.
Pregnancy:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on pregnant women.
The vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the
foetus. 
Breast-feeding:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However,
HBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
a. Summary of the safety profile
The most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine.
As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been
established.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01
The vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg).
Development of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or
greater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B
virus infection.
In clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a
previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of
antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (
schedules and concomitant vaccines, the proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies were
97.5 % and 97.2 % with geometric mean titres of 214 and 297 IU/l, respectively.
 10 IU/l). In two infant trials using different dosing
The protective efficacy of a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth followed by 3 doses of a previous
formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been demonstrated for neonates born to
mothers positive for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen
(HBeAg). Among 130 vaccinated infants, the estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis B
infection was 95 % as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls.
Although the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis
B vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk
subjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B
infection.
In addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen
(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous
formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The duration of the protective effect in healthy
vaccinees is unknown. The need for a booster dose of HBVAXPRO is not yet defined beyond the
12 month booster dose required for the 0, 1, 2 compressed schedule.
Reduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have
demonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of
hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been
recognised as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection
Slightly opaque white suspension.
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
HBVAXPRO is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known
subtypes in individuals 16 years of age or more considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus.
The specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official
recommendations.
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals 16 years of age or more: 1 dose (1 mL) at each injection.
Primary vaccination:
A course of vaccination should include at least three injections.
18
Two primary immunisation schedules can be recommended:
0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the first
administration.
0, 1, 2, 12 months: three injections with an interval of one month; a fourth dose should be administered at
12 months.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated. Those receiving the
compressed regimen (0, 1, 2 months dosing schedule) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher
antibody titres.
Booster: 
Immunocompetent vaccinees
The need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course
has not been established. However, some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation
for a booster dose and these should be respected.
Immunocompromised vaccinees (e.g. dialysis patients, transplant patients, AIDS Patients)
In vaccinees with an impaired immune system, administration of additional doses of vaccine should be
considered if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) is less than 10 IU/l.
Revaccination of nonresponders
When persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated, 15-25 % produce an
adequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 % after three additional doses. However,
because data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis B vaccine when additional doses in excess
of the recommended series are administered, revaccination following completion of the primary series is
not routinely recommended. Revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals, after weighing
the benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse
reactions.
Special dosage recommendations for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick
with contaminated needle):
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).
The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, but at a separate injection site.
Serologic  testing  is also recommended,  with  the  administration  of  subsequent  doses  of  vaccine,  if
necessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.
In  the  case  of  unvaccinated  or  incompletely  vaccinated  individuals,  additional  doses  should  be
given  as  in  the  recommended  immunisation  schedule.  The  accelerated  schedule  including  the
12 month booster dose can be proposed.
Individuals less than 16 years of age:
HBVAXPRO 10 micrograms is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. 
The appropriate strength for administration to individuals from birth through 15 years of age is
HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms.
19
Method of administration
This vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.
The deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection in adults and adolescents.
Do not inject intravascularly.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or
bleeding disorders.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
- 
- 
History  of  hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance,  or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  or  trace  residuals
(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 6.2.
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of
the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case
of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).
This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the
manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).
Use caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the vial stopper contains dry natural latex
rubber that may cause allergic reactions.
For clinical or laboratory monitoring regarding immunocompromised individuals or individuals with
known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus, see section 4.2.
A number of factors have been observed to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines. These
factors include older age, male gender, obesity, smoking, route of administration and some chronic
underlying diseases. Consideration should be given to serological testing of those subjects who may be at
risk of not achieving seroprotection following a complete course of HBVAXPRO. Additional doses may
need to be considered for persons who do not respond or have a sub-optimal response to a course of
vaccinations.
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to
be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. 
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis
E and other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).
Excipient(s) with known effect:
20
This medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be
essentially sodium free.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
This vaccine can be administered:
- 
- 
with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.
to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously
received another hepatitis B vaccine.
concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.
- 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Fertility:
HBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.
Pregnancy:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO in pregnant women
The vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the
foetus. 
Breast-feeding:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However,
HBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects
a. Summary of the safety profile
The most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine.
As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been
established.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01
The vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg).
Development of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or
greater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B
virus infection.
In clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a
previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of
antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (
adolescents and adults, 95.6-97.5 % of vaccinees developed a protective level of antibodies, with
geometric mean titres in these trials ranging from 535 – 793 IU/l.
 10 IU/l). In two trials conducted in older
Although the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis
B vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk
subjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B
infection.
In addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen
(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous
formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in healthy adults. The duration of the protective
effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown. The need for a booster dose of HBVAXPRO is not yet defined
beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0, 1, 2 compressed schedule.
Reduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have
demonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of
hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been
recognised as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
HBVAXPRO 40 micrograms, suspension for injection
Hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant DNA)
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One dose (1 mL) contains:
Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) * ................... 40 micrograms
Adsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.50 milligram Al+)
* produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain 2150-2-3) yeast by recombinant DNA technology.
This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the
manufacturing process. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8.
Excipient(s) with known effect:
Sodium less than 1mmol (23 mg) per dose.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection
Slightly opaque white suspension.
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
HBVAXPRO is indicated for the active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all
known subtypes in predialysis and dialysis adult patients.
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Predialysis and dialysis adult patients: 1 dose (1 mL) at each injection.
Primary vaccination:
A course of vaccination should include three injections:
Schedule 0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the
first administration.
34
Booster:
A booster dose must be considered in these vaccinees if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface
antigen (anti-HBsAg) after primary series is less than 10 IU/l.
In accordance with standard medical practice for hepatitis B vaccine administration, regular antibody
testing should be done in hemodialysis patients. A booster dose should be given when antibody levels
decline below 10 IU/l.
Special dosage recommendations for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick
with contaminated needle):
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).
The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.
Serologic testing  is also  recommended,  with  the  administration  of  subsequent  doses  of  vaccine,  if
necessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.
In  the  case  of  unvaccinated  or  incompletely  vaccinated  individuals,  additional  doses  should  be
given as in the recommended immunisation schedule.
Method of administration
This vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.
The deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection in adults.
Do not inject intravascularly.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or
bleeding disorders.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
- 
- 
History  of  hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance,  or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  or  trace  residuals
(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 6.2.
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of
the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case
of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).
This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the
manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).
Use caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the vial stopper contains dry natural latex
rubber that may cause allergic reactions.
35
A number of factors have been observed to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines. These
factors include older age, male gender, obesity, smoking, route of administration and some chronic
underlying diseases. Consideration should be given to serological testing of those subjects who may be at
risk of not achieving seroprotection following a complete course of HBVAXPRO. Additional doses may
need to be considered for persons who do not respond or have a sub-optimal response to a course of
vaccinations.
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to
be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. 
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis
E and other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).
Excipient(s) with known effect:
This medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be
essentially sodium free.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
This vaccine can be administered:
- 
- 
with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.
to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have 
previously received another hepatitis B vaccine.
concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.
- 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Fertility:
HBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.
Pregnancy:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on pregnant women.
The vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the
foetus. 
Breast-feeding:
There is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However,
HBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
a. Summary of the safety profile
The most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.
36
 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine.
As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been
established.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01
The vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg).
Development of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or
greater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B
virus infection.
In clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a
previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of
antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (
 10 IU/l).
Although the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis
B vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk
subjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B
infection.
In addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen
(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous
formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in healthy adults.
In accordance with standard medical practice for hepatitis B vaccine administration, regular antibody
testing should be done in hemodialysis patients. A booster dose should be given when antibody levels
decline below 10 IU/l. In subjects in whom insufficient antibody titres are achieved after boosting, the use
of alternative hepatitis B vaccines should be considered.
Reduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have
demonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of
hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been
recognised as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is and what it is used for
This vaccine is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known
subtypes in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B
virus.
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as hepatitis
D does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis
E and other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receive HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms
Do not use HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms
- 
if you or your child is allergic to hepatitis B surface antigen or to any of the other ingredients of
HBVAXPRO (see section 6)
if you or your child has a severe illness with fever
- 
Warnings and precautions
The container of this vaccine contains latex rubber. Latex rubber may cause severe allergic reactions.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you or your child receives HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms.
Other vaccines and HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms
HBVAXPRO can be administered at the same time as with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate
injection site.
HBVAXPRO can be used to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who
have previously received another hepatitis B vaccine.
64
 
HBVAXPRO may be administered at the same time as with some other vaccines, using separate sites and
syringes.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, or has recently taken, any other
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Caution should be exercised when prescribing the vaccine to pregnant or breast-feeding women.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines 
HBVAXPRO is expected to have no, or negligible, influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms contains sodium: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol
sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- free’.
3.  How HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is given
Dosage
The recommended dose for each injection (0.5 mL) is 5 micrograms for individuals from birth through
15 years of age.
A course of vaccination should include at least three injections.
Two immunisation schedules can be recommended:
- 
two injections with an interval of one month followed by a third injection 6 months after the first
administration (0, 1, 6 months).
if immunity is needed quickly: three injections with an interval of one month and a fourth dose 1
year later (0, 1, 2, 12 months).
- 
In case of a recent exposure to the hepatitis B virus, a first dose of HBVAXPRO together with the
appropriate dose of immunoglobulin can be given.
Some local vaccination schedules currently include recommendations for a booster dose. Your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse will inform you if a booster dose should be given.
Method of administration
The vial should be well shaken until a slightly opaque white suspension is obtained.
Once the vial has been penetrated, the withdrawn vaccine should be used promptly, and the vial must be
discarded.
The doctor or nurse will give the vaccine as an injection into muscle. The upper side of the thigh is the
preferred site for injection in neonates and infants. The upper arm muscle is the preferred site for injection
in children and adolescents.
This vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia
(diminution of blood platelets) or to persons at risk of haemorrhage.
65
If you or your child forget one dose of HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms 
If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Your doctor or
nurse will decide when to give the missed dose.
If you or your child have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or
nurse.
4. 
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship of side effects to the vaccine
has not been established.
The most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: soreness, redness and hardening.
Other side effects are reported very rarely: 
Low platelet count, Lymph node disease
Allergic reactions
Nervous system disorders such as pins and needles, Facial paralysis, Nerve inflammations including
Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Inflammation of the nerve of the eye that leads to impaired vision, Brain
inflammation, Exacerbation of multiple sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Convulsions, Headache,
Dizziness and Fainting
Low blood pressure, Blood vessel inflammation
Asthma-like symptoms
Vomiting, Nausea, Diarrhoea, Abdominal pain
Skin reactions such as eczema, Rash, Itching, Hives and Skin blistering, Hair loss
Joint pain, Arthritis, Muscle pain, Pain in extremity
Fatigue, Fever, Vague illness, Flu-like symptoms
Elevation of liver enzymes
Inflammation of the eye which causes pain and redness 
In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between
breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this
medicine.

This vaccine is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known
subtypes in individuals 16 years of age or more considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus.
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as hepatitis
D does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis
E and other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive HBVAXPRO 10 micrograms

HBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
HBVAXPRO  10 micrograms  contains  sodium:  This  medicinal  product  contains  less  than  1  mmol
sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- free’.
3.  How HBVAXPRO 10 micrograms is given
Dosage
The recommended dose for each injection (1 mL) is 10 micrograms for individuals 16 years of age or
more.
A course of vaccination should include three injections.
Two immunisation schedules can be recommended:
- 
two injections with an interval of one month followed by a third injection 6 months after the first
administration (0, 1, 6 months).
if immunity is needed quickly: three injections with an interval of one month and a fourth dose 1
year later (0, 1, 2, 12 months).
- 
In case of a recent exposure to the hepatitis B virus, a first dose of HBVAXPRO together with the
appropriate dose of immunoglobulin can be given.
Some local vaccination schedules currently include recommendations for a booster dose. Your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse will inform you if a booster dose should be given.
For individuals less than 16 years of age, HBVAXPRO 10 micrograms is not recommended. The
appropriate strength for administration to individuals from birth through 15 years of age is HBVAXPRO
5 micrograms.
Method of administration
The vial should be well shaken until a slightly opaque white suspension is obtained.
The doctor or nurse will give the vaccine as an injection into muscle. The upper arm muscle is the
preferred site for injection in adults and adolescents.
This vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia
(diminution of blood platelets) or to persons at risk of haemorrhage.
77
If you forget one dose of HBVAXPRO 10 micrograms 
If you miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Your doctor or nurse will
decide when to give the missed dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4. 
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship of side effects to the vaccine
has not been established.

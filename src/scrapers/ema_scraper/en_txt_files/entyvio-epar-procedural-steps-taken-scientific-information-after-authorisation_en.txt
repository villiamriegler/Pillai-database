are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Submission of the final report from study 
06/07/2023 
SmPC, Annex 
Following review of study MLN0002_401 SmPC 4.8 was 
MLN0002_401 listed as a category 3 study in the 
II and PL 
updated to include Clostridoides diffiicle infection to 4.8 of 
RMP in order to fulfil MEA/001.2; this is an 
international observational prospective cohort study 
comparing vedolizumab to other biologic agents in 
patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. 
The RMP version 8.0 has also been submitted. 
Update of the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and Annex 
II (removal of additional risk minimisation measures 
based on data from this study. The package leaflet 
has been updated in accordance. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
the SmPC with a frequency “common”. Furthermore, 
frequencies on herpes zoster, infusion site reaction 
(including: infusion site pain and infusion site irritation), 
and infusion related reaction, pneumonia and blurred vision 
were updated in 4.8 of the SmPC. No cases of PML were 
reported in the study and the study did not suggest an 
increased risk of malignancies. Patient alert card and 
Physician’s Educational material was removed from Annex 
II of the MA. The package leaflet was updated in 
accordance. For more information, please refer to the

Update of section 4.6 of the Summary of Products

Package Leaflet (PL) in order to implement 
information on lactation based on study 
Vedolizumab-4001 (An Open-Label, Multicenter and 
Open Enrollment Model, Postmarketing, Milk-Only 
Lactation Study to Assess Concentration of 
Vedolizumab in Breast Milk of Lactating Women With 
Active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease Who Are 
Receiving Vedolizumab Therapeutically), including 
the concentration of vedolizumab in human breast 
milk and the estimated average daily dose of 
vedolizumab ingested by the infant. 
C.I.4 
Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to adjust 
the values for clearance (CL) and serum half-life of 
vedolizumab IV and SC in subjects with ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn's disease. The updated pop PK 
dataset consists of pooled data across 4 phase 3 
studies (C13006, C13007, MLN0002SC-3027, 
enrollment model, postmarketing, milk-only lactation study 
to assess concentration of vedolizumab in breast milk of 
lactating women with active ulcerative colitis or crohn's 
disease who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically) was 
designed to detect the presence of vedolizumab in breast 
milk but the effect of this medicine on infants remains 
unknown. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in lactating 
women should continue to take into account the benefit of 
therapy to the mother and potential risks to the infant. In 
order to inform Health Care Providers (HCP) when making 
prescribing decisions, it is proposed to update section 4.6 
of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) and 
the section 2 of the Package Leaflet (PL) to add the new 
data obtained from the study MLN0002-4001, including the 
concentration of vedolizumab in human breast milk and the 
estimated average daily dose of vedolizumab ingested by 
the infant. In the mentioned study, the concentration of 
vedolizumab obtained was approximately 0.4% to 2.2% of 
the maternal serum concentration obtained from historical 
studies of vedolizumab. The estimated average daily dose 
of vedolizumab ingested by the infant was 0.02 mg/kg/day, 
(which is approximately 21% of the body weight-adjusted 
average maternal daily dose.

Vedolizumab has been detected in human milk. The effect 
concerning the information on breast-feeding based 
on findings from published literature. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, section 
4.2 was updated for consistency amongst both 
of vedolizumab on infants is unknown. The use of 
vedolizumab in lactating women should take into account 
the benefit of therapy to the mother and potential risks to 
the infant.

approved indications with regards to discontinuing 
treatment when no therapeutic benefit is observed. 
Section 4.4 is updated to remove that no cases of 
PML were reported in clinical trials. Editorial changes 
were also made in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
For consistency and clarity purposes amongst both 
approved indications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s 
disease wordings were aligned with regards to 
discontinuing vedolizumab treatment when no therapeutic 
benefit is observed. 
A single case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) was reported in post-marketing in a patient treated 
with vedolizumab with no causal relationship established 
with vedolizumab. In order to minimise possible misleading 
interpretation the CHMP agreed on the removal of the 
statement indicating that no cases of PML were reported in 
clinical studies of vedolizumab.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

Entyvio in the approved indications remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
vedolizumab treatment, as assessed by partial Mayo score, 
clinical remission, and clinical response were shown for up 
to 196 weeks. Immunogenicity data showed that during 
vedolizumab treatment antibodies to vedolizumab may 
develop, most of which are neutralising. The formation of

anti-vedolizumab antibodies is associated with increased 
clearance of vedolizumab and lower rates of clinical

infusion are reported in subjects with anti-vedolizumab 
antibodies.

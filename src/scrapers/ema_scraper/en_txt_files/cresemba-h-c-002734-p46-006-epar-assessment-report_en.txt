1.  Introduction 
On January 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cresemba (study 9766-CL-
0046), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s) P46. The study is part of 
the agreed paediatric investigation plan EMEA-001301-PIP02-12-M03 (P/0100/2019). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Description  
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble triazole antifungal agent and the prodrug of the active 
moiety isavuconazole. Isavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of 
ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 
dependent enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to 
ergosterol. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of 
ergosterol within the cell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell 
membrane. 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is indicated in adults for the treatment of  
• 
invasive aspergillosis 
•  mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate  
The current adult posology:  
Loading dose 
The recommended loading dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg of 
isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total). 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg 
of isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.  
Duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response. For long-term treatment beyond 6 
months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered.  
Switch to oral isavuconazole 
CRESEMBA is also available as hard capsules containing 100 mg isavuconazole, equivalent to 186 mg 
isavuconazonium sulfate. On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%), switching between 
intravenous and oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.

2.2.  Information on the development programme 
The MAH stated that study 9766-CL-0046 (A phase 1, open-label, multicenter, non-comparative 
pharmacokinetics and safety study of intravenous and oral isavuconazonium sulfate in paediatric 
patients) is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting of the full 
relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 07/2022.  
A listing of all the concerned studies is annexed (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Overview of concerned studies 
The MAH explains that the purpose of study 9766-CL-0046 is to provide an understanding of the 
pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral treatment regimens in paediatric subjects of different age 
groups, but that it does not allow any definitive conclusion regarding the safety and the efficacy of 
isavuconazole in paediatric patients with invasive aspergillosis/mucormycosis.  
Moreover, the MAH does not seek an update of the isavuconazole product information until all studies 
as outlined in the PIP (in particular Study 9766-CL-0107) are completed. 
2.3.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulations used in the study 
In part 1 of the study, the intravenous drug was administered using the formulation marketed for 
adult patients (200 mg isavuconazole, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion).  
In part 2 of the study, the oral drug was administered. A 74.5 mg size 3 capsule of isavuconazonium 
sulfate (corresponding to 40 mg isavuconazole) developed for paediatric use was administered to 
paediatric subjects aged 6 to < 18 years of age.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  A phase 1, open-label, multicenter, non-comparative pharmacokinetics and safety study of 
intravenous and oral isavuconazonium sulfate in paediatric patients (9766-CL-0046) 
o  Part 1: The currently approved intravenous formulation (Cresemba for injection) was 
administered to intravenous cohorts 1 (1 to <6 years), 2 (6 to <12 years, and  
cohort 3 (12 < 18 years).  
o  Part 2: A 74.5 mg oral formulation of isavuconazonium sulfate (corresponding to 40mg 
isavuconazole) developed for paediatric use was administered orally to cohorts 4 (6 to 
<12 years) and 5 (12 to < 18 years) in Part 2 of this study. Subjects younger than  
6 years of age were excluded from Part 2 due to the size of the oral capsule. 
2.4.2.  Clinical study (9766-CL-0046) 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 
multiple doses of intravenous and oral isavuconazonium sulfate administered daily in paediatric 
subjects. 
Study design 
In part 1, eleven centres in the US enrolled 29 paediatric subjects aged 1 to < 18 years of age into 
the following three intravenous cohorts.  
-  Cohort 1: 1 to < 6 years of age 
-  Cohort 2: 6 to < 12 years of age 
-  Cohort 3: 12 to < 18 years of age 
Eligible subjects received an intravenous loading regimen of isavuconazonium sulfate, which consisted 
of a dose every 8 hours (± 2 hours) on days 1 and 2 (a total of 6 doses), followed by once daily 
intravenous maintenance dosing for up to 26 additional days (for a maximum of 28 days of dosing).  
In part 2, twelve centres in the US enrolled 24 subjects aged 6 to 18 years old into the following oral 
cohorts.  
-  Cohort 4: 6 to < 12 years of age 
-  Cohort 5: 12 to < 18 years of age 
Subjects younger than 6 years of age were excluded from Part 2 due to the size of the oral capsule.  
Subjects in cohorts 4 and 5 received a loading regimen of isavuconazonium sulfate by oral 
administration, comprising one dose every 8 hours (± 2 hours) on day 1 and day 2 (a total of 6 
doses), followed by once-daily oral maintenance dosing for up to 26 additional days (a maximum of 28 
days of dosing).  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/304783/2020  
Page 5/28 
 
 
 
In all cohorts, the first maintenance dose was to start 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the 
last loading dose. Subsequent maintenance doses were to be administered once a day (24 hours ± 2 
hours from the previous maintenance dose).  
For the IV administration, the 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile of isavuconazole, the active moiety of 
isavuconazonium sulfate, included blood samples collected on days 3 (± 1 day), 7 (± 1 day), and at 
the day 28 or EOT visit. If the subject was able to provide pharmacokinetics samples beyond day 7, 
trough sampling was performed weekly (± 1 day), approximately 24 hours after the prior day’s 
infusion (i.e., within 15 minutes prior to the start of next infusion) through day 28 or EOT.  
For the oral administration, the 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile of isavuconazole was based on blood 
samples collected on day 7 (± 1 day) pre-dose, ± 10 min at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours and 4 hours, ± 
30 min at 6 hours and 8 hours and 24 hours (within 1h before next study drug administration) after 
study drug administration. In addition, blood samples were collected within 1 hour before the (first) 
dose on each of days 2, 3, 5, 14 (± 2 days), 21 (± 2 days), and day 28 (± 2 days).  
For IV, the average duration of treatment in this study was to be approximately 14 days and for oral 
approximately 7 days (± 1 day); however, for subjects deriving benefit from the prophylactic regimen 
as deemed by the investigator, treatment could continue for up to a maximum of 28 days. 
Study population / Sample size 
Inclusion criteria 
The study population consisted of subjects who, in the opinion of the treating physician, could benefit 
from isavuconazonium sulfate in the prophylactic setting. These included those at high risk for invasive 
fungal disease, such as children with hematological malignancy including hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients. 
Exclusion criteria (major) 
One subject had familial short QT syndrome, was receiving medications that are known to shorten the 
QT interval, or had a clinically significant abnormal ECG. 
One subject had evidence of hepatic dysfunction (TBL ≥3 ULN, ALT or AST ≥5 ULN), cirrhosis or 
chronic hepatic failure 
In part 1 and 2, subjects whose pharmacokinetics were not evaluable were assessed and replaced as 
appropriate. Up to 36 subjects (Part 1) or 24 subjects (Part 2) were to be enrolled to ensure that in 
each age cohort at least 8 subjects had evaluable pharmacokinetics (see table 2 to 5 in the results 
section). 
Treatments 
The adult clinical dosing regimen used to establish the safety and efficacy was 372 mg 
isavuconazonium sulfate (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 2 days 
followed by 372 mg once daily thereafter.  
In part 1, for children weighing ≤ 40 kg: 
• 
Loading regimen of 10.0 mg/kg isavuconazonium sulfate infusions every 8 hours (± 2 hours), 
for 6 doses total over the course of days 1 and 2, followed by; 
•  Maintenance doses of 10.0 mg/kg isavuconazonium sulfate administered once daily for up to a 
maximum of 26 additional days, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose. 
The maximum loading and daily maintenance doses administered to any subject was to be 372 mg.

For children weighing > 40 kg: 
• 
Loading regimen of 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate infusions (1 vial) every 8 hours (± 2 
hours), for 6 doses total over the course of days 1 and 2, followed by;  
•  Maintenance doses of 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate (1 vial) administered once daily for up 
to a maximum of 26 additional days, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose. 
In part 2, the daily oral dose was based on body weight, as shown in table 1.  
Table 1. Body weight based dosing for the oral cohorts 4 and 5 (part II). 
Prohibited Therapies: 
Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 were prohibited. 
Use of systemic azole-type antifungals was prohibited during study drug administration. Treatment 
with concurrent drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic range were 
prohibited or reduced in dose, as determined by the investigator. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
While dosing is reflected as milligrams of the administered prodrug (isavuconazonium sulfate), this 
compound is converted by plasma esterases within seconds to the active moiety (isavuconazole), and 
thus exposure is represented as milligrams of isavuconazole. The pharmacokinetic endpoints of 
isavuconazole were as follows: 
•  Cmax, AUCtau, tmax: day 3 and day 7 (iv only) 
•  Ctrough: days 3 and 7, and if applicable, days 14, 21, 28 (iv only): 
•  Model-derived parameters: CL, Vss, AUCss, t1/2 
Efficacy: no formal prospectively defined efficacy assessments were planned in this study. 
The safety endpoints were: 
•  Nature, frequency, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
•  Vital sign measurements (temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure) 
• 
Laboratory assessments (hematology and chemistry) 
•  Routine 12-lead ECGs

Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of isavuconazole were calculated by non-compartmental analysis and by 
popPK analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as geometric mean values with geometric 
coefficients of variation [%] and/or ranges. Descriptive statistical analyses were applied. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
A paediatric population pharmacokinetics model was developed with intravenous data (part 1) based 
on the already established adult population pharmacokinetics model, based on study 9766-CL-0018, 
whereby model-derived pharmacokinetics parameters (CL, Vss, AUCss and t1/2) were estimated. The 
IV model was then updated, adding available PK data from part 2 of the study.   
The aim of the population pharmacokinetic analysis was to confirm the appropriate dosing regimens in 
paediatric population 6 to <12 years of age. 
A base paediatric population pharmacokinetic model built on adult IV data (9766-CL-0018) and data 
from the IV and first PO part (12 to <18 years) of the 9766-CL-0046 study was a 3-compartment 
model with combined zero and first order absorption and linear elimination. The base model also 
included allometric scaling based on body weight to scale size-related changes in clearance and volume 
of distribution. All random effects were treated as log-normally distributed. The Ln-Ln transformation 
of both the model and the data was used to stabilize the residual variance. The residual variance of the 
Ln-Ln transformed model was additive. The above-mentioned base model was utilized as an initial 
model for further development and finalization after the addition of data from the second PO part (6 to 
<12 years) from the 9766-CL-0046 study. 
Serum creatinine, age, liver chemistry, sex and race were explored as covariates in the model. Only 
statistically significant covariates were included in the model. In addition, the covariates that were 
included in the best model were required to have clinical significance, which might alter dosing 
recommendations. 
For the best model, population and individual PK parameters were estimated and the precision of the 
population model parameters (e.g. asymptotic standard errors or bootstrap 95% CIs) were generated. 
Nonparametric bootstrapping with replacement using 1000 replications was used to provide further 
validation of the model parameter estimates. 
Monte Carlo simulations were performed in NONMEM to confirm the paediatric dosing regimen. 
Individual and population profiles were simulated to steady-state. The area under the isavuconazole 
concentration-time curve at steady-state (AUCs) was calculated for each simulated subject. Predicted 
exposures from the simulated patients were compared against observed exposures from adult patients 
at the therapeutic dose (372 mg) enrolled in the SECURE study, which was conducted in adult patients 
with invasive aspergillosis and other filamentous fungi.  
The analyses were performed using NONMEM software version 7.3 (Icon Development Solutions, 
Ellicott City, MD, USA).

Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
The base model developed for the IV and first PO part (12 to <18 years) of the study, which was a 3 
compartment model with combined zero and first-order absorption and linear elimination, was utilized 
as an initial model for the final dataset. The updated structural base model included an additional inter-
individual variability on volume of distribution of peripheral compartment (V3) in addition to inter-
individual variability that was previously included on clearance (CL), volume of distribution of

peripheral compartments (V4), and on inter-compartmental clearance (Q4) in the previous base 
model. Allometric scaling using fixed exponents was applied in this model on clearance and volume of 
distribution parameters.  
Race was statistically significant in adult population, but visual inspection did not find any correlation of 
race against clearance in paediatric population. No other significant covariates were identified.

Simulations 
Simulations were performed to estimate the percentage of children with isavuconazonium exposures in 
the target range. The applicant considered the target range for paediatric patients that 
isavuconazonium exposure should be higher than lowest quartile isavuconazonium exposure (60 
mg*hr/L)) in adults treated with 372 mg QD and lower than the minimim isavuconazonium exposure 
(233 mg*hr/L) in adults treated with 1116 mg, where toxicities were observed.

For PO, 6 to < 12 years, an isavuconazonium sulfate dose of 10 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 372.5 
mg provided mean exposures that were similar to and/or above the 372 mg adult dose and 
significantly below the 1116 mg dose group,. 
In IV, across all age groups, > 99% of the predicted AUCss values were below the mean AUC24 values 
and > 94% of the predicted AUCss values were below the minimum adult AUC24 values for the adult 
population administered the supratherapeutic clinical dose (1116 mg). Greater than 82% of the 
predicted AUCss values were above the 25th percentile from the SECURE study. 
In PO, across all age groups, > 99% of the predicted AUCss values were below the mean AUC24 values 
and > 96% of the predicted AUCss values were below the minimum adult AUC24 values for the adult 
population administered the supratherapeutic clinical dose (1116 mg).Approximately 80% of the 
predicted AUCss values were above the 25th percentile from SECURE study.

Efficacy results 
No formal prospectively defined efficacy assessments were planned in this study.  
In cases of breakthrough fungal infection, the site of infection, causative organism (including 
susceptibility testing of isolates), start/stop dates, and any follow-up information available regarding 
resolution and therapies used to treat the infection were recorded.  
However, since no breakthrough infections were observed (neither in Part 1, nor in Part 2 of the study) 
no efficacy results were to report here.

TEAEs in 52.6% of subjects (10/19) were considered at least possibly related to study drug [Table 18. 
Part 2, PO]. The drug-related TEAEs occurring most frequently in Cohort 4 were vomiting and nausea 
each reported for 2 (22.2%) subjects. In Cohort 5, no related TEAE was seen in more than 1 subject. 
Overall, vomiting (15.8%), diarrhea nausea and headache (10.5% each) were the most common 
related TEAEs, but study drug-related TEAEs were low in both cohorts.

Serious Adverse Events 
Part 1 
Overall, 44.4% (12/27) of subjects experienced an SAE. Overall, the most frequent SAEs were diarrhea 
and pyrexia (3 [11.1%] were diarrhea and pyrexia (3 [11.1%] subjects each), followed by febrile 
neutropenia, abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, and cytomegalovirus infection (2 [7.4%] subjects 
each). The number of SAEs for individual events was very low.

One SAE (electrocardiogram QT prolonged) was considered at least possibly related to study drug 
[End-of-Text Table 12.6.1.5], which was experienced on day 7 by a 16-year-old girl in Cohort 3 
diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. The AE was moderate in severity, a single episode, and 
was recovered from by day 15, when it was considered resolved [Appendix 13.2.7.4]. The concomitant 
medications of famotidine, diphenhydramine and promethazine hydrochloride were discontinued as the 
investigator felt they could possibly affect QTc values. This SAE resulted in discontinuation of study 
drug on day 8 (see Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation). 
Part 2 
Overall, 42.1% (8/19) of subjects experienced an SAE. The most frequent SAE in any single treatment 
cohort was pyrexia (2 [22.2%] subjects); all other SAEs were experienced by 1 subject each. The 
number of SAEs for individual events was very low. 
Four SAEs (tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and pyrexia) occurred on day 18 in a 10-year-old girl in 
Cohort 4, and were considered at least possibly related to study drug. The SAE of pyrexia was mild in 
severity; the SAEs of tachycardia, nausea and vomiting were considered severe. The SAEs of nausea, 
vomiting and pyrexia resulted in discontinuation of study drug on day 20 (see Adverse Events 
Resulting in Discontinuation). The subject recovered, and all events were considered resolved. This 
subject was also noted in regard to a protocol deviation. 
Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation 
Part 1 
AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported for 2 subjects [Table 19] 
Table 19  
Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation (SAF) (Part 1, IV) 
One subject, a 6-year-old girl in Cohort 2 diagnosed with aplastic anemia, experienced a severe TEAE 
of hepatic enzyme increased on day 11, considered probably related to study drug and resulting of 
withdrawal of study drug on day 15. The TEAE was associated with levels of ALT that were 476 U/L and 
levels of AST that were 196 U/L on day 14. ALT and AST remained elevated (352 U/L and 92 U/L, 
respectively) at day 15 (EOT). Alkaline phosphatase and TBL levels remained low and unaffected. At 
the time of the event the subject was also receiving acyclovir, aminocaproic acid, amlodipine, 
amphotericin B (day 14 only), clonidine, diphenhydramine, macrogol, methylphenidate, ondansetron, 
pentamidine, promethazine, risperidone, scopolamine melatonin, esomeprazole and ursodeoxycholic 
acid. The TEAE was considered resolved on day 24 (no liver enzyme results available). 
Study drug was also discontinued due to a moderate SAE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged, 
experienced on day 7 by a 16-year-old girl in Cohort 3. The event was considered possibly related to 
study drug, which was withdrawn on day 8. At the time of the event, the subject was also receiving

acyclovir, diphenhydramine, famotidine, morphine, pantaprazole and tacrolimus. The event was 
considered resolved on day 15. 
Part 2 
AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported for 4 subjects, 3 in Cohort 4 and 1 in Cohort 5 [Table 
20]. One subject in Cohort 4 experienced 4 SAEs on day 18, 3 of which resulted in discontinuation of 
study drug. The events were considered possibly related to study drug, which was withdrawn on day 
20. Another subject in Cohort 4, a 7-year-old-girl, had ALT and AST increased on day 23. The events 
were both of moderate severity and considered to be probably related to study drug, which was 
withdrawn on the same day. The events were considered to be resolving at the end of the study. A 10-
year-old girl subject in Cohort 4 experienced abdominal pain upper of moderate severity on day 9 that 
was considered to be possibly related to study drug, which was withdrawn on day 10. The event was 
considered resolved on day 10. In Cohort 5, a 14-year-old girl subject experienced severe mucosal 
inflammation (oral mucositis) on day 8 that was considered not related to study drug, which was 
withdrawn on day 7. The event was considered resolved on day 24.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Part 1 
Possible cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include the 6-year-old girl subject in Cohort 2 
discussed above  and a 10-year-old boy in Cohort 2 receiving 336.5 mg isavuconazonium sulfate who 
had elevated ALT (169 U/L) and AST (90 U/L) levels on day 15. ALT was 109 U/L on day 29 (EOT),

while AST had declined to 44 U/L by that time. There were no significant changes in TBL or alkaline 
phosphatase levels.  
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported for 2 subjects. The first subject, a 4-year-old girl in 
Cohort 1 receiving 168 mg study drug, experienced the TEAE of infusion related reaction (reported by 
the investigator as chills) during infusion of the study drug on day 1. 
This TEAE was accompanied by the TEAE of procedural nausea. On day 3, the subject experienced 
another TEAE of infusion related reaction (reported by the investigator as chills). This TEAE was 
accompanied by the TEAEs of diarrhea and of procedural vomiting during the infusion. Each of these 
events was mild and possibly related to study drug. Study drug dosing was not changed for any event, 
and the subject continued to receive daily infusions until EOT on day 16. This subject met the criteria 
for discontinuation, but was not discontinued. 
The second subject was a 3-year-old boy in Cohort 1 receiving 152 mg study drug who experienced 
the TEAE of infusion-related abdominal pain during infusion on day 1. This event was mild, considered 
possibly related to study drug. It was accompanied by the TEAE of procedural nausea (mild) and 
procedural vomiting (mild) which were considered possibly related to study drug. It was noted that the 
infusion line occluded several times during administration (the site confirmed that in-line filters were 
used for the infusion), and the total time of infusion was extended by 10 minutes. Study drug dosing 
was not changed, and the events were recovered from and considered resolved on day 1. The subject 
continued to receive daily infusions until EOT on day 14. 
Part 2 
Possible cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) comprise the 7-year-old girl subject in Cohort 4 
discussed above. This subject received 223.5 mg study drug, and had elevated ALT (140 U/L) and AST 
(121 U/L) on day 22, which rose to 181 U/L and 146 U/L at the end-of-trial visit the next day. These 
events were considered to be probably related to study drug. By day 71 both values had resolved. 
There were no significant changes in TBL or alkaline phosphatase levels.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Part 1 
No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed. No important changes in laboratory shift 
analyses were observed. Liver enzymes and TBL values for the majority of subjects tended to be within 
the normal laboratory ranges during the study. ALT was elevated beyond 3 x ULN in 2 of 8 (25.0%) 
subjects in Cohort 2, and was elevated beyond 3 x ULN in 1 subject (12.5%). AST was elevated > 3 x 
ULN in 1 subject in Cohort 2. A value of AST or ALT > 3 x ULN coupled with TBL > 2 x ULN in the same 
sample was not observed in any subject. 
Part 2 
No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed. No important changes in laboratory shift 
analyses were observed. Liver enzymes and TBL values for the majority of subjects tended to be within 
the normal laboratory ranges during the study. In 1 of 9 (11.1%) subjects in Cohort 4, ALT was 
elevated beyond 3 x ULN (at 181 U/L [3.29 xULN]). This event was considered to be probably related 
to study drug. A value of AST or ALT > 3 x ULN coupled with TBL > 2 x ULN in the same sample was 
not observed in any subject. 
Vital signs (Part and Part 2) 
No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed for any of the vital sign measurements. No 
changes in vital sign measurements were reported as an AE.

Electrocardiograms 
Part 1 
One subject experienced a clinically significant ECG abnormality (SAE of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged on day 7). ECGs at baseline and day 8/EOT were considered abnormal but not clinically 
significant. 
Part 2 
One subject experienced a clinically significant ECG abnormality (ST abnormality and T wave inversion) 
reported at the day 14 visit, and a TEAE was reported (conduction disorder of mild severity, possibly 
related to study drug). This event was not resolved, and no action was taken. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study 9766-CL-0046 is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, non-comparative pharmacokinetics and 
safety study of intravenous and oral isavuconazonium sulfate in paediatric subjects of different age 
groups. It does not allow any definitive conclusion regarding the safety and efficacy of isavuconazole in 
paediatric patients with invasive aspergillosis/mucormycosis. Moreover, the MAH does not seek an 
update of the isavuconazole product information until all studies as outlined in the PIP (in particular 
Study 9766-CL-0107) are completed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The aim of the current study and population pharmacokinetic analyses was to determine appropriate 
dosing regimens for paediatric populations receiving either IV or oral isavuconazonium sulfate. Overall, 
pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for 26 (part I) and 19 (part II) paediatric patients. 
Subsequently, exposure, defined as the AUC at steady state, was compared with the adult data using 
model simulations with the developed population pharmacokinetic analyses. In general, the population 
pharmacokinetic analyses is adequately conducted and described. Nonetheless, it would be valuable in 
future applications to include at least ETA versus Age and Body weight plots as the current correlation 
matrix cannot be assessed. Furthermore, VPCs should be provided per age group, per bodyweight 
group and per route of administration on a linear and log-linear scale as there appears to be a 
structural deviation with age in the goodness-of-fit plots. This could potentially indicate a difference in 
PK in the paediatric population as compared to the adult population.  
When comparing across age cohorts, mean AUCtau, Ctrough and Cmax were comparable for paediatric 
patients 1 to <6 years and 6 to < 12 years. In children aged < 12 years, mean AUCtau, Ctrough and Cmax 
were approximately 30% to 35% higher as compared to children aged 12 to <18 years. Exposure in 
paediatric patients 12 to <18 years appears to be comparable to adults. Since this does not apply for 
the younger paediatric patients in which exposure is higher with the currently used dosing regimen as 
compared to adults, this should be discussed in future applications.  
Currently, the target range for efficacy is 25% percentile of the AUCss and for safety, the minimum 
exposure of the 1116 mg dose group, in which toxicity was observed. These target ranges should be 
appropriately justified in future applications.  
Further, it would be valuable to evaluate the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters, in 
particular Cmax, and safety effects in the paediatric population as the current analysis focusses mainly 
on efficacy.

Efficacy 
No formal prospectively defined efficacy assessments were planned in this study.  
In cases of breakthrough fungal infection, the site of infection, causative organism (including 
susceptibility testing of isolates), start/stop dates, and any follow-up information available regarding 
resolution and therapies used to treat the infection were recorded. However, since no breakthrough 
infections were observed (neither in Part 1, nor in Part 2 of the study) no efficacy results were to 
report here. 
Safety 
As could be expected in this severily-ill study population (due to the underlying medical 
disease/condition) and the extensive use of accompanying medication like oncolytics and 
immunosuppressants, the frequency and type of TEAEs observed was very high: 25/27 (92.6%) of 
patients that were treated intravenously (Part1) and 18/19 (94.7%) of patients treated orally (Part 2), 
respectively. The overall AE frequency was similar to what was observed in adults.  
Following intravenous use (Part 1), the TEAEs with the highest frequencies were pyrexia (51.9%), 
mucosal inflammation (44.4%), diarrhea (33.3%), thrombocytopenia, anemia, abdominal pain, 
epistaxis and pain in extremity (22.2% each).  
Following oral use (Part 2), the TEAEs with the highest frequencies within a cohort were pyrexia 
(55.6%), vomiting (40%) and abdominal pain (33.3%). 
Drug-related TEAEs attributed to bedaquiline were also reported frequently: 10/27 (37.0%) of subjects 
treated intravenously (Part 1) and 10/19 (52.6%) of subjects treated per os (Part 2): 
Part 1, IV: The drug-related TEAEs occurring most frequently were infusion related reaction, 
procedural nausea, and procedural vomiting, each reported for 2 (22.2%) subjects in Cohort 1. In 
the other cohorts, no TEAE was seen in more than 1 subject (Part 1, IV). 
Part 2, PO: The drug-related TEAEs occurring most frequently in Cohort 4 were vomiting and 
nausea each reported for 2 (22.2%) subjects. In Cohort 5, no related TEAE was seen in more than 
1 subject. Overall, vomiting (15.8%), diarrhea nausea and headache (10.5% each) were the most 
common related TEAEs, but study drug-related TEAEs were low in both cohorts (Part 2). 
No obvious difference in overall and individual-type AEs was observed between the 3 age cohorts, 
although numbers of patients per cohort were very low and definitive conclusions can not be drawn. 
Study drug was withdrawn in 1 subject due to liver toxicity, and in 1 subject due to QT prolongation. 
Two subjects experienced mild IRR events but study drug was not withdrawn by the principal 
investigator. Liver toxicity and QT changes are well known adverse events described with the use of 
isavuconazole.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The pharmacokinetic profile of isavuconazonium administered as IV or oral administration was 
characterised using non-compartmental analaysis and a population pharmacokinetic analyses, partly 
based on adult data. Overall, the analyses appear to be adequately conducted. It is advised to include 
some additional diagnostic plots in future applications as there appears to be a deviation in the 
population predicted concentrations versus observed concentrations goodness-of-fit plot, which could 
indicate differences in PK in the paediatric population as compared to the adult population.  
Furthermore, higher exposure is observed in paediatric patients <12 years as compared to adults. The 
currently used target ranges and the higher exposure should be discussed in future applications. The 
implications for the safety of use in these children should be discussed in depth. 
Currently, no change in the SmPC has been proposed, which is considered acceptable.

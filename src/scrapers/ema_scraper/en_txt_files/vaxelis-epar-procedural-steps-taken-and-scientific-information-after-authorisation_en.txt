1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of section 4.5 in order to add drug-drug 
07/12/2023 
SmPC and PL 
The Vaxelis SmPC section 4.5  has been updated to include 
interaction information with meningococcal B 
conjugate vaccine based on final results from study 
OVG 2018/05 - Immunogenicity and reactogenicity 
of concomitantly administered hexavalent and group 
B meningococcal vaccines in infancy; this is an open-
label, non-inferiority, randomized clinical trial that 
compared the immune response and assessed the 
safety of Vaxelis and control vaccine (Infanrix hexa) 
when co-administered with 4 component 
meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB) along with other 
routine infant vaccines. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
information on drug-drug interaction information with 
meningococcal B conjugate. Vaxelis may be administered at 
the same time with meningococcal B vaccines.  Due to an 
increase in some adverse reactions when a different 
hexavalent vaccine with a similar reactogenicity profile to 
Vaxelis was co-administered with Meningococcal B vaccine, 
separate vaccinations can be considered.

Product Characteristics.

Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order 
30/11/2023 
SmPC 
The Vaxelis SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 have been updated 
to add information on interchangeable use of Vaxelis 
with other hexavalent vaccines based on final results 
from Study V419-016. 
to include information on interchangeable use of Vaxelis 
with other hexavalent vaccines. Vaxelis may be used as a 
booster dose in children who received another hexavalent

conditions of the finished product or the

to the table of adverse events reported during post-
marketing use in Section 4.8 of the SmPC, with ‘rare’ as 
frequency. Accordingly, “allergic reaction, serious allergic 
reaction (anaphylactic reaction)” was added to the list of 
side effects in section 4 of the PL with frequency ‘rare’. 
Consequently, the paragraph on hypersensitivity and 
anaphylactic reaction - previously part of the description of 
selected adverse reactions reported with other vaccines 
containing the components or constituents of Vaxelis 
without regard to causality or frequency – was deleted from 
the SmPC (section 4.8) and the PL (section 4) approved 
with this variation.

The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated following the 
the efficacy section on immune persistence based on 
Labelling 
completion of PRI03C study with the data on long- term 
the final results from study PRI03C - Long-term

Persistence of Hepatitis B and Pertussis Antibody 
Responses in Healthy 4- to 5-year-old Children 
Previously Vaccinated with a 2 dose or 3 dose Infants 
Series and Toddler dose of Vaxelis or INFANRIX hexa 
listed as P46 study in the PIP.  
The RMP version 2.2 has also been submitted. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce editorial changes in Annex IIIA.

The purpose of this study was to provide the results of the 
long-term persistence of anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen 
(antiHBsAg) and pertussis antibody (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM) 
responses in children previously vaccinated with Vaxelis or 
Infanrix hexa. The data was collected 3 to 4 years after 
completion of a 2+1 or 3+1 vaccination schedule.  
The proportion of children seroprotected (anti-HBsAg ≥10 
mIU/mL – accepted correlate of protection) after those 
vaccination schedules decreased by approximately 30% in 
approximately 4 years. Considerable study data suggest 
that individuals who have ever had a seroprotective 
response to HB vaccination will have a memory response 
that is protective against clinical disease if exposed to the 
HB virus.  
The immunogenicity findings also support the long-term 
persistence of pertussis antibody responses. After 
approximately 4 years, the percentages of children with 
anti-pertussis antibodies above Lower Limit of 
Quantification (LLOQ) were as follows: anti-PT 58.4%, anti-
FHA 80.9%, anti-PRN 66.1% and anti-FIM 94.3%. 
Clinical data had confirmed that Vaxelis is comparable to 
currently licensed vaccine controls with respect to 
immunogenicity and safety, when given concomitantly with 
other licensed routine paediatric vaccines.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Actual dates 
30 April 2020 
Pembrolizumab  (Keytruda)  is  a  highly  selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to  human 
programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) and blocks the interaction between the PD-1 pathway receptor and its 
ligands,  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  1  (PD-L1)  and  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  2  (PD-L2) 
expressed  on  antigen  presenting  tumour  cells.  Binding  of  either  PD-1  ligand  to  PD-1  inhibits  T  cell 
activation triggered through the T-cell receptor, thus overcoming the active anti-tumour specific T cell 
immune  surveillance.  The  high  expression  of  PD-L1  on  tumour  cells  has  been  found  to  correlate  with 
poor prognosis and survival in various cancers and suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical 
role in tumour evasion and is thus an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
In the setting of lung cancer, which currently represents the main cause of malignancy-related mortality 
worldwide  accounting  for  1.76  million  of  deaths  globally  (Globocan  2018),  pembrolizumab-based 
immunotherapy is a consolidated therapeutic option in clinical practice. Current guidelines recommend 
the  use  of  Keytruda  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  i.e.  the 
prevailing histological subtype (85%-90%) of all lung malignancies, as follows (ESMO, 2019): 
- 
First-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours have high PD-L1 
expression [Tumour Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%] with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour aberrations  
-  Advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) and who have 
received  prior  platinum-based  therapy,  and  if  the  tumours  express  EGFR  or  ALK  genomic  tumour 
aberrations should have disease progression on approved therapy before receiving Keytruda  
Moreover, Keytruda has been recently approved in combination with chemotherapy as first line treatment 
in metastatic NSCLC irrespective of the PD-L1 level of expression. The chemotherapy regimen associated 
with pembrolizumab depends on the histology: pemetrexed and a platinum compound in non-squamous 
NSCLC with negative ALK/EGFR disease (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0043) or carboplatin and either paclitaxel 
or nab-paclitaxel in squamous NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0060).  
Chemotherapy regimens used in NSCLC include cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel, 
nab-paclitaxel,  gemcitabine,  pemetrexed,  or  docetaxel  (ESMO,  2019).  Multiple  Phase  3  studies  have 
demonstrated similar efficacy for most platinum-based chemotherapy in the 1st line treatment of patients 
with advanced NSCLC (Schiller JH. et al, 2002); response rates have ranged from 15% to 33%, with 
median PFS of approximately 4.5 to 6.3 months, and median OS of 10.3 to 12.1 months [Socinski et al. 
2012, Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2008, Thatcher et al 2015]. Treatment-related mortality (deaths 
due to AEs) in these studies has ranged from 0% to 3%. However, the overall 5-year survival rate of 
9%  to  13%.  Over  the  past  4  years,  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  such  as  PD-1/PD-L1  blocking 
antibodies, have emerged as effective alternatives to chemotherapy for many tumour types. In 1L and 
2L+ NSCLC, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy or in combination 
depending on the setting.  
With  this  submission,  the  MAH  intends  to  further  extend  the  clinical  indication  of  Keytruda  as 
monotherapy  in  the  NSCLC  setting  to  include  previously  untreated  patients  with  metastatic  disease 
(including both squamous and non-squamous subtypes) not expressing EGFR or ALK tumour aberrations,

in the presence of a PD-L1 positive score with TPS ≥ 1%. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from conducting 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients are not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The only new clinical study that has been submitted in support of this application is study KEYNOTE-
042. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted with this application which is acceptable 
considering substantial characterizations of the PK and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab have been 
provided in previous submissions. A description of the clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab in 
patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC was included in the KEYNOTE-024 submission to 
support 200 mg Q3W as the recommended dosing regimen of pembrolizumab in this patient population 
(EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0011, 27 January 2017). No new clinical pharmacology analyses beyond those 
provided in previous submissions have been generated. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This submission is based on the second interim analysis (IA2; date cut-off: 26-FEB-2018) of the Phase 
3 trial KEYNOTE-042, a multicentre, international, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical study of 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy in previously untreated adult subjects with locally 
advanced or metastatic TPS ≥1% NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. During the 
procedure,  final  analysis  results  of  the  study  were  also  submitted  (FA;  date  cut-off:  4-SEP-2018);  a 
subsequent updated OS analysis with database date cut-off of 25-OCT-2019 was also presented.   
The MAH also included supporting data from the final planned analysis of OS (data cut-off: 10-JUL-2017) 
and  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  ORR,  and  DOR  (IA2,  data  cut-off:  09-MAY-2016)  of  the  phase  3  trial 
KEYNOTE-024, i.e. the pivotal study for pembrolizumab in treatment-naïve metastatic NSCLC patients 
negative  for  ALK/EGFR  tumour  aberrations  and  highly  expressing  PD-L1  (TPS≥50%).  Detailed 
information on the main pivotal study (KEYNOTE-042) are summarised in the following table:

Outcomes/endpoints 
Table 2: Efficacy endpoints in study Keynote 042 
Sample size 
The study randomized subjects in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab arm and the SOC arm. The sample 
size for the subjects with TPS≥50% was targeted at approximately 530 and drove the end of enrolment, 
the overall sample size for this study was projected to be approximately 1240. The final analysis of the 
study was planned to occur about 45 months after the first subject randomized (study start), at which 
time  approximately  398  deaths  (projections  updated  in  November  2017)  were  expected  between  the 
two arms in the subjects with TPS≥50%. With 398 deaths, the study had approximately 99% power to 
detect a 0.65 piece-wise hazard ratio on OS at alpha=2.5% (one-sided) in the subjects with TPS≥50%. 
By the same time, the expected numbers of deaths were about 557 and 900 in the subjects with TPS≥
20% and TPS≥1%, respectively. With 557 deaths, the study had approximately 98% power to detect a 
piecewise  hazard  ratio  on  OS  with  0.8  before  month  6  and  0.64  after  month  6  at  alpha=2.5%  (one-

sided)  in  the  subjects  with  TPS≥20%.  With  900  deaths,  the  study  had  approximately  91%  power  to 
detect a piecewise hazard ratio with 0.92 by month 6 and 0.73 after month 6 at alpha=2.5% (one-sided) 
in the subjects with TPS≥1%. 
The assumed hazard ratios were based on results from studies KN010 and KN024. The above calculations 
were  based  on  the  following  assumptions:  1)  OS  in  the  standard  of  care  arm  follows  an  exponential 
distribution with a median of 13 months, 2) hazard ratio on OS between pembrolizumab and control is 
0.65  in  the  subjects  with  TPS≥50%,  3)  an  enrolment  period  of  ~26  months  and  a  minimal  19-month 
follow-up period after enrolment completion, 4) a dropout rate of 0.003 per month for OS.  
Randomisation 
Randomization was centralized using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response 
system (IVRS/IWRS). There were 2 treatment arms. Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to 
pembrolizumab and SOC, respectively. 
Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale (0 vs. 1) 
2) Histology (squamous vs. non-squamous) 
3) Geographic region of the enrolling site (East Asia vs. non-East Asia) 
4) PD-L1 expression status (TPS ≥50% vs. TPS 1-49%) prior to randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  an  open-label  study.  Imaging  data  for  the  primary  analysis  were  centrally  reviewed  by 
independent radiologists without knowledge of subject treatment assignment. The subject level PD-L1 
biomarker (TPS) results were masked in the database to the study team at the Sponsor including clinical, 
statistical,  statistical  programming,  and  data  management  personnel.  Access  to  the  TPS  results  was 
limited to an unblinded Sponsor clinical scientist and an unblinded data management analyst who were 
responsible for data review to ensure validity of results but who had no other responsibilities associated 
with  the  study.  Even  though  the  Sponsor  was  unblinded  to  individual  treatment  assignments,  the 
Sponsor  did  not  conduct  any  analysis  upon  aggregate  data  until  the  required  number  of  events  were 
reached and did not become aware of such results until the external DMC advised the Executive Oversight 
Committee that the endpoint of OS had been achieved. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the TPS ≥50%, ≥20%, and ≥1% sub-populations using the intention-
to-treat (ITT) population. 
All safety analyses were conducted using data from the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population, i.e., 
all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
The treatment difference in OS (primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. 
A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the 
magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 
the  survival  curves.  The  hypotheses  for  PFS  were  evaluated  using  the  same  methods  used  for  OS 
assessment. The hypotheses for ORR were evaluated using a stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method 
with weights proportional to the stratum size. Stratification factors were the same used for randomization 
(ECOG performance scale, histology, geographic region of the enrolling site, and PD-L1 expression).  
Assessment report

As  an  exploratory  analysis,  recognized  methods,  e.g.,  the  Rank  Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time 
(RPSFT)  model,  two-stage  method,  etc.,  were  to  be  used  to  adjust  for  the  effect  of  crossover  on  OS 
based upon the appropriateness of the data to the assumption required by the methods.   
To further account for the possible confounding effect, a sensitivity analysis of OS that censors subjects 
at  the  time  of  initiation  of  new  therapy  was  planned  and  an  OS  analysis  that  treats  initiation  of  new 
therapy as a time-dependent binary covariate was also to be conducted. In case the proportional hazards 
assumption  did  not  hold,  Fleming  and  Harrington’s  weighted  log-rank  test,  Restricted  Mean  Survival 
Time (RMST) method or other methods, as appropriate, were planned, possibly after proper adjustment 
of the crossover effect over time. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, two sensitivity analyses with a different set of 
censoring rules were planned (Table below). 
Subgroup analyses 
The estimate of the treatment effect was provided for the following subgroups: 
age  (≤65  vs.  >65  years);  sex  (female  vs.  male);  race  (white  vs.  non-white);  ECOG  status  (0  vs.  1); 
geographic  region  of  enrolling  site  (East  Asia  vs.    non-East  Asia  and  East  Asia  vs.  Europe  vs.  Latin 
America  vs.  Other);  histology  (squamous  vs.  non-squamous);  smoking  status  (never  vs.  former  vs. 
current); PD-L1 status (TPS≥50% vs. TPS 1-49%, TPS≥20% vs. TPS 1-19%, and TPS≥50% vs. TPS 20-
49% vs. TPS 1-19%); Investigators’  choice  of  SOC  chemotherapy prior  to  randomization (Pemetrexed 
vs.  No  Pemetrexed);  disease  stage  (advanced  vs.  metastatic);  brain  metastasis  status  (yes  vs.  no); 
baseline tumour size (at/above median vs. below median). 
Interim analyses 
According to the last version of the protocol, two interim analyses were planned in this trial. The Table 
below provides the summary of the strategy and timing of the interim and final analyses.

under a hypothetical scenario 
Multiplicity strategy 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  hypotheses  were  analysed  using  a  sequential  testing  strategy, 
testing a hypothesis only if superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was established for all the 
preceding hypotheses. The order of testing was as follows: OS in subjects with TPS ≥50%, TPS ≥20%, 
and TPS ≥1%; PFS in TPS ≥50%, TPS ≥20%, and TPS ≥1%; and ORR in TPS ≥50%, TPS ≥20%, and TPS 
≥1%.  The  alpha  spending  at  IA2  and  FA  was  determined  by  the  Hwang-Shih-DeCani  alpha  spending 
function with the gamma parameter -0.9023.   
Change in the planned analysis and study design 
During the conduct of KEYNOTE-042 and prior to any analysis being performed, the study protocol was 
amended several times. The major changes are summarized below: 
In the original protocol (18 Jun 2014), the hypothesis was formulated on the basis of the supposed OS 
in strongly positive patients (TPS ≥50%); analyses were event-driven (final analysis at 354 OS events, 
supposed HR=0.70) and three interim analyses were contemplated (IA1 at 75 OS events observed in 
the weakly positive PD-L1 stratum; IA2 at 315 PFS events and IA3 at 283 OS events in TPS ≥50%); the 
type  I  error  rate  was  split  between  OS  (2%,  one-sided)  and  PFS  (0.5%,  that  was  a  key  secondary 
endpoint). 
With Amendment 02 (21 Dec 2015), the hypothesis also included TPS≥1%; changes in the target number 
of events were introduced (from the initial 354 OS events to 340 for the FA in TPS≥50%); the number 
of IA were reduced from 3 to 2 (IA1 at 187 OS events and IA2 at 272 OS events); the type I error was 
totally spent for OS (2.5%). 
In Amendment 03 (12 Apr 2017) an intermediate cut-off value of TPS≥20% was introduced; a single IA 
was planned at 250 OS events and with a conserved totality of OS events of 340 for FA, the HR was 
changed from 0.70 to 0.65. 
Finally, Amendment 06 (09 Jan 2018), that followed the conduction of IA1 (30 Aug 2017), re-introduced 
IA2 with an updated FA based on calendar time at 45 months and an additional IA based on calendar 
time at 38 months in order to maintain a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months. Timing and control 
of  multiplicity  were  changed  accordingly.  Under  the  revised  alpha  allocation,  the  alpha  spending  was

Page 16/106 
 
 
 
 
determined by the Hwang-Shih-DeCani with the gamma parameter -0.9023 instead of the initially set 
value -5.  With this spending, the alpha level at IA1 was the same as the actual spent at IA1 (one-sided 
1.576%) based on the scale of calendar time fraction 0.729 (i.e., 986/1353). The cumulative alpha (one-
sided) spending at the planned time of IA2 and FA became 1.94% and 2.5%, regardless of the actual 
number of deaths observed at the IA2 and FA.

Disposition for subjects with TPS ≥50% and ≥20% NSCLC was similar to that observed for the entire 
study population (TPS ≥1% NSCLC). 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 196 centres in 32 countries across Europe (22.4%), Latin America (21.1%), 
East Asia (29.0%) and other (27.5%). Randomization started on 19 Dec 2014 and was completed on 27 
Feb 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There  were  7  protocol  amendments;  of  them,  4  were  country-specific  (amendment  01  for  Sweden, 
amendments  04,  05  and  07  were  related  to  the  China  Extension  Study).  A  summary  of  the  relevant 
Assessment report

changes to KEYNOTE-042 protocol, including updates to the statistical analysis plan (SAP), are outlined 
below: 
Amendment-02: An amendment to modify the SAP based on new efficacy data from KEYNOTE-010. As 
a consequence, the futility analysis for the PD-L1 1-49% subgroup was removed from KEYNOTE-042. 
The  primary  objective  was  updated  to  include  the  primary  endpoint  for  OS  in  the  overall  TPS  ≥1% 
population in addition to the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% subgroup. The full alpha was allocated to OS, instead of 
splitting it between OS and PFS. 
Amendment-03: An amendment to update the SAP based on KEYNOTE-010 results (2L+ treatment), 
evaluating  efficacy  at  different  PD-L1  cutpoints,  and  new  data  from  KEYNOTE-024  (1L  treatment), 
showing a very strong overall survival signal. As a result, the KEYNOTE-042 SAP changed the OS primary 
endpoint to a sequential stepdown from TPS ≥50% to a new intermediate cutpoint of TPS ≥20%, to 
TPS ≥1%. Based on the updated projected timing of events and power calculations for IA1 and IA2, the 
number of planned interim analyses was reduced to one. The exponential spending function was changed 
to O’Brien-Fleming as requested by the FDA. 
Amendment-06: An amendment to update the SAP. The rate of event accrual was faster than originally 
anticipated and the FA was expected to occur in February 2018 when the elapsed time would only be 
about 38 months. In order to preserve the data maturity at the FA, a new IA was added for February 
2018  and  a  new  FA  that  preserved  the  originally  anticipated  45  months  of  follow-up.  These  changes 
required a revised alpha spending allocation that was retrospectively consistent with the alpha spent at 
IA1. Given the alpha spend of 1.576% (one-sided) at IA1, the new cumulative alpha spending follows 
the Hwang-Shih-Decani spending function with the gamma parameter -0.9023, so that the alpha actually 
spent at the IA1 will be kept intact. The power calculations were updated based on the revised alpha 
allocation and analysis timing. 
Protocol deviations 
The following table provides a summary of the most important protocol deviations by category:

EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 19/106 
 
 
 
Table 5: Summary of the most important protocol deviations (Database lock: 26 February 2018) 
In  addition,  important  administrative  protocol  deviations  were  noted  for  66  subjects  without  SAE 
reporting within 24 hours of learning of the event, 9 subjects with a delay in signing the initial consent, 
and 113 subjects that did not sign the updated safety consent following a significant safety change to 
the  risk  language  prior  to  performing  study  procedures  and/or  the  next  cycle  of  treatment.  At  a 
subsequent visit, all subjects signed the initial consent or safety consent except for 8 subjects that either 
died or withdrew from the study. According to the MAH, no subject’s safety was endangered due to the 
delay in reporting SAEs or to the delay in signing the informed consent. No subjects were excluded from 
the efficacy analyses. 
At the updated database lock (01-OCT-2018), there were 4 additional patients with important protocol 
deviations  compared  to  the  prior  cut-off  date  (2  patients:  Inclusion  #9-EGFR  sensitizing  mutation;  1 
patient:  treatment  discontinuation  requirement  not  followed;  1  patient  administration  of  prohibited 
medication (Tarceva) during the study).

Demographics for subjects with TPS ≥50% and ≥20% NSCLC were similar to those of the entire population 
(TPS ≥1% NSCLC), with no meaningful imbalances between treatment arms. 
Chemotherapy by histology 
The majority of the 375/388 subjects with non-squamous NSCLC that actually started treatment received 
pemetrexed + carboplatin, while all subjects with squamous NSCLC received paclitaxel + carboplatin. Of 
these 375 subjects, 196 (52.3%) received pemetrexed maintenance following induction chemotherapy. 
Of the 179 subjects with non-squamous NSCLC who did not receive pemetrexed maintenance, 50.3% 
experienced PD/clinical progression prior to the maintenance phase, 19.0% discontinued treatment due 
to AEs prior to the maintenance phase, and 23.5% did not receive pemetrexed maintenance because 
maintenance was not planned/specified at the time of randomization.

 Database Cutoff Date: 25OCT2019 
The hypotheses for OS across all 3 TPS cut-points (TPS ≥50%, ≥20%, and ≥1%) were met at the 
previous IA2. 
As of the data cut-off date of the FA, the median duration of follow-up was 14.0 months (range: 0.1-
43.7 months) in the ITT population. In the most up-to-date OS analysis, additional 14 months of 
follow-up were included with extension of the median follow-up period in the ITT population up to 43 
months (range: 32-58 months).

The  OS  rate  was  higher  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  than  in  the  chemotherapy  group  at  18  months 
(48.3% vs 37.4%, respectively). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Progression Free Survival 
TPS ≥50% NSCLC 
PFS was not significantly improved with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (tested at the p-
value boundary of 0.01455) in subjects with TPS ≥50% NSCLC. Therefore, subsequent secondary efficacy 
hypotheses beyond subjects with TPS ≥50% NSCLC were not formally tested at this interim analysis and 
would be tested at the final analysis.

TPS ≥20% NSCLC 
PFS was comparable for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, with an HR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.11) in 
subjects with TPS ≥20% NSCLC. The median PFS was 6.2 months for pembrolizumab and 6.6 months 
for chemotherapy. Results from the final analysis were similar to those from the second interim analysis. 
TPS ≥1% NSCLC 
PFS was comparable for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, with an HR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.21) in 
subjects with TPS ≥1% NSCLC. The median PFS was 5.4 months for pembrolizumab and 6.5 months for 
chemotherapy. Results from the final analysis were similar to those from the second interim analysis.

the TPS ≥1% NSCLC population. 
Progression-Free Survival Based on Investigator Assessment per RECIST 1.1 
The results of the analysis of PFS based on investigator assessment were consistent with the results of 
the analysis of PFS based on BICR assessment in subjects with TPS ≥50%, ≥20%, and ≥1% NSCLC.  
Objective Response Rate Based on Investigator Assessment per RECIST 1.1 
The results of the analysis of confirmed ORR based on investigator assessment were consistent with the 
results of the analysis of ORR based on BICR assessment in subjects with TPS ≥50%, ≥20%, and ≥1% 
NSCLC.  
Progression-Free Survival 2 Based on Investigator Assessment per RECIST 1.1 
A  total  of  240  subjects  (37.7%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  and  282  subjects  (44.3%)  in  the 
chemotherapy group received subsequent anti-cancer therapy upon primary therapy discontinuation. 
PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression after initiation of new 
anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever comes first, was analyzed in subjects with TPS 
≥50%, ≥20%, and ≥1% NSCLC.

At the final analysis, PFS2 HRs were consistent with what was observed at the second interim analysis. 
A  total  of  262  subjects  (41.1%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  and  294  subjects  (46.2%)  in  the 
chemotherapy  group  received  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  upon  primary  therapy  discontinuation. 
Crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab was not part of the study design. At the time of data 
cut-off, 16 of 637 subjects on chemotherapy continued on treatment. Of the remaining 621 subjects in 
the chemotherapy group, 134 (21.0%) received a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, 
avelumab, or nivolumab) as subsequent therapy during survival follow-up.

The  mortality  rates  over  time  in  the  period  before  the  curves  crossed  were  measured  individually  for

To  further  explore  the  risk  of  early  death,  a  comparison  of  baseline  characteristics  considered  to  be 
prognostic factors for treatment outcomes were evaluated in the overall TPS 1-49% population. In the 
pembrolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group, more subjects had baseline tumour size 
at/above the ITT population median (49.7% versus 44.8%), ≥3 metastasis sites (54.4% versus 49.0%), 
and liver metastases at baseline (17.2% versus 13.1%).

The baseline risk factors for mortality among patients who died or were censored in the first 3 months 
were compared with those known to have survived for at least 3 months. 
In subjects who died or were censored before 3 months versus after 3 months, a higher proportion of 
patients had liver metastasis at baseline (25.5% versus 13.2%), baseline tumour size at/above the ITT 
population median (73.6% versus 42.4%), ≥3 sites of metastasis (67.9% versus 48.7%), a higher mean 
number of lesions (5.8 versus 4.9) and a higher proportion of subjects with ECOG PS of 1 (80.2% versus 
68.0%).  
A stratified multivariate Cox regression analysis of OS with stepwise variable selection was carried out 
including the baseline characteristics identified above as well as other factors known to be of prognostic 
interest  in  NSCLC.  Baseline  tumour  size,  number  of  metastasis  sites,  and  liver  metastasis  status  at 
baseline  were  confirmed  as  risk  factors  for  early  mortality,  with  p-values  based  on  the  Wald  test  of 
<0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively.

When adjusted by baseline tumour size, the number of metastasis sites, and liver metastasis status at 
baseline,  the  OS  HR  in  favour  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  TPS  1-49%  subgroup  improved  from  0.92  to 
0.83. 
In addition, the MAH also proposed an alternative approach to further investigate the findings from the 
post hoc analysis, evaluating whether the early part of the survival curve in the TPS 1-49% subgroup 
was driven by subjects with poor prognosis, including high tumour burden. Evaluation of baseline factors 
with prognostic and predictive associations based on the totality of survival data was considered more 
appropriate for identifying patients at high risk (denoted as Control>Treatment) as well as those who 
may benefit from the experimental therapy (denoted as Treatment>Control). 
Figure 17: Permutation-based importance ranking of predictive factors 
Based on the predictive risk factor ranking, the baseline target tumour sum of longest diameters (SLD) 
was identified as the most important predictive factor for treatment benefit. A data driven cut-off of 149 
mm was estimated based on a classification tree using only baseline tumour SLD as the risk factor. For

Considering the statistical significance emerged for the interaction between smoking status and 
treatment for both the early death time window and the full dataset, further analyses were requested 
in the form a 3-way interaction study to verify the contribution of other clinical parameters to these 
results, considering that some factors (i.e. histology and sex) generally present a typical association 
with the smoking status (i.e. females and non-squamous tumour prevailing within non-smokers) (see 
Table X).

Supportive study 
The MAH presented an updated final OS analysis of KEYNOTE-024 as supportive study. 
An additional 14 months of follow-up (data cutoff 10-JUL-2017) were included in the final OS compared 
to the prior IA2. The KEYNOTE-024 updated OS analysis presented in this submission based on the FA 
was not subjected to multiplicity control, because the previous analysis of OS and PFS were positive. 
At the time of data cut-off, 14.9% of subjects in the pembrolizumab group and 1.3% of subjects in the 
chemotherapy group were continuing on their randomized study treatment, and 24.4% of subjects in 
the  chemotherapy  group  remained  on  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  crossover  phase  of  the 
study.  Among  the  subjects  randomized  to  chemotherapy,  54%  crossed  over  to  treatment  with 
pembrolizumab in the crossover phase of the study, as specified within the protocol. In the crossover 
phase,  45%  of  these  crossover  subjects  received  pembrolizumab  for  ≥6  months  and  21%  received 
pembrolizumab  for  ≥12  months.  Another  8%  of  subjects  in  the  chemotherapy  group  received 
immunotherapy as second-line therapy outside the context of the study.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the NSCLC indication, pembrolizumab monotherapy is already approved for the first-line treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic disease in PD-L1 highly positive patients (≥50% TPS) with no EGFR or 
ALK positive tumour mutations and in PD-L1 positive patients (≥1% TPS) who have received at least 
one  prior  chemotherapy  regimen,  including  approved  target  therapy  for  EGFR  and  ALK  aberrations  in 
case of positive tumour mutations. Pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy 
and pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel were also recently approved for the 
treatment of, respectively, non-squamous and squamous NSCLC treatment-naïve patients, regardless 
of PD-L1 expression.  
This application has been submitted to extend the Keytruda indication to the treatment of PD-L1 positive 
(1% TPS) advanced and metastatic NSCLC in treatment naïve patients. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KN-042  is  a  Phase  3  randomised,  open-label,  clinical  study  testing  the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab against standard of care (i.e. platinum-based doublets) in treatment-naïve advanced or 
metastatic  NSCLC  patients,  including  both  squamous  and  non-squamous  histology,  who  present  with

ALK/EGFR  negative  disease  and  a  level  of  PD-L1  tumour  expression  (TPS)  ≥1%.  The  MAH  initially 
submitted data derived from the IA2 with a date cut-off of 26-FEB-2018. During the procedure results 
were updated based on the planned final analysis (data cut-off of 4-SEP-2018); an additional extended 
OS analysis was presented, with cut-off date of 25-OCT-2019.  In addition, the final OS analysis of KN-
024 was submitted, i.e. the pivotal trial based on which pembrolizumab was approved in the first-line 
setting  of  NSCLC  with  TPS≥50%.  Although  being  considered  by  the  MAH  supportive  to  the  current 
application,  KN-024  does  not  provide  additional  efficacy  data  on  NSCLC  patients  with  a  TPS  score 
between 1-49%, which is the population of interest to the sought extension of indication. Nevertheless, 
an indirect comparison between KN-024 and KN-042 offers important points for discussion in terms of 
overall clinical performance of pembrolizumab monotherapy in NSCLC patients with TPS≥50%. 
The choice of platinum-based doublets as comparator reflects the currently recommended standard-of-
care; however, pemetrexed maintenance was optional for patients with non-squamous histology, despite 
current recommendations which could have led to an underperformance of the chemotherapy arm. In 
the  study,  23.5%  of  the  non-squamous  patients  who  were  assigned  to  the  control  group  and  started 
treatment did not receive pemetrexed maintenance because maintenance was not planned/specified at 
the time of randomization.  
As regards the open-label nature of the clinical trial, it should be acknowledged that the risk of bias was 
mitigated by the choice of the primary endpoint OS, and the blinded independent review of radiographic 
imaging based on which the secondary endpoints PFS and ORR were defined.  
The  calculation  of  the  sample  size,  which  was  based  on  hypotheses  formulated  within  the  TPS≥50% 
population, is deemed adequate. 
Histology subtype (squamous vs non-squamous), PD-L1 expression status (based on TPS score of 50% 
as the cut-point level) were among the randomisation factors (in addition to ECOG PS and geographic 
region).  The  allocation  to  the  experimental  therapy  (pembrolizumab)  or  the  comparator  arm  was 
therefore  well  balanced  as  regards  these  clinical  variables  for  a  proper  statistical  analysis.  However, 
while the randomisation was stratified based on a TPS score ≥ 50% or < 50%, the OS analysis by an 
intermediate cut-off value of ≥20% with a step-down to TPS ≥1% was added with protocol amendment 
3. The MAH specified that the intermediate cut-off point of TPS≥20% was selected based on a B-value 
plot  of  data  from  a  different  trial,  Study  KEYNOTE-010.  In  particular,  the  cut-off  of  20%  was  chosen 
because its corresponding relative treatment effect (distance to diagonal line) was relatively similar to 
that observed at TPS ≥50% (the maximum distance from the diagonal line).  
The study design was amended in several occasions with a change in the target number of events from 
the initial 354 OS events to 340 (Amendment 03), and finally 398 events (Amendment 06). The supposed 
HR  in  the  TPS  ≥  50%  population  changed  from  0.70  to  0.65.  No  sensitivity  analysis  was  planned  to 
handle missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population of the pivotal study KN-042 (1274 patients in total, 637 each in the pembrolizumab 
and  control  arm)  can  be  considered  overall  representative  of  the  population  targeted  by  the  sought 
indication with regard to disease staging (87.4% stage IV, 10.8% stage IIIB and 1.8% stage IIIA) and 
histology (61.7% non-squamous and 38.6% squamous).  
Baseline characteristics as well as demographics appear well balanced between treatment arms in the 
ITT  population  (TPS≥1%).  Demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  also  similar  between 
experimental and control groups as stratified by the PD-L1 cut-off levels, with the exception, within both 
the TPS≥20% ≥50% groups, of a slight difference in tumour sizes above the ITT median between arms 
(50.7% vs 38.7% and 51.8% vs 40.7% in the pembrolizumab and control, respectively). The prevalence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 65/106 
 
 
 
of  the  different  PDL-1  score  within  the  study  population  is  adequately  representative  of  the  distinct 
categories (35.2% and 36.4% in the pembrolizumab and control arm for TPS 1-19%; 17.9% and 16.5% 
in pembrolizumab and control group for TPS 20-49%; 46.9% and 47.1% in pembrolizumab and control 
group for TPS ≥50%), thus rendering the efficacy analysis by TPS numerically appropriate. Nevertheless, 
a remarkable low number of females is included in the study. Due to the exclusion of patients with EGFR 
or ALK positive tumour mutations, no data are available for this group of patients. Moreover, data are 
restricted to patients with good performance status and adequate organ functions. 
At  the  IA2  (cut-off  date:  26-Feb-2018),  the  median  duration  of  follow-up  was  13.4  months  and  12.2 
months for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The comparison between pembrolizumab and SoC within 
the ITT population comprising all patients with a TPS≥1% demonstrated superiority of pembrolizumab 
vs SoC, with a gain of 4 months in median OS and HR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; p=0.0018). As expected, 
the  clinical  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  over  chemotherapy  increased  by  PD-L1  score,  with  the  highest 
advantage in OS being observed in the TPS ≥ 50% subcategory (a gain of 8 months with HR 0.69;95% 
CI: 0.56, 0.85; p=0.0003), which slightly decreased in the TPS ≥ 20% group (a gain of around 4 months 
in OS with HR 0.77;95% CI: 0.64, 0.92; p=0.0020). These results were achieved with an OS maturity 
of 89.9% at IA2. 
During the procedure, the MAH provided results of the final analysis (data cutoff: 04-Sep-2018), with 
additional 6 months of follow-up compared to IA2. Overall, the final analysis results confirmed previous 
findings from IA2. Moreover, an extended OS analysis with cutoff date of 25-Oct-2019 was submitted, 
providing 14 months of additional follow-up from the last reported protocol-specified FA. These newly 
presented  data  consolidate  the  previous  analyses  showing  a  long-term  benefit  of  pembrolizumab 
compared to chemotherapy in terms of OS gain within the ITT population,  with the magnitude of the 
long-term benefit being dependent upon PD-L1 level of expression. 
Differently  from  what  had  been  observed  in  KN-024,  in  which  the  KM  curves  for  OS  demonstrated 
continuous separation from Month 1 favouring pembrolizumab, KN-042 showed an initial advantage of 
SoC  over  pembrolizumab  with  a  crossing  of  OS  KM  curves  at  Month  8  that  was  reported  in  the  ITT 
population. Importantly, such higher risk of early death is evident also for the TPS ≥ 50% subgroup, 
with OS KM curves crossing at month 7 (see below risk of early death).   
Unlike study KN-024, the analysis of PFS as assessed by BICR in study KN-042 within the TPS ≥ 50% 
group did not show a statistically significant benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy (HR=0.81, 
95%  CI  0.67-0.99;  p=0.0170  for  a  tested  p-value=0.01455).  Although  a  trend  towards  a  more 
advantageous overall effect of pembrolizumab vs control can be recognised, the Kaplan-Meier curves of 
PFS show an early separation in favour of chemotherapy up to Month 6, when the curves cross. The HR 
was 0.94 (95% CI 0.80-1.11) in TPS ≥20% and 1.07 (95% CI 0.94 -1.21) in TPS ≥1%. Investigator-
based analyses were consistent with the independent data review. 
Similarly, no statistically significant superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was demonstrated 
in ORR (CR+PR, 39.5% vs 32%), while disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was higher for chemotherapy, 
regardless  of  the  level  of  PD-L1  expression,  even  in  the  TPS  ≥50%  subgroup  (76.3%  vs  68.9%).  A 
progressive  decline  in  ORR  was  observed  according  to  a  reduction  in  TPS  score,  so  that  in  the  ITT 
population (TPS ≥1%) an even more marked advantage of SoC vs pembrolizumab was reported in terms 
of disease control rate (78.8% vs 65.9% in chemotherapy and pembrolizumab, respectively). However, 
responders  to  pembrolizumab  had  a  longer  response  duration  compared  to  the  control  group  (20.2 
months vs 8.3 months in median). Data were confirmed by investigator-based analyses. 
As regards PFS2, pembrolizumab performed better than chemotherapy in all TPS categories.

Even though an optimal cut-off was not known when the studies were designed, a relationship between 
PD-L1 expression level and pembrolizumab activity was known: the principle outlined in several SAs on 
the need to provide enough evidence in the complementary PD-L1 expression subgroups when it was 
expected that results in the overall population could be driven by the most responsive subgroup should 
have been followed.  
The MAH provided OS subgroup analysis for TPS 1-49% that was pre-specified in the protocol, although 
as exploratory, which is considered relevant in the context of this extension of indication from TPS≥50% 
to TPS≥1% NSCLC patients. The overall effect (OS HR=0.81, 95%IC: 0.71-0.93) in the ITT population 
(TPS≥1%) seems to be driven by the strong effect observed in the TPS≥50% group (HR=0.69, 95%CI 
0.56-0.85).  The first part of the OS KM curves for the TPS 1-49% subgroup favoured chemotherapy, 
and then the curves started to approach one another and crossed around Month 10 (see also discussion 
on risk of early death). 
PFS in TPS 1-49% NSCLC appears clearly in favour of the standard treatment (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.12, 
1.56, median PFS 4.2 vs 6.8 months). Of note, DOR in this subgroup is doubled compared to control, 
with  median  DOR:  17.4  vs  8.2  months.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  responders  was  lower  in  the 
pembrolizumab group vs. the chemotherapy group with response rates of 16.5% vs 21.3%, respectively.  
Overall, no superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy could be detected. The MAH stated that 
the  exploratory  subgroup  analysis  for  TPS  1-49%  was  pre-specified  in  the  protocol  but  was 
underpowered  and  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  not  planned  in  the  SAP.  This  is  not  agreed,  since 
patients  with  TPS  1-49%  contributed  to  53%  of  the  study  population,  and  56%  of  the  total  deaths 
occurred in this group. Therefore, it is considered that the study provided a reliable estimate of treatment 
effect in the TPS 1-49% population.  
Risk of early death 
The  fact  that  the  survival  curves  crossed  around  month  6  in  all  TPS  groups  not  only  poses  a 
methodological concern in using the Cox model for the primary analysis, but also raises doubts on the 
opportunity  to  express  the  treatment  effect  over  time  with  an  overall  HR.  In  light  of  the  statistical 
hypotheses that underly the study, the MAH was asked to provide the treatment effect before month 6 
and after month 6 for all the three TPS groups and provide the additional sensitivity analyses planned 
to address the issue of the violation of proportional hazards.  
The  provided  HRs  were  above  1  for  both  OS  and  PFS  before  6  months,  and  below  1  after  6  months, 
across  all  TPS  scores.  Restricted  mean  survival  time  (RMST)  was  provided  as  protocol  pre-specified 
sensitivity analysis in the event of proportional hazard (PH) violation. The RMST is, in fact, suitable even 
in the absence of PH. According to the RMST analyses, for TPS≥1%, the OS was not statistically different 
till month 18, with only a modest improvement after 24 months (1.17 months) and 30 months (1.76 
months)  of  follow  up.  No  improvement  in  PFS  was  observed.  The  same  considerations  apply  to  the 
TPS≥20% subgroup where the OS improved by 1.33 months after 24 months and 1.91 months after 30 
months  of  follow  up.  This  sensitivity  analysis  is  not  supporting  a  clinically  significant  effect  of 
pembrolizumab in the TPS≥1% population. On the contrary, a long-term benefit of pembrolizumab on 
both PFS and OS can be recognised in the TPS≥50% subgroup with a gain of 2.81 months in OS after 
30 months of follow-up. However, no effect was observed up to 6 months of follow-up, and between 12 
and  18  months  of  therapy  the  OS  improvement  achieved  with  pembrolizumab  is  marginal  (data  not 
shown). The first part of the OS KM curves for the TPS 1-49% subgroup favour chemotherapy, and then 
the curves start to approach one another and cross around Month 10. A piecewise hazard rate analysis 
revealed a detrimental effect of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy during the first 3 months of treatment 
(HR of 1.29, 1.95 and 2.13 at Month 1, 2 and 3 respectively) in this subgroup, with a total of 66 OS 
events  occurring  in  the  experimental  arm  vs  37  in  the  control  arm.  A  comparison  of  the  baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 67/106 
 
 
 
characteristics between treatment arms showed some slight unbalance in tumour size (under/above ITT 
median; 49.7% vs 44.8% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively), metastasis sites (≥3 or less than 
3; 54.4% vs 49% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively) and liver metastasis (17.2% vs 13.1% in 
pembrolizumab and control, respectively) that could have favoured chemotherapy in the first 3 months.  
The observed crossing of OS KM curves in the TPS≥50% subgroup is relevant for the currently approved 
indication and a similar piecewise hazard rate analysis was requested for this subgroup. The monthly 
piecewise hazard rate demonstrated a higher risk in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy in the 
first  two  months  and  at  month  4,  with  HR  1.69,  1.94  and  1.84  respectively.  Therefore,  the  MAH  has 
selected  the  4-month  cutoff  for  the  evaluation  of  baseline  potential  risk  factors  in  the  TPS  ≥50% 
subgroup  which  is  acceptable.  The  MAH  identified  some  variables  indicative  of  burden  of  disease  as 
predictors of early deaths since they were more common in patients who died before 4 months vs after 
4 months (baseline tumour size, number of metastasis sites, and liver metastasis status at baseline). 
Consequently, an adjusted Cox model was run with these factors used as covariates. 
The  MAH  performed  additional  post-hoc  analyses  in  the  ITT  population,  and  in  both  TPS  1-49%  and 
TPS>=50% groups, in order to identify factors/combination of factors able to explain the early crossing 
of curves. The max-combo test was also suggested, to take into account the PH violation in detecting 
differences in survival between subgroups identified by possible combination of factors. The MAH also 
performed the random forest classification for TPS 1-49% population.  
The MAH concluded that in subjects with TPS ≥50% and ≥1% NSCLC, baseline liver metastasis and never 
smoker  status  appeared  to  predict  poorer  response  to  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  the  initial  4 
months of treatment, and the observed OS benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy 
was improved by excluding these subjects from the analysis. 
A  more  evident  unbalance  in  tumour  sizes  above  the  ITT  median  was  observed  between  treatments 
within both the TPS≥20% (50.7% vs 38.7%) and TPS≥50% groups (51.8% vs 40.7% in pembrolizumab 
and control, respectively).  
In the TPS 1-49% subgroup, no definitive factors predictive of early mortality were identified with the 
proposed in-depth analyses and the Random Forest analysis identifying the tumour burden as the most 
important predictive factor, corroborating findings of the previous analyses. However, some factors were 
excluded from these analyses and some indications of interaction between factors and treatment were 
not adequately explored. Several factors were indicated that seem to be associated to an increased risk 
of Pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy, but they were not adequately explored. Furthermore, 
these analyses are limited due to the exploratory nature, the lack of multiplicity control, and the limited 
number  of  events  occurring  in  the  first  months.  Additionally,  factors  indicated  by  the  CHMP  to  be 
associated with an increased risk of early death with pembrolizumab treatment compared with platinum-
doublet chemotherapy were included in a multivariate model to further explore treatment interaction for 
the dataset restricted to early death window and for the full dataset. Contradicting results in terms of 
potential predictive factors were observed in TPS 1-49% and TPS≥50% subgroups, making any statement 
on the ITT population of TPS≥1% inconclusive.  
Overall,  no  clear  explanation,  even  from  the  biological  perspective,  was  provided  for  the  early  death 
observation. The provided data do not to alleviate the CHMP concerns on the higher risk of early death 
observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy vs SoC in this setting. This is even more relevant for the 
TPS 1-49% group for which no clear long-term benefit has been observed, making the uncertainty on 
the short-term outcome not acceptable. 
For both the TPS-1-49% and TPS≥50% subgroups, the MAH was also asked to investigate the cause of 
death for each of the OS events occurring in each arm before the crossing of the K-M OS curves, and, 
separately, for those occurring in the timeframes in which a higher risk of death for pembrolizumab was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 68/106 
 
 
 
identified based on piecewise hazard rate analyses (e.g. 3 months for the TPS 1-49% subgroup). The 
main cause of death during both the follow-up period before the K-M OS curve crossing (10.3 months 
for TPS 1-49% and 6.7 months for TPS≥50%) and the first months of therapy that were unfavourable 
for pembrolizumab as based on piecewise HRs (3 months for TPS 1-49% and 4 months for TPS≥50%), 
was malignant progression. More cases of malignant progression were reported in the pembrolizumab 
arm in the two distinct PD-L1 level of expression subpopulations (TPS≥50%: 34/299 [11.4%] vs 24/300 
[8%] before 4 months; TPS 1-49%: 33/338 [9.8%] vs 19/337 [5.6%] before 3 months). Although the 
benefit/risk balance of pembrolizumab in the TPS ≥50% population is not questioned, the higher number 
of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
An  additional  analysis  was  run  to  compare  the  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  who  died/were 
censored within the first 3 months and those who survived for at least 3 months, in order to identify risk 
factors for early death. Since the variables identified by the MAH as risk factors for early death were the 
same  for  which  an  unbalance  at  baseline  was  observed,  a  multivariate  Cox  model  using  a  stepwise 
selection was performed, by using the baseline characteristics identified above as well as other factors 
known to be prognostic in NSCLC. The model was applied to the entire follow-up period, and therefore 
the totality of the events, and resulted in an improvement of the HR from 0.92 to 0.83. In order to better 
understand how much the higher risk in treatment group in the first 3 months could be explained by this 
bias, the MAH was asked to limit the multivariate analysis to the first 3 months of follow-up only. The 
MAH has conducted a data analysis limited to the initial period of treatment when a major risk of fatalities 
for pembrolizumab was observed. A multivariate analysis was conducted for the first 3 (TPS 1-49%) and 
4 months (TPS ≥50% and TPS ≥1%) of follow-up only. Additional analyses were conducted using both 
the  Cox  regression  model  and  Random  Forest  for  early  death,  in  order  to  test  several  factors  for 
treatment  interaction  within  the  early  time  window as  well  as  the  full  dataset.  However,  results  were 
somewhat inconsistent across PD-L1 subgroups not allowing to identify credible predictive factors of high 
risk of early death or overall response to pembrolizumab. This is even more relevant for the TPS 1-49% 
in  which  no  clear  long-term  benefit  has  been  observed,  making  the  uncertainty  on  the  short  term 
outcome not justified. 
The analysis performed in subjects with TPS≥50% were requested to be replicated in study KN024 in 
order  to  get  all  the  available  information.  Moreover,  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  inconsistency 
between  study  KN042  and  KN024,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  a  comparison  of  the  risk  factors, 
especially those found to correlate to risk of early death between the two trials, by treatment group. The 
between-arm  comparison  in  KEYNOTE-024  of  the  clinical  characteristics  of  subjects  who  died/were 
censored before 4 months revealed an opposite trend in the distribution of factors associated with higher 
tumour burden including baseline tumour size and liver metastasis (more frequent in the chemotherapy 
than  pembrolizumab  group)  with  respect  to  the  observed  frequency  of  these  in  KEYNOTE-042  (more 
frequent in pembrolizumab than chemo). Consistent with this, more patients among those treated with 
pembrolizumab  and  who  died/were  censored  before  4  months  had  liver  metastasis  at  baseline  in 
KEYNOTE-042 (35.2% vs 16.7% in the chemo arm) compared to KEYNOTE-024 (13.0% vs 32.3% in the 
chemo arm). Although with a less pronounced difference, an unbalance between trials was observed also 
in  tumour  burden>median  (68.5%  vs  56.5%  in  KEYNOYE-042  vs  KEYNOTE-024  respectively  in  the 
pembrolizumab group with a similar rate in their respective chemo arms: 71.4% and 74.2%). Moreover, 
a higher tumour size at baseline characterised patients in the pembrolizumab group of KEYNOTE-042 
(140.3 mm in mean) compared to KEYNOYE-024 (97.7 mm in mean), with a similar value in the chemo 
group of the two trials (148.9 and 142.5 mm). The MAH reported no interaction or influence of these 
parameters indicative of aggressive disease on OS HR in the individual analysis of KEYNOTE-024 during 
both, the entire follow-up period and the first 4 months of treatment. However, it is acknowledged that 
the different distributions of these factors between KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 could potentially 
explain  the  difference  in  outcomes  observed  between  the  two  studies.  The  MAH  explored  factors

identified  in  subjects  with  TPS  ≥50%  NSCLC  KN-042  as  predictor  of  higher  risk  of  early  death  in 
Pembrolizumab group compared with chemotherapy, also in the study KN-024. In this study the crossing 
of  curves  was  not  observed  and  therefore  the  analysis  was  limited  to  the  first  4  months  only  for 
uniformity.  Exploration  of  factors/combination  of  factors  identified  in  subjects  with  TPS  ≥50%  NSCLC 
from  KEYNOTE-042  in  KEYNOTE-024  did  not  demonstrate  consistent  findings.  A  possible  explanation 
could  be  the  different  histology  in  the  two  studies,  since  in  KN-042,  37%  of  the  recruited  TPS≥50% 
population had squamous tumour while in KN-024 was 18%. The individual analysis of KN-024 and KN-
042  was  somewhat  inconclusive,  and  for  some  aspects  even  contradictory.  Particularly,  the  MAH 
concluded that presence of baseline liver metastasis suggests a poor outcome for pembrolizumab in the 
first  4  months  of  treatment;  however,  the  statistical  significance  related  to  this  parameter  in  the 
treatment interaction analysis does not seem to indicate a relevant effect and was not confirmed in the 
multivariate model applied to all data. The uncertainty of the finding is further reinforced by lack of data 
reproducibility in KN-024, where results show an even opposite direction for this parameter within the 
same  time  window.  The  interaction  between  liver  metastasis  and  treatment  is  absent  in  the  pooled 
analysis as both limited to the early death time window and the whole dataset. Pooled analyses from 
Study KN-042 and KN-024 seem to suggest that the never smoker status is predictor of poor outcome 
on pembrolizumab both in the early time window and in the whole dataset follow-up.  
Given the impact of these findings on the currently approved indication of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy for patients with TPS ≥50%, further exploration of these data testing combination of 
more factors (i.e. a 3 term interaction factor analysis) was undertaken revealing that among the 
different clinical parameters included in the model, histology (but not liver metastasis) seems to 
interact with smoking status and treatment by judging on the basis of a significant p value (0.034) in 
the pooled population analysis. In particular, the OS K-M curves showed that smokers and never 
smokers within the non-squamous histology group present with an opposite trend in terms of response 
to chemotherapy that consequently makes the effect of pembrolizumab more advantageous in the 
smokers and less advantageous in non-smokers compared to chemotherapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 
of the SmPC). Pemetrexed maintenance 
The  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  over  chemotherapy  as  expressed  by  OS  HR  appears  higher  when 
compared against absence than presence of pemetrexed maintenance across all TPS scores. Considering 
the optimal SoC only, which includes the group receiving pemetrexed maintenance, data (ITT=341 pts 
assigned  to  chemotherapy  vs  328  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.89  [95%  CI:  0.73,  1.09],  p=0.124) 
confirm the trend of the primary outcome in the total study population (TPS ≥1%; ITT=637 pts assigned 
to  chemo  vs  637  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.81  [95%  CI:  0.71,  0.93],  p=0.0018).  The  same 
consideration can be applied to the TPS≥50% subpopulation (ITT=166 pts assigned to chemotherapy 
vs  157  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.83  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.12],  p=0.1129)  when  compared  with  the 
respective  group  encompassing  all  histologies  (ITT=300  pts  assigned  to  chemotherapy  vs  299  to 
pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.69  [95%  CI:  0.56,  0.85],  p=0.0003).  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that 
Investigator’s  choice  of  pemetrexed  maintenance  did  not  constitute  a  bias  in  data  interpretation  and 
analysis (Data not shown).  
Subgroup analyses 
The  efficacy of  the  experimental  treatment  in  the advanced  cancer  (stage  III)  was  similar  to  the  one 
observed in both the metastatic tumour and the overall population. Although limited to 12.6% of the ITT 
population, the prevalence of patients with “locally advanced” tumour comprising stages IIIA and IIIB is 
consistent with the expected distribution of disease stages at diagnosis in the “real world”. Moreover, 
there were no unbalances in the number of patients with stage III cancer between treatment arms. For 
completeness, the MAH specified upon request disease stage in the baseline characteristics of study KN-
042 reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The prevalence of locally advanced cancer within the TPS ≥
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 70/106 
 
 
 
50% group was 10.4% (62 subjects). Due to the small number of subjects, the efficacy data from this 
post  hoc  subgroup  analysis  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  however  the  efficacy  data  in  locally 
advanced disease are consistent with results in metastatic cancer patients. 
The geographic area was associated with a variable degree of efficacy of pembrolizumab compared to 
control, with a lower performance in OS being reported for the EU (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.79-1.40) than 
non-EU region (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63 -0.87). A stratified multivariate COX-regression analysis adjusted 
by  the  metastasis  number,  tumour  size  and  liver  metastasis  at  baseline  only  slightly  modified  the 
outcome (HR for EU-region of 0.98).  
The MAH presented results across the different PD-L1 categories as stratified by histology and showed 
that  squamous  and  non-squamous  NSCLC  behave  similarly  in  terms  of  response  to  pembrolizumab 
regardless  of  PD-L1  score.  In  comparing  the  KM  curves  of  the  control  arms,  the  squamous  histology 
presented with a worse clinical outcome than the non-squamous tumour subtype, and this resulted into 
an apparent higher advantage of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy for the squamous histology, across 
all the different TPS categories, albeit differences between histologies were not statistically significant.  
The MAH has discussed the negative effect of pembrolizumab in PFS for females and never smokers by 
comparing  the  subgroup  point  estimates  of  the  PFS  forest  plots  with  the  overall  population,  together 
with the OS forest plots of study KEYNOTE-042, to conclude that a dissociation between PFS and OS was 
observed in both subgroups and similarly to the overall TPS≥1% population. The results of a post-hoc 
exploratory  subgroup  analysis  indicated  a  trend  towards  reduced  survival  benefit  of  pembrolizumab 
compared  to  chemotherapy,  during  both  the  first  4  months  and  throughout  the  entire  duration  of 
treatment, in patients who were never-smokers. However, due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup 
analysis, no definitive conclusions can be drawn (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The increases in the risk of early death, particularly marked in the subgroup of patients expressing PD-
L1 1-49% TPS, and the lack of identified clinical indicators for the proper selection of patients do not 
allow  concluding  on  a  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy.  The  MAH 
during  the  procedure  decided  to  no  longer  pursue  the  extension  of  indication  to  include  the  first-line 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer tumours for patients expressing 
PD-L1  1-49%  TPS,  based  on  data  from  study  KEYNOTE-042.  The  scope  of  the  Type  II  variation 
application is therefore revised to reflect an update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to 
include the data from KEYNOTE-042.

Laboratory findings 
In the KEYNOTE-042 Dataset, the most frequently reported (incidence >30%) laboratory abnormalities 
with  a  clinically  meaningful  worsening  in  CTCAE  grade  (all  grades)  in  subjects  treated  with 
pembrolizumab were increased glucose (51.8%), decreased haemoglobin (43.1%), decreased albumin 
(33.3%), increased ALT (32.9%), increased AST (31.4%), and decreased sodium (30.6%).  There were 
no important differences from the Reference Safety Dataset in the incidence of laboratory abnormalities. 
Nearly all changes from baseline in laboratory abnormalities in KEYNOTE-042 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. 
Grade  3  to  4  laboratory  abnormalities  occurred  much  more  frequently  in  subjects  treated  with 
chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab. Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality occurred in >9% of 
subjects  treated  with  pembrolizumab,  whereas  abnormalities  in  several  parameters  were  observed  in 
>10% of subjects treated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory 
abnormalities  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  occurred  with  similar  or  lower  frequencies  compared  with 
those  in  the  chemotherapy  group.  The  most  common  Grade  3  to  4  laboratory  abnormalities  in  both 
treatment groups were as follows:

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 03-Sept-2018 through 03-Sep-2019. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH presented a comparison of the safety profile of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy as first-line 
treatment  of  NSCLC  through  an  individual  analysis  of  Study  KN-042  (ASaT  population:  636  and  615 
patients in the pembrolizumab and control arm) as well as a pooled database incorporating KN-042 and 
KN-024 (ASaT population: 790 and 765 patients in the pembrolizumab and control arm). The safety data 
derived from the clinical experience with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of NSCLC was compared 
to the Reference Dataset (RDS; N=3830) and cumulative Database (CDS; N=5246), mainly including 
trials of pembrolizumab in the second-line therapy of distinct clinical indications. 
The duration of exposure was longer for pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (mean 253.3 vs 
156.6 days and median number of administrations 9 vs. 6, respectively). A total of 302 (47.5%) subjects 
in the pembrolizumab group and 143 (23.3%) subjects in the chemotherapy group received treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/299815/2020  
Page 96/106 
 
 
 
 
 
for ≥ 6 months. As expected for the 1L NSCLC setting the mean exposure to pembrolizumab in KN042 
was  also  longer  compared  with  the  RSD  (8.3  months  vs  6.7  months,  respectively)  as  were  the 
proportions of subjects exposed to pembrolizumab for ≥12 months (29.4% vs 20.5%). 
Pembrolizumab treatment favorably compares with chemotherapy in terms of drug-related AEs (62.7% 
vs 89.9%), Grade≥3 AEs (50% vs 57.1%), drug-related Grade≥3 AEs (17.8% vs 41%), serious drug-
related  AEs  (13.7  vs  14.6%).  Similarly,  pembrolizumab  treatment  favorably  compares  with 
chemotherapy in relation to treatment discontinuation due to drug-related AEs (19.2% vs 14.5%) and 
treatment  discontinuation  due  to  SAEs  (16%  vs  9.3%)  and  drug-related  SAEs  (6.1%  vs  4.2%).  The 
longer  exposure  of  patients  to  pembrolizumab  rather  than  chemotherapy  (9  vs.  6  administrations  in 
median) accounts for an even more favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab following adjustment by 
exposure time (overall AEs rate of 83.16 vs 170.33 events/100 person-months). Similarly, exposure-
adjusted grade 3-5 AEs (10.49 vs 21.85 events/100 person-months) and SAEs (6.93 vs 8.05 events/100 
person-months) occurred at a lower frequency in the pembrolizumab than control arm, while a similar 
incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  found  between  treatments  (2.25  vs  2.74  events/100 
person-months). 
As  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  disease  specific  setting  and  prior  experience  with  pembrolizumab, 
endocrine  (hypothyroidism),  skin  (rash)  and  respiratory  disorders  (dyspnoea,  cough  and  pneumonia) 
were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  in  the  experimental  arm  of  KN-042  (>10%  incidence),  while 
gastrointestinal (vomiting, constipation and nausea) and blood disturbances (myelosuppression) were 
the prevailing AEs in the chemotherapy group (all of them with an incidence >10%). The incidence of 
overall  AEs  in  the  KN-042  pembrolizumab  dataset  was  comparable  to  the  RDS  and  CDS;  however, 
pneumonia occurred more frequently in the pivotal trial than previously reported (11.9% incidence vs 
4.7%  and  5.4%  in  the  RDS  and  CDS,  respectively)  likely  due  to  the  underlying  disease  of  the  study 
population.  
Drug-related  AEs  were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  chemotherapy  (89.9%)  than  pembrolizumab 
(62.7%) group.  
Overall analysis of Grade 3 to 5 AEs was in favour of the pembrolizumab group; Grade 3 to 5 AEs were 
reported  in  50.0%  of  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  and  57.1%  in  the  chemotherapy  group. 
Analysis of exposure-adjusted event rates of Grade 3 to 5 AEs showed that the rate for pembrolizumab 
group was half of the rate for the chemotherapy group (10.49 vs 21.85 events/100 person-months) and 
the  median  time  to  first  Grade  3  to  5  AE  was  longer  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  than  in  the 
chemotherapy  group  (49.4  weeks  vs  17.0  weeks).  These  numerical  differences  in  Grade  3-5  AEs 
appeared to be mainly driven by the higher proportion of haematological toxicities in the chemotherapy 
group. 
 Among the Grade 3-5 AEs, pneumonitis was the main event that was causally-related to pembrolizumab 
in study KN-042 (3.1% vs 0% in the control), followed by drug-related ALT increase (1.4% vs 0.8%); 
both  of  them  presented  with  a  higher  frequency  than  in  the  prior  datasets  (1.2%  and  1.3%  for 
pneumonitis  in  the  RDS  and  CDS;  0.5%  and  0.7%  for  ALT  increase  in  the  RDS  and  CDS)  as  also 
confirmed by the exposure-adjustment analysis. Similar considerations apply to the analysis of SAEs, 
for which pneumonia was reported in 7.4% of patients receiving pembrolizumab vs 5.2% assigned to 
chemotherapy (no cases of pneumonia were considered drug-related), and pneumonitis in 3.9% of the 
experimental  arm  (all  cases  considered  drug-related)  vs  0.2%  in  the  control.  The  incidence  of 
pneumonitis as drug-related SAE was higher in KN-042 (3.9%) compared to the RDS (1.8%) and CDS 
(1.7%); this is likely due to the specific NSCLC-disease setting. The MAH provided further analyses on 
immune-related  pneumonitis,  and  consequently  updated  the  SmPC  to  present  incidence  rates  of 
pneumonitis  for  all  patients,  for  patients  with  NSCLC  and  for  subjects  with  and  without  prior  thoracic 
irradiation in the pooled monotherapy population.

Additionally,  numerically  higher  rates  for  Grade  3  to  5  cardiac  disorders  were  notable  with  4.4%  for 
pembrolizumab  in  KN-042  vs.  2.8%  in  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset;  (Exposure  adjusted  rates  for 
cardiac disorders were 0.6 events/100 person-months in the pembrolizumab group of KN-042 compared 
to 0.3 in the chemotherapy group of KN-042). Rates of drug-related grade 3-5 cardiac disorders were 
1.4% vs. 0.2%, respectively. Of note are the high incidences of serious cardiac disorder events in the 
pembrolizumab arm of KN-042. Serious cardiac disorders were also slightly higher compared to the RSD. 
In the analysis of SAEs by SOC 4.2% of subjects experienced a cardiac disorder in the KN-042 Dataset 
for pembrolizumab compared to 3.1% of subjects in the RSD. The higher rate of events in the KEYNOTE-
042 pembrolizumab group was driven by increases in the frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs of 
cardiac arrest, cardiac failure/cardiac failure acute, myocardial infarction, and, more notably, pericardial 
effusion and cardiac tamponade as compared with chemotherapy and the RSD. However, interpretation 
of these data is difficult. It is acknowledged that the observed differences may be partially related to the 
longer exposure to pembrolizumab in the 1L NSCLC setting and that underlying disease progression and 
pre-existing conditions are confounding factors to assess the clear contribution of pembrolizumab to the 
manifestation  of  the  events.  Moreover,  small  events  numbers  further  hamper  drawing  definitive 
conclusions. However, cardiac toxicity will need persistent attention with further evolving safety data. 
A  higher  rate  of  deaths  due  to  AEs  in  the  KN-042  was  observed  with  pembrolizumab  arm  (11%) 
compared  to chemotherapy (7.5%). The overall incidence of deaths due  to AEs in this trial was even 
higher compared with the Reference Safety Dataset (4.1%), and with Study KN-024 (7.8%). The cause 
of  death  was  most  frequently  unknown  (10/70  patients,  1.6%),  followed  bypneumonia  (1.3%), 
pulmonary  embolism  (0.9%),  pulmonary  haemorrhage  (0.6%)  and  respiratory  failure  (0.5%).  The 
findings  of  a  higher  rate  of  deaths  compared  to  Study  KN-024,  together  with  the  observation  of  the 
higher risk of early deaths reported in Study KN-042 (but not in Study KN-024) raises concerns. A review 
of AEs resulting in death for each arm, ordered by the time from randomization and the type of event 
did not raise concerns. They were mainly respiratory and cardiovascular causes, the majority of them 
being not considered causally related to the study drug by the Investigator.  
While the number of subjects who died due to an AE was generally similar between the pembrolizumab 
and  chemotherapy  groups  for  subjects  with  TPS  ≥50%,  more  subjects  died  due  to  an  AE  in  the 
pembrolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group for TPS 1-49% group. This is driven by 
the  higher  percentage  of  subjects  with  PD  as  the  best  overall  response.  Across  all  subgroups  a  large 
proportion  of  patients  had  “no  assessment”,  probably  related  to  an  early  death  with  no  subsequent 
imaging assessment for response. Overall, these data indicate that the higher rates of death due to an 
AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low PD-L1 expression subgroup 
than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
No major differences emerged in the analysis of safety in special populations that showed a similar profile 
across  patient  subgroups  by  either  intrinsic  or  extrinsic  factors,  between  KN-042  and  the  reference 
datasets.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  AEs  generally  increased  with  increasing  age  for  all  AE 
categories for both pembrolizumab and chemotherapy and no major concerns emerged regarding the 
tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  elderly  NSCLC  patients  (although  the  limitations  of  the 
still small patient numbers in the age group beyond 75 years have be taken into account).  
In terms of AEs leading to drug discontinuation, the exposure-adjusted analysis indicates a similar profile 
of pembrolizumab between study KN-042 and the reference datasets. 
Finally, AEOSIs in KN-042 occurred at a similar frequency than previously reported with the exception 
of hypothyroidism (12.1% vs 9.1% in RSD and 9.6% in CSD), pneumonitis (8.3% vs 3.7% in RSD and 
4% in CSD) and hyperthyroidism (6.1% vs 3.5% in RSD and 3.8% in CSD) which could be attributable 
Assessment report

Page 98/106 
 
 
 
to both the longer treatment in KN-042 than the reference datasets as well as NSCLC disease-specific 
setting.  Of  note,  the  majority  of  these  events  were  of  Grade  1-2.  As  discussed  above,  the  higher 
incidence  of  pneumonitis  and  the  relative  figures  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  analysis  of 
hypothyroidism  and  hyperthyroidism  events  was  comparable  in  NSCLC  and  non-NSCLC  populations, 
therefore the SmPC has not been updated.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy that emerges from KN-042 is overall consistent with 
the prior clinical experience. Of note, the comparison with chemotherapy revealed a more favourable 
outcome  achieved  with  pembrolizumab  in  NSCLC  patients.  Further  analyses  indicated  that  the  higher 
rates of death due to an AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low 
PD-L1 expression subgroup than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
A somewhat worse toxicity profile is notable for pembrolizumab in the 1L NSCLC indication compared to 
the  reference  safety  dataset,  which  might  be  partly  attributable  to  a  slightly  longer  exposure  of 
pembrolizumab and the underlying disease.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the results from study KEYNOTE-
042; an international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study investigating KEYTRUDA monotherapy 
compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic PD-L1 positive (TPS ≥ 1%) NSCLC. Particularly, a new warning with regard to a higher 
number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation of Keytruda monotherapy compared to 
chemotherapy has been added to the product information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups..

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
With the current application, the MAH was initially seeking an extension of indication for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous and non-squamous metastatic 
and locally advanced NSCLC with a positive PD-L1 score (TPS ≥1%) and negative for EGFR and ALK 
gene mutations. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current guidelines recommend the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy for the treatment of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), i.e. the prevailing histological subtype (85%-90%) of all lung malignancies, as 
follows: 
- 
First-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours have high PD-L1 
expression [Tumour Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%] with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour aberrations  
-  Advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) and who have 
received  prior  platinum-based  therapy,  and  if  the  tumours  express  EGFR  or  ALK  genomic  tumour 
aberrations should have disease progression on approved therapy before receiving Keytruda. 
Moreover,  Keytruda  is  currently  authorised  as  add-on  therapy  to  pemetrexed  and  platinum 
chemotherapy as first-line option for patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, irrespective of the 
PD-L1  level  of  expression.  However,  the  combined  therapy  was  proven  to  hold  higher  toxicity  than 
chemotherapy alone, particularly in elderly patients. This could represent an important limitation to the 
use of this therapeutic scheme on the basis of patient tolerability, particularly for those with a TPS < 
50% for whom chemotherapy would be the only licensed therapy. The same applies to squamous NSCLC, 
for which pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel has been approved in first-line. 
The treatment of NSCLC remains a high unmet medical need.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-042  is  the  pivotal  trial  supporting  this  application.  It  is  a  Phase  3,  randomized,  open-label, 
controlled  clinical  study  of  pembrolizumab  versus  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  treatment-naïve 
advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  patients,  including  both  squamous  and  non-squamous  histology,  who 
present  with  ALK/EGFR  negative  disease  and  a  positive  PD-L1  score  (TPS  ≥1%).  The  MAH  submitted 
results  from  the  second  interim  analysis  (IA2;  date  cutoff:  26-Feb-2018).  During  the  procedure,  the 
planned Final Analysis (FA; date cutoff: 04-Sep-2018) was also provided, and an additional extended 
follow-up served for an updated analysis of OS (cutoff date: 25-Oct-2019). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the final analysis, pembrolizumab demonstrated superiority over chemotherapy in the ITT population 
(TPS≥1%), with a gain in 4 months in OS and HR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; p=0.0013; 12-month and 
18-month OS rates of 57.8% versus 50.7% and 49.7% versus 37.5%, respectively). 
Within the TPS ≥50% group, OS was in favour of pembrolizumab with a gain of 8 months in median OS 
(HR= 0.70;95% CI: 0.58, 0.86; p=0.0003). 
Superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was also demonstrated in the TPS ≥ 20% subgroup 
with a gain of around 5 months in median OS (HR 0.77;95% CI: 0.65, 0.91; p=0.0012).

Page 102/106 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Within the subgroup of patients of main interest to the current application (TPS 1-49% group), no benefit 
of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  chemotherapy  was  demonstrated  in  terms  of  OS  (HR  0.91,  95%  CI: 
0.77-1.09; p=n.s). HR of PFS in TPS 1-49% NSCLC was 1.27 favouring chemotherapy.  
The number of responders was lower in the pembrolizumab group vs. the chemotherapy group in TPS 
1-49% NSCLC with response rates of 16.5% vs 21.3%.  
Within the ITT population (TPS ≥1%) as well as in all subgroup analyses (TPS ≥20% and TPS ≥50%) 
the OS K-M curves crossed at around month 6, showing a more favourable outcome in the control arm 
during the first months from treatment initiation while an increased risk of early deaths emerged in the 
subgroup  of  patients  exposed  to  pembrolizumab.  Inconsistent  results  were  achieved  in  terms  of 
predictive factors for early death across PD-L1 categories. Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated to reflect that a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation followed by a 
long-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy 
for the already approved indication of pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients with TPS ≥50%. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  disease  specific  setting  and  prior  experience  with  pembrolizumab, 
endocrine  (hypothyroidism),  skin  (rash)  and  respiratory  disorders  (dyspnoea,  cough  and  pneumonia) 
were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  with  Keytruda  (>10%  incidence),  while  gastrointestinal 
(vomiting, constipation and nausea) and blood disturbances (myelosuppression) were the prevailing AEs 
in the chemotherapy group (>10% incidence). 
A  higher  rate  of  deaths  due  to  AEs  in  the  KN-042  was  observed  with  pembrolizumab  arm  (11%) 
compared  to chemotherapy (7.5%). The overall incidence of deaths due  to AEs in this trial was even 
higher compared with the Reference Safety Dataset (4.1%), and with Study KN-024 (7.8%). The higher 
rates of death due to an AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low 
PD-L1 expression subgroup than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
Pembrolizumab  showed  a  more  favourable  safety  profile  than  chemotherapy  following  adjustment  by 
exposure time. Overall AEs rate was 83.16 vs 170.33 events/100 person-months and grade 3-5 AE rate 
of  10.49  vs  21.85  events/100  person-months  for  pembrolizumab  versus  chemotherapy  respectively. 
SAEs were 6.93 (pembrolizumab) vs 8.05 events/100 person-months (chemotherapy)  while a similar 
incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  found  between  treatments  (2.25  vs  2.74  events/100 
person-months). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  incidence  of  overall  AEs  in  the  KN-042  pembrolizumab  dataset  was  comparable  to  the  reference 
dataset and cumulative dataset; however, pneumonia occurred more frequently in the pivotal trial than 
previously reported (11.9% incidence vs 4.7% and 5.4% in the RDS and CDS, respectively) likely due 
to  the  underlying  disease  of  the  study  population.  The  slight  increase  of  pneumonitis  in  the  NSCLC 
compared  with  the  non-NSCLC  population  and  the  RDS  may  be  attributed  to  the  higher  frequency  of 
patients in the NSCLC population who received prior thoracic radiation (15.8%) compared with the non-
NSCLC population (2.8%) and the RSD (8.0%).  
Rates of severe and serious cardiac events for pembrolizumab in 1L NSCLC appeared to be increased 
compared to chemotherapy and compared to the RSD. The higher rate of events in the KEYNOTE-042 
pembrolizumab group was driven by increases in the frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs of cardiac

arrest, cardiac failure/cardiac failure acute, myocardial infarction, and, more notably, pericardial effusion 
and cardiac tamponade as compared with chemotherapy and the RSD. 
However, interpretation of these data is difficult due to the longer exposure to pembrolizumab in the 1L 
NSCLC  setting,  underlying  disease  progression  and  comorbidities  and  the  small  event  numerosity. 
Cardiac  toxicity  will  need  persistent  attention  with 
further  evolving  safety  data  (routine 
pharmacovigilance).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study  KN-042  showed  that  the  clinical  benefit  of  immunotherapy  over  chemotherapy  within  the  ITT 
population  (TPS  ≥1%)  is  mainly  derived  from  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  PD-L1  highly  expressing 
tumours (TPS ≥50%), for whom pembrolizumab is already licensed. Extension of the clinical indication 
to  include  the  complementary  population  with  PD-L1  score  1-49%  is  not  currently  supported  by  a 
demonstrated  clinical  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  chemotherapy  in  this  subcategory  of 
patients, on the basis of a non-significant advantage in OS of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy, lack 
of beneficial effect on PFS and superiority of chemotherapy over pembrolizumab in ORR.  
Moreover, contradicting results in terms of potential predictive factors for response to treatment were 
observed  in  the  TPS  1-49%  and  TPS≥50%  group,  not  allowing  any  claim  on  the  ITT  population  of 
TPS≥1%. The presented data are not considered conclusive and do not alleviate the CHMP concerns on 
the higher risk of early death in the ITT population of TPS≥1%. This is more relevant for the TPS 1-49%, 
that represents a relevant portion of the ITT population (53% and 54% of the study population and total 
deaths, respectively). Considering the absence of a clear long-term benefit in this group, the uncertainty 
on the short-term outcome cannot be overcome. 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy that emerges from KN-042 is consistent with the prior 
clinical  experience.  Of  note,  the  comparison  with  chemotherapy  revealed  a  more  favourable  outcome 
achieved with pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. However, patient subgroups at increased risk of early 
deaths with pembrolizumab compared to SOC have not been fully characterized so far despite several 
analyses.  In  the  absence  of  clinical  indicators  able  to  select  patients  with  TPS  1-49%,  for  treatment 
appropriately, the acceptability of the  uncertainties related to the higher risk of early death might be 
envisaged  only  in  subjects  not  suitable  for  chemotherapy  or  pembrolizumab  combination  (the  latter 
recently approved in the first line setting of both squamous and non-squamous histology). However, this 
was not the target population enrolled in KN-042. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
At the present stage, taking into account the observed increases in the risk of early death, particularly 
marked in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression TPS 1-49%, and due the lack of identified 
clinical indicators for the proper selection of patients, the current extension of indication is considered 
not approvable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda monotherapy is considered negative for patients with a PD-L1 TPS 1-49%. 
During the procedure, the MAH has decided to no longer pursue the extension of the indication and to 
only update the PI with relevant safety and efficacy information from study KN-042.

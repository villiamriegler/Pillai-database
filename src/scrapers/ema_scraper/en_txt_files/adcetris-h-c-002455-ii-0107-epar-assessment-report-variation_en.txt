Information relating to orphan designation 
ADCETRIS, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/08/596 on 15 Jan 2009. ADCETRIS was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  
Treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Adcetris as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Adcetris 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0013/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0013/2021 was completed.   
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0013/2021.

Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Protocol assistance 
The MAH received Protocol assistance from the CHMP on 16 February 2012 and 23 October 2014. The 
protocol assistance pertained to clinical aspects of the ECHELON-1 study (C25003). With regard to 
Hodgkin Lymphoma patients with Ann Arbor stage III (the intended target population with the current 
extension of indication), it was advised to restrict the indication to patients with stage III/IV disease as 
included in the ECHELON-1 study. As it was not presumed that the study results could also be 
extrapolated to stage II patients, the term ‘advanced’ (instead of specific Ann Arbor stages) was not 
recommended.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Hodgkin Lymphoma (formerly called Hodgkin’s disease) is a lymphatic neoplasm, accounting for 
approximately 10 percent of all lymphomas. HL is histologically characterized by malignant Hodgkin and 
Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells that are surrounded by non-malignant inflammatory cells. HL is divided in two 
major subtypes: classical (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLPHL), based on 
immunohistological features and microscopic appearance of the malignant cells. The cHL subtype 
expresses CD30, and accounts for 95% of all HL. There are 4 histopathologic subtypes of cHL in the 
World Health Organization classification: nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte rich, and 
lymphocyte depleted. 
Disease or condition 
With the current extension of indication, the first line indication in HL is proposed to be extended to 
advanced HL instead of Stage IV HL patients as follows: 
Hodgkin lymphoma 
ADCETRIS is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ advanced Stage IV 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of 
relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) (see section 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL):  
1. 
following ASCT, or 
2. 
following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is 
not a treatment option. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The incidence in Europe is ~ 2.4 cases per 100.000 persons. Young adults aged 20–40 years are most 
often affected; a second incidence peak is seen in individuals aged 55 and older. HL demonstrates a 
bimodal age distribution with the first peak occurring at about 20-30 years of age and a second peak in 
patients >65 years of age. In the European Union (EU), GLOBOCAN estimates that 20,410 new HL cases 
were diagnosed and 5,887 HL-related deaths occurred in 2012 (across all ages), with a 5-year prevalence 
of 67,782 cases in adults.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical symptoms are present in 2/3 of patients, and could include the presence of B symptoms (fever, 
night sweats, unexplained weight loss >10% in 6 months), fatigue, pruritus and alcohol-induced pain.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 7/90 
 
 
 
 
Staging is according to the Ann Arbor criteria, which are based on localisation, the extent of nodal and 
extranodal involvement and the presence of the classical B symptoms. For the purposes of treatment 
planning, cHL is frequently divided into early-stage (Stage I/II) and advanced-stage (Stage III/IV) 
disease. In the absence of unfavourable features, the prognosis for early-stage disease is excellent. Thus, 
the frontline treatment approach for these individuals is focused on minimizing toxicity of therapy while 
maintaining high cure rates.  
In addition to clinical staging, other clinical features can predict outcomes in these patients. The 
international prognostic score is a tool that assesses 7 potentially unfavourable clinical features in HL at 
diagnosis: serum albumin <4 g/dL, haemoglobin <10.5 g/dL, male gender, age >45 years, Stage IV 
disease, white blood cell count ≥15,000/μL, and absolute lymphocyte count <600/μL and/or <8% of the 
total white blood cell count. When applied retrospectively to patients who were treated with current 
standard-of-care combination chemotherapy regimens, the 5-year OS for patients with lower scores (0-3) 
was 93% ±1% and those with higher (≥4) scores was 78% ±4%. 
HL prognosis is worse in patients who present with advanced disease and 30-40% relapse within 5 years 
after initial treatment or have immediate treatment failure. Five-year survival for patients with Stage III 
cHL is approximately 80%, whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with Stage IV cHL is 
approximately 65%. Multiple large studies demonstrate that about half of patients undergoing ASCT can 
be cured. However, a significant percentage of patients with relapsed or refractory HL never make it to 
ASCT because their disease does not respond adequately to salvage therapies or their clinical status, 
including age, precludes them from undergoing the procedure. 
Management 
After diagnosis of HL, chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens are recommended, depending on the 
stage of the disease. According to the ESMO Clinical Practice guidelines (Eichenauer et al, 2018), the 
following therapeutic algorithm can be used (Figure 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 8/90 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Therapeutic algorithm for newly diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma (ESMO Clinical Practice 
guideline) 
Patients with early-stage disease are typically treated with 2 to 4 cycles of ABVD, with or without focal 
radiotherapy to sites of disease. This approach results in 3- to 5-year progression-free and OS rates 
exceeding 90% and 95%, respectively, in patients with favourable disease, and 85% and 90%, 
respectively, in patients with unfavourable disease. 
Patients diagnosed with Stage III/IV cHL are usually treated with 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD, with some 
physicians adding limited field consolidative radiotherapy for bulky mediastinal involvement. In multiple 
studies of Stage III/IV patients treated with ABVD, the 5-year failure free survival rates ranged from 61% 
to 67% and 5-year OS rates ranged from 73% to 85%. In patients ≤ 60 years who are eligible for a more 
intensive treatment, escalated-dose versions of BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) could also be considered. Several trials 
randomly comparing ABVD and BEACOPP escalated have shown a superior tumour control with BEACOPP 
escalated, and a meta-analysis including 9993 patients also indicted a significantly better OS. However, 
given the relevant acute toxicity, appropriate surveillance and supportive care must be available. 
Moreover, the BEACOPP regimen should not be given in patients >60 years, as an increased treatment-
related mortality has been observed in this age group. In 2018, brentuximab vedotin + AVD was 
approved as alternative treatment option for patients with Stage IV HL. This was based on the ECHELON-
1 trial, for which updated OS analyses have currently been submitted in support of an extension of 
indication to advanced HL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 9/90 
 
 
 
 
 
For most patients with refractory or relapsed HL after frontline therapy, the treatment of choice consists 
of high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. The use of brentuximab vedotin represents an option in 
patients relapsing after ASCT or at increased risk of relapse after ASCT. 
Furthermore, the patients who achieve durable remissions are still subject to late ASCT-related 
complications including secondary malignancies, cataracts, cardiac dysfunction, osteoporosis/avascular 
necrosis, hypothyroidism, and infertility. Therefore, to make substantial improvements to the outcomes in 
advanced cHL, more effective frontline treatments with manageable toxicity profiles need to be 
developed. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
 Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin; SGN35) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), that consists 
of the chimeric anti-human CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) conjugated to the small molecule 
cytotoxic anti-tubulin agent MMAE by a protease-cleavable linker. CD30 is a member of the tumour-
necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Mechanistically, the antibody targeted chemotherapeutic 
brentuximab vedotin acts by binding to the cell surface marker CD30, expressed on cells of several types 
of malignancy, including HL. After binding to CD30 positive cells, brentuximab vedotin is internalized, and 
MMAE is released from the conjugate through proteolytic degradation of the drug linker. Released MMAE 
binds to the tubulin and leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death. CD30 expression on normal cells is 
rare, i.e. less than 1% of lymphoid cells, being activated, but not resting lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) 
and weakly on activated monocytes. CD30 is not present on cells from solid organs. 
Pharmacological classification (ATC-code): L01XC12. The first marketing authorization for brentuximab 
vedotin in the EU was granted in October 2012 and is currently indicated for: 
Hodgkin lymphoma 
ADCETRIS is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of 
relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) (see section 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL):  
1. 
following ASCT, or 
2. 
following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is 
not a treatment option. 
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
ADCETRIS in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (CHP) is indicated 
for adult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) (see 
section 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma  
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) 
after at least 1 prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1).

2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
 Scientific advice 
The applicant received Protocol assistance from the CHMP on 16 February 2012 and on 23 October 2014 
for the pivotal trial of the current application, ECHELON-1. The Protocol assistance pertained to clinical 
aspects of the dossier. It was advised to exclude patients with pre-existing neuropathy (as has been done 
by the MAH); and to restrict the indication to the patients with stage III/IV disease as included in the 
pivotal study (use similar definition, and not ‘advanced’), which advice was not followed. The comparator 
arm ABVD, number of cycles of study treatments, and the primary endpoint modified PFS (mPFS) were 
agreed. As the trial is open label, any HRQL measure was by the CHMP considered prone to bias, and only 
of limited value. The proposed increase in sample size with 200 patients was endorsed, considering the 
provided extrinsic data that point to a longer than previously projected mPFS. 
Previous review of the pivotal trial 
The pivotal clinical trial ECHELON-1 for the current extension of indication (EoI) application has been 
reviewed as pivotal trial for the EoI to the treatment of previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV HL as well 
(II/0055). In this previous EoI, the MAH initially applied for an indication in advanced HL (which is the 
same as the current proposed target population), as the trial included HL patients with Ann Arbor Stage 
III and Stage IV. During the 2018 review of the data from the 2017 primary analysis of ECHELON-1, the 
MAH changed the applied indication to Stage IV cHL, based on interim overall survival (OS) results for 
patients with Stage III cHL. This 2017 interim OS analysis yielded a hazard ratio in excess of 1 
(HR=1.216, 95% CI 0.563 to 2.630).  
Results of a second interim analysis (IA2) of OS data (data cut-off 01 June 2021) were reviewed as part 
of a variation to update SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1 with long-term follow-up data from ECHELON-1 
(II/0103). In this procedure, it was concluded that the updated data confirm the benefit of treatment and 
the safety profile of the A+AVD regimen as was noted at the time of approval of brentuximab vedotin for 
the treatment of previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).  
Based on the same data, the MAH is now seeking an extension of indication in advanced HL, i.e. including 
Stage III HL patients. This since updated OS results of the second interim analysis in 2021 showed a HR 
point estimate below 1 in patients with Stage III HL 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The most recent ERA included the current three indications in calculations for environmental exposure. As 
long as the extension of indication variation does not increase the potential population treated beyond 
these indications, there is no need for a revised ERA.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
 No new pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data have been submitted. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
 No new dose response studies have been submitted. There are no changes proposed in the current 
recommended dose for previously untreated patients, i.e. 1.2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles in combination with 
chemotherapy (doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D] [AVD]).  
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
The pivotal clinical trial ECHELON-1 for the current extension of indication (EoI) application has been 
reviewed as pivotal trial for the EoI to previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV HL as well (II/0055; please 
also refer to section 5.1.3). Results of a second interim analysis of OS data were reviewed as part of a 
variation to update SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1 with long-term follow-up data from ECHELON-1 (II/0103). 
The study design as well as results for the primary analysis (2017), first OS interim analysis (2017 IA1) 
and second OS interim analysis (2021 IA2) are for convenience repeated below. In addition,  a descriptive 
analysis of OS  is included, which was presented by the MAH in response to a request for supplementary 
information.

In this variation the applied indication changed to advanced HL and hence the focus of the data shifted 
from Stage IV patients to the ITT population with advanced Stage III or IV disease. 
ECHELON-1 (C25003)  
This study is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial to compare the modified progression-free survival 
(mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin + AVD (Adcetris plus doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vinblastine 
and dacarbazine, abbreviated A+ AVD) versus that obtained with ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], 
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) in frontline treatment of adult patients with CD30+ advanced 
Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) in combination with chemotherapy.

active conduction system abnormalities.  
Treatments 
Patients in this study were randomized 1:1 to receive up to 6 cycles of either A+AVD or ABVD by IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.  
A+AVD: doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, dacarbazine 375 mg/m2, and 
brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) 1.2 mg/kg. Brentuximab vedotin was administered by IV infusion over 
approximately 30 minutes within approximately 1 hour after completion of AVD therapy.  
No routine premedication was required for patients who received A+AVD. However, the use of 
prophylactic growth factor support was recommended for patients in this treatment arm, according to 
institutional guidelines beginning with Cycle 1.  
ABVD: doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 25 mg/m2, bleomycin 10 units/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and 
dacarbazine 375 mg/m2.  
Dose modifications 
The dose modifications recommended for brentuximab vedotin in response to treatment-related toxicity 
are presented in Table 1.

Co-medication 
The following medications and procedures were allowed during the study:  
-  Radiotherapy: Patients in PR upon completion of frontline chemotherapy with PET results 
indicative of PET-positive disease could have received radiotherapy.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
The use of topical, inhalational and ophthalmic steroids was permitted.  
Patients were allowed to receive concomitant hormonal therapy provided they had been on a 
stable dosage for at least 1 month before enrolment.  
The use of platelet and/or red blood cell supportive growth factors or transfusions was allowed 
when applicable.  
The use of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) for neutropenia was permitted during therapy for 
patients in both treatment arms according to institutional practice. After enrolment of 
approximately 70% of study participants the use of prophylactic CSFs for neutropenia was 
recommended for patients in the A+AVD treatment arm starting with the first treatment cycle 1. 
This recommendation that was communicated to investigators through a DIL dated 10 April 2015. 
A switch to a physician’s choice of alternative therapy for the remainder of frontline therapy was 
permitted at the investigator’s discretion after the Cycle 2 CT scan and PET assessment (including those 
with a Deauville score of 5). A switch to alternative frontline medication (AFM) for other reasons (such as 
adverse event) was also permitted at the investigator’s discretion. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the mPFS per IRF assessment obtained with A+AVD 
to that obtained with ABVD for the frontline treatment of advanced HL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 15/90 
 
 
 
 
 
The key secondary objective was to determine if A+AVD improved OS vs that obtained with ABVD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
Modified (m)PFS per IRF assessment using the criteria defined in the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma. * 
mPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first of (1) 
documentation of PD; (2) death due to any cause; (3) for patients who failed to achieve a CR per 
IRF, receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy for HL after completion of frontline therapy. The 
mPFS event date for these patients was the date of the first PET scan post completion of frontline 
therapy demonstrating the absence of a CR, defined as a Deauville score of ≥3.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
-  Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint, defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of death.  
-  Rate of CR as best overall response achieved at the end of randomized regimen (A+AVD or 
ABVD) per IRF assessment using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.  
- 
Event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from randomization until any cause of treatment 
failure: disease progression, premature discontinuation of randomized treatment for any reason, 
or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
-  Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from CR to disease progression or to death 
from lymphoma or acute toxicity from treatment. Analyses of DFS were performed on the subset 
of the ITT population who achieved a CR. 
-  Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
-  Duration of response (DOR) per IRF assessment. For patients with confirmed response, the 
duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time between first documentation of objective 
response (PR or CR) and disease progression. 
-  Duration of complete response (DOCR) per IRF assessment - In patients with confirmed CR is 
defined as the time between the first documentation of CR and disease progression. 
-  Rate of patients not in CR that received irradiation 
-  CR rate per IRF assessment at the end of frontline therapy.

Sample size 
The study is powered on the following assumption: a 2-year mPFS of 81% for patients in the A+AVD 
treatment group versus 73% for patients in the ABVD treatment group (HR = 0.67, assuming an 
emergent plateau in the PFS event rate after 2 years). A total of 260 mPFS events will provide 90% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 using a log-rank test. 
Approximately 1240 patients will be randomized to achieve (with 95% probability) 260 mPFS events in 
about 60 months assuming 36 months of accrual, a 5% annual dropout rate, and 24 months of mPFS 
follow-up after last patient in.  
The original sample size was lower (1040 patients), and increased to 1240 patients in protocol 
amendment 7 in March 2015. The 200 patient increase in sample size was accepted at follow up scientific 
advice in 2014. During the original design of ECHELON-1, assumptions regarding the expected number of 
progression events for the control arm were made on the basis of FFS estimates from an intergroup 
cooperative study comparing ABVD with Stanford V in 404 patients with locally extensive HL. However, 
aggregate data for 299 patients and a 167-patient dataset for patients with advanced HL from the British 
Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) provided the sponsor with an opportunity to revise projected estimates 
of the expected mPFS rate for the patient population in ECHELON-1. The statistical modelling with the 
aggregate data and the 167-patient dataset suggested that an increased sample size of 1240 randomized 
patients provided a higher than 90% projected probability of accruing 260 mPFS events by 2 years after 
randomization of the last patient. The revised statistical modelling for ECHELON-1 using the data from the 
BCCA suggested that approximately 90% of mPFS events occurred within 2 years of the initial diagnosis 
with an emergent plateau in the PFS event rate after approximately 2 years. A similar trend of few late 
progression events was noted in published results from other well controlled studies in patients with 
advanced HL. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either A+AVD or ABVD, with stratification by the number of 
International Prognostic Factor Project (IPFP) risk factors (0-1 vs 2-3 vs 4-7), and region (Americas vs 
Asia vs Europe). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; investigators and patients were not blinded to the individual treatment 
assignments. However, the sponsor’s study team, investigators, and patients were blinded to aggregate 
efficacy data throughout the study according to a prespecified blinding procedure. The independent 
review facility (IRF) was blinded to study treatment assignments. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 17/90 
 
 
 
 
The primary population for efficacy analysis was the intent to treat (ITT) population, which included all 
randomized patients. The Per-Protocol (PP) population included all randomized patients who do not have 
a major protocol violation, and will be analysed according to the actual treatment received. The PP 
population was used as supportive analysis for the primary endpoint.  
The response-evaluable population was defined as the subset of the ITT population with diagnosis as 
confirmed by an independent pathology review facility, with measurable disease at baseline, who receive 
at least 1 dose of study drug, and have at least 1 post-baseline response assessment. The response-
evaluable population was used for the analyses of CR rate, overall response rate, and duration of 
response.  
Analysis methods  
Primary hypothesis to be tested:  
The primary null hypothesis is that there is no difference in modified progression-free survival 
(mPFS) between the 2 treatments of A+AVD and ABVD. The alternative hypothesis is that A+AVD 
improves mPFS.  
Key secondary hypothesis to be tested:  
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in overall survival (OS) between the 2 treatments of 
A+AVD and ABVD. The alternative hypothesis is that A+AVD improves OS. 
Modified PFS was to be tested at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. The key secondary endpoint was to 
be tested at 1-sided, 0.025 level only when the test of the primary endpoint (mPFS) is statistically 
significant.  
Interim analysis  
Two interim analyses were planned:  
- The first formal interim analysis to be performed was a futility analysis. The CR rate at the end of 
frontline therapy will be analysed when the first approximately 348 patients have completed the regimen 
to which they were randomized or have discontinued treatment prior to completion. An independent data 
monitoring committee (IMDC) reviewed safety and efficacy data at the interim analysis.  
- The second formal interim analysis for OS was to be performed at the time of the final mPFS analysis. 
Overall type-I error for OS will be controlled using the O’Brien-Fleming method with a Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function, with final OS analysis scheduled for when 112 deaths have occurred (Table 2).

Table 2. Study C25003: Analysis Points 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis  
Final analysis of mPFS was planned to be performed when 260 mPFS events have been observed, which 
was estimated to occur by 24 months after the last patient is randomized.  
Stratified log-rank testing was to be used to compare mPFS between the 2 treatment arms as the primary 
analysis. The stratification factors included region and number of IPFP risk factors at baseline. The hazard 
ratios along with the 95% confidence interval (CI; 2-sided) were estimated using the stratified Cox model 
with treatment as the explanatory variable. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves and survival 
probability at 2 and 3 years along with the 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for each treatment group. In 
addition, a stratified Cox regression model was used to further evaluate the treatment effects on mPFS 
after adjusting for some prognostic factors.  
Sensitivity analyses were performed for mPFS to evaluate the robustness of treatment effects.  
Key secondary endpoint analysis  
There were 2 formal analyses planned for OS, an OS interim analysis at the time of the final mPFS 
analysis, and the OS final analysis when 112 deaths have occurred. OS analysis was based on the ITT 
population. Overall type I error was controlled using the O’Brien-Fleming method with a Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function. Stratified log-rank testing was used to compare OS between the 2 treatment 
arms. The stratification factors were similar to the primary endpoint analysis.  
The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs (2-sided) were estimated using a stratified Cox regression 
model. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of the OS endpoint for each 
treatment.  
Missing data handling  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023

In general, missing data will be treated as missing and no data imputation will be applied, unless 
otherwise specified. For Quality of Life Data, missing elements may be substituted with the average of 
non-missing items per published methods of analysis. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The planned sample size was 1240 patients, and a total of 1334 patients were actually included in the ITT 
population and randomized to receive A+ AVD (n=664) or ABVD (n=670). The study was conducted in 
218 investigative sites located in 21 countries across 4 regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and 
North America. 
As of the previous presented 20 April 2017 data cut-off, a total of 91 A+AVD patients (13%) and 123 
ABVD patients (17%) discontinued from the study; for 28 A+AVD patients (4%) and 39 ABVD patients 
(6%), the reason for study discontinuation was death (Figure 2). The completed maximum number of 
cycles per protocol was approximately 90% in both arms. This remained similar with the second interim 
analysis (IA2) in 2021, as all patients had discontinued study treatment at the 2017 primary analysis. 
Figure 2 Study C25003: Subject Disposition as of 20 April 2017 Data Cut-off 
As of the 01 June 2021 IA2 data cut-off, 103 deaths were reported for the ITT population. On-study 
death was reported for 9 A+AVD patients (1%) and 13 ABVD patients (2%; Table 3). Death during post-
treatment follow-up (PTFU) was reported for 30 A+AVD patients (5%) and 51 ABVD patients (8%). OS 
follow-up is ongoing for 9% of patients in the A+AVD arm and 11% in the ABVD arm.

Conduct of the study 
Study protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 29 March 2012, and subsequently amended 9 times. Key changes are 
described below: 
Protocol amendment 1 (12 May 2012 , no patients enrolled under this amendment) 
-  Changed the mPFS event date for patients who receive subsequent anticancer chemotherapy in 
absence of disease progression. The mPFS event will be recorded as occurring on the date of the 
first PET scan post completion of frontline therapy demonstrating the absence of a CR, defined as 
a Deauville score of ≥3. 
-  Specified that Deauville scoring must be performed for the EOT PET scan and any unscheduled 
PET scan to support objective determination of mPFS. 
Protocol amendment 3 ( 13 Jul 2012 , no patients enrolled) 
-  Changed the scheduled timing of the Cycle 2 PET/CT scan to Day 25 (± 1 day). 
Protocol amendment 4 (3 Aug 2012 , 615 patients enrolled) 
-  Allow sites’ determination of PET positivity to guide additional radiotherapy for noncomplete 
responders at the conclusion of frontline therapy, and allow radiation to be given for patients with 
PET-positive residual masses of any size instead of only those with masses of 2.5 cm or larger. 
-  Clarify that, unless otherwise specified, only those SAEs that occur during long term follow-up 
that are considered related to study drug (instead of ‘frontline therapy’) will be reported. 
Protocol amendment 5 (6 Feb 2014 , 1 patient enrolled) 
-  Add acute pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity to the discussion of potential risks associated with 
brentuximab vedotin. 
Protocol amendment 6 ( 27 May 2014, 536 patients enrolled) 
-  Remove the exclusion criterion pertaining to pulmonary diffusion capacity. 
Protocol amendment 7 (2 Mar 2015, 182 patients enrolled) 
- 
- 
Increase the sample size by 200 patients to a total of approximately 1240 patients, and increase 
the anticipated enrollment period. 
Increase enrollment to 620 patients per arm, and increase the estimated number of sites to 250 
globally. 
-  Align the timing of interim OS analysis with final mPFS analysis 
-  Revise timing of final OS analysis. 
Protocol amendment 9 (24 Sep 2021, enrolment complete/ no patients enrolled) 
     -   Added a second interim analysis of OS with alpha spending after 103 deaths were reported. 
Changes in the SAP 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 22/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A revised statistical analysis plan (SAP) was submitted in conjunction with protocol amendment 7. The 
revised SAP described the rationale for the increase in the planned number of randomized patients and 
the revised assumptions pertaining to the analysis of the primary endpoint, mPFS. 
Changes in analyses 
A number of additional subgroup analyses not described in the SAP were added to the prespecified 
analyses in June 2016, approximately 1 year before clinical database lock, without knowledge of the 
treatment effect in efficacy data. These included mPFS per IRF and mPFS per investigator by age 
dichotomized around 45 and 65 years, ECOG performance status score 0 vs 1 vs 2, and gender (male vs 
female). 
Protocol compliance 
The major protocol deviations identified in the study as of the primary analysis data cut-off 20 April 2017 
fell into 2 categories: 
- 
- 
Patients who were enrolled in the study even though they did not satisfy eligibility criteria (n=4 in 
A+ AVD arm vs. n=12 in ABVD arm). 
Patients who received incorrect treatment or dose of the study drug(s) n=9 in A+AVD arm vs. 
n=2 in ABVD arm). 
No deviations were identified relating to patients receiving excluded medication or not being discontinued 
from the study despite study withdrawal criteria being met. 
Baseline data 
Patient demographics were generally balanced between the two treatment arms (Table 4). In the ITT 
population, a slightly higher proportion of patients was male (~58% in both arms), most patients were 
white (~83%) and not Hispanic or Latino (86%). The median age was ~36 years. 
Assessment report

Table 4 Study 25003: Demographics (ITT population) 
The demographic characteristics of patients in the ITT population with extranodal involvement, Stage III 
disease or Stage IV disease were comparable with that of the ITT population as a whole.  
Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment arms in the ITT 
population (Table 5). The initial time since diagnosis was <1 month in both arms, and the majority of 
patients had nodular sclerosis classical HL (~61%), with Ann Arbor Stage IV at diagnosis (~63%). The 
majority of patients had at least 2 IPFP risk factors (~78%), and an ECOG performance score of 0 (57%) 
or 1 (39%).

Concomitant medication  
A higher use of myeloid growth factors was reported for the A+AVD patients possibly as concomitant 
medication or secondary prophylaxis for neutropenia. At least 1 myeloid growth factor (immunostimulant) 
was reported as a concomitant medication for 536 A+AVD patients (81%) and 373 ABVD patients (57%). 
Filgrastim was the most commonly reported growth factor for patients in both treatment arms, and was 
reported for 405 A+AVD patients (61%) and 286 ABVD patients (43%). 
Numbers analysed 
Primary and secondary efficacy analysis were based on the ITT analysis set, defined as all 1334 
randomized patients. A summary of all study populations is provided in Table 6.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint – modified Progression-Free Survival per IRF 
Primary analysis - As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date for the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint, median mPFS was not reached in either treatment arm. At this time, 117 mPFS events had 
been observed in the A+AVD arm and 146 mPFS events had been observed in the ABVD arm. A+AVD was 
associated with a 23.0% reduction in the risk of an mPFS event versus ABVD (HR=0.770; 95% CI, 0.603-
0.983). This improvement was statistically significant (p=0.035). The proportion of patients free from an 
mPFS event at 2 years after randomization was 82.1% in the A+AVD arm versus 77.2% in the ABVD arm 
(95% CI, 78.8-85.0% versus 73.7-80.4%; Table 7; Figure 3).

Figure 3 Study C25003: KM Plot of mPFS per IRF Assessment (ITT) 
Sensitivity analyses of mPFS in which ‘treatment discontinuation for undocumented disease progression 
after the last adequate assessment’ or ‘an event after more than 1 missed visit’ were considered events 
were consistent with the primary analysis. This also applied to mPFS per investigator and additional 
sensitivity analyses investigating alterations in handling of missing assessments and censoring. PFS by 
investigator for Stage III patients was 0.766 (0.507, 1.156; p=0.203) and for Stage IV patients 0.705 
(0.530, 0.937; p=0.016) 
Subgroup analyses at the time of the 2017 primary analysis generally supported the primary endpoint. 
For patients ≥65 years of age (N=122; HR=1.010; 95% CI: 0.525, 1.942) patients ≥60 years of age 
(N=186; HR=1.002; 95% CI: 0.583, 1.722), and patients without extranodal disease at baseline 
(N=445; HR=1.042; 95% CI: 0.670, 1.619) the HR point estimate was around 1 (Figure 4). 
For patients with Stage III disease, the mPFS per IRF HR was 0.922 (95% CI: 0.599, 1.419; p=0.712) 
and for patients with Stage IV disease, the unstratified HR was 0.711 (95% CI: 0.529, 0.956; p=0.023).

with statistical significance not met (p=0.199). The estimated OS rate was 96.6% for the A+AVD patients 
vs 94.2% for ABVD patients at 2 years; and 94.4% for A+AVD patients vs 92.9% for ABVD patients at 3 
years. A forest plot with OS subgroup analysis was not yet presented at the 2017 IA1.

Complete Remission (CR) rate by IRF  
At the end of randomized treatment, the CR rate was 73% in the A+AVD arm vs. 70% in the ABVD arm 
(Table 1). At the end of frontline treatment, the CR rate was 73% vs. 71%, respectively. At the end of 
cycle 2, 69% and 67%, respectively, achieved CR. The CR rate and ORR by disease stage are shown in

Event-free survival (EFS) 
The median EFS by IRF assessment was not estimable for either treatment arm. The stratified HR 
indicated no significant difference between treatment arms: 0.900 (95% CI, 0.726; 1.117, p=0.339). An 
estimated 76.5% of A+AVD patients vs. an 73.7% of ABVD patients were event free at 2 years; at 3 
years, the frequencies were 73.9% and 71.5%, respectively. 
Disease-free survival (DFS) 
The median DFS by IRF assessment was not estimable (NE) for either treatment arm. The stratified 
hazard ratio was 0.701 (95% CI, 0.504, 0.976; p=0.034), favouring the A+ AVD arm. An estimated 88% 
of patients achieving CR on the A+AVD arm (95% CI, 84-90%) versus an estimated 82% of patients 
achieving CR on the ABVD arm (95% CI, 78-86%) were DFS-event free at 2 years. At 3 years 86% vs. 
81% of patients achieving CR were DFS-event free, respectively. 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRF 
The ORR at the end of randomization regimen was also similar between treatment arms: 86% (A+AVD) 
vs. 83% (ABVD). 
Concordance between IRF and INV assessments of CR and ORR  
CR and ORR results by investigator assessment are shown in Table 16. The IRF and INV ORR 
assessments were concordant for 1215 of 1334 patients (91%) and the concordance rates were similar 
for each of the treatment arms. A lower overall concordance rate of 75% was noted for the CR 
assessments at the end of the randomized regimen treatment period and at the end of frontline therapy. 
Table 19. CR Rate and ORR per INV (ITT) 
Duration of response (DOR) by IRF 
The median DOR by IRF assessment was not estimable for either treatment arm. A total of 628 of 664 
A+AVD patients (95%) and 623 of 670 ABVD patients (93%) achieved a best overall response of PR or 
better. Among them, almost similar frequencies of patients had disease progression after objective 
response (86 patients [14%] versus 99 patients [16%], respectively). 
Duration of complete remission (DOCR) by IRF 
By IRF assessment, median DOCR was not estimable for either treatment arm of the ITT population who 
had a best response of CR. After a median follow-up of 22.7 months, the number of patients who 
progressed after achieving a best response of CR was 59 of 543 A+AVD patients (11%) and 72 of 528 
ABVD patients (14%). 
Rate of Patients Not in CR Who Received Irradiation and/or Chemotherapy 
Among patients not attaining a CR, a numerical lower proportion of A+AVD-randomized patients required 
radiation or subsequent chemotherapy than similar patients randomized to ABVD (Table 20). Among the 
132 A+AVD patients (20%) and 157 ABVD patients (23%) in the ITT population who were determined to 
be not in CR by IRF assessment at the end of frontline therapy, 11 A+AVD patients (8%) and 20 ABVD

patients (13%) subsequently received radiotherapy. Subsequent chemotherapy was reported for 
43 A+AVD patients (33%) and 65 ABVD patients (41%) in this subgroup. 
Table 20. Study C25003: Patients Not in CR Receiving Subsequent Radiation and Chemotherapy After 
Completion of Frontline Therapy (ITT Population) 
PET negativity at Cycle 2 and Deauville Scores 
At the end of Cycle 2, the PET negativity rate was 89% versus 86% (RR 1.028 [95% CI, 0.99; 1.07]). 
At the end of frontline therapy, the rates of Deauville scores ≤3 were 86% vs 82% (RR 1.044 [95% CI, 
1.00; 1.09]) and the rates of scores ≤2 were 85% vs 80% (RR 1.058 [95% CI, 1.01; 1.11]). 
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) per European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) QLQ C30.  
Over time, compliance (the number of forms actually completed as a proportion of those anticipated) 
ranged from 86% to 98% across treatment arms. The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 summary scores (ITT) are 
shown in Figure 18.

Antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA)  
At the end of frontline therapy, immunogenicity status and response rates were examined in the 632 
immunogenicity-evaluable patients of the A+AVD-treated safety population. Of these, 109 patients 
(17.2%) were anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) positive at any time post-baseline.  
Response per IRF was calculated for the subset of transiently ATA-positive patients (positive in 1 or 2 
post-baseline samples) and the subset of persistently ATA-positive patients (positive in >2 post-baseline 
samples).  
The majority of transiently ATA-positive patients (87 patients, 83%) achieved CR at the end of frontline 
therapy, whereas 1 of 4 persistently ATA-positive patients achieved CR at the end of frontline therapy. All 
4 persistently ATA positive patients achieved an objective response at the end of frontline therapy.  
Response rates by ATA titer status  
Of the 108 patients with a positive ATA status who had their titer assessed, 106 patients had a low ATA 
titer and 2 patients had a high ATA titer. Most of the patients with a low titer achieved a response of CR 
or PR (99 of 106) and both patients with a high titer achieved a response of CR at the end of frontline 
therapy.  
Response rates by ATA neutralizing antibody (nATA) response status (positive/negative)  
The proportion of patients who achieved a CR at the end of frontline therapy was similar for neutralizing 
antibody (nATA)- positive (83%) and nATA-negative (80%) patients; 2 of the 12 patients (17%) who 
were nATA positive achieved a PR at the end of frontline therapy compared with 11 of 95 (12%) patients 
who were nATA negative.

Exploratory endpoints 
PRO per FACIT-Dyspnea 10 (lung-specific PRO, ITT) 
Mean subscale scores for dyspnoea generally were higher in the A+AVD arm than in the ABVD arm from 
Cycles 3 through 6, indicating a higher impact of dyspnoea in the A+AVD arm. A trend of worsening 
dyspnoea was observed in both treatment arms across treatment cycles, although there is no established 
minimum clinically important difference (MCID). 
PRO per Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Neurotoxicity 
Mean subscale scores were lower in the A+AVD treatment arm compared with the ABVD arm over the 
course of the study and at EOT. A difference between treatment arms was observed in favour of ABVD 
across Cycles 2 through 6. The differences in FACT/GOG-Ntx at Cycles 4, 5, and 6 were clinically 
meaningful according to the MAH. 
Patient-reported health utility values per EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-3L 
2017 primary data cut-off - Overall, mean scores over time were not different between the 2 treatment 
arms on the basis of the MCID of 0.07 established for the UK TTO score. 
2021 updated analysis - Figure 19 illustrates patients’ quality of life for the long-term follow-up period as 
assessed per EORTC QLQ-30/QoL subscale scores by treatment arm and the presence or absence of a 
PFS event per investigator. EORTC QLQ-C30 data were collected for 3 years after the last dose of 
frontline therapy ending at posttreatment follow-up (PTFU) Visit 12 or until the first of documented 
disease progression or subsequent anticancer therapy. Absence of a PFS per investigator event is 
according to the MAH associated with higher quality of life at each posttreatment time point.

Utilization of medical resources 
At least 1 hospitalization was reported for a higher number of patients in the A+ AVD arm (n= 242, 36%) 
compared to the ABVD arm (n=186 ABVD, 28%). 
The median number of days of hospitalization among patients who were hospitalized at least once was 
similar across treatment arms (9 vs. 8 days, respectively).  
The hospitalization visit rate per patient-year was 0.3363 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.37) for A+AVD patients and 
0.2277 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.25) for ABVD patients. An AE or toxicity was the most commonly reported 
reason for hospitalization.  
Percent of patients alive without HL at 3 and 5 years 
As of the 20 April 2017 data cutoff date, approximately one quarter of patients have had the opportunity 
to be followed for 3 years and no patient has yet to have been followed for 5 years. 
There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.795) in the estimated proportion of patients in the 
ITT population alive without HL at 3 years between the A+AVD treatment arm (70%) and the ABVD 
treatment arm (71%). 
Percent of patients switching therapy after Cycle 2 and before EOT 
After the Cycle 2 PET assessment, patients could be switched to an AFM of physician’s choice for the 
remainder of planned frontline therapy without the switch being considered an mPFS event. While this 
was permitted, in practice, very few patients were switched to an AFM. 
A total of 15 A+AVD patients (2%) and 9 ABVD patients (1%) received an AFM. All patients receiving AFM 
switched to another form of chemotherapy. The reason for switching was primarily an adverse event 
(54%) or Deauville score (21%). 
Ancillary analyses 
The choice of subsequent therapy for CD30+ HL after first line brentuximab vedotin was discussed at the 
time of approval, as brentuximab vedotin is also indicated following autologous stem cell transplant in 
adult patients with at increased risk of relapse, and in relapsed or refractory patients. As next line 
anticancer therapies continued to be followed, the updated data are presented below. 
Subsequent anticancer therapy 
At least 1 subsequent anticancer therapy was reported for 135 A+AVD patients (20%) and 157 ABVD 
patients (24%) in the safety population. Chemotherapy was the most commonly reported subsequent 
anticancer therapy across treatment arms. At least 1 anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen was reported 
for 79 A+AVD patients (12%) and 111 ABVD patients (17%) and included high-dose chemotherapy and 
transplantation in 3% of patients across treatment arms. The type of first subsequent anticancer therapy 
in both treatment arms is shown in Table 21. Three patients in the A+AVD arm received subsequent 
brentuximab vedotin-containing anticancer therapy compared to 23 patients in the ABVD arm.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
In the pivotal study, 84 patients (13%) in the A+AVD arm, and 102 patients (15%) in the ABVD arm 
were ≥60 years of age. Approximately 61 patients in both arms (9%) were ≥ 65 years of age.  
2017 primary analysis data cut-off - The percentage of patients age 60 years or older receiving 
subsequent anticancer therapy was similar across treatment arms (A+AVD 19% [n=16 of 83] versus 
ABVD 17% [n=17 of 98]) as of the 2017 data cut-off. In the safety population slightly fewer A+AVD arm 
patients (121 patients, 18%) received at least 1 subsequent anticancer therapy compared with ABVD 
patients (144 patients, 22%).  
As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off and after a median follow-up of 28 months, 32 deaths had occurred 
among patients who were age 60 years or older: 15 deaths (18% of this subgroup of older patients) on 
the A+AVD arm and 17 deaths (17% of this subgroup of older patients) on the ABVD arm. No data has 
been presented for patients <60 years of age. In the ITT, a slightly larger difference between treatment 
arms was observed: 28 deaths (4%) were reported in the A+AVD treatment arm and 39 deaths (6%) in 
the ABVD treatment arm after a median follow-up of approximately 28 months. 
Elderly Stage IV patients 
2017 primary analysis data cut-off - The mPFS (HR 0.804, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.53, p = 0.506) and OS (HR 
0.616, 95% CI: 0.245, 1.546, p=0.297) results for elderly patients with Stage IV HL are shown in Table 
22 and Table 23.

2021 IA2: As of the 1 June 2021 data cut-off, 49 deaths had occurred among patients who were aged 60 
years or older. Based on OS subgroup data presented in Figure 11, 20 events (23.8% of this elderly 
subgroup) occurred in the A+ AVD arm and 29 events (28.4% of this subgroup) in the ABVD arm. Data 
for elderly patients has not been updated by disease stage.  
2023 descriptive OS analysis : In response to the request for supplementary information, data for elderly 
Stage IV patients were presented with the 2023 descriptive analysis data cut-off. A further 13 OS events 
had occurred in patients aged ≥60 years since the 2017 OS IA1 (4 A+AVD, 9 ABVD). The OS HR of 0.634 
(0.314, 1.282; p=0.201), supported the 2017 IA1.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this application, an extension of indication (EoI) is requested for brentuximab vedotin in patients 
with previously untreated CD30+ HL, i.e. from ‘Stage IV HL’ to ‘advanced HL’.  
Main clinical data to support this variation is derived from Phase 3 Study ECHELON-1. This is a 
randomized, open-label trial comparing the modified progression-free survival (mPFS) obtained with 
brentuximab vedotin + AVD (Adcetris plus doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vinblastine and dacarbazine, 
abbreviated A+ AVD; n=664) versus that obtained with ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], bleomycin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine, n=670). Patients were required to have treatment-naïve histologically 
confirmed classical HL, with Ann Arbor Stage III or IV. Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary 
endpoint. 
This study has been reviewed as pivotal trial for the EoI II/55 in previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV 
HL. In that EoI, the MAH initially applied for an indication in advanced HL (which is the same as the 
current proposed target population), as the trial included HL patients with Ann Arbor Stage III and Stage 
IV. During review of the data from the 2017 primary analysis of ECHELON-1, the MAH changed the 
applied indication to Stage IV cHL, based on OS results for patients with Stage III cHL. As of the 2017 
primary analysis, overall survival (OS) yielded a hazard ratio in excess of 1 (HR=1.216, 95% CI 0.563 to 
2.630).  
Results of a second interim analysis (IA2) of OS data (data cut-off 01 June 2021) were reviewed as part 
of a variation to update SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1 with long-term follow-up data from ECHELON-1 
(II/0103). In this procedure, it was concluded that the updated data confirm the benefit of treatment in 
the approved first line Stage IV HL indication. Based on the same data, the MAH is now seeking an 
extension of indication in advanced HL, i.e. including Stage III HL patients. This since updated OS results 
of the second interim analysis in 2021 showed a HR point estimate below 1 in patients with Stage III HL. 
While IA2 results have been presented before, the study population of interest for review of the data is 
now changed from Stage IV patients to advanced (Stage III and IV) patients. 
As per the previous EoI review, the comparator arm, endpoints and statistical methods of the ECHELON-1 
trial are considered acceptable. The 2021 IA2 repeated the time-to-event analyses for PFS and OS 
considered valuable in the long-term follow-up period. As it was not meaningful to repeat an analysis of 
mPFS per IRF due to discontinuation of independent review, PFS per investigator, a prespecified 
sensitivity analysis around the mPFS primary endpoint, replaced the function of mPFS per IRF in IA2. This 
is acknowledged. Secondary endpoints event free survival, disease free survival, duration of response and 
duration of CR have not been updated, which is acceptable as OS is the key secondary endpoint and the 
potential OS detriment in Stage III patients was the main concern at the previous EoI review. 
There are currently no fully concordant definitions of the term ‘advanced HL’ in Europe. In some 
guidelines, patients with clinical Stage IIB with the risk factors large mediastinal mass and/or extranodal 
disease also belong to ‘advanced’ patients. Therefore, a similar definition as used in the pivotal trial is 
preferred in the indication: ‘Stage III or IV’. (see SmPC section 4.1). 
No changes to the existing dosing recommendation in previously untreated HL have been proposed, which 
is agreed.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All patients were already included at the time of the primary analysis with a data cut-off in 2017, 
therefore, baseline characteristics were the same at the 2021 IA2. In the ITT population, a slightly higher 
proportion of patients across treatment arms were male (~58%), most patients were white (~83%) and 
the median age was approximately 36 years. Most patients had Stage IV HL (~64%) and 36% had Stage 
III disease in the ITT. The demographic characteristics of patients in the ITT population with extranodal 
involvement, Stage III disease or Stage IV disease were comparable with that of the ITT population as a 
whole.  
Results of the prespecified exploratory sensitivity analysis of PFS by investigator at the 2021 data cut-off 
(HR 0.678 (95% CI, 0.532 0.863, descriptive 2-sided p=0.002) supported the primary 2017 mPFS by IRF 
analysis (HR 0.770; 95% CI, 0.603-0.983; p=0.035). With longer follow up in the subgroup of patients 
with Stage III disease, the PFS by investigator HR improved from 0.766 at the 2017 data cut-off, to 
0.603 (95% CI, 0.391 0.93; descriptive p=0.021) at the 2021 data cut-off. In patients with Stage IV 
disease, the PFS HR remained similar with a HR of ~0.71.  
Key secondary endpoint OS reached statistical significance at the 2021 IA2 (0.59 (95% CI, 0.396 0.879, 
p=0.0009), while this was not (yet) the case at IA1 (HR of 0.728 [95% CI, 0.448; 1.184], p=0.199). 
After a median OS follow-up duration of 73.3 months, 39 deaths (6%) were reported in the A+ AVD 
treatment arm and 64 deaths (10%) in the ABVD treatment arm. Median OS was not reached in either 
treatment arm, the latter is to be expected considering the prognosis of HL patients. 
For patients with Stage IV cHL, the OS HR shifted from 0.507 (95% CI 0.265-0.971) as of the 2017 IA1 
to 0.478 (95% CI 0.286-0.0.799) with the 2021 IA2. In patients with Stage III cHL, the OS HR changed 
from 1.216 (95% CI 0.563-2.630) in the 2017 first interim analysis, to 0.863 (95% CI 0.452-1.648) in 
the 2021 second interim analysis. The censoring reasons were quite similar between treatment arms, 
except lost to follow-up: 26 out of 237 (10.9%) in A+AVD vs. 39 out of 246 (15.9%) in ABVD (Table 11). 
If this censoring is informative of an upcoming OS event, it seems more to favour the control arm. The 
change of HR from >1 to <1 can be understood as Figure 13 shows that the detriment in the A+AVD arm 
was seen in a part of the survival curve with much censoring, which has disappeared with longer follow-
up. Therefore, the updated OS analysis seems more reliable than at IA1, within the constraints of few 
events. Before 72 months, virtually no difference in survival rates seems to be present in Stage III 
patients, at 72 months this is 1.2% and at 84 months 2.1%, in favour of A+AVD (Table 11). Therefore, 
the updated OS results do not indicate a detriment for Stage III patients, which is reassuring. The 
proportion of patients with Stage III cHL experiencing an OS event is still quite low as of the 2021 IA2 
(7% of A+AVD patients and 8% of ABVD patients), however this can be acceptable considering the 
prognosis of these patients. Overall (complete ITT), 41% (A+AVD) and 48% (ABVD) patients have 
discontinued the study, and will not provide further follow-up data. In response to the request for 
supplementary information, the MAH indicated that the 112th OS event to trigger the final OS analyses 
was recorded, but data analyses is in progress as one date of death is  still missing from the additional 9 
patients who died since the second interim OS analysis (with 103 OS events). This patient had Stage IV 
cHL and was randomized to the ABVD arm. A descriptive OS analysis (2023 descriptive analysis ) was 
presented without this OS event (i.e. with 111 OS events). Updated 2023 descriptive OS data for the ITT 
(HR 0.61, corresponding with approximately 4 percent points OS difference) and Stage IV patients (HR 
0.48, corresponding to up to 6 percent points OS difference) supported the 2021 IA2 analyses. For 
patients with Stage III disease, the proportion of patients experiencing an OS event is still quite low (8%) 
and the HR shifted from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.452 1.648) to 1.004 (95% CI, 0.540 1.866). There is no 
survival advantage of A+ AVD, but still no sign of a potential detrimental effect either as the HR is ~1 and 
KM curves are overlapping (within the constraints of few events). Similar OS results are acceptable

considering the substitution setting and different safety profile (see safety section). Updated OS data 
were reflected in SmPC section 5.1. 
Altogether, clinical relevant efficacy in terms of mPFS by investigator and OS is considered demonstrated 
for the studied HL patients. Considering the substitution trial setting, similar efficacy compared to the 
active control arm would be acceptable as well and it is most important to exclude a potential detrimental 
effect on OS. Updated IA2 results indicate that this has been done for Stage III patients as well.  
Subgroup analyses of mPFS by IRF at the primary analysis data cut-off showed that for patients ≥60 or 
≥65 and patients without extranodal sites no clear benefit of A+AVD over ABVD in terms of mPFS could 
be demonstrated as the HR point estimate was ~1. These analyses have not been updated due to 
discontinuation of independent review, which is acknowledged. The current presented OS subgroup 
analysis confirmed this observation for patients without extranodal sites, as the HR in this subgroup 
crossed 1 (HR 1.184, 95% CI: 0.641, 2.187). A trend for a smaller difference between treatment arms 
has been observed for patients with Stage III disease and 0-1 IPFP risk factors relative to the respective 
more advanced counterparts as well. Results of these subgroup analyses should be interpreted with 
caution due to the low number of events, wide confidence intervals and high censoring rates. Results of 
the mPFS subgroup analyses were reflected in SmPC section 5.1, including the absence of a clinically 
meaningful difference between treatment arm in elderly patients and patients without extranodal sites. 
OS Subgroup analyses suggest lower efficacy in females compared to males, as is shown by an OS HR of 
0.96 in females vs. 0.43 in males, though results are still considered clinically relevant for both gender 
subsets in this substitution setting. 
As of the previous data cut-off in 2017, mPFS results in elderly patients with Stage IV disease showed a 
trend towards a larger benefit of A+AVD treatment over ABVD compared to elderly in the ITT (HR~1): 
patients aged ≥60, n=118, mPFS per IRF: HR of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.42 to 1.53; p=0.506) and patients 
aged ≥65, n=78, HR of 0.777 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.67; p=0.515). OS data for this subgroup with the 2023 
descriptive analysis data cut-off supported these observations. However, the number of patients within 
the elderly stage IV subgroup is relatively small and the number of events was low with a high censoring 
rate. This leads to uncertainty in the HR point estimates of these subgroups, as illustrated by the wide 
confidence intervals.  
A descriptive analysis of OS was performed using data with median follow up of over 7 years for OS. In 
the ITT population, a lower proportion of patients randomized to A + AVD (44 deaths, 7%) had died 
compared with patients randomized with ABVD (67 deaths, 10%) [HR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.414, 0.892)]. 
Similar proportions of Stage III patients randomized to A+AVD (20 deaths, 8%) and ABVD (20 deaths, 
8%) had died [HR =1.004, 95% CI (0.540, 1.866)]. A lower proportion of Stage IV patients randomized 
to A + AVD (24 deaths, 6%) had died compared with patients randomized with ABVD (46 deaths, 11%) 
[HR = 0.48, 95% CI (0.291, 0.784)].  
Results of secondary and exploratory endpoints analysed at the 2017 data cut-off were more or less 
similar between treatment arms (a.o. CR, ORR, EFS, PET negativity at Cycle 2) or slightly in favour of 
A+AVD (DFS, rate of patients not in CR who received irradiation and/or chemotherapy, subsequent 
anticancer therapy).  
From previous studies it is known that retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is still effective. 
With the current proposed indication, brentuximab vedotin could in theory be considered three times 
during the course of the disease (frontline, after ASCT if at increased risk of relapse, and at relapse after 
ASCT). As of the 2021 data cut-off, only 3 patients in the A+AVD arm received subsequent brentuximab 
vedotin-containing anticancer therapy, while this applied to 23 patients in the ABVD arm. These data 
suggest very limited use of brentuximab vedotin in case this antibody-drug conjugate was included in the 
front-line therapy. As such, a thorough assessment of efficacy of retreatment is not feasible.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in first line Stage III or IV HL treatment is considered 
demonstrated by a statistically significant difference in mPFS and OS as shown by a HR of 0.770 and 
0.59, respectively, in favour of A+AVD over ABVD in the studied population. This difference seems mainly 
driven by Stage IV patients. With updated OS data (HR 1.004 (95% CI, 0.540-1.866), as of the 2023 
descriptive analysis) there seems no survival advantage in Stage III patients, but no detrimental effect is 
observed either. The MAH agreed to submit final OS data in the context of a future Type II variation. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
 Introduction 
With this EoI application, updated clinical safety findings have been submitted for the ECHELON-1 
(Study C25003) safety population after approximately 6 years of posttreatment follow-up (PTFU). 
Ongoing safety assessments during posttreatment follow-up (PTFU) included deaths, treatment-related 
serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-emergent neuropathy events, second malignancies, and 
pregnancy. Investigators were required to report any deaths and any SAEs that were considered 
treatment related according to investigator assessment.  
The safety results are based on cumulative data from the second interim analysis as of the 01 June 2021 
cut-off for data analysis and are presented coincided with the results of the second interim analysis of the 
study’s key secondary endpoint, overall survival (OS). The ECHELON-1 study has been reviewed as 
pivotal trial for the EoI in previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV HL as well using a data cutoff of 20 April 
2017 (II/0055). Safety data as of the 01 June 2021 cut-off have been subject of the 
EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0103 procedure.  
Patient exposure 
The safety population consisted of 662 A+AVD patients and 659 ABVD patients from pivotal study 
ECHELON-1, including 237 A+AVD patients and 246 ABVD patients with Stage III cHL. Patients in 
ECHELON-1 were randomized 1:1 to receive up to 6 cycles of either A+AVD or ABVD on Days 1 and 15 of 
each 28 day treatment cycle. The relative dose intensity, duration of treatment, and number of maximum 
completed cycles of individual regimen components was similar between treatment arms. Patients in both 
treatment groups received a median of 6 cycles of study treatment per patient over a median of 
approximately 24 weeks. As the maximum number of cycles to be administered was 6, exposure data 
with the currently presented safety update with data cut-off 01 June 2021 remained the same as those

presented using a data cutoff of 20 April 2017 (II/0055). A median of 6 cycles (range 1 to 6 cycles) was 
reported for both treatment arms, administered over a similar median duration of approximately 24 
weeks (range 2.0 to 48.9 weeks). 
Adverse events 
For reference, an overview is presented of the safety results for ECHELON-1 from the 
treatment-emergent period of the study (from administration of the first dose of study drug through 
30 days after the last dose of frontline therapy) with data cut-off 20 April 2017. These results have been 
reviewed as part of the EoI in first line Stage IV cHL (II/0055). An overview of the safety is presented in 
Table 24.

Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
At least 1 Grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for 549 patients (83%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 
434 patients (66%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported for at least 10% 
of the A+AVD patients were neutropenia (54% of patients), febrile neutropenia (19%), and decreased 
neutrophil count (13%). The Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported for at least 10% of ABVD patients were 
neutropenia (39%) and decreased neutrophil count (10%). 
Drug-Related Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
At least 1 Grade 3 or higher drug-related TEAE was reported for 525 patients (79%) in the A+AVD 
treatment arm and 389 patients (59%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The Grade 3 or higher drug-related 
TEAEs reported for at least 5% of the A+AVD patients were neutropenia (52%), febrile neutropenia 
(18%), decreased neutrophil count (12%) and anemia (7%). The Grade 3 or higher drug-related TEAEs 
reported for at least 5% of ABVD patients were neutropenia (37%), decreased neutrophil count (10%), 
and febrile neutropenia (7%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Updated results for the safety assessments that continued during posttreatment follow-up (PTFU) are 
provided in the following sections. 
SAEs 
2017 data cut-off – At least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was reported for 284 A+AVD patients (43%) and 
178 ABVD patients (27%; Table 27). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 68/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A+AVD patients were febrile neutropenia (17% of patients), pyrexia (7%), and neutropenia and 
pneumonia (3% each).  
Table 27. Study C25003: Treatment-Emergent SAEs Reported for at Least 5 Patients in Either Treatment 
Arm by PT (Safety Population) 
At least 1 drug-related SAE was reported for 240 patients (36%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 125 
patients (19%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs for the 
A+AVD patients were febrile neutropenia (17% of patients); pyrexia (6%); neutropenia (3%); and 
pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting (2% each). 
2021 data cut-off – During PTFU, investigators were required to report to the sponsor any SAE that they 
considered to be treatment related. Drug relationship was ascribed to any of the anticancer regimens in 
the combination therapy. SAEs reported during PTFU were identified from a review of the clinical and 
global safety databases. During PTFU, peripheral motor neuropathy was reported for 1 A+AVD patient 
(<1%). Peripheral motor neuropathy was initially reported as a drug-related SAE during the treatment 
period of the study and persisted beyond 30 days from the last dose of frontline therapy. 
A treatment-related SAE was identified from a review of the sponsor’s global safety database for 
3 patients each across the 2 treatment arms. Pain, suicidal ideation, and malignant lung neoplasm were 
the treatment-related SAE PTs reported for 1 A+AVD patient each and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 
trisomy 18 (Edward’s syndrome [child]), and acute promyelocytic leukemia were the treatment-related 
SAE PTs reported for 1 ABVD patient each.

Per protocol, any occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a patient was to be 
reported on an SAE form, regardless of treatment arm or causal relationship, from administration of the 
first dose of study drug through death or termination of the study by the sponsor.  
PML was reported for 1 A+AVD patient during PTFU. PML was considered to be not drug related, 
according to the investigator assessment and was attributed to the patient’s immunosuppressive state 
subsequent to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient’s condition was reported to be resolving. 
Deaths 
2017 data cut-off – On-study deaths (i.e. within 30 days of last dose of frontline therapy), were reported 
for 9 patients (1%) in the A+AVD arm and 13 patients (2%) in the ABVD arm at the time of the primary 
analysis. At this 2017 data cut-off, 19 patients had died during post treatment follow up (PTFU, i.e. after 
30 days of the last dose of frontline therapy) in the A+AVD arm and 26 patients in the ABVD arm. 
2021 data cut-off – As of the 01 June 2021 cut-off for data analysis, 39 deaths (6%) were reported for 
A+AVD patients and 64 deaths (10%) were reported for ABVD patients in the safety population (Table 
28).  
Deaths during the 2021 PTFU were reported for 30 patients (5%) in the A+AVD arm and 51 patients 
(8%) in the ABVD arm. Death was considered disease related for 15 patients (2%) vs. 24 patients (4%), 
respectively. The primary cause of death for the non–disease related deaths during the PTFU (N=15; 2% 
vs. N=27; 4%) was different for all cases, except for cardiac arrest that was reported for 2 patients 
(<1%) and 3 hemorrhage related deaths (hemorrhage following a fall at home, intracerebral hemorrhage, 
intracranial hemorrhage; one case for each) in the A+AVD arm. Of note, one death is attributed to AE 
and 3 deaths are attributed to deceased. In the ABVD arm N=5 deaths were related to pulmonary 
toxicity/infections.

All safety population patients herein were also in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population 
(Listing 16.2.3.1). 
Stage III cHL 
As of the 01 June 2021 cut-off for data analysis, 17 deaths (7%) were reported for A+AVD patients and 
20 deaths (8%) were reported for ABVD patients in the safety population. On-study death was reported 
for 4 A+AVD patients and 5 ABVD patients (2% each) in the Stage III cHL subset of the safety 
population. 
Assessment report

Death during 2021 PTFU was reported for 13 A+AVD patients and 15 ABVD patients (6% each) in the 
Stage III subset of patients in the safety population. PTFU death was considered disease related or 
attributed to the primary disease and associated complications for 8 A+AVD patients (3%) vs. 6 ABVD 
treated patients (2%) and non–disease related for 5 A+AVD patients (2%) vs. 9 ABVD patients (4%) in 
this subset.  
The reported non-disease related primary causes of death in the A+AVD arm (n=5) were AE, 
intracerebral hemorrhage, (completed) suicide, deceased NOS, and pneumonia. AE, intracerebral 
haemorrhage, and deceased NOS were considered complications of the primary disease, cHL. Pneumonia 
was considered a complication of a second malignancy. 
The reported primary non-disease related causes of death in the ABVD arm (n=9) were clostridial 
myonecrosis, lower respiratory tract infection, hematological phagocytosis, pulmonary 
hemorrhage/pneumonia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, T-cell lymphoma and 
unknown for 2 patients.  
Stage IV cHL 
On-study death was reported for 5 A+ AVD patients (1%) and 8 ABVD patients (2%) in the Stage IV cHL 
subset of the safety population. Deaths due to drug-related adverse events were reported in 5 patients in 
each arm (1%). Data were not presented separately for this subgroup.  
Other significant AEs 
Updated results for the safety assessments AEs of special interest that continued during PTFU (peripheral 
neuropathy and second malignancy) are described below. For comparison, results with the 2017 data cut-
off are presented as well. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy is a well characterized side effect of brentuximab vedotin treatment and is 
considered an adverse event of special interest for patients who treated with brentuximab vedotin. 
Patients with an ongoing PN event at the end of frontline therapy were to be followed during PTFU every 
3 months for 36 months and every 6 months thereafter to assess changes in severity of PN events until 
the sooner of resolution to baseline or study closure. 
2017 data cut-off – As of the 20 April 2017 cut-off for data analysis, at least 1 PN (SMQ) event of any 
grade was reported for 442 patients (67%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 286 patients (43%) in the 
ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported PN PTs (≥5%) of any grade for the A+AVD patients 
were peripheral sensory neuropathy (29% of patients), PN (26%), paraesthesia (13%), PMN (6%), and 
muscular weakness (5%). The most frequently reported PN PTs of any grade for ABVD patients were 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (17% of patients), PN (13%), paraesthesia (11%), and hypoesthesia 
(5%). 
For patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event, PN continued to improve over time and 
resolution or improvement was reported for 295 A+AVD patients (67%) and 214 ABVD patients (75%) at 
the time of last follow-up. At EOT, an ongoing PN (SMQ) event was reported for 320 A+AVD patients 
(72%) and 147 ABVD patients (51%), the majority of which were either Grade 1 or Grade 2 events. At 
the time of the last follow-up, an ongoing PN event was reported for 251 A+AVD patients (57%) and 112 
ABVD patients (39%), the highest proportion of which were Grade 1 events. 
2021 data cut-off – As of the 01 June 2021 cut-off, at least 1 PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported 
for 443 A+AVD patients (67%) and 286 ABVD patients (43%) in the safety population.  
The most commonly reported PN (SMQ) events of any grade for A+AVD patients were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (29% of patients), peripheral neuropathy (26%), paraesthesia (13%), and peripheral motor

neuropathy (6%). For ABVD patients, the most commonly reported PN (SMQ) events of any grade were 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (17% of patients), peripheral neuropathy (13%), and paraesthesia. 
Among the 443 A+AVD and 286 ABVD patients for whom at least 1 PN (SMQ) event was reported during 
frontline therapy, resolution was reported for 318 A+AVD patients (72%) and 227 ABVD patients (79%), 
and resolution or improvement for 379 A+AVD patients (86%) and 249 ABVD patients (87%) at last 
follow-up. 
At last follow-up, a PN (SMQ) event was reported to be ongoing for 125 A+AVD patients (28%) and 
59 ABVD patients (21%). Among A+AVD patients with an ongoing PN (SMQ) event, Grade 1 was reported 
for 71 patients (16%), Grade 2 for 38 patients (9%), and Grade 3 for 15 patients (3%). Grade 4 
polyneuropathy was the only Grade 4 PN (SMQ) event reported in the study and was reported to be 
ongoing for the affected A+AVD patient at the time of the patient’s death. Among the ABVD patients with 
an ongoing PN (SMQ) event, Grade 1 was reported for 39 patients (14%), Grade 2 for 16 patients (6%), 
and Grade 3 for 4 patients (1%).

Among patients for whom at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported 
during frontline therapy, the median time to resolution was 16 weeks (range, 0-283 weeks) for A+AVD 
patients vs. 10 weeks (range, 0-343 weeks) for ABVD patients.  
Among the subgroup of patients for whom a PN (SMQ) event was reported to be ongoing at the end of 
frontline therapy, resolution was reported for 185 A+AVD patients (42%) and 82 ABVD patients (29%) at 
last follow-up. Resolution was reported at a median of 34 weeks (range, 0-270 weeks) after end of 
treatment (EOT) for A+AVD patients and 16 weeks (range, 0-318 weeks) after EOT for ABVD patients. 
Peripheral motor neuropathy: Among the 74 A+AVD patients and 29 ABVD patients for whom at least 
1 treatment-emergent PMN (SSQ) event of any grade was reported during frontline therapy, resolution 
was reported for 55 A+AVD patients (74%) and 26 ABVD patients (90%), and resolution or improvement 
for 62 A+AVD patients (84%) and 26 ABVD patients (90%) at last follow-up. At last follow-up, a PMN 
(SSQ) event was reported to be ongoing for 19 A+AVD patients (26%) and 3 ABVD patients (10%). 
Resolution was reported at a median of 49 days (range, 0-237 days) after EOT for A+AVD patients and 
18 days (range, 4-240 days) after EOT for ABVD patients. 
Secondary malignancy 
2017 data cut-off – As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date, 10 of 662 patients receiving A+AVD (1.5%) 
and 14 of 659 patients receiving ABVD (2.1%) experienced a second malignancy. The onset day for 
second malignancies following the last dose of the study treatment ranged from 24 to 624 days for the 
A+AVD arm and from 14 to 857 days for the A+AVD arm. 
2021 data cut-off – A second malignancy was reported for 23 A+AVD patients (3%) and 32 ABVD 
patients (5%) in the safety population. After a categorisation as to what was reported in the CSR, the 
number of patients with a solid (2%) or hematological (2%) malignancy was comparable across the 
treatment arms in the A+AVD versus ABVD arm. No A+AVD patient (0%) had a malignancy that could 
not be categorized as opposed to 3 ABVD patients (<1%).

Fertility/pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in patients or their partners from the date of first dose until the date of study closure was 
to be reported and the pregnancy was to be followed for the final pregnancy outcome. 
At least 1 pregnancy was reported for 49 female A+AVD patients (17%) with 39 live births (80%) 
reported as the most recent pregnancy outcome for these patients, and for 28 female ABVD patients 
(10%) with 19 live births (68%) reported as the most recent pregnancy outcome for these patients.  
At least 1 pregnancy was reported for 33 partners each of A+AVD patients (9%) and ABVD patients (8%) 
with 31 live births (94%) reported as the most recent pregnancy outcome for the partners of A+AVD 
patients and 26 live births (79%) reported as the most recent pregnancy outcome for the partners of 
ABVD patients. 
No stillbirths were reported for either female patients or partners of male patients across the 2 treatment 
arms 
Subgroup analyses 
2017 data cut-off – On-treatment safety data have been presented separately for subgroups of patients 
with Stage III and Stage IV cHL disease. The incidence of SAEs, treatment-related SAEs and AEs resulting 
in study drug discontinuation was higher in patients with Stage III cHL compared to the incidence 
observed in patients with Stage IV cHL (Table 28, Table 29).

Table 33. ECHELON-1: Overview of Safety (Safety Population With Stage IV cHL) 
The incidence of TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher is similar between patients with Stage III or IV cHL (83%). 
The most common TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher are similar between treatment arms, except for a slightly 
lower frequency of neutropaenia in patients with Stage III cHL (50%) compared to Stage IV patients 
(56%; Table 30, Table 31).

Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
The incidence of second malignancy was evaluated for patients aged <60 years and those aged 
≥60 years.  
Patients <60 years – A total of 579 A+AVD patients and 561 ABVD patients in the safety population were 
aged <60 years. Within the subgroup of patients across the 2 treatment arms aged <60 years, a second 
malignancy was reported for 14 A+AVD patients (2%) and 18 ABVD patients (3%). Tumours categorized 
as ‘other’ were the most reported of these malignancies; ‘other’ tumours were reported for 6 A+AVD 
patients and 7 ABVD patients (1% each), mature B-cell neoplasms for 1 A+AVD patient and 5 ABVD 
patients, solid tumours for 3 patients each and mature T-cell and natural killer–cell neoplasms for 
2 patients each across the 2 treatment arms, acute myeloid leukaemia or related precursor neoplasm for 
2 A+AVD patients and precursor lymphoid neoplasm for 1 ABVD patient (<1% each) 
Patients ≥60 years – A total of 83 A+AVD patients and 98 ABVD patients in the safety population were 
aged ≥60 years. Within the subgroup aged ≥60 years, a second malignancy was reported for 9 A+AVD 
patients (11%) and 14 ABVD patients (14%). Solid tumours and those categorized as ‘other’ were 
reported for 5 A+AVD patients each (5%). Solid tumours were reported for 6 ABVD patients (6%) and 
‘other’ tumours for 5 ABVD patients (5%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data regarding interactions have been submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
2017 data cut-off – An AE resulted in premature study drug discontinuation for 88 patients (13%) in the 
A+AVD arm vs. 105 patients (16%) in the ABVD arm. 
This data has not been updated with the 2021 data cut-off.

Post marketing experience 
As of 30 January 2023, brentuximab vedotin has been approved in 79 countries and regions. As of the 
18 August 2022 data-lock point for the currently approved PBRER (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation 
Report), the cumulative estimated patient exposure to brentuximab vedotin was 119,292 patients, 
including 3320 patients from company-sponsored clinical studies, 4015 patients from 
investigator-sponsored studies, 2976 patients from various compassionate use programs, and 
approximately 108,981 patients from the postmarketing setting (sponsor in-house data).  
No data from post marketing experience in first line HL were submitted within this application. Post 
marketing experience has been the subject of Periodic Safety Update Single Assessments (PSUSAs) with 
the latest update reporting up to 18 August 2022 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010039/202208). Here it was 
concluded that the benefit-risk assessment for brentuximab vedotin remains unchanged. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Updated clinical safety findings have been submitted for pivotal Phase 3 Study C25003 (ECHELON 1) after 
approximately 6 years of posttreatment follow up (PTFU) with data cut-off 01 June 2021. The ECHELON-1 
study has been reviewed as pivotal trial for the EoI in previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV HL as well 
using a data cutoff of 20 April 2017 (II/0055). PTFU assessments included deaths, treatment related 
SAEs, PN (SMQ) events that were ongoing at the end of frontline therapy, and secondary malignancies. 
PTFU safety with data cut-off 01 June 2021 have been previously submitted as part of II/0103. 
Exposure – The safety population consisted of 662 A+AVD patients and 659 ABVD patients from pivotal 
study ECHELON-1. This population included 237 A+AVD patients and 246 ABVD patients with Stage III 
cHL, who comprise (next to Stage IV patients) part of the applied target indication in advanced HL. No 
new exposure data was provided. The maximum number of cycles to be administered was 6. As the 
median number of cycles of study treatment was already 6 in both treatment arms at the previously 
reviewed 20 April 2017 data cut-off, exposure data remained the same with the currently presented 
safety update with data cut-off 01 June 2021. A similar median duration of approximately 24 weeks 
(range 2.0 to 48.9 weeks) was observed in both arms. Of note, patients lost to follow up or by withdrawn 
patients (>30% in both arms) may have influenced safety reporting during the PTFU, however rates were 
quite similar between the two study arms. 
Treatment-emergent period – An overview of the safety results for ECHELON 1 from the treatment 
emergent period of the study (from administration of the first dose of study drug through 30 days after 
the last dose of frontline therapy) with data cut-off 20 April 2017 were provided. As these have been 
presented as pivotal evidence in the II/0055 procedure these are only summarized here. In brief, almost 
all patients experienced 1 TEAE of any grade in both treatment arms (>98% in both arms). At least 1 
grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for 83% in A+AVD and 66% in the ABVD arm and at least SAE for 
43% vs. 27%, respectively. The higher frequency of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs and SAEs previously 
reported for A+AVD patients during frontline treatment was attributed to the higher frequency of 
neutropenia and associated complications, primarily febrile neutropenia. The combination of A+AVD had a 
safety profile consistent with that of each drug individually with respect to the nature of TEAEs and SAEs 
observed. No new important risks were identified. The most common reported TEAE in both regimens 
were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhoea, peripheral neuropathy, decreased weight, 
abdominal pain, anaemia, febrile neutropenia, and bone pain. The A+AVD treatment is associated with an 
increased risk of peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia, whereas the ABVD treatment is associated with 
increased risk for pulmonary toxicity. Of note, during the II/0055 procedure it was noted that a minority 
of the patients had received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (N=83 A+AVD patients and N=43 ABVD 
patients). It was supported during the II/0055 procedure that the SmPC states that adult patients with 
Assessment report

advanced cHL treated with A+AVD should receive primary prophylactic growth factor support beginning 
with the first dose of study drug, as an increased tolerability of the A+AVD regimen as well as reduced 
neutropenia and associated complications were observed in patient having received this prophylaxis. 
Stage III/IV - The type of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs was comparable across the Safety Population and did not 
differ with the presence of extranodal disease or disease staging (III/IV). The incidence of SAEs (48% 
with A+AVD in Stage III patients vs. 40% with Stage IV), treatment-related SAEs (42% vs. 33%, 
respectively) and AEs resulting in study drug discontinuation (19% vs. 10%) was higher in patients with 
Stage III cHL compared to the incidence observed in patients with Stage IV cHL. These differences were 
not seen in the ABVD arm. During the II/0055 procedure no differences in exposure or baseline 
demographics were observed between between stage III and stage IV patients in the A+AVD (and ABVD) 
arm. Also the frequencies of SAEs/AEs leading to discontinuation per preferred term (PT) were 
comparable between stage III and stage IV patients in the A+AVD. Thus, no clear cause of these 
differences could be found. It is considered that no further information can be requested which may 
clarify this issue. 
Related SAEs during PTFU - Investigators were required to report to the sponsor any SAE that they 
considered to be treatment related during PTFU. Peripheral motor neuropathy was reported as a drug 
related SAE for 1 A+AVD patient (<1%). Additional treatment related PTFU SAEs were identified from a 
review of the sponsor’s global safety database for 3 patients each across the 2 treatment arms. Pain, 
suicidal ideation, and malignant lung neoplasm were reported as treatment related SAE PTs for 1 A+AVD 
patient each vs. diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, trisomy 18 (child) and acute promyelocytic leukaemia in 1 
patient each of the ABVD arm. Overall, the incidence of treatment related SAEs was low across the 2 
treatment arms during PTFU and no new safety signals were observed. Of note, one case of PML was 
reported in the A+ AVD arm. PML was considered to be not drug related and was attributed to the 
patient’s immunosuppressive state subsequent to allogeneic stem cell transplantation by the MAH. This is 
agreed upon. PML is adequately reported on in the label. 
Deaths - Fewer deaths were reported for A+AVD patients in the safety population both during the on 
study period and PTFU compared to the ABVD arm. As of the 01 June 2021 cut-off for data analysis, 39 
deaths (6%) were reported for A+AVD patients and 64 deaths (10%) were reported for ABVD patients in 
the safety population. In total, N=18 (3%) versus N=28 (4%) were considered disease related and N=21 
(3%) versus N=36 (5%) were not. On study death was reported for 9 A+AVD patients (1%) and 13 ABVD 
patients (2%). Death during PTFU was reported for 30 A+AVD patients (5%) and 51 ABVD patients (8%).  
During the II/0055 procedure on-study deaths patients were reported during Cycle 1 for the majority of 
the A+AVD patients and deaths were related to neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and its associated 
complications, including infections, sepsis and septic shock. Very few of these patients had received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis, which is considered to reduce the complications of cytopenia. The majority of 
on-study deaths for ABVD patients were related to pulmonary toxicity, which is a known risk factor of 
bleomycine.   
During the PTFU the primary cause of death for the non–disease related deaths (2% vs. 4%) was 
different for all cases, except for cardiac arrest that was reported for 2 patients (<1%) and 3 hemorrhage 
related deaths in the A+AVD arm. In the ABVD arm N=5 deaths were related to pulmonary 
toxicity/infections. In the A+AVD arm one death is attributed to AE and 3 deaths are attributed to 
“deceased”. The causes of these deaths could not be retrieved after long-term follow up, which can be 
understood. Overall, these data are considered to be in line with the known safety profile of both drugs 
that deaths were mostly related to cytopenia complications for the A+AVD arm and in the ABVD arm 
mostly deaths related to pulmonary toxicity were observed. Updated data on deaths were provided for 
patients who died between OS IA2 (103 deaths) and the 112 OS event trigger for the final OS analysis 
(data cleaning still in progress). No new safety concerns were identified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 81/90 
 
 
 
 
Stage III patients - On study death was reported for 4 A+AVD patients and 5 ABVD patients (2% each) in 
the Stage III cHL subset of the safety population. Death during the PTFU period in 13 vs. 15 patients (6% 
each), of which death was considered disease related or attributed to the primary disease and associated 
complications for 8 A+AVD patients (3%) vs. 6 ABVD treated patients (2%). Although the total number of 
deaths is limited, safety data do not indicate a detrimental effect of brentuximab vedotin for Stage III HL 
patients.  
Stage IV patients - On-study death was reported for 5 A+ AVD patients (1%) and 8 ABVD patients (2%) 
in the Stage IV cHL subset of the safety population. Deaths due to drug-related adverse events were 
reported in 1% of each arm. Data were not presented separately for this subgroup, however since these 
data can be assessed by deducting stage III deaths from the total deaths, no concern is raised. Death 
during the PTFU period was observed in N=17 in the A+AVD arm and N=36 patients in the ABVD arm. 
AEs of special interest - Updated results were presented for two AEs of special interest, namely peripheral 
neuropathy and second malignancy that continued during PTFU. 
Peripheral neuropathy - Among the 443 A+AVD (67%) and 286 ABVD patients (43%) for whom at least 1 
treatment emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported during frontline therapy, resolution or 
improvement was reported for 86% and 87% respectively in the safety population at last follow up. This 
is higher compared to the previous 2017 data cut-off, when resolution or improvement was reported for 
67% and 75%, respectively, at the time of last follow-up. Despite these improvements, it needs to be 
considered that a minority of the patients will continue to experience peripheral neuropathy complaints. 
At the 2021 data cut-off, an ongoing PN event was reported for 28% and 21%, respectively, which is a 
substantial decrease from the 2017 data cut-off (57% and 39% respectively). 
Second malignancy – While the incidence of second malignancies increased with longer follow-up, this 
occurred in both treatment arms and still a lower incidence of second (new primary) malignancy was 
reported for A+AVD patients: N=23 (3%) vs. N=32 (5%) with ABVD in the safety population. The MAH 
recategorized the second malignancies according to solid and haematological neoplasms indicating that 
2%of the patients had a solid malignancy and 2% of the patients had a hematological malignancy in both 
study arms. The MAH conducted subgroup analyses which indicated that second malignancies occurred 
relatively more frequent in patients of 60 years and older (11% in the A+AVD arm and 14% in the ABVD 
arm) compared to those younger than 60 years (2% in the A+AVD arm and 3% in the ABVD arm). 
However, it remains uncertain what the influence of brentuximab vedotin is on these numbers. 
Other- No new data was submitted for laboratory values and discontinuations. This is acceptable 
considering that this data is not relevant for long term post treatment follow up. Pregnancy is not an 
infrequent event and it can be concluded that treatment does not necessarily lead to infertility (in both 
arms). However, these data do not allow any conclusion regarding a possible reduction in fertility or 
embryotoxicity. The latest PSUSA concluded that the benefit-risk assessment for brentuximab vedotin 
remains unchanged.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
 Overall, the data show that the toxicity of the A+AVD regimen is substantial. Compared to ABVD a 
different toxicity profile is observed and toxicity is generally higher for A+AVD in cHL patients. The ABVD 
treatment is associated with increased risk for pulmonary toxicity, whereas the A+AVD treatment is 
associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia/cytopenia. No new safety 
concerns were reported, and long term safety is in line with what can be expected from the initial 
application in HL. The type of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs was comparable across the Safety Population and did not 
differ with the presence of extranodal disease or disease staging (III/IV) in the A+AVD arm. It is noted 
that stage III patients have more SAEs and drug discontinuations compared to stage IV, however no clear 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 82/90 
 
 
 
 
cause of these differences could be found. Overall, the data can be considered to confirm the known 
safety profile of brentuximab vedotin in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. 
In the II/0055 procedure, the following measures was considered necessary to address issues related to 
clinical safety: The MAH will provide data from a 10-year extension of the pivotal Phase 3 study C25003 
(ECHELON-1) which will follow-up on safety 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH was requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 18.0 is acceptable.  
The updated RMP includes the newly proposed indication, and Part II has been updated with most recent 
epidemiology data and clinical trial and post-marketing exposure for the newly proposed and existing 
indications as requested. The safety concerns remain unchanged. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make editorial changes throughout the RMP. Minor inconsistencies in tables V.1 and V.3 
were noted for routine risk communication of important potential risks severe hepatotoxicity and 
pulmonary toxicity. As the same updates have also been submitted in the ongoing procedure II/0109, the 
MAH will be requested to amend the RMP in that procedure. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.   
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
ADCETRIS is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage III or IV Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD)  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients who present with advanced disease, are usually treated with 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD (adriamycin, 
bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), with some physicians adding limited field consolidative 
radiotherapy for bulky mediastinal involvement. In patients ≤ 60 years who are eligible for a more 
intensive treatment, 6 cycles of BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) could also be considered. Approximately 30-40% of patients 
relapse within 5 years after initial treatment or have immediate treatment failure. A substantial 
proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory HL are not eligible for autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT), cannot be cured by ASCT, or are still subject to late ASCT-related complications. 
This indicates the need for more effective first line treatments with manageable toxicity profiles. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
 Main evidence to support this extension of the indication is obtained from pivotal Phase 3, randomized, 
open-label Study ECHELON-1 (C25003). This study compared the modified progression-free survival 
(mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin + AVD (Adcetris plus doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vinblastine 
and dacarbazine, abbreviated A+ AVD, n=664) versus that obtained with ABVD (doxorubicin 
[Adriamycin], bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, n=670) as frontline treatment for adult patients 
with CD30+ stadium III/IV HL. Primary endpoint was mPFS by independent review. Overall survival (OS) 
was the key secondary endpoint. 
This study has been reviewed as pivotal trial for the EoI in previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV HL as 
well (II/0055). Results of a second interim analysis of OS data were reviewed as part of a variation to 
update SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1 with long-term follow-up data from ECHELON-1 (II/0103). Efficacy data 
presented in the current EoI application pertain to a prespecified second OS interim analysis performed in 
1 June 2021 (2021 IA2) and non-prespecified 2023 descriptive analysis  presented in response to the 
request for supplementary information. These analyses waere done for the ITT as well as several patient 
subgroups, including the new target population of patients with Stage III disease. Moreover, updated PFS 
results (by investigator due to discontinuation of independent review) and posttreatment follow-up safety 
assessments were presented. The safety population consisted of 662 patients in the A+AVD treatment 
arm and 659 patients in the ABVD treatment arm. Updated clinical safety findings have been submitted 
for the safety population after approximately 6 years of posttreatment follow-up (PTFU) as of the 
01 June 2021 cut-off. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
 The primary endpoint mPFS per IRF based on the ITT population, as reported after 263 mPFS events 
(117 mPFS events in the A+AVD arm and 146 mPFS events in the ABVD arm) at the 20 April 2017 data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 84/90 
 
 
 
 
cut-off, was met. A+AVD was associated with a 23.0% reduction in the risk of an mPFS event versus 
ABVD (stratified HR=0.770; 95% CI, 0.603-0.983, p=0.035). The mPFS effect was consistent across 
several sensitivity analyses. A pre-specified analysis of mPFS per IRF by disease stage showed that 
patients with Stage IV disease (HR 0.711 [95% CI: 0.529, 0.956], p=0.023) may experience more 
benefit of A+AVD relative to that seen in Stage III patients (HR 0.922 [95% CI: 0.599, 1.419], p=0.712). 
Results of a prespecified exploratory sensitivity analysis of PFS by investigator at the 1 June 2021 data 
cut-off supported the primary analysis (HR 0.678 (95% CI, 0.532 0.863, descriptive 2-sided p=0.002). 
With longer follow up in the subgroup of patients with Stage III disease, the PFS by investigator HR 
improved from 0.766 at the 2017 data cut-off, to 0.603 (95% CI, 0.391 0.93; descriptive p=0.021) at 
the 2021 data cut-off. In patients with Stage IV disease, the PFS HR remained similar with a HR of ~0.71.  
Key secondary endpoint OS reached statistical significance at the 2021 IA2 (0.59 (95% CI, 0.396 0.879, 
p=0.0009), while this was not yet the case at IA1 (HR of 0.728 [95% CI, 0.448; 1.184], p=0.199). At the 
2023 descriptive analysis , the HR for the ITT was 0.61 (0.414, 0.892). For patients with Stage IV cHL, 
the OS HR improved from 0.507 (95% CI 0.265-0.971) as of the 2017 IA1 to 0.478 (95% CI 0.286-
0.0.799) with the 2021 IA2, and remained similar at the 2023 descriptive analysis . In patients with 
Stage III cHL, the OS HR changed from 1.216 (95% CI 0.563-2.630) in the 2017 first interim analysis, to 
0.863 (95% CI 0.452-1.648) in the 2021 second interim analysis and 1.004 (95% CI, 0.540-1.866) in the 
2023 descriptive analysis. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints suggested more or less similar efficacy relative to the active control 
arm (a.o. CR [73% vs. 70%], ORR [86% vs. 83%], EFS [HR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.726, 1.117] and PET 
negativity at Cycle 2 [89% vs. 86%]) or results in favour of A+AVD (DFS [HR 0.701, 95% CI: 0.504, 
0.976; p=0.034], rate of patients not in CR who received irradiation and/or chemotherapy [8% vs, 13% 
radiation/ 33% vs. 41% chemotherapy]). 
A descriptive analysis of OS was performed using data with median follow up of over 7 years for OS. In 
the ITT population, a lower proportion of patients randomized to A + AVD (44 deaths, 7%) had died 
compared with patients randomized with ABVD (67 deaths, 10%) [HR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.414, 0.892)]. 
Similar proportions of Stage III patients randomized to A+AVD (20 deaths, 8%) and ABVD (20 deaths, 
8%) had died [HR =1.004, 95% CI (0.540, 1.866)]. A lower proportion of Stage IV patients randomized 
to A + AVD (24 deaths, 6%) had died compared with patients randomized with ABVD (46 deaths, 11%) 
[HR = 0.48, 95% CI (0.291, 0.784)].  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Median mPFS and OS were not yet reached in either treatment arm. An update of mPFS results will not 
be provided, which limits the precision of the mPFS data, in particular for the subgroups with relative 
good prognosis due to the current high censoring rates and low event rates, reflecting high activity (or 
even curative) potential of front-line treatment in HL. Despite the longer follow-up for OS, the number of 
events for Stage III HL patients (who now form part of the target population as well) is still limited (17 
events [7%] A+AVD, 20 events [8%] ABVD). 
Results of prespecified mPFS by IRF analyses indicated no clinically meaningful difference between 
treatment arms in elderly patients and patients without extranodal sites. OS subgroup analysis confirmed 
this observation for patients without extranodal sites, as the HR in this subgroup crossed 1 (HR 1.184, 
95% CI: 0.641, 2.187). A trend for a smaller or no difference between treatment arms has been 
observed for patients with Stage III disease and 0-1 IPFP risk factors relative to the respective more 
advanced counterparts. Results of these subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution due to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440104/2023 
Page 85/90 
 
 
 
 
 
low number of events, wide confidence intervals and high censoring rates. Results of the respective 
subgroups have been reflected in SmPC section 5.1. 
Efficacy of retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is uncertain. From previous studies it is 
known that retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is still effective. With the current proposed 
indication, brentuximab vedotin could in theory be considered three times during the course of the 
disease (frontline, after ASCT if at increased risk of relapse, and at relapse after ASCT), with unknown 
efficacy. 
The MAH committed to submit final OS data as part of a separate Type II variation, when available. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
 No updated exposure data and safety data from the treatment-emergent period of the study (from 
administration of the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of frontline therapy) for 
ECHELON-1 have been submitted. These data remain unchanged as those presented using a data cut-off 
of 20 April 2017 and are presented below for easy reference.  
Patients with any TEAE of any grade were observed in N=653 (99%) and N=646 (98%) patients in the 
A+AVD arm and ABVD arm, respectively. At least 1 grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for N=549 
(83%) patients in A+AVD and N=434 (66%) in the ABVD arm and at least SAE for N=284 (43%) vs. 
N=178 (27%) patients, respectively. The higher frequency of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs and SAEs 
previously reported for A+AVD patients during frontline treatment was attributed to the higher frequency 
of neutropenia and associated complications, primarily febrile neutropenia.  
The most common reported TEAE in both regimens were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
diarrhoea, peripheral neuropathy, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anaemia, febrile neutropenia, and 
bone pain. The A+AVD treatment is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy and 
neutropenia, whereas the ABVD treatment is associated with increased risk for pulmonary toxicity. The 
type of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs was comparable across the Safety Population and did not differ with the 
presence of extranodal disease or disease staging (III/IV).  
Ongoing safety assessments during the PTFU as of the 01 June 2021 cut-off for data analysis included 
deaths, treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-emergent, neuropathy events, 
secondary malignancies, and pregnancy. 
Treatment related SAEs: during the PTFU peripheral motor neuropathy, pain, suicidal ideation, and 
malignant lung neoplasm were reported in 1 patient each in the A+AVD arm versus diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma, trisomy 18 (child) and acute promyelocytic leukaemia in 1 patient each of the ABVD arm 
Deaths: as of the 01 June 2021 cut-off 39 deaths (6%) were reported for A+AVD patients and 64 deaths 
(10%) were reported for ABVD patients in the safety population. Death during PTFU was reported for 
30 A+AVD patients (5%) and 51 ABVD patients (8%). During the PTFU the primary cause of death for the 
non–disease related deaths (2% vs. 4%) was different for all cases, except for cardiac arrest that was 
reported for 2 patients (<1%) and 3 hemorrhage related deaths in the A+AVD arm. In the ABVD arm 
N=5 deaths were related to pulmonary toxicity/infections. 
PN: as of the 01 June 2021 cut-off at least 1 PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 
N=443 A+AVD patients (67%) and N= 286 ABVD patients (43%) in the safety population. Resolution or 
improvement was reported for 379 A+AVD patients (86%) and 249 ABVD patients (87%).

Secondary malignancy: as of the 01 June 2021 cut-off secondary malignancy was reported for 23 A+AVD 
patients (3%) and 32 ABVD patients (5%) in the safety population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The incidence of SAEs (48% with A+AVD in Stage III patients vs. 40% with Stage IV) and AEs resulting 
in study drug discontinuation (19% vs. 10%) was higher in patients with Stage III cHL compared to the 
incidence observed in patients with Stage IV cHL. It is uncertain what the cause of these differences is.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, clinical efficacy in terms of mPFS by IRF at the primary analysis data cut-off (HR 0.77, 95% CI: 
0.603, 0.983) and OS as of the 2023 descriptive analysis  data cut-off (0.61, 95% CI: 0.414, 0.892) is 
considered demonstrated for the ITT consisting of Stage III and IV HL patients. The OS HR in Stage III 
patients shifted from 1.216 at the first interim analysis (2017 IA1) to 0.863 (95% CI 0.452-1.648) at the 
second 2021 IA and 1.004 at the 2023 descriptive analysis with overlapping OS KM curves. Although no 
survival advantage was observed for Stage III patients, there is no trend for a potential detrimental effect 
in these patients either, which is considered most important in this substitution setting. The proportion of 
patients with OS events, in particular in the subgroups by disease stage is still quite low (<10%), but this 
can be acceptable considering the prognosis of these patients.  
The observed toxicity is generally higher for A+AVD versus ABVD, however compared to ABVD a different 
toxicity profile is observed between the regimens. ABVD treatment is associated with increased risk for 
pulmonary toxicity, whereas the A+AVD treatment is associated with an increased risk of peripheral 
neuropathy and neutropenia /cytopenia effects. These are managed with dose modifications and primary 
G-CSF prophylaxis. Of note, the latter was not recommend for the majority of the study patients. G-CSF 
prophylaxis is recommended in the SmPC as this was considered to improve tolerability to A+AVD and 
reduce neutropenia and related complications.  
For the long term follow up no new safety concerns were reported, and long term safety is in line with 
what can be expected from the known safety profile of the product in HL.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk balance of ADCETRIS in first line advanced HL patients is considered positive. Clinical 
efficacy is considered demonstrated in terms of mPFS and OS. The efficacy is considered to outweigh the 
known toxicity profile for A+AVD. This regimen has a higher, but differential toxicity profile compared to 
ABVD and thus is considered to be a clinically relevant treatment option in this setting. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Adcetris in the indication  
ADCETRIS is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage III or IV 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) 
is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends  the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage III 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD), for 
ADCETRIS, based on the second interim analysis of OS data from ECHELON-1 study (C25003); this is a 
randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of A+AVD versus ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with 
advanced classical HL. As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. Version 18.0 of 
the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex I are recommended.

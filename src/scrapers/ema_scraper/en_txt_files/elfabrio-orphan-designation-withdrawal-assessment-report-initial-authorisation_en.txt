2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2017 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor Protalix B.V. submitted on 17 July 2017 an application for designation as an orphan 
medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing pegunigalsidase 
alfa for treatment of Fabry disease (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was 
submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan 
medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing pegunigalsidase alfa was 
considered justified based on non-clinical data showing reduced accumulation of toxic metabolites in 
relevant tissues and on clinical data demonstrating the stabilisation of kidney function; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to recurrent episodes of severe pain that do not 
respond to standard analgesics, and life-threatening due to renal failure, cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular complications; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing pegunigalsidase alfa will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
The sponsor has provided non-clinical data in a model of the condition that demonstrate that the 
product reduced peripheral neuropathy, which is an improvement over the authorised products. Clinical 
data also demonstrate reduced immunogenicity of the product compared to other authorised 
treatments. In addition, the product can be used in a wider patient population than migalastat. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing pegunigalsidase alfa, as an orphan medicinal product 
for the orphan indication: treatment of Fabry disease”.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Fabry disease is an X-linked multisystem lysosomal storage disorder caused by the absence or 
reduction of α-galactosidase-A (α-Gal-A), which is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) from oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids. The accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids (e.g. Gb3) leads to chronic pain, skin lesions, cardiac deficiencies and, in particular, 
renal involvement. End-stage renal failure and cardiomyopathy often lead to early death in Fabry 
disease patients.  
Typical symptoms include neuropathic pain, angiokeratoma formation, abnormal sweating, hearing 
loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The major complications of Fabry disease include kidney disease, 
cardiac disease and cerebrovascular disease.  
Fabry disease continues to be acceptable as an orphan condition.  
The approved therapeutic indication “Elfabrio is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in 
adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (deficiency of alpha-galactosidase)” falls 
within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Fabry disease”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Fabry disease is associated with the following characteristic signs and symptoms: neurological (pain), 
cutaneous (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, 
arrhythmia), and cochleovestibular and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attacks, strokes). Pain is a 
common early symptom of Fabry disease (chronic pain characterized by burning and tingling 
paresthesia and occasional episodic crises characterized by agonizing burning pain). With age, 
progressive damage to vital organ systems develops, possibly leading to organ failure, which is life 
threatening. Fabry disease is associated with an impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy. 
Most common cause of death shifted from renal disease (pre-2001) to cardiovascular disease (post 
2001, Mehta et al 2009). Data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (Beck et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare 
Diseases (2022) 17:238) suggest that the estimated median survival for male patients with Fabry 
Disease treated with ERT for 5 years was 77.5 years, compared with 60 years for untreated male 
patients. Women continue to live longer than men nearing normal life-expectancy.  
The condition is therefore chronically debilitating and life threatening.

The published prevalence varies significantly, ranging from 0.12/100,000 (Pinto et al., 2004) to 32.3 
per 100,000 (Spada et al., 2006), although the latter only refers to male newborns; female newborns 
were excluded from this study. There is a trend towards higher prevalence in more recent studies, 
most likely due to raised awareness and improved screening strategies and analytical methods. 
The sponsor proposes to use an incidence published by Spada et al 2006 which is 32.3/100,000 
newborns (Spada et al., 2006) (the highest incidence number) which is believed to have remained 
stable up to 2020. The total number of births in the EU in 2020 was then used to establish the number 
of children who were born with the condition. A total of 1,334 newborns were estimated to have been 
born with Fabry Disease in this manner which translates into 1,334 new cases per the total EU 
population or an incidence of 0.029/10.000. 
According to the ‘Points to Consider’ on the Calculation and Reporting of the Prevalence of a Condition 
for Orphan Designation (COMP/436/01, March 2002), the prevalence of a disease can be estimated on 
the basis of the incidence, using the following formula: 
Prevalence = Incidence x Mean Disease Duration 
Since Fabry disease is an incurable inherited disease, by taking the incidence rate derived from genetic 
screening of newborns, the assumed disease duration in this calculation must be lifelong.  
Before enzyme replacement therapy with α-Galactosidase became available, a reduced life expectancy 
of Fabry patients was reported (MacDermot et al., 2001a,b). Since ERTs have become standard 
therapy Fabry patients’ mean life expectancy was prolonged to 81 years (average for both women and 
men although men still live slightly less than the normal male population) to be in line with the general 
life expectancy in the EU 27 countries.  
Using this figure, a prevalence of 2.35 per 10,000 (0.029 per 10,000 x 81) can be estimated.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Current treatment guidelines include a very long list of adjunctive and preventive measures in Fabry 
disease patients for common Fabry related morbidities (Eng et al., 2006). Three medicinal products for 
the treatment of Fabry disease were approved via the centralised procedure in the EU: Replagal 
(agalsidase alfa), Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) and Galafold (migalastat).  
•  Replagal is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of Fabry Disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency). 
• 
Fabrazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency). Fabrazyme is indicated in adults, 
children and adolescents aged 8 years and older. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000109504 
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Galafold is indicated for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an 
amenable mutation (see the tables in section 5.1). 
Elfabrio is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in adult patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of Fabry disease (deficiency of alpha-galactosidase).  
As Galafold is only indicated for patients who have an amenable mutation this is a narrower indication 
than the one for Elfabrio, and therefore Galafold is not considered a satisfactory method to be 
discussed in the significant benefit section. 
The therapeutic indication for Elfabrio completely overlaps with the two ERTs (Replagal and 
Fabrazyme) currently authorised for the treatment of Fabry’s disease, and they will subsequently be 
discussed in the significant benefit section. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not request protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit.  
The sponsor included a discussion on the significant benefit over Galafold (migalastat) but as this 
product is not considered a satisfactory treatment for the full patient population of Elfabrio, it will not 
be discussed in this report. 
The justification for the significant benefit is based on claims of efficacy, safety and a major 
contribution to patient care (MCPC), discussed below. 
Efficacy: 
The sponsor states that both ERT products are efficacious in preventing morbidity outcomes, but a 
trend towards improved efficacy of agalsidase beta over agalsidase alfa has been described recently (El 
Dib et al., 2017). Therefore, they focus on the demonstration of significant benefit of pegunigalsidase 
alfa over agalsidase beta only as it is considered equally applicable to agalsidase alfa. 
The efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa was directly compared to agalsidase beta in the randomized, 
double-blind, active Control Study PB-102-F20.The two treatment arms were found to be comparable 
with regards to efficacy in the treatment of Fabry disease. There was a good overlap of the confidence 
intervals for the eGFR slopes of the two arms, with the lower bound of the confidence interval being 
well above the non-inferiority margin. The predefined primary efficacy testing for non-inferiority of 
Elfabrio compared to agalsidase beta on the measure of eGFR slope showed a margin of -2.444 
mL/min/1.73 m2/year for the ITT and a similar difference between the slopes for the PP population. 
Considering a non-inferiority margin of -3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, these results indicate non-inferiority 
of Elfabrio compared to agalsidase beta. As such, the current study is considered successful. The 
treatment difference was slightly in favour of Elfabrio when the clinically relevant stratification factor, 
urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR), was included as covariate in the primary analysis model. 
Safety: 
Safety data from pegunigalsidase alfa was directly compared to agalsidase beta in the randomized, 
double-blind, active Control Study PB-102-F20. 
Cumulatively, 2574 infusions of PRX-102 and 1303 of agalsidase beta were administered in the study. 
Patients in the PRX-102 arm received a mean (SE) of 49.5 (1.6) infusions, while those in the 
agalsidase beta arm received a mean (SE) of 52.1 (0.6).

Table 2 below presents an overview of the categories of Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs) 
reported in the study, showing the number of patients who experienced events in each category and 
the number of events. The majority of patients experienced at least one TEAE: 90.4% in the PRX-102 
arm and 96.0% in the agalsidase beta arm. 
Table 2.   
With respect to the subset of TEAEs that were considered related to study drug (either possibly, 
probably, or definitely), similar percentages of patients reported at least one related event of any type 
(40.4% vs. 44.0%), but the rate of related events was considerably higher in the agalsidase beta arm: 
42.9 events per 100 patient-years of exposure in the PRX-102 arm vs. 152.9 in the agalsidase beta 
arm. Similar percentages of patients had at least one related event of severe intensity (3.8% vs. 
4.0%) with corresponding similar rates (2.04 vs 2.01).  
As patients in the agalsidase beta had already been on agalsidase beta stable treatment for at least 
one year at the start of the study, the almost 4-fold lower rate of related TEAE for the patients 
switched to PRX-102 is believed to offer a clinically relevant advantage. The COMP does not share this 
view as they noted that the number of patients in the dataset was quite small making interpretation of 
this safety claim difficult. 
Serious AEs: There were no deaths in the study. Eight patients (15.4%) in the PRX-102 arm 
experienced a total of 14 SAEs, for an exposure-adjusted rate of 14.3 events per 100 patient-years of 
treatment, and 6 (24.0%) patients in the agalsidase beta arm experienced a total of 11 SAEs, for an 
adjusted rate of 22.1 events. The COMP did not consider there was any significant difference between 
the products again as the number of patients included in the dataset provided is quite small making 
comparative analysis difficult.  
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)  
IRRs were defined as TEAEs that occurred during an infusion or within 2 hours after its completion, and 
whose causality was assessed as definitely, probably, or possibly related to study treatment. IRRs do 
not include injection site reactions (ISRs). In the PRX-102 arm, 11 patients (21.2%) experienced a 
total of 13 IRRs associated with 12 infusions, for an adjusted rate of 0.5 events per 100 infusions. The 
rate in the agalsidase beta arm was considerably higher, with 6 (24.0%) patients experiencing a total 
of 51 IRRs associated with 40 infusions, for an adjusted rate of 3.9 events per 100 infusions. The 
sponsor noted a reduced need for pre-infusion medication seen in the PRX-102 arm compared to the 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000109504 
Page 9/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agalsidase beta arm. In the PRX-102 arm, 44.2% (23/52) of patients had at least one premedication 
during the study, compared to 68.0% (17/25) in the agalsidase beta arm. Even though there was a 
reduction in use of pre-medication, IRRs were still less reported with PRX-102, both indicative for a 
significant safety benefit of PRX-102 over agalsidase beta. 
Immunogenicity 
In both treatment arms, most cases of seroconversion were transient in nature: i.e., the patients were 
positive at only one or two timepoints and reverted to being negative thereafter. At the end of the 
study, higher portion of patients who were positive to ADA at baseline became ADA negative in the 
PRX-102 arm: 5 (27.8% of the ADA positives) vs. 1 (12.5% of the ADA positives) from the agalsidase 
beta arm. The COMP concluded there was no difference between the treatments. 
Integrated immunogenicity profile 
The development of anti-pegunigalsidase alfa IgG and neutralising anti-pegunigalsidase alfa ADA over 
time in studies PB-102-F01/F02/F03, PB-102-F20, PB-102-F30 and PB-102-F50 was presented for 
Cohorts 1, 2 and 4. The immunogenicity assessments were performed following a multi-tiered 
approach, thus further ADA assessments (including tests for neutralising antibodies) were only 
performed in IgG-positive patients. 
At Baseline, 25% of the patients with data in Cohort 1 and 33% of the patients in Cohort 2 tested 
positive for IgG and 89% and 100% of these patients, respectively, carried neutralising antibodies 
against pegunigalsidase alfa. The proportion of patients with IgG detected in Cohort 1 increased to 
36% of patients with data in the first 6 months of treatment but decreased steadily in the further 
course of treatment (note that the sample size decreased also over time). In Cohort 2, the proportion 
of IgG-positive patients remained fairly constant over time. 
Integrated Infusion Related Reactions profile  
Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) were defined as those related TEAEs which occurred during the 
infusion or within 2 hours after the completion of the infusion and were related to study treatment 
rather than to procedures.  
The reporting frequencies for any IRR and serious IRRs are provided in Table 9 for all analysis cohorts. 
Both proportions of patients with TEAEs and event rates (events per 100 infusions) are presented. The 
proportions of patients with events were generally similar across the cohorts. Event rates were low in 
all cohorts and ranged from 0.7 to 3.8 IRRs per 100 infusions. Rates for any IRR were highest in 
Cohort 2, but no serious IRRs were observed in this cohort. Serious IRRs were rare in all cohorts with 0 
or 0.1 serious IRRs being reported per 100 infusions in all cohorts. 
IRRs were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and resolved under continued treatment In addition, 4 
patients showed serious IRRs, all indicative of hypersensitivity reactions. 
In summary, the sponsor concluded that PRX-102 showed a more favourable trend regarding safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity profile compared to agalsidase beta especially when exposure 
adjusted reporting rates for TEAEs, ADRs, SAE, and IRRs as well as ADA are assessed. As the efficacy 
of PRX-102 has been shown to be comparable to agalsidase beta, the improved safety profile of PRX-
102 seems to be the main claim of significant benefit over existing ERT for Fabry disease patients. In 
line with the CHMP assessment (day 180 report) where it is stated that there is no difference in safety 
between Elfabrio and Replagal (agalsidase alfa) and Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta), the COMP does not 
consider the safety difference to be of such magnitude and relevance to that could be qualified as a 
clinically relevant advantage.

Major contribution to patient care: 
To support the argumentation of major contribution to patient care the sponsor has submitted 
simulated PK data.  
PK samples from studies PB-102-F01, PB-102-F02, PB-102-F20, and PB-102-F50 were used in a 
Modelling and Simulation Analysis to explore the exposure to PRX-102 with both treatment regimes, 1 
mg/kg E2W and 2 mg/kg E4W. 
PRX-102 plasma concentrations were simulated for the 2-dosing scenario following 24 months of 
dosing: 
1.  1 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (E2W) and infused over 3-hours for the first 3 months of 
dosing and over 1.5-hours thereafter 
2.  2 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks (E4W) and infused over 5-hours for the first 3 months of 
dosing and over 2.5-hours thereafter 
The results support that AUC and Cave following dose regimens of 1 mg/kg E2W and 2 mg/kg E4W are 
similar, and as expected Cmax is up to 86% higher for 2 mg/kg E4W dosing scheme as compared to 1 
mg/kg E2W. Ctrough is estimated to be detectable for both doses and is expected to be approximately 
53% lower at steady state for 2 mg/kg dosing 4 weeks after dosing as compared to 1 mg/kg 2 or 4 
weeks after dosing. 
The sponsor reports that by changing from a twice a month to a once-a-month dosing schedule they 
will improve the quality of life of patients. They have not, however, provided any data to support this 
claim. The only data they have submitted is pharmacokinetic data to show that similar efficacy can be 
achieved with the once-a-month dosage and that this could offer an alternative to twice a month 
dosing. The sponsor should provide further data to support the basis of major contribution to patient 
care showing a reduction in healthcare professional use for example as well as improvement in the 
quality of life of patients. The benefit of home use if made should be contextualised with home use of 
the other Enzyme Replacement Therapies authorised for this condition.    
The sponsor has not provided any significant data to support major contribution to patient care. The 
COMP therefore has requested that the sponsor further elaborate, with data from their clinical trials 
programme, the basis of a major contributions to patient care. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant Benefit 
The sponsor has not established a clinically relevant advantage to the other authorised enzyme 
replacement therapies in the condition. They should therefore elaborate on the basis of a major 
contribution to patient care using clinical data in patients with the condition from their clinical 
development programme to support the basis of significant benefit.

1.  Introduction 
Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is approved in the EU since 12 November 2012 for treatment of adults with type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A clinical programme to support treatment of paediatric patients is 
currently ongoing, as described in the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed with the Paediatric 
Committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA/PDCO). 
On 2015-09-07, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Forxiga, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
No changes to the labelling are proposed based on the results from the current study.

Standard Forxiga 5 mg & 10 mg Tablets were used.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Study MB102-091 is a randomised single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study of 
dapagliflozin in children and adolescents aged 10-17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its 
purpose is to support dosing in studies of efficacy in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study MB102-091 
Description 
The primary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of dapagliflozin in the range 
of 2.5 to 10 mg in paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with T2DM. Secondary objectives were to 
assess the pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability and to characterise the pharmacokinetics of 
dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (BMS-801576) following a single dose of dapagliflozin in the range of 2.5 
to 10 mg in paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with T2DM.

The primary safety outcome measures included adverse events (AEs) monitored from administration of 
investigational product. Safety assessments were based on medical review of adverse event (AE) 
reports and the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and clinical 
laboratory tests collected at specified time points. The incidence of AEs was tabulated and reviewed for 
potential significance and clinical importance. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group designed study.  
The study design schematic is presented below: 
S = Screening; R = Randomization; PK = Pharmacokinetics; PD = Pharmacodynamics; D = Study 
Discharge 
Twenty-four children or adolescents with T2DM were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 
2.5, 5, or 10 mg dapagliflozin (8 per dose group). There must have been at least 3 males and 3 
females in each dose group. For each dose group, at least 3 subjects must have been between the 
ages of 10 and 15 years and at least 3 subjects must have been >15 and 17 years.  
Subjects were admitted to the clinical facility the evening prior to dosing (Day 1). Alternatively, 
subjects could report to the clinical facility early in the morning on the day of dosing having confirmed 
(orally) that the subject had fasted since 2400 hours (midnight) the preceding evening. Subjects were 
confined to the clinical facility for at least 24 hours after study drug administration. Subjects returned 
to the clinical facility on the morning of Day 3 for the 48 hour PK sample collection and complete study 
discharge procedures. 
Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical 
laboratory evaluations were performed at selected times during the study. Blood samples were 
collected for up to 48 hours after study drug administration for PK analysis.

The approximate duration of the study was 31 days including the 28-day screening period. 
The clinical portion of the study was conducted at 18 clinical sites located in the United States and 
Mexico. The first subject was enrolled on 19-Jul-2012 and the last subject completed the study on 13-
Sep-2014. 
Study population /Sample size 
Male and female pediatric subjects, previously diagnosed as having T2DM by World Health 
Organization (WHO) or American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria, 10 years of age, up to 
but not including 18 years of age at Day 1, as determined by medical history, physical examination, 
12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations, with body weight ≥30 kg, were eligible to participate 
in the study. Subjects had HbA1c >6.0% to <10.0% obtained at screening visit. Subjects who received 
metformin must have been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1. Subjects who received 
insulin must have been on a clinically stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1. 
The number of subjects was not based on statistical power considerations since no formal hypothesis 
was planned to be statistically tested. 
Treatments 
Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of the following 
treatment panels: 
Panel 1: dapagliflozin 2.5 mg single dose orally on Day 1 
Panel 2: dapagliflozin 5 mg single dose orally on Day 1 
Panel 3: dapagliflozin 10 mg single dose orally on Day 1 
Subjects were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to study drug administration until 2 hours after 
study drug administration. All subjects consumed 240 mL of water 1 hour post-dose. Subjects were 
prohibited from drinking water one hour before and after study drug administration except with dosing. 
A breakfast or snack was served approximately 2 hours postdose. A standard lunch was served 
approximately 4 hours postdose. A standard dinner was served approximately 10 hours postdose and a 
standard light snack was served approximately 12 hours postdose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints were derived from plasma concentration versus time data collected on Days 
1, 2 and 3:

Formulation Swallowability: 
Subjects responded to a questionnaire on Day 1 regarding their experience swallowing the 
dapagliflozin tablet. The question regarding ease of swallowability consisted of the following categories 
for a response: easy, acceptable, difficult, and unable to swallow. If a subject was regularly taking 
metformin, they were also asked to complete the questionnaire to assess their experience swallowing 
the metformin tablet. 
Statistical Methods 
Standard summary statistics were used.

Abbreviations: SD = Standard Deviation; BMI = Body Mass Index 
CHMP’s comment: 
The age of the patients included ranged from 11 to 17 years. Notably the majority of patients were 
overweight as could be expected. The metabolic control, as reflected by HbA1c, ranged from 6.1 to 
9.7. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A summary of dapagliflozin PK parameters is provided below:

A statistical analysis (power model described by Gough et al (1995)) for dose proportionality is 
summarized below: 
CHMP’s comment: 
Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolized, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an 
inactive metabolite. Given that the 3-O-glucuronide is inactive, such data from the performed study is 
therefore not presented in this AR by the CHMP. 
In adults, the recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily.  
According to the MAH, similar PK is seen in the adolescent population and adults:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

“In pediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed following oral 
administration, with maximum concentrations achieved within 1.5 h after administration. Mean 
terminal elimination half life of dapagliflozin appeared independent of dose and ranged between 10 to 
14 h across the studied dose range and is similar to the reported half life of dapagliflozin of 12.9 h in 
adults. The increase in peak and total systemic exposure of dapagliflozin was dose proportional, as has 
been demonstrated for adults.“ 
The comparison with other adult PK data (AUC, Cmax) is not presented in the documentation, 
however, data indicate similar PK.  
When deciding on dose for the efficacy study, it is anticipated that any underlying trends in 
dapagliflozin PK due to age or weight is considered. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Urinary Glucose Excretion 
Table 10.1-1 shows the amount of glucose excreted in urine over 24 hours by dose of dapagliflozin. 
Following administration of a single oral dapagliflozin dose of 2.5 to 10 mg to pediatric subjects with 
T2DM, the amount of glucose in the urine over the 0 to 24 h interval increased in a dose-related 
manner.

Dapagliflozin (All Subjects) 
a N represents the available PD data for each dose. One subject was excluded from the summary statistics for the 
2.5 mg group due to anomalous PK and PD profile. Additional details are presented in Section 5.2.4 of the clinical 
study report. 
Abbreviations: N=number, SD=standard deviation 
Table 10.1-2 provides a comparison of the amount of glucose in urine over 24 hours in subjects that 
were receiving insulin treatment versus those that were not receiving any insulin. Overall, only a small 
number of subjects were receiving insulin in any dose group and the 24-h urinary glucose excretion for 
these subjects were variable, but generally similar in patients with and without concomitant insulin 
treatment.

Dapagliflozin (Subjects with vs. Subjects without Insulin) 
a N represents the available PD data for each dose. One subject was excluded from the summary statistics for the 
2.5 mg group due to anomalous PK and PD profile. Additional details are presented in Section 5.2.4 of the clinical 
study report. 
Abbreviations: N=number, SD=standard deviation 
In both groups, the mean amount of glucose in urine increased with dose. Mean amounts of glucose 
excreted in urine were generally similar for the 2.5-mg and 5-mg dose of dapagliflozin in subjects with 
and without insulin. There appeared to be a greater urinary glucose excretion in subjects being treated 
with insulin that received the highest dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg); however, the small number of 
subjects suggests that this result should be interpreted with caution. 
CHMP’s comment: 
A dose dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion was observed. No direct comparison to data in 
adults with T2DM can be made since no single dose study was included in the MAA for dapagliflozin. 
The 24h glucose excretion is in the same range as observed in the short-term study in adults with 
T2DM. It should, however, be taken into account that the glucose excretion is partly affected by the 
blood glucose levels as reflected by the differences observed between adult healthy subjects and adult 
patients with T2DM (see EPAR for Forxiga). In this context it should be noted that there was a rather 
large variation in metabolic control among the patients included.  
Fasting Plasma Glucose 
The fasting plasma glucose concentration was lower for all dapagliflozin dose panels on Day 2 versus 
pre-dose on Day 1. Summary statistics for fasting plasma glucose and changes from baseline are 
displayed in Table 10.2-1.

study report. 
Abbreviations: N=number, SD=standard deviation 
CHMP’s comment: 
In this single dose study, no dose dependent effect was observed with regards to FPG although all 
doses resulted in a lowering of FPG. This may be due to the small number of patients included and the 
rather large variation in baseline FPG. Thus this finding does not raise any concerns regarding the PD 
effect of dapagliflozin in children and adolescents. 
Formulation Swallowability 
The results from this study indicate that dapagliflozin 2.5-mg, 5-mg, and 10-mg tablets were easy to 
swallow. Twenty-three subjects reported easy swallowability, and 1 subject reported acceptable 
swallowability. None of the subjects reported the dapagliflozin tablets as difficult or unable to swallow. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Considering the age of the patients included, i.e. > 11 years, this information is of somewhat limited 
value but still reassuring. 
Safety results 
Administration of a single dose of dapagliflozin in the range of 2.5 to 10 mg in pediatric subjects aged 
10 to 17 years with T2DM was generally well tolerated and was not associated with clinically significant 
safety findings. 
There were no deaths, SAEs or discontinuation due to AEs in this study. There were no occurrences of 
adverse events of special interest in this study. 
Overall, 6 subjects (25%) had an AE in the study. Three subjects (37.5%) from the dapagliflozin 10 
mg panel (N = 8) had AEs of upper abdominal pain (12.5%), nausea (12.5%), vomiting (12.5%), 
decreased neutrophil count (12.5%), back pain (12.5%), rash (12.5%), and skin irritation (12.5%). 
One subject (12.5%) from the dapagliflozin 5 mg panel (N = 8) had an AE of pyrexia (12.5%). Two 
subjects (25.0%) from the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg panel (N = 8) had AEs of peripheral swelling (12.5%), 
influenza (12.5%), pollakiuria (12.5%), and cough (12.5%).

Table 8.6-1: Adverse Event Summary 
a Considered by investigator to be related to study drug. 
Two subjects (8.3%) had mild AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study treatments. 
One subject (N = 8) had AEs of nausea (12.5%), upper abdominal pain (12.5%), and back pain 
(12.5%) on Day 1 following administration of dapagliflozin 10 mg. One subject (N = 8) had an AE of 
pollakiuria (12.5%) on Day 1 following administration of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg. 
Nine subjects had a total of 17 clinical laboratory test results that met marked abnormality (MA) 
criteria (decreased leukocytes [N=2], decreased neutrophils [N=1], elevated AST [N=1], elevated ALT 
[N=1], elevated serum glucose [N=2], protein in urine [N=3], blood in urine [N=2], RBC in urine 
[N=3] and WBC in urine [N=2]; none of the MAs were considered to be clinically significant. Nine 
subjects are listed as having MAs of glucose in urine. However glucose in urine is entirely expected via 
the mode of action (MOA) of dapagliflozin and therefore may not accurately represent a safety signal. 
There were no clinically significant ECG findings, vital sign abnormalities, or physical examination 
findings after dosing. 
CHMP’s comment: 
One subject reported gastrointestinal AEs not listed for dapagliflozin which were considered related to 
treatment. All other AEs were either in line with the safety profile or mechanism of action for 
dapagliflozin or considered unrelated to treatment. Overall the safety data does not raise any new 
safety concerns in relation to the use of dapagliflozin in children or adolescents. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The primary objective of study MB102-091 was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 
dapagliflozin in the range of 2.5 to 10 mg in paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with T2DM. 
Secondary objectives were to assess the pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability and to characterise 
the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (BMS-801576) following a single dose of 
dapagliflozin in the range of 2.5 to 10 mg in paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with T2DM.

The age of the patients included ranged from 11 to 17 years. Notably the majority of patients were 
overweight as could be expected. The metabolic control, as reflected by HbA1c, ranged from 6.1 to 
9.7. 
Regarding PK, data indicate that exposure to dapagliflozin is likely similar when comparing the adult 
population and the current population administered the same doses. The increase in peak and total 
systemic exposure of dapagliflozin was also demonstrated dose proportional in paediatric subjects aged 
10 to 17 years with T2DM. 
A dose dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion was observed. No direct comparison to data in 
adults with T2DM can be made since no single dose study was included in the MAA for dapagliflozin. 
The 24h glucose excretion is in the same range as observed in the short-term study in adults with 
T2DM. It should, however, be taken into account that the glucose excretion is partly affected by the 
blood glucose levels as reflected by the differences observed between adult healthy subjects and adult 
patients with T2DM (see EPAR for Forxiga). In this context it should be noted that there was a rather 
large variation in metabolic control among the patients included.  
In this single dose study, no dose dependent effect was observed with regards to FPG although all 
doses resulted in a lowering of FPG. This may be due to the small number of patients included and the 
rather large variation in baseline FPG. Thus this finding does not raise any concerns regarding the PD 
effect of dapagliflozin in children and adolescents. 
Swallowability of the tablets was also assessed and the majority of patients reported that the tablets 
were easy to swallow. Considering the age of the patients included, i.e. > 11 years, this information is 
of somewhat limited value but still reassuring. 
With regards to safety, one subject reported gastrointestinal AEs not listed for dapagliflozin which were 
considered related to treatment. All other AEs were either in line with the safety profile or mechanism 
of action for dapagliflozin or considered unrelated to treatment. Overall the safety data does not raise 
any new safety concerns in relation to the use of dapagliflozin in children or adolescents. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Study MB102-091 was a phase II study investigating the PK and PD for dapagliflozin in children and 
adolescents aged 10-17 years. The study is part of the PIP for dapagliflozin and precedes a planned 
phase III study in this population. 
The data presented indicate that there are no relevant differences in the PK and PD in this population 
compared to adults. No new safety concerns arise.  
Recommendation

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Dry eye disease (DED), also referred to as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a multifactorial disease of the tears and 
ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance and tear film instability with potential 
damage to the ocular surface, which is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation 
of the ocular surface [definition in line with 2007 International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS)]. DED can be divided 
in two major classes, aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear-deficient dry eye 
may result from a failure of sufficient lacrimal tear secretion and can be further subdivided in Sjögren Syndrome 
and  non-Sjögren  Syndrome  dry  eye.  Patients  with  Sjögren  Syndrome  suffer  from  an  autoimmune  disease 
affecting the function of lacrimal and salivary glands amongst other organs and represent a group of patients 
with a worse prognosis and in need of effective treatments. Evaporative dry eye is due to excessive water loss 
from the ocular surface caused by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors. The most common cause of evaporative 
dry eye disease is meibomian gland dysfunction resulting in a deficient tear film lipid layer.  
Regardless  of  the  initiating  factors  or  groups  of  factors,  any  abnormality  of  the  ocular  surface  can  trigger 
disequilibrium in all the other components of tear dynamics. There is a common final pathway for expression of 
the disease, which is characterised by tear hyperosmolarity. Tear hyperosmolarity is common across all forms of 
DED and is central to the pathogenic mechanism of DED. It can set in motion a chain of events resulting in a 
vicious  circle  of  inflammation  causing  further  ocular  surface  injury.  Eventually,  patients  can  develop  a 
self-sustaining DED with an unstable and poorly maintained tear film causing ocular signs and symptoms, which 
may  develop  into  more  severe  forms  of  DED.  Inflammation  has  a  prominent  role  in  the  development  and 
amplification of both the signs and symptoms of the disease.   
The prevalence of dry eye ranges from 5%-15% in the USA, Australia, and Europe to 30-50% in Asia. Depending 
on the severity of the disease, patients with DED may suffer from symptoms of ocular irritation and discomfort 
as  well  as  visual  disturbance.  Severe  forms  of  DED  are  characterised  by  the  co-existence  of  clinical  signs 
including severe punctuate corneal erosion as well as constant, severe and/or disabling symptoms. However, 
there is usually a poor correlation between symptoms and objective clinical findings. If not effectively treated, 
severe  disease  forms  may  cause  major  ocular  complications,  such  as  infections  or  ulcers  with  potentially 
irreversible loss of visual acuity. 
Aside from the treatment of the underlying disease or removal of external detrimental factors, if possible, the 
treatment  of  DED  aims  at  both  improving  disease  signs  and  symptoms  and  depends  on  the  severity  of  the 
disease. Most patients with mild-to-moderate DED can be treated symptomatically with lubricants/artificial tears 
for long periods of time. Other therapeutic strategies include ocular inserts, occlusion of the lacrimal puncta, and 
anti-inflammatory treatment. According to DEWS, patients with moderate to severe DED are recommended to 
start  using  topical  anti-inflammatory  drugs  such  as  steroids  and  ciclosporin.  However,  long-term  use  of 
corticosteroids eye drops is associated with an increased risk of side effects such as intraocular hypertension, 
ocular infections and cataract.

Ciclosporin formulations, from 0.05% to 2% ophthalmic emulsions in olive or castor oil, up to four times daily, 
have been used in clinical practice as an alternative to steroids in severe forms of DED for several decades. 
However, no ophthalmic ciclosporin formulation had been approved for marketing in the EU at the time of this 
report. In the USA, a 0.05% ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) is available to increase tear production 
in patients with ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Restasis® is available in some EU 
countries  under  compassionate  use  programs.  In  other  countries,  pharmacy  compounded  oily  ciclosporin 
formulations are used. 
About the product 
IKERVIS eye drops, emulsion contains ciclosporin as active ingredient at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (0.1%) and 
is presented as 0.3 ml single-doses including cetalkonium chloride (CKC), a cationic surfactant to improve the 
residence time of ciclosporin on the ocular surface. Ciclosporin is a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide that has been 
used  for  several  decades  as  systemic  immunosuppressant  for  the  prevention  of  graft  rejection  following 
organ/tissue transplantation and the treatment of various immune diseases. It has anti-inflammatory properties 
due  to  its  ability  to  inhibit  the  development  of  cell-mediated  reactions  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  the 
production and/or release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2), as well as to upregulate 
the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. With inflammation being a key component of the disease pathology 
in DED, the anti-inflammatory effect of ciclosporin is thought to be the mechanism of action in the treatment of 
this condition. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication:  
Treatment of dry eye disease in adult patients with severe keratitis that does not improve despite treatment with 
tear substitutes. 
The indication approved by CHMP was: 
Treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite treatment 
with tear substitutes (see section 5.1). 
The recommended dose is one drop of IKERVIS once daily to be applied to the affected eye(s) at bedtime.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, positively-charged, oil in water (o/w) emulsion that contains the active 
substance ciclosporin at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The emulsion is milky-white in appearance. The finished 
product is packed in conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) single dose containers containing 0.3 ml of 
the emulsion. The single dose containers are provided in strips of five, which are packaged in a conventional 
sealed laminate pouch. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a formulation of ciclosporin for topical ocular delivery. 
Due to the poor aqueous solubility of the drug the development of an emulsion was pursued. A positively 
charged emulsion was designed to extend the residence time on the eye (due to electrostatic attraction with the 
negative charge of the ocular surface) in contrast with conventional eye drop solutions, where washout of the 
formulation occurs rapidly after instillation. This allows once-daily dosing to be achieved.  
In addition, eye drops are easy to administer and the resulting level of systemic exposure to the drug substance 
is reduced compared to systemic delivery.  
Therefore, the development program was designed to develop an ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion formulation 
that was suitable for conventional ocular instillation, easy to manufacture as a sterile product, isotonic to human 
tears and physically and chemically stable at room temperature. 
The following key factors were considered: choice of oil solvent for drug solubilisation, choice of surfactant to 
stabilise  the  emulsion,  choice  of  other  excipients  to  optimise  ocular  tolerability,  droplet  size,  physical  and 
chemical stability of the formulation, impact of heat sterilisation, impact of pH drop over shelf life. 
A solubility study of ciclosporin in different oily media was conducted to select the solubilising agent. The results 
from this study indicated that maximum solubility was achieved in medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) followed 
by castor oil and soybean oil.  As a result, MCT, a fully saturated triglyceride was chosen.  Moreover, as MCT is 
stable to oxidation compared to unsaturated oils, the risk of rancidity is eliminated, the use of an antioxidant is 
avoided and a longer shelf life can be guaranteed.  MCT also has a very low viscosity, ensuring easy spreading 
on the eye’s surface following administration.  
In order to facilitate the emulsification process and to stabilise the product by decreasing the interfacial tension 
between oil and water the addition of a surfactant was required. Two surfactants complimentary to each other 
in their hydrophilic –lipophilic balance were chosen: Tyloxapol (HLB of 12.5) and Poloxamer 188 (HLB of 29) to 
ensure physical stability of the dispersed oil phase within the aqueous phase.  
In addition, a cationic surfactant was chosen for use in the drug product based upon positive results in literature 
indicating that positively charged emulsions can optimise spreading and exposure of the ocular surface to the 
drug product. Several cationic agents were considered.  During initial development benzalkonium chloride (BAK) 
was  selected  because  of  its  extensive  use  in  approved  ophthalmic  formulations,  usually  as  a  preservative. 
However,  in  this  formulation  it  is  used  only  as  a  cationic  agent.  This  formulation  was  used  in  the  initial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 13/82 
  
  
pharmaceutical, nonclinical and clinical development. Subsequently, the applicant decided to replace BAK with 
cetalkonium chloride (CKC) since this is the most lipophilic of the three homologues in BAK. The selection of CKC 
instead  of  BAK  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  the  amount  of  quaternary  ammonium  used  by  a  factor  of  4.  To 
determine the optimal concentration of CKC, a series of emulsions containing different concentrations of CKC 
were evaluated for zeta potential and droplet size distribution at the initial time point and after stress conditions 
(15 days at 80°C) and freeze-thaw cycles. It is acknowledged that IKERVIS emulsion does not comply with the 
antimicrobial  effectiveness  test  prescribed  in  the  European  Pharmacopeia  (5.1.3),  which  ascertains  the 
unpreserved feature of the emulsion. 
Moreover, the applicant conducted a number of studies to compare the BAK and CKC formulations to identify any 
potential  changes  in  the  product  performance  or  quality  specifications.  The  comparisons  consisted  of 
physicochemical  comparison  (appearance,  zeta  potential,  droplet  size,  pH,  osmolality,  viscosity),  ciclosporin 
assay and degradation products comparison over 36 months storage at long term conditions (25°C / 40% RH) 
or 6 months storage at accelerated conditions (40°C / ≤ 25% RH) and droplet size analysis. The obtained results 
demonstrated that the replacement of BAK by CKC does not impact the formulation. 
In  order  to  control  the  osmolality  of  the  formulation,  two  excipients  were  considered  sodium  chloride  and 
glycerol.  The latter was chosen as sodium chloride affected emulsion stability.   
Finally,  sodium  hydroxide  was  selected  as  ophthalmic  pH  adjuster,  and  water  for  injections  as  the  aqueous 
diluent for the emulsion. 
Well-known pharmaceutical excipients were selected to ensure good ocular tolerability of the formulation, as 
described above. The excipients used are compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except CKC which is controlled 
through an in-house specification which includes some of the Ph. Eur. parameters applied to BAK, since CKC is 
a constituent of the mixture of homologues making up BAK. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The compatibility of the active substance with all the excipients used in the finished product formulation has 
been demonstrated through development, accelerated and long term stability studies. 
The drug product is a white milky emulsion intended to be applied topically to the eye and is presented in 
single-dose containers over-wrapped with an aluminium pouch to prevent moisture loss and protect from 
light. 
The emulsion has been characterised in terms of type of emulsion, impact of droplet size and structure of the 
droplet. 
Stability studies indicated that the formulation undergoes a decrease in pH over time and quickly reaches a 
threshold value. Since the water used in the preparation is of high quality and no ionic species are added to the 
formulation, a small amount of a pH decreasing substance (e.g. carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) can cause a 
significant fall in pH. A pharmaceutical study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the administration of an 
acidic drop of the drug product onto the surface of the eye. This study concluded that the pH of the tear film 
would remain unchanged after the administration of one drop of the proposed formulation.  Therefore, the low 
apparent pH of the formulation is not considered as an issue regarding the quality and product attributes since 
no degradation of ciclosporin or physical instability have been reported along with the pH decrease over time.  
The  choice  of  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  justified;  the  critical  process  steps  and 
parameters are identified. The sterility of the final product is ensured by combining a moist heat bulk sterilisation 
with  an  aseptic  filling  into  blow-fill-seal  single  dose  containers,  since  the  primary  packaging  made  of  semi 
permeable  LDPE  does  not  allow  a  terminal  sterilisation  by  heat.  The  method  of  sterilisation  was  selected

accordingly to the Annex to the Note for Guidance on Development Pharmaceutics detailing the Decision Trees 
for the selection of Sterilisation Method (CPMP/QWP/054/098 Corr).  
The primary packaging is 0.3 ml single-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containers presented in a sealed 
laminate  aluminium  pouch.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the 
container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: preparation of oily and aqueous phases, high shearing 
mixing,  high  pressure  homogenization,  sterilisation  of  the  bulk  emulsion  by  heat,  aseptic  filling  utilizing  the 
blow-fill-seal (BFS) technique and packaging.  
The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  since  the  emulsion  is  a  specialised 
pharmaceutical dosage form and aseptic filling is applied. The process is generally well-described, the critical 
process  parameters  and  in-process  controls  are  specified.  Process  validation  has  been  performed  on  three 
commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and comprise: 
appearance, identification (HPLC, HPLC/UV, TLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality  (Ph. Eur.), zeta potential 
(electrophoretic mobility), mean droplets size (dynamic light scattering), uniformity of dosage units (content 
uniformity) (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
The  proposed  specifications  are  in  line  with  ICHQ6A  and  general  Ph.  Eur. requirements  and  are  acceptable. 
However, there is scope for further tightening of the pH limits. Due to the limited batch analysis data at the time 
of opinion, the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the pH specification limit in light of new stability data 
from the next 10 new commercial scale batches. 
Beside compendial methods, in-house analytical methods are used for identification and assay of the active 
substance, determination of degradation products by HPLC/UV as well as for zeta potential and mean droplets 
size. The in-house methods have been adequately validated. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 pilot scale and 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches and three full scale batches stored under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 40% RH) and under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) for up to 36 months (pilot batches), and 
up to 6 months (full scale batches), as well as under accelerated conditions (40°C/≤25%RH) for 6 months 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of IKERVIS are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for appearance, pH, osmolality, zeta potential, mean droplet size, assay, related 
substances and sterility.  
The applicant performed forced degradation studies as a part of the validation of the HPLC method for related 
substances. The studies confirmed that isociclosporin A is the main degradation product under acidic, oxidative, 
heat and light conditions. It can also be concluded that the analytical method is stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products.  
A freeze-thaw cycle testing (24-hour freezing cycle at -18 °C, followed by thawing for 4 hours at 60°C) and 
shipment stability testing (at 50°C during 2 weeks, 5°C during 2 and 4 weeks and -20°C during 2 weeks (with 
one freeze-thaw cycling after 1 week) was performed.  The results from these studies confirm that the product 
the product quality is not affected by temperature excursions that might occur during transportation. 
The product was stable over the time-period studies. All results remained well within the proposed shelf life 
specifications and no trend was noted in any of the parameters tested apart from a drop of pH during 
photo-stability testing. This led to the conclusion that the product has to be protected from light as described in 
the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. A positively charged oil-in-water emulsion has been designed to extend the 
residence time of ciclosporin on the eye allowing a once-daily dosing. The choice of excipients used in the 
formulation has been well justified and it has been demonstrated by a number of studies that a physically and 
chemically stable emulsion with good ocular tolerability was produced. The manufacturing process has been well 
described and adequately validated. The results of tests carried out indicated consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn led to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the pH specification limit post-approval, based on new stability 
data from the next 10 new commercial scale batches.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme for IKERVIS was abridged and focused on the investigation of the 
disposition of ciclosporin after single and repeated administrations, in order to quantify the local and systemic 
exposure following ocular administration, and the examination of the topical effects in toxicology testing. Given 
that ciclosporin is a known active substance that has been used for several decades in the prophylaxis of organ 
rejection  following  transplantation  as  well  as  in  the  treatment  of  immune  and  inflammatory  disorders,  the 
pharmacodynamic effect is well described in the scientific literature and therefore, no non-clinical pharmacology 
studies have been conducted by the applicant. Furthermore, as the systemic exposure after ocular instillation of 
IKERVIS  was  negligible,  no  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies 
were  performed.  Instead,  the  applicant  made  reference  to  published  studies  in  the  scientific  literature 
concerning administration of ciclosporin via other routes. 
Some of the non-clinical studies were performed with a former formulation containing benzalkonium chloride 
(BAK) at a concentration of 0.02% w/w, which was replaced in the final formulation proposed for approval by 
cetalkonium chloride (CKC) at a concentration of 0.005% w/w. This was considered in principle acceptable in a 
previous scientific advice provided by the CHMP in 2010, given that BAK is a mixture of quaternary ammonium 
compounds  including  CKC  and  at  a  concentration  of  0.02%  w/w  contains  more  CKC  than  the  final  IKERVIS 
formulation,  thus  representing  a  worst  case  scenario  in  the  safety  assessment  (see  section  2.3.3.  for  a 
comparison of the PK profiles of both formulations). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The mechanism of action of ciclosporin is well known and has been described in numerous publications in the 
scientific literature (see section 2.4.3). Animal models exactly reflecting the human pathology of DED were not 
available at the time of this report and therefore no non-clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted by 
the applicant. 
The use of ocularly administered ciclosporin has also been documented in the treatment of DED/KCS. DED is a 
multifactorial condition in which increased osmolarity of the tear film, T-cell mediated inflammation and cytokine 
production,  decreased  production  of  mucins  and  goblet  cell  death  are  observed.  Beneficial  effects  of  topical 
ocular ciclosporin for the treatment of tear deficiency in DED were first reported over 20 years ago in dogs with 
KCS showing that topical ciclosporin has a marked lacrimogenic effect (Kaswan  et al., 1989, Olivero et al., 
1991, Kaswan et al., 1994, and Gao et al., 1998). Further data showed that ciclosporin exerts its therapeutic 
effect  on  KCS  not  only  by  inhibiting  T-cells  and  increasing  goblet  cells,  but  also  by  increasing  Aquaporin  3 
expression in the conjunctiva (Sun et al., 2005), and through an antagonist effect on prolactin. The inhibition of 
apoptosis appears also to be a key mechanism for the therapeutic effect of ciclosporin for KCS (Strong et al.,  
2005). 
According to ICH S7A guideline ‘safety pharmacology studies may not be needed for locally applied agents (e.g., 
dermal  or  ocular)  where  the  pharmacology  of  the  test  substance  is  well  characterized,  and  where  systemic 
exposure or distribution to other organs or tissues is demonstrated to be low’. As these conditions were met for 
IKERVIS (see section 2.3.3. and 2.4.2. for systemic absorption of ciclosporin after ocular administration), no 
safety pharmacology studies were conducted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014

Ciclosporin  is  known  to  interfere  with  efflux  transporters,  by  being  both  at  substrate  and  an  expression 
modulator  of  P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp/MDR1) 
(Bohme  et  al.,  1994)  and  by 
inhibiting  MRP1 
(Bobrowska-Hagerstrand et al, 2007). Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated 
proteins 1–6 (MRP1–6) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were found in ocular tissues (Karla et al., 
2009). Prostaglandin analogues and their free acid forms are substrates of MRP1, MRP2, and MRP5 (Hariharan 
et al., 2009), and thus it might be possible that ciclosporin modulates the ocular transport of these molecules. 
Since MRP1 is mainly localised in the basal cells of the corneal epithelium, its inhibition may results in a lower 
absorption of the prostaglandin analogues into the anterior chamber (aqueous humor). However, the clinical 
significance of efflux transporters modulation is still not clearly determined for antiglaucoma therapies.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The goal of the pharmacokinetic (PK) nonclinical programme was to characterise the ocular biodisposition of 
ciclosporin following single and multiple ocular administrations of IKERVIS (NOVA22007), and to compare it with 
Restasis (0.05%), which is authorised in the USA for the treatment of KCS and was used as a reference product 
because it was the only other ciclosporin-containing eye drop formulation available for human use at the time of 
this report. To this end, the applicant performed single and multiple dose studies in rabbits. Validated HPLC-MS, 
UPLC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS methods were used for the determination of ciclosporin concentrations in rabbit 
whole blood and various ocular tissues (cornea, conjunctiva). The limits of quantification ranged from 0.1 ng/ml 
in whole blood to 50 ng/g in the cornea. 
Absorption 
The formulation used for the non-clinical PK studies included BAK (0.02% w/w), which was later replaced by CKC 
(0.005% w/w) in the final formulation applied for. Furthermore, the old formulation included vitamin E, which 
was no longer present in the new formulation. In order to confirm that the ocular PK profile of the two 
formulations was comparable, the applicant performed a single dose study in rabbits. The study showed that the 
exchange of BAK for CKC and removal of vitamin E had no effect on the overall ocular PK parameters in the 
conjunctiva and cornea. Both maximum concentrations (cmax) and areas under the curve (AUCs) measured for 
the two formulations in ocular tissues were comparable.   
•  Ocular tissue 
NOVA22007 concentrations increased dose proportionally in the cornea and conjunctiva after both single and 
multiple instillation of 50 μl of NOVA22007 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml and displayed half-lives of 3.19-6.68 hrs and 
26.21-53.25 hrs in conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. Maximum concentration (cmax) was attained generally 
at 0.33 hrs. No (conjunctiva) or slight (cornea) accumulation of ciclosporin in ocular tissues was observed 
following multiple administrations.  The AUC levels of ciclosporin in the cornea were found to be doubled after a 
single instillation of NOVA22007 (0.5 mg/ml) compared to single installation of Restasis 0.5 mg/ml. Conjunctival 
AUC levels were similar for both formulations. Following repeated administrations (for ten days) of NOVA22007 
0.1% QD tissue ciclosporin concentrations (Cmin) were observed in the cornea at steady state similar to those 
observed following a 10-day treatment with Restasis (0.05%) BID. 
•  Systemic exposure 
Whole blood ciclosporin exposure as measured in rabbits following single or multiple instillations of 50 μl of 
NOVA22007 up to a strength of 1 mg/ml was shown to be negligible with all values < LOD (limit of detection) of 
0.1 ng/ml.

Distribution and metabolism 
Radioactivity levels were measured in ocular (including cornea and conjuctiva) and non-ocular tissues of rabbits 
treated with 3H-ciclosporin formulations for 7 days, at 1 hour and 24 hours after the last administration. The 
highest radioactivity levels were found in external ocular structures, and low levels were observed in deep ocular 
tissues. Some levels of radioactivity were found in systemic organs which the applicant considered to be likely 
due to the presence of radiolabelled ciclosporin metabolites considering that the higher count levels were found 
in the major elimination organs, liver and kidney.  
No additional drug metabolism or drug interaction studies have been performed by the applicant as ophthalmic 
ciclosporin metabolism could not be demonstrated in dogs and rabbits (Acheampong 1999, Wiederholt 1986).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant did not perform any single dose toxicity studies due to the low systemic exposure after ocular use 
of  IKERVIS.  However,  four  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  with  NOVA22007  in  rabbits  to 
investigate local tolerance (see below).  
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity 
As  the  systemic  exposure  after  ocular  instillation  of  IKERVIS  was  negligible,  the  applicant  did  not  perform 
genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  and  instead  summarised 
relevant information from the scientific literature. Ciclosporin is referred to in the literature as a non-genotoxic 
human carcinogen (McClain 2001, Hernandez 2009). The carcinogenic potential has been reported previously 
(Ryffel 1992, Durnian 2007), however excessive immunosuppression allowing for uncontrolled cellular growth 
was not expected at the doses used with an ocular topical application of ciclosporin 1 mg/ml, even in eye tissues. 
There  are  no  adequate  and  well-controlled  studies  in  pregnant  or  breast-feeding  women  with  either  oral 
ciclosporin or other ciclosporin ophthalmic dosage forms, however Ryffel (1983) reported no teratogenic effects 
for ciclosporin when investigated in different animal species, but there is some evidence for reproductive toxicity 
at high (maternal toxic) doses.  
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance of NOVA22007 was investigated in four repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits with instillations 
in the eyes four times a day for 28 days to investigate local tolerance (see below). Two of these studies used a 
ciclosporin formulation with BAK and two used the CKC formulation. Additionally, corneal sensitivity following 
repeated instillation of NOVA22007 was examined in a study with rabbits. 
NOVA22007 was well tolerated at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml instilled at 4-hour and 90 minute 
intervals. Slight signs of irritation mainly in nictitans membrane and eyelids were noted in all treated animals, as 
well as in animals administered the vehicle alone. Slight conjunctival redness was observed for NOVA22007 
1 mg/ml  but  no  histopathological  findings  were  reported.  Moreover,  slight  transient  conjunctiva  irritation 
reactions accompanied with focal unilateral and chronic conjunctivitis on the bulbar conjunctiva were also noted 
in a study with NOVA22007 containing 0.005% w/w CKC. These findings were also seen in an untreated eye and 
were considered attributable to the daily repeated instillations. Minor epithelial ulcerations or linear marks of the 
cornea seen in the same study were considered attributable to slight traumatisms and not treatment related.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 19/82 
  
  
Removal of Vitamin E and the change of the excipient from 0.02% w/w BAK to 0.005% w/w CKC had no impact 
on the ocular tolerance of the formulation.  
NOVA22007 1 mg/ml and its vehicle did not cause any anaesthesia of the cornea in rabbits.  
Other toxicity studies 
The  applicant  furthermore  performed  a  Local  Lymph  Node  Assay  (LLNA)  assay  in  mice  to  evaluate  the  skin 
sensitisation potential of the vehicle of NOVA22007 as well as a murine UV-LLNA assay and a study in guinea 
pigs to assess the phototoxic and photoallergic potential. Finally, the applicant presented the results of three 
non-GLP studies examining different safety attributes of the cationic emulsion in rabbits. 
The  LLNA  assay  showed  that  neither  the  BAK  nor  CKC  containing  formulations  induced  delayed  contact 
hypersensitivity. NOVA22007 was devoid of phototoxic and photoallergic potentials in the guinea pig. Finally, 
the  results  of  the  murine  UV-LLNA  assay  demonstrated  that  the  product  was  devoid  of  phototoxic  and 
photoallergic potential. 
In the first of the three studies investigating the safety of the cationic emulsion (Liang 2008), both BAK and CKC 
containing cationic emulsions proved safer and well tolerated by ocular surface tissue when compared to their 
equivalent  aqueous  solutions.  The  second  study  (Liang  2012b)  demonstrated  that  NOVA22007  0.5  mg/ml 
containing  0.005%  CKC  was  again  well  tolerated  and  was  comparable  to  other  BAK/CKC  free  ciclosporin 
formulations  (i.e.  Restasis  and  ciclosporin  oil  solution)  as  assessed  by  both  Draize  test  and  in  vivo  confocal 
microscopy  irritation  scores.  Finally,  to  assess  the  effects  of  the  cationic  emulsion/formulations  on  corneal 
wound healing, the applicant examined the effects of the cationic emulsion containing 0.005% w/w CKC onto 
damaged  cornea  (Liang  2012a).  Results  indicated  that  the  cationic  emulsion  was  well  tolerated  by  altered 
corneal epithelium and had a positive effect on cell survival and migration compared to 0.02% w/w BAK aqueous 
solution.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The predicted environmental concentration in the surface water (PECsurfacewater) of ciclosporin was calculated 
to be 0.00025 μg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Fpen was set at the default value of 1%, as the 
overall market penetration segment was estimated at 0.30% based on published epidemiology data. 
Furthermore, ciclosporin is not a PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) substance as log Kow does not 
exceed 4.5. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that IKERVIS was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Animal models exactly reflecting the human pathology of DED were not available at the time of this report. 
Therefore and since the pharmacodynamic effect of ciclosporin is well described in the scientific literature, the 
CHMP considered the absence of primary pharmacodynamic studies acceptable. 
The  lack  of  secondary  pharmacodynamic  and  specific  safety  pharmacology  studies  was  also  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP in view of the negligible systemic passage of ciclosporin after ocular treatment with 
IKERVIS (see also PK discussion). The CHMP considered that the maximum dose of ciclosporin administered to 
patients treated with IKERVIS in line with the dose recommendations of 1 drop daily was very low compared to 
the doses used in patients treated with ciclosporin in other indications, e.g. when compared to systemic doses 
of ciclosporin used to prevent graft rejections, there was a >2000 safety margin.   
The  clinical  relevance  of  ciclosporin’s  possible  interference  with  efflux  transporters  within  the  eye  was  not 
entirely clear at the time of this report (see PK discussion below). To avoid absorption interference and partial 
wash out of the product due to the excess instilled volume, the SmPC recommends that IKERVIS should be 
instilled at bedtime and should not be administered concomitantly with other eye drops, which was considered 
adequate by the CHMP.   
Pharmacokinetics 
The exchange of BAK for CKC and removal of vitamin E in the final IKERVIS formulation was shown not to have 
an effect on the overall ocular PK parameters measured in the conjunctiva and cornea, which was considered 
reassuring by the CHMP considering that several non-clinical studies had been conducted with the old BAK (and 
vitamin E) containing formulation only. 
No (conjunctiva) or slight (cornea) accumulation of ciclosporin in ocular tissues of rabbits was observed 
following multiple administrations, reflecting the highly vascularised conjunctiva environment where clearance 
is significantly greater compared to the cornea.

Systemic exposure after ocular administration of IKERVIS up to a strength of 1 mg/ml was found to be 
negligible. However, in an ocular autoradiographic study in rabbits, some levels of radioactivity were found in 
systemic organs, which was attributed by the applicant to the presence of radiolabelled ciclosporin metabolites. 
The CHMP considered this explanation difficult to interpret given that data in the scientific literature suggest that 
ciclosporin is not metabolised in the eye (at least in animals, see discussion below). However, as ciclosporin is 
a well-known active substance, the significance of this finding was considered limited. 
No  additional  drug  metabolism  studies  have  been  performed  by  the  applicant  considering  that  ophthalmic 
ciclosporin metabolism has not been demonstrated in dogs and rabbits (Acheampong 1999, Wiederholt 1986). 
However, the CHMP considered that the available literature data were controversial. The results of a publication 
in patients suggest that ciclosporin is extensively metabolised in the human eye (Althaus et al., 1996). So far, 
these data have not been corroborated by animal data and cytochrome CYP450 expression profiles in human 
corneal epithelium, and alternative explanations for the results of Althaus et al. such as an increased vascular 
permeability and reduce retinal barrier in the investigated patient population have been proposed. It is known 
that numerous phase I and phase II metabolic enzymes are present in the human eye, including cytochrome 
(CYP) enzymes, but data in the scientific literature (Kolln, 2012) suggest that these enzymes have minor or 
non-existent roles in the fate of drugs in the cornea. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that further drug metabolism 
studies were not warranted. 
The CHMP, having considered the totality of the data including the scientific literature, furthermore accepted 
that no in-vitro or in-vivo drug interaction studies were carried out with IKERVIS. While, ciclosporin is known to 
be  a  strong  inhibitor  of  several  transporters  such  as  P-gp  (MDR1),  BCRP,  MRP  and  OATPB1  (organic 
anion-transporting polypeptide B1), only transporters of the MRP family and BCRP are expressed and functional 
in  human  cornea.  The  applicant  acknowledged  that  inhibition  of  MRPs  in  theory  might  lead  to  a  decreased 
passage through the cornea of prostaglandin analogues used in the treatment of glaucoma, a condition which 
might co-exist in DED patients. The risk was considered by the applicant to be low, as either the inhibitory effect 
of ciclosporin on the efflux proteins normally expressed in the cornea (MRP 1, BCRP) was rather weak, or the 
level of expression of the proteins in the eye was low (MRP2, MRP4). There was no evidence in the scientific 
literature regarding interaction of ciclosporin with MRP4 or MRP5. Furthermore, while, compared to Restasis 
(0.05%),  which  was  the  only  other  approved  (though  only  in  the  USA)  ciclosporin-containing  eye  drop 
formulation  at  the  time  of  this  report,  corneal  ciclosporin  concentrations  will  be  higher  immediately  after 
instillation of IKERVIS 0.1%, similar exposure rates would be expected for both formulations at steady-state 
because IKERVIS is given once a day and Restasis is used twice a day. Thus, no increased risk for interactions 
deferred from increased local exposure, would be expected. 
The  applicant  proposed  to  further  explore  possible  drug-drug  interactions  in  a  study,  which  would  aim  at 
obtaining information at the transporter level (two year study program), as well as at the cellular level (one year 
study program). The study proposal was welcomed by the CHMP and considered useful to further explore the 
interaction potential of ciclosporin. The CHMP recommended that the study be conducted post-authorisation.  
Finally,  the  CHMP  noted  that  IKERVIS  contains  poloxamer  188.  Poloxamers  are  known  to  interact  with 
transporters  like  BCRP  (Giri  et  al,  2009)  and  MRPs  (Shaik  et  al,  2008).  Still,  the  interaction  potential  was 
considered small because of the high water solubility of poloxamer 188 and since the water phase of the tear film 
is  eliminated  from  the  pre-corneal  space  within  few  minutes  after  instillation.  Hence,  the  concentration  of 
Poloxamer  188  on  the  ocular  surface  decreases  rapidly  and  the  remaining  impact  of  the  expected  low 
concentration on the transmembrane efflux proteins was presumed to be minor.

Toxicology 
Systemic exposure to ciclosporin after ocular use was found to be negligible and thus the risk of systemic side 
effects due to circulating ciclosporin levels was considered to be low, justifying the lack of certain toxicological 
tests, including any genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. However, 
since  ciclosporin  has  been  shown  to  have  a  carcinogenic  potential,  peri-ocular  skin  cancer,  conjunctival  or 
corneal neoplasia was included in the risk management plan (RMP) as an important potential risk. This was 
agreed by the CHMP although the risk was considered low at the doses used with the ocular topical application 
of IKERVIS. 
No overt adverse effects attributable to IKERVIS were identified in the local tolerance toxicity studies. The CHMP 
considered that the conduct of these studies was in line with the Note for Guidance on non-clinical local tolerance 
testing on medicinal products (CPMP/SWP/2145/00). Although DED is a chronic disease requiring long-term use 
of  IKERVIS,  the  application  period  for  local  tolerance  testing  should  generally  not  exceed  four  weeks,  and 
therefore 28 days was considered by the CHMP to be an acceptable observation time using the same dose as 
proposed for clinical use. 
The use of the BAK formulation in some of the studies was considered acceptable in line with a previous scientific 
advice by the CHMP in 2010, given that BAK is a mixture of quaternary ammonium compounds including CKC 
and, at a concentration of 0.02% w/w contains more CKC than the final IKERVIS CKC formulation proposed for 
approval. Thus, the BAK formulation may be considered a worst case scenario in the safety assessment. CKC is 
furthermore well-known and, at the time of this report, was already used in marketed products and medical 
devices  within  the  EU.  Results  from  studies  in  mice  furthermore  indicated  that  the  cationic  emulsions  were 
generally well tolerated and a positive effect on cell survival and migration was seen for the CKC formulation 
compared to BAK aqueous solution. As these studies were not conducted in line with GLP, the evidence was only 
considered supportive. However, this data in addition to the known safety profile of CKC in marketed products 
and the local tolerance studies performed with NOVA22007 1 mg/ml containing CKC  was considered by the 
CHMP sufficient to support the use of CKC in the final product from a toxicology perspective. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered by the CHMP sufficient to support the application for a marketing 
authorisation  for  IKERVIS  in  the  treatment  of  severe  keratitis  in  adult  patients  with  dry  eye  that  does  not 
improve  despite  treatment  with  tear  substitutes.  The  CHMP  furthermore  concluded  that  IKERVIS  was  not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As IKERVIS is intended for topical use, no specific PK studies were performed. However, in order to evaluate a 
possible systemic exposure to ciclosporin as a result of the ocular administration of IKERVIS, blood samples 
were collected in patients included in the Phase IIa study and in the 2 Phase III clinical studies (SANSIKA and 
SICCANOVE)  and  ciclosporinemia  was  measured  using  a  specific  validated  HPLC-MS/MS  assay  (LLOQ  of  0.1 
ng/mL and LLOD of 0.05 ng/mL). The other method used in the Phase IIa safety study was an HPLC-MS assay 
with a LLOQ of 2 ng/ml. 
In study N09F0502 (see section 2.5.1. for a brief description), performed in 2006 in 53 patients with Sjögren 
syndrome, detectable ciclosporin blood levels were reported in only 2 patients treated with NOVA22007 0.05% 
following one month and three months of treatment respectively. In one patient, a ciclosporin blood level of 23.9 
ng/mL was found at one month of treatment and in the other patient a ciclosporin blood level of 19.9 ng/ml was 
found  at  three  months  of  treatment.  These  results  were  considered  by  the  applicant  to  be  likely  due  to  a

cross-contamination of the blood samples during their handling, as the values are substantially higher that what 
would be expected assuming complete absorption of the instilled eye drops. 
In the SICCANOVE study (described in more detail in section 2.5.2.3. ), 184 patients (85 who received IKERVIS 
and 99 vehicle) were assayed for ciclosporinaemia at baseline (Day 0) and after 6-month treatment (Day 168). 
Most of the patients (170/186) were below LLOD after 6-month treatment. Amongst the 322 samples analysed, 
16  showed  detectable  ciclosporin  levels  with  12  samples  being  below  LLOQ,  and  4  with  a  quantifiable  level 
(0.102, 0.110, 0.123 and 0.155 ng/ml).  
In the SANSIKA study (described in more detail in section 2.5.2. ) ciclosporin blood levels were measured at 
baseline,  and  at  Months  6  and  12.  At  baseline  5/213  patients  had  quantifiable  levels  as  they  were  already 
receiving  systemic  ciclosporin,  which  was  allowed  during  the  study  as  per  the  study  protocol,  provided 
treatment remained stable throughout the course of the study. At Month 6, 187 patients were assayed and most 
of them had negligible systemic exposure to ciclosporin: 157 were below LLOD, 23 were below LLOQ, 7 had 
measurable ciclosporin levels including 3 patients with measurements beyond the ULOQ of 5 ng/mL as they 
were  receiving  systemic  ciclosporin.  The  other  values  ranged  from  0.126  to  0.206  ng/mL  At  Month  12,  the 
systemic exposure profile appeared consistent with the profile observed until Month 6 (56 patients with <LLOD 
values, and 19 patients with <LLOQ values), whether the patient received IKERVIS for 12 months or whether 
the patient was switched to IKERVIS after 6 months on placebo. Measurable samples were detected in 7 patients 
and ranged from 0.105 to 1.27 ng/mL at end of study (Month 12). Two patients had values beyond the ULOQ 
due to use of systemic ciclosporin. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacology studies were conducted with IKERVIS since an adequate model of DED does not exist 
and since ciclosporin is a well-known active substance for which the mechanism of the immunosuppressive and 
anti-inflammatory actions has already been well-described in the scientific literature. 
Ciclosporin  acts  via  passive  entry  into  cells,  reversible  binding  to  cyclophilin  A  causing  inactivation  of 
calcium-dependent activation of the cell. The resultant immunosuppressive effect is caused by the inhibition of 
IL-2 production (as well as of other cytokines), inhibition of clonal expansion of T lymphocytes including mainly 
helper CD4 cell and its subsets (Noble, 1995, Donnenfeld 2009) and is reversible when treatment is stopped. 
Over recent years, inflammation of the ocular surface has been shown to be key in the pathogenesis of DED. 
Tear hyperosmolarity leads to irritation of the surface of the eye and promotes inflammation, involving cytokine 
secretion by epithelial cells as well as activation of the T-cells lymphocytes. An increase in soluble and cellular 
inflammatory mediators in the tear fluid (IL-1, IL-8, TNF-α, and MMP-9), conjunctiva and lacrimal glands has 
been reported (Furuichi  et al, 2002;  Li et al., 1981; Luo Let al., 2003; Rosette et al., 1996), which initiates an 
inflammatory  cascade  on  the  ocular  surface,  evidenced  by  increased  expression  of  immune  activation  and 
adhesion molecules (HLA-DR and ICAM-1) by the conjunctival epithelium. Increased HLA-DR antigen expression 
by the conjunctival epithelium detected by flow cytometry has been observed as a universal feature of dry eye 
(Baudouin  et  al.,  2000).  Secretion  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  sustains  and  intensifies  the  inflammatory 
response  (Meggs 1993;  Mircheff  et  al  1998;  Gao  et  al  1998),  causing  further  ocular  surface  injury.  The 
inflammatory  response  has  been  shown  to  consist  of  inflammatory  cell  infiltration,  epithelial  activation, 
increased  concentrations  of  cytokines  and  other  inflammatory  factors,  and  increased  activity  of 
matrix-degrading  enzymes  (Baudouin  et  al  1997;  Tishler  et  al  1998;  Afonso  et  al  1999;  Pflugfelder  1999; 
Pflugfelder 2000; Sobrin et al 2000). This key role of inflammation in the pathogenic mechanism of DED is the 
basis for the anti-inflammatory treatment approach.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As there is no adequate model of DED and since IKERVIS is used locally and there was no evidence of significant 
systemic  absorption,  the  CHMP  considered  it  acceptable  that  no  specific  clinical  pharmacology  studies  were 
conducted.  Ciclosporin  is  a  known  immunosuppressant  and  anti-inflammatory  agent  and  the  mechanism  of 
action has been well documented in the scientific literature. As inflammation has been shown to be key to the 
pathology of DED and has been postulated to be part of a vicious circle leading to a self-sustained disease state, 
the CHMP considered it plausible that anti-inflammatory therapies could be effective in the treatment of DED. 
While it is possible that systemic absorption of ciclosporin could occur through the nasal mucosa as a result of 
the  eye  drops  being  cleared  from  the  ocular  surface  through  the  lachrymal  draining  system,  PK  samples 
collected in the phase IIa and the two phase III trials with IKERVIS, suggested that absorption of and resulting 
systemic exposure to ciclosporin after ocular instillation of IKERVIS was negligible. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the view that the available information in the scientific literature as well the PK data collected 
in the clinical trials were sufficient to support the application for IKERVIS in the treatment of severe keratitis in 
adult patients with DED from a clinical pharmacology perspective. Given the local route of administration and 
that  no  significant  systemic  exposure  was  observed,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  lack  of  specific 
pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic studies was acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical trials program for IKERVIS consisted of two phase II and two Phase III studies (see tabular overview 
in section 2.4.1. ).  
This application was based primarily on data from the pivotal  Phase  III  SANSIKA  study, a randomised, 
double masked, vehicle controlled multicentre European study that assessed IKERVIS for the treatment of dry 
eye disease in patients with severe keratitis which did not improving despite treatment with tear substitutes. In 
addition, the applicant provided data from the supportive phase III SICCANOVE study in moderate to severe 
DED patients. The choice of the target population for the pivotal SANSIKA trial was based on post hoc results 
from SICCANOVE, which suggested a pronounced effect of IKERVIS in the most severely affected patients [i.e. 
those with corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) =4 and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) ≥23]. 
The applicant furthermore provided the results of a  meta-analysis of the 2 phase III studies (SANSIKA  and 
severely affected patients in SICCANOVE).  
Finally, supportive data was available from 2 phase II studies. In addition to informing the pharmacodynamic 
(PD), and safety profile of IKERVIS in adult patients with DED, the 2 studies provided the rationale for dose 
selection for testing in Phase III. Relevant dose finding efficacy data from these studies are discussed in section 
2.5.1.  
In the absence of an appropriate active comparator, the applicant used IKERVIS vehicle as a comparator in all 
studies. During the clinical development, the IKERVIS formulation was changed with regards to the excipients. 
Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) was exchanged by cetalkonium chloride (CKC), both excipients being used as a 
cationic  agent  in  the  formulation  to  stabilise  the  oil-in-water  emulsion.  This  change  was  prompted  by  the 
publication of the EMA Public Statement on Antimicrobial Preservatives in Ophthalmic Preparations for Human 
Assessment report

Use from 8 December 2009 (EMEA/622721/2009) to minimise the concentration of the quaternary ammonium 
compounds and related toxicity. One study in each Phase (II and III) was conducted with the BAK formulation 
and the CKC formulation. The formulation proposed for registration contains CKC and was used in the pivotal 
Phase III SANSIKA study.  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection of the dose used in SANSIKA, i.e. one drop of NOVA22007 0.1% (1mg/ml) once daily at bedtime, 
was based on the results of the pharmacokinetic studies conducted in rabbits as well as available data from the 
IKERVIS clinical trials programme. 
Based on the studies in rabbits, described in more detail in section 2.3.3. of this report, the applicant concluded 
that NOVA22007 0.1% QD appeared to be similar to Restasis BID (approved for treatment of DED in the US) in 
terms of target tissue exposure (cornea and conjunctiva) in rabbits. 
Selection of the dosing regimen was further supported by the results of the 2 Phase II clinical studies and by the 
Phase III SICCANOVE supportive study: 
Phase IIa study N09F0502 
Study N09F0502 was a multicentre, double-masked, randomised, parallel group, vehicle-controlled pilot study 
to  assess  the  use  of  3  different  concentrations  of  NOVA22007  (0.025%,  0.05%  and  0.1%,  one  drop  BID) 
administered twice daily in Sjögren patients with moderate to severe DED after 12 weeks of treatment. The 
study  recruited  53 patients  with  46  patients  completing  the  study.  The  main  objective  was  to  assess  ocular 
tolerance and safety as well as systemic safety. Efficacy was also assessed as a secondary objective although 
the study was not powered to show a difference between treatment groups.  
In addition to the confirmation of the Sjögren status, the main inclusion criteria were corneal fluorescein staining 
(CFS)  scored  ≥2  on  the  modified  Oxford  scale,  at  least  3  symptoms  (i.e.,  burning/stinging,  foreign  body 
sensation, itching, eye dryness, pain, blurred vision or sticky feeling or photophobia) scored >1 on a 4-point 
scale, and corneal staining scored ≥4 on the van Bijsterveld scale.  
CFS, Schirmer test, Lissamine Green, and Tear Film Break-up Time (TBUT) were used to assess effects on signs 
of  DED.  Symptoms  unrelated  to  study  drug  instillation  or  HLA-DR  expression  were  used  to  support  the 
assessment  of  safety  /tolerability.  DED  symptoms  were  furthermore  assessed  using  the  Global  Related 
Subjective Ocular Symptom Score. 
The percentage of improved patients for CFS in the worst eye was similar in all treatment groups (including 
vehicle), ranging from 70-82%. An improvement in CFS in the worst eye occurred in the four treatment groups 
from Day 7 and was maximal at the end of the study. Similar improvements in all four treatment groups were 
also observed for the Schirmer test and Tear Film Break-up Time (TBUT) and a slightly more pronounced global 
trend  towards  improvement  in  the  mean  Lissamine  Green  total  score  in  the  worst  eye  was  observed  for 
NOVA22007  0.025%  and  0.1%.  The  mean  symptom  score  was  higher  in  the  three  active  treatment  arms 
compared to vehicle. The applicant concluded that, as compared to the 2 other concentrations (0.025% and 
0.05%, one drop BID), IKERVIS 0.1% showed the most consistent improvement in both ocular symptoms and 
objective signs (improvement of corneal staining after 3 months of treatment).

Phase IIb study NVG08B112 (ORA)  
ORA  (NVG08B112)  was  a  multicentre,  double-masked,  randomised,  vehicle-controlled  dose  finding  study 
conducted  in  the  US  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  DED  for  a  duration  of  3  months.  The  study  used  a 
Controlled  Adverse  Environment  (CAE),  a  clinical  model  that  provides  a  standardised  approach  to  studying 
investigational treatments of dry eye by exacerbating the signs and symptoms of dry eye (e.g. corneal staining 
and ocular discomfort) in a controlled manner by regulating humidity, temperature, airflow, lighting conditions 
and visual tasking within the CAE chamber.  
Patients were randomised into the study on a 1:1:1 basis to receive one drop QD of either IKERVIS, 0.05%, 
IKERVIS 0.1% or vehicle. A total of 132 patients were randomised and 120 completed the study (42, 36 and 42 
in the IKERVIS 0.05%, IKERVIS 0.01% and vehicle groups, respectively). The main inclusion criteria were a 
corneal staining scored ≥2 on the ORA scale, a Schirmer test without anesthesia scored ≥ 1 and ≤ 10 mm, a 
response when exposed to the CAE as evidenced by a) an ocular discomfort scored ≥ 3 for two consecutive 
measurements within the CAE in at least 1 eye and b) a ≥1 increase in CFS in the inferior region as measured 
by the ORA scale post-CAE in at least one eye. The ORA scale is a 5-point scale to evaluate symptoms/ocular 
discomfort. ORA score was the average of all time points during CAE exposure (graded by the subjects every 5 
minutes during the 90 minutes exposure). At baseline all patients were scored 3 in average. 
The study failed to meet its objective on the co-primary endpoints, which were combining mean CFS and mean 
ocular  discomfort  based  on  the  ORA  scale  after  3  months.  The  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  CFS 
improvement showed a statistical significant effect  in favour of the 0.05% group (reduction of CFS of 0.3 units 
compared to vehicle), but not for the 0.1% group. This result was considered by the applicant to be explained 
by the small sample size which was based on an over-expectation of the magnitude of the treatment effect at the 
planning stage of the study (expected effect size = 0.75), thus suggesting that the absence of a significant effect 
for the higher dose could be a chance finding. For the ocular discomfort endpoint, the test result indicated no 
significant  treatment  group  difference,  with  patients’  symptoms  being  similarly  and  largely  improved  in  all 
3 treatment  groups.  Furthermore,  for  both  investigated  NOVA22007  concentrations  improvement  trends  in 
several dry eye sign and symptom secondary endpoints compared to baseline were observed. 
Phase III SICCANOVE study 
The SICCANOVE study is described in more detail in section 2.5.2.3. A statistically significant improvements of 
CFS (component of the co-primary endpoint) and of the percentage of CFS responders (post-hoc analsysis) were 
observed for NOVA22007 0.1% QD compared to vehicle.  
Conclusion 
With regards to safety, the applicant argued that the selected dose of one drop NOVA22007 0.1% QD has been 
shown  to  be  safe  in  clinical  studies  and  there  was  no  significant  systemic  exposure  to  ciclosporin  neither  in 
non-clinical studies (see section 2.3.3. ) nor in the Phase IIa and phase III clinical studies (see section 2.4.2. ).  
Therefore,  mainly  based  on  the  PK  results  observed  in  rabbits  as  well  as  in  the  phase  IIa  study  and  in  the 
absence of safety concerns in any of the tested doses, the highest strength of 0.1% was retained for the pivotal 
Phase III trial SANSIKA and is also proposed for the commercial formulation.

Patients  were  allowed  to  use  unpreserved  artificial  tears  (only  those  provided  by  the  sponsor)  as  often  as 
needed. Patients were instructed not to use artificial tears within 30 minutes before or after use of the study 
medication. Patients were also instructed not to use the artificial tears 2 hour before the study visit. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of 1 mg/mL ciclosporin eye drop emulsion 
(NOVA22007) over vehicle administered once daily in simultaneously improving signs and symptoms in patients 
with severe DED after 6 months of treatment. 
Secondary Objective 
The  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  ocular  tolerability  and  overall  ocular  safety  of  NOVA22007 
administered once daily in patients with severe DED at 2 time points: 
- at Month 6, after the randomised, double-masked treatment period, and 
- at Month 12, after the open label follow-up period.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy was to be only determined in the “analysis eye”, which was defined as the worst eligible eye, i.e. the 
eligible eye with the higher lissamine green staining score at baseline. If both eyes were eligible and had the 
same lissamine green staining score at baseline, the eye with the worst Schirmer test score at baseline was 
used. If both eyes had the same Schirmer test score at baseline, the right eye was used. 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  CFS-OSDI  composite  responder  rate  at  Month  6  (i.e.  end  of  Part  1).  A 
CFS-OSDI responder was defined as a patient satisfying simultaneously the following conditions:  
• 
• 
improvement of 2 points or more from Baseline in CFS based on the modified Oxford scale (i.e. change 
in CFS ≤-2), and 
improvement by 30% or more from Baseline in OSDI (i.e. % change ≤-30%). 
Secondary efficacy endpoint  
•  CFS responders at Month 6: patients with a 2 grade or more improvement in CFS score assessed based 
on the modified Oxford scale. 
•  OSDI responders at Month 6: patients having an improvement in OSDI score of at least 30%. 
•  Composite responder at Month 6: patients with a 2 grade or more improvement of CFS score assessed 
with  the  modified  Oxford  scale  AND  an  improvement  in  the  Visual  Analogue  Scale  (VAS)  of  Ocular 
Discomfort score of at least 30%. 
•  VAS responder at Month 6: patients having an improvement in the VAS score of at least 30%. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  CFS score assessed with the Modified Oxford Scale at Months 1, 3 and 6. 
•  OSDI score at Months 1, 3, and 6. 
•  VAS score at Months 1, 3 and 6. 
•  Schirmer Test score without anaesthesia at Month 6. 
•  Complete Corneal Clearing at Month 6. 
•  Artificial Tear use at Months 1, 3 and 6. 
• 
Investigator Global Evaluation of Efficacy at Month 6. 
Other outcomes 
• 
• 
• 
Impression Cytology for Conjunctival Cell Surface Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR) Expression 
at Months 1 and 6. 
Tear Break Up Time (TBUT) at Month 6. 
Lissamine Green Staining score at Months 1, 3 and 6. 
•  Quality of Life Questionnaires (NEI-VFQ/EQ-5D) at Month 6.

Furthermore, post hoc analyses were performed 
- with the primary endpoint setting the threshold of improvement of CFS at 3 grades; 
- with the CFS responder rate, setting the threshold of improvement of CFS at 3 grades; 
- with the primary efficacy endpoint at Months 1, 3 and 6; 
- with tear film osmolarity in patients with a score higher than 308 mOsms/L at baseline. 
Efficacy variables 
−  Corneal Staining 
In general, punctate staining of the cornea is not normal and the presence of punctuate staining suggests the 
loss  of  epithelial  cell  membrane  or  junctional  integrity.  The  modified  Oxford  grading  system  and  the  van 
Bijsterveld  scale  are  widely  used  and  standardised  methods  to  estimate  ocular  surface  damage.  More 
specifically,  the  modified  Oxford  grading  system,  a  7-point  ordinal  scale  (0,  0.5,  and  1  to  5),  was  used  to 
evaluate  corneal  fluorescein  staining  (CFS)  in  all  phase  III  and  phase  II  studies.  In  this  system  a  grade  0 
represents  complete  corneal  clearing  (absence  of  staining  dots).  With  the  van  Bijsterveld  scale,  staining  is 
graded 0 to 3 on the cornea and for two exposed conjunctival areas (range: 0–9). 
−  Symptom scores 
The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was designed to assess symptoms of ocular irritation and their impact 
on vision-related functions. It also allows the grading of dry eye severity. All 12 questions of the OSDI are scored 
from 0 (none) to 4 (all the time) although seven questions could be answered as “not applicable”.  
In addition to OSDI, each symptom was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of Ocular Discomfort, VAS 
(0-100), as a secondary endpoint. The global VAS assessment of ocular discomfort was the average of the main 
8 symptoms: burning/stinging, itching, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, eye dryness, photophobia, pain, 
and sticky feeling. Symptoms were assessed in each eye and the data was used to calculate the global VAS 
assessment for both eyes.  
−  Use of artificial tears (AT) 
Most of the patients were already receiving AT prior to enrolment into the study. During the wash-out period and 
throughout the studies, patients were allowed to use unpreserved ATs as frequently as needed. The number of 
estimated unpreserved AT provided by the sponsor was calculated as the difference in weight of unused and 
used AT bottles during the period, assuming that 1g of artificial tears contains 33.3 drops.  
−  Schirmer test 
The Schirmer test without anaesthesia is a well-standardised test performed with the patient’s eyes closed. 
There is wide intra-subject, temporal, and visit-to-visit variation, with the variation and the absolute decrease in 
aqueous deficiency being mostly due to the decreased reflex response with lacrimal failure. A low score on a 
Schirmer  test  is  an  indication  for  aqueous  deficiency.  The  lower  the  score,  the  lower  the  tear  production, 
whereby a score of 10 or more suggests normal aqueous tear production. Patients with severe to moderate 
aqueous deficiency would typically score in the range of 0 to 5. The diagnostic cut off frequently used at the time 
of this report was <5.0 mm in 5 minutes.

−  HLA-DR expression 
Flow  cytometry  is  a  minimally  invasive  objective  metrics  and  was  used  to  determine  HLA-DR  levels  on 
conjunctival  epithelial  cell  surfaces.  HLA-DR  is  an  immune-related  marker  normally  expressed  by 
immune-competent cells, and has been shown to be up-regulated in epithelial cells in cases of autoimmune and 
inflammatory disorders, and inflammation in the ocular surface. In DED, conjunctival and lacrimal acinar cells 
have  been  shown  to  over-express  this  marker  at  very  high  levels,  especially,  but  not  only,  in  patients  with 
Sjögren’s syndrome. Flow cytometry was therefore used to determine inflammatory levels in patients with DED 
and monitoring topical ciclosporin effects. HLA-DR expressions was quantified in Arbitrary Units of Fluorescence 
[AUF] and in percentages of conjunctival cells expressing HLA-DR (HLA-DR+). 
−  Tear osmolarity 
Tear hyperosmolarity, which is common across all forms of DED, is considered to be a global marker of DED 
(Lemp et al, 2011), and shown to correlate with disease severity. Osmolarity values above 308mOsm/L appear 
to be indicative of DED (Foulks et al, 2009; Lemp et al, 2011). Osmolarity was measured using the TearLab 
Osmolarity System with minimal disturbance of the tear film. For this parameter, the worst eye at each visit was 
used as this was considered more meaningful than analysing the same eye throughout the study. The post-hoc 
analysis  was  conducted  on  a  subset  of  patients  who  had  elevated  tear  film  osmolarity  at  baseline 
(>308 mOsms/L).  
−  Tear film breakup time (TFBUT) 
Tear film breakup time (TFBUT) is generally regarded as a test for diagnosis of evaporative dry eye. However, 
there is now good evidence that TFBUT alone is not a good differentiator for evaporative dry eye (Arita et al, 
2010). With traditional volumes of fluorescein (5 μl as used as per the protocol), TFBUTs in normal subjects is 
>10 seconds versus ≤10 seconds in those with dry eyes (Tomlinson et al, 2011).  
−  Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) 
In the absence of a valid and specific instrument to measure impact of DED on patient’s health status at the time 
SANSIKA was started, two instruments were used: the NEI-VFQ, an ophthalmic specific questionnaire, and the 
EQ-5D, a generic health questionnaire.  
The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) is a 25-item questionnaire, which was 
developed to comprehensively assess the influence of visual impairment on the multiple dimensions of HRQL, 
including emotional and well-being aspects, and visual functioning. A score of 100 indicates the best possible 
score, and 0 indicates the worst score. A 5-point difference on the NEI-VFQ-25 has been shown to be a minimal 
criterion for a visual impairment-related difference.  Of specific interest in the  study of dry eye is the ocular 
subscale score composed of 2 questions with a focus on ocular pain.  
The  EQ-5D  is  a  simple  indirect  utility  and  generic  questionnaire  designed  to  measure  health  outcome.  It  is 
applicable  to  a  wide  range  of  health  conditions  and  treatments  and  as  such  has  limited  disease-specific 
sensitivity and is lacking discriminative properties. It consists of five attributes, with three levels per attribute. 
The  dimensions  of  the  EQ-5D  include:  Mobility,  Self-  Care,  Usual  Activities,  Pain/Discomfort,  and  Anxiety/ 
Depression. In addition to these five dimensions, a visual analogue scale (VAS) for Overall QoL is included. A 
total score for the five domains is calculated. In addition, the VAS is scored as a separate measure. A total score 
of 1.00 indicates 'full health'.

Sample size 
Based on the data of the Phase III study SICCANOVE in moderate to severe DED patients, a sample size of 
approximately 225 evaluable patients (150 in the active group and 75 in the vehicle group, according to a 2:1 
ratio) was calculated to provide at least 90% power to detect a difference between NOVA22007 and vehicle in 
the main analysis at Month 6. In order to take into account a potential small percentage of patients (10%) not 
evaluable for efficacy, a total number of at least 252 patients was calculated to be required for this study (168 in 
the active group and 84 in the vehicle group). 
Randomisation 
Each patient who provided written informed consent, and who complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
at both the Screening Visit and Baseline Visit (Day 0) was randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups 
(NOVA22007 0.1% or vehicle) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. A computerised randomisation scheme was used. 
Randomisation was centralised using an interactive voice response system and an interactive web response 
system and was stratified by centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
Masking  was  achieved  by  providing  the  study  medication  (test  medication  and  vehicle)  in  identical  masked 
treatment  units  and  by  identifying  each  study  medication  by  a  treatment  number.  Each  patient  received  a 
treatment unit number by the study site. 
During  the  first  6  months  of  the  study  (Part  1),  the  study  medication  (NOVA22007  or  vehicle)  was 
double-masked. In the second 6 months of the study (Part 2), the study treatment was open label. Although the 
study treatment with NOVA22007 was unmasked in the final 6 months of the study, the investigators, centre 
staff, and patients had to remain masked to the prior randomised treatment assignments until all patients had 
completed the 12 month study. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was used as the primary population for the efficacy analysis. The FAS comprised all 
patients randomised into the study that received any amount of the study drug and were analysed according to 
randomised treatment (intention-to-treat principle). 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) was used for reporting safety data; this included all randomised patients for whom 
there was any evidence that they used study medication and for whom any follow-up data were available. Safety 
analyses were performed using the actual treatment received. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population excluded patients in the FAS with any major protocol deviations that could 
impact the efficacy analysis. 
During  part  2,  efficacy  analyses  were  descriptive  and  conducted  in  the  FAS-OPEN.  Responder  endpoints 
(CFS-OSDI,  CFS,  OSDI,  global  VAS  and  CFS-VAS  responder  rates,  complete  corneal  clearing  rate)  were 
analysed using frequency distributions and exact 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Other efficacy endpoints 
were analysed using means or medians (and standard deviations or range). 
A summary of the statistical methods applied to the primary and secondary endpoints as well as for the post-hoc 
analyses for part 1 of the study is provided below. Statistical testing was conducted at a two-tailed significance 
level of 0.05 for all tests, except for the test on the “treatment by pooled country” interaction effect on the 
primary efficacy variable (significance level of 0.10). No adjustments were made for multiplicity because the 
Assessment report

primary test of the primary endpoint was performed only once and the other efficacy results were considered 
supportive. Statistical testing was only performed for data of the analysis eye.  
Primary endpoint 
The primary composite responder endpoint was analysed at Month 6 on the FAS using imputed data. A logistic 
regression model, referred to as the main logistic model, was carried out with 2 factors, “treatment” and “pooled 
country”. Sensitivity analyses were also performed, using the main logistic model on the Per Protocol Set (PPS), 
on  the  FAS  using  observed  data,  on  the  FAS  considering  the  actual  treatment  received,  and  use  of  a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for pooled country. 
Secondary and other efficacy endpoints 
Secondary and other efficacy endpoints were analysed on the FAS and the PPS. CFS, OSDI, VAS and CFS-VAS 
responder rates, and complete corneal clearing rate were analysed using the main logistic model using imputed 
data. 
Analyses of CFS, OSDI, global VAS, and lissamine green total score change from baseline at each time point 
(Months 1, 3, and 6) were performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the following 
fixed factors: “treatment”, “visit”, “pooled country”, and “treatment by visit” interaction. The same model was 
used to estimate the treatment effect at Month 6, and if significant, the treatment effect at Month 3, and if 
significant, the treatment effect at Month 1. 
Schirmer test, TBUT, NEI-VFQ-25 and EQ-5D scales, impression cytology (after a logarithmic transformation for 
HLA-DR [AUF]) and tear film osmolarity were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the 
following fixed factors: “treatment” and “pooled country”, and the baseline score as covariate. The Shapiro-Wilk 
test  was  used  to  evaluate  the  normality  of  the  residuals.  A  supportive  analysis  was  conducted  using  a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for pooled country. 
The investigator global evaluation of efficacy was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for 
pooled country.  
Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the use of artificial tears. 
Post hoc analyses  
The post hoc analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint (composite CFS-OSDI responder rate) as well as the 
secondary endpoint of CFS responder rate setting the threshold of improvement of CFS at 3 grades instead of 2 
was conducted on imputed data and observed data, using the main logistic model. The primary efficacy variable 
at Months 1, 3 and 6 was furthermore analysed through a generalised mixed model. The post-hoc analysis of 
tear film osmolarity was conducted on the change from baseline at Month 6 using an ANCOVA model and taking 
the worst value of osmolarity between the 2 eyes (eligible or not) at each visit.  
Handling of missing values 
For  the  primary  endpoint  as  well  as  the  secondary  responder/non-responder  endpoints  (CFS,  OSDI,  VAS, 
CFS-VAS responder rates and complete corneal clearing rate), missing data were imputed as follows: 
• 
• 
If the patient discontinued before the Month 6 Visit due to lack of tolerance, lack of efficacy or change in 
dry eye therapy, the patient was considered a non-responder; 
If the patient discontinued before the Month 6 Visit due to another reason, a last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) procedure was used carrying forward the Month 3 or Month 1 recording; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 37/82 
  
  
• 
If the patient discontinued before the Month 1 Visit, the patient was considered as a non-responder. 
If the evaluation was missing and the patient did not discontinue before the Month 6 Visit: 
• 
• 
a LOCF procedure was used carrying forward the Month 3 or Month 1 recording, or; 
if the Month 1 and 3 recordings were also missing, the patient was considered as a non-responder. 
Furthermore, for the primary endpoint a secondary analysis was performed on observed data.

Recruitment 
A total of 313 patients were screened and 261 were randomised to two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (155 to 
NOVA22007 and 91 to Vehicle). A total of 52 patients failed screening prior to randomisation. The main reasons 
for screening failures were patients failing to meet the protocol inclusion criteria. Patients from one study centre 
(n=15, 5.7%) were omitted from in the analysis, due to an inspection outcome revealing breaches with GCP 
which led to concerns on the reliability of the data. As a result, 246 randomised patients were retained in the 
final database. 
The  study  initiation  date  was  31  March  2011  (first  patient  first  visit).  The  completion  date  of  part  1  was 
2 July 2012 (last patient Month 6) and of part 2 it was 13 February 2013 (last patient Month 12). 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  no  amendments  to  the  study  protocol.  However,  there  were  a  number  of  modifications  to  the 
planned statistical analyses, as detailed in the statistical analysis plan which was finalised prior to database lock. 
Baseline data 
In the FAS, the overall mean age was 61.3 years (range 22.9 to 87.6 years), with 85.3% of the patients being 
females  of  which  73.2%  were  post-menopausal.  A  total  of  37.6%  of  the  patients  had  Sjögren’s  syndrome. 
Almost all patients had a diagnosis of severe DED in both eyes (239/245, 97.6%). The overall mean time since 
diagnosis was 9.1 years (range: 0.2 to 31.5 years), and all patients were having artificial tears at study entry 
(10 drops/day in average). 
Table 2 – Demographic Characteristics 
The proportion of patients presenting any eye disorder other than DED was similar in both treatment groups 
(40.3% in the NOVA22007 group and 35.2% in the control groups). Diseases/medical procedures were reported 
in  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  NOVA22007  group  than  in  the  vehicle  group  for  cardiac  disorders 
(14.3% vs. 7.7%), immune system disorders (11.7% vs. 5.5%), and surgical and medical procedures (12.3% 
vs. 3.3%) respectively. In contrast, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were reported in a higher 
proportion  of  patients  of  the  vehicle  group  (14.3%)  than  in  the  active  group  (7.1%).  There  were  no  other 
differences between treatment groups. There were no marked differences between treatment groups regarding 
the proportion of patients reporting the use of concomitant medications. Some patients also received systemic 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants including systemic ciclosporin (n=5), or beta-blockers.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 246 patients enrolled, only one patient (not treated) had no baseline data and was excluded from the FAS 
(245 patients). One more patient (not treated) was excluded from the Safety Analysis Set (SAF), which thus 
included 244 patients.   
A  total  of  42  patients  from  the  FAS  had  at  least  1  major  protocol  deviation  in  part  1;  27  (17.5%)  in  the 
NOVA22007 group and 15 (16.5%) in the vehicle group. All 42 FAS patients having major protocol deviations 
were excluded from the PPS. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: CFS-OSDI responder rate 
Based on imputed data (according to randomised treatment group), the CFS-OSDI responder rate was slightly 
higher  in  the  NOVA22007  group  (44  patients,  28.6%)  than  in  the  vehicle  group  (21  patients,  23.1%).  The 
difference in favour of NOVA22007 (5.5%) was not statistically significant. 
When considering imputed data according to the actual treatment received or observed data (i.e. not imputing 
missing data), the difference in favour of the NOVA22007 group increased further but remained not statistically 
significant. 
Table 3 – CFS-OSDI response at Month 6 (FAS) 
CFS: corneal fluorescein staining; OSDI: ocular surface disease index questionnaire; n: number of patients. 
a CFS-OSDI responder: improvement of 2 points or more from Baseline in CFS in the analysis eye (i.e. change in 
CFS ≤-2) and improvement by 30% or more from Baseline in OSDI (i.e. % change ≤-30%). 
b p-value for treatment effect in the logistic regression model. 
c Total sample size for this analysis was 213 (131+82 patients), i.e. there were 32 missing data. 
Similar results were found in the PP population. Based on imputed data, there was no statistically significant 
difference in the CFS-OSDI responder rate between treatment groups (36 patients, 28.3%, with NOVA22007, 
versus 17 patients, 22.4%, with vehicle) and between pooled countries.  
Secondary endpoints: Responder/Non-Responders including complete corneal clearing 
There were no statistically significant differences in CFS responder rate, OSDI responder rate, VAS responder 
rate and CFS-VAS responder rate between NOVA22007 and vehicle. The responder rate at Month 6 tended to be 
higher for CFS, assessing corneal surface integrity (51.9% with NOVA22007, 45.1% with vehicle), compared to 
the  variables  assessing  symptoms  of  ocular  discomfort  (OSDI:  39.6%  with  NOVA22007  versus  39.6%  with 
vehicle; VAS: 31.2% with NOVA22007 versus 37.4% with vehicle).

Complete corneal clearing, i.e. CFS score going from 4 down to 0, was achieved within 6 months in 6.5% of 
patients assigned to NOVA22007 and 4.4% of patients assigned with vehicle. The difference between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. 
Similar results were found in the PP population.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Corneal Fluorescein Staining (CFS) 
CFS score at Baseline was 4 in all FAS patients, in accordance with the inclusion criteria of the study protocol. 
There was a statistically significant decrease (i.e. improvement) in CFS score over time (p<0.001) in the FAS. 
Over the 6-month treatment period, a global effect of treatment in favour of NOVA22007 over vehicle regarding 
the change in CFS score from baseline was observed (p=0.017). The decrease in CFS score from Baseline was 
greater with NOVA22007 than with vehicle at each time point, reaching statistical significance as early as Month 
3 (p=0.024), which was maintained at Month 6 (p=0.037). At Month 3, the adjusted mean change in CFS score 
from  Baseline  was  -1.51  with  NOVA22007  and  -1.13  with  vehicle.  At  the  end  of  Part  1  (Month  6  Visit),  the 
adjusted mean change in CFS score from baseline was -1.76 with NOVA22007 and -1.42 with vehicle. 
The global effect of treatment on the change in CFS score from Baseline in favour of NOVA22007 was also found 
when adjusting for the average number of artificial tears used per day (p=0.021).

Figure 2 - Mean CFS Scores from Baseline to Month 6 in the Analysis Eye (FAS) 
•  Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score 
There was a clinically and statistically significant decrease in OSDI score over time in the FAS patients (p=0.003) 
compared to baseline, with no statistically significant difference between treatment groups. The improvement in 
OSDI score compared to Baseline was statistically significant as early as Month 1 in both treatment groups. At 
the Month 6 visit, the adjusted mean change in OSDI score from baseline was -13.6 with NOVA22007 and -14.1 
with vehicle. The absence of a difference between NOVA22007 and vehicle was also found when adjusting for 
the average number of artificial tears used per day. Similar results were also found in the PPS. 
•  Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
Mean  (plus  or  minus  SD)  global  VAS  assessment  score  at  Baseline  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups 
(55.6±20.6 mm with NOVA22007 and 54.5±18.4 mm with vehicle). 
There was a statistically significant decrease (i.e. improvement) in the global VAS assessment score of ocular 
discomfort  over  time  in  the  FAS  patients  (p=0.010),  with  no  statistically  significant  difference  between 
treatment groups. The decrease in the global VAS assessment score was statistically significant at Months 1, 3 
and 6 in both treatment groups compared to Baseline. At Month 6, the adjusted mean change in global VAS 
assessment score from Baseline was -12.1 mm with NOVA22007 and -11.2 mm with vehicle. The absence of a 
difference between NOVA22007 and vehicle was also found when adjusting for the average number of artificial 
tears used per day. 
•  Schirmer Test (without anaesthesia) 
Mean  Schirmer  test  score  at  Screening  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (3.7±2.0  mm/5  min  with 
NOVA22007  and  3.9±2.2  mm/5  min  with  vehicle).  Schirmer  test  scores  ranged  from  2.0  mm/5  min  to 
9.0 mm/5 min in both treatment groups and thus were ≥2.0 mm/5 min and <10.0 mm/5 min in all FAS patients

There  was  an  increase  (i.e.  improvement)  in  the  Schirmer  test  score  over  time  in  both  treatment  groups 
compared to Baseline. At Month 6, the mean change in Schirmer test score from Screening (used as Baseline 
values  in  this  test)  was  +2.2  mm/5  min  with  NOVA22007  and  +1.5  mm/5  min  with  vehicle.  The  difference 
between treatment groups was not statistically significant. 
•  Use of Concomitant Artificial Tears 
Median use of artificial tears was discussed by the applicant instead of the mean because the distribution of the 
data was skewed. Median use of artificial tears during the Screening-Baseline period was relatively similar in 
both treatment groups (9.2 drops/day/eye with NOVA22007 and 10.2 drops/day/eye with vehicle). No major 
differences were seen in the use of artificial tears between treatment groups during all periods of part 1 of the 
study. However, the number of missing data was high. 
Considering all available data, there was a progressive decrease in the use of artificial tears over time in both 
treatment groups. The number of drops/day/eye was approximately 2 times lower during the Month 3-Month 6 
period than the Screening-Baseline period in both treatment groups. Median use of artificial tears during the 
Month 3-Month 6 period was 4.4 drops/day/eye with NOVA22007 (n=80) and 5.4 drops/day/eye with vehicle 
(n=55). 
Similar results were found in the PPS. 
• 
Investigator Global Evaluation of Efficacy 
Patient’s improvement was rated by the investigators as satisfactory or very satisfactory in a slightly higher 
proportion  of  patients  assigned  to  NOVA22007  (91  patients,  64.1%)  than  patients  assigned  to  vehicle 
(49 patients, 57.0%). The difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant. 
•  HLA-DR Expression on the Conjunctival Cell Surface by Impression Cytology 
At  baseline,  median  HLA-DR  (AUF)  was  relatively  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (64471.0  AUF  with 
NOVA22007 and 67663.5 AUF with vehicle). Values were spread over a large range in both treatment groups 
(6739 to 504052 AUF with NOVA22007 and 10117 to 477068 AUF with vehicle). The mean of the percentage of 
HLA-DR+  cells  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (71.5±17.9%  with  NOVA22007  and  73.3±14.2%  with 
vehicle). 
From baseline to Months 1 and 6, in the NOVA22007 group, there was a decrease in HLA-DR level of expression 
(AUF) and the percentage of HLA-DR+ cells at both time points whereas in the vehicle group, HLA-DR (AUF) 
tended to slightly decrease over time while the percentage of HLA-DR+ cells remained relatively stable.  
When compared to the vehicle group, the NOVA22007 group showed a significant decrease in HLA-DR (AUF) 
from  baseline,  both  at  Month  1  (p=0.019  vs.  vehicle)  and  Month  6  (p=0.021  vs.  vehicle).  There  was  no 
statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  groups  regarding  the  decrease  in  the  percentage  of 
HLA-DR+ cells from baseline to Months 1 and 6 (p>0.05, CMH test). 
Similar results were found in the PPS.

• 
Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT) 
Mean TBUT at baseline was similar in both treatment groups (3.3±1.6 s with NOVA22007 and 3.5±1.7 s with 
vehicle). There was an increase (i.e. improvement) in TBUT over time in both treatment groups. At Month 6, the 
mean change in TBUT from baseline was +0.75 s with NOVA22007 and +0.30 s with vehicle. The difference 
between treatment groups was not statistically significant. Similar results were found in the PPS. 
• 
Lissamine Green Staining 
During the study, some investigators declared that they were not able to perform the examination correctly. 
Therefore, during the blind review meeting, it was decided to perform a second analysis of the lissamine green 
total score, excluding patients for whom a problem was reported. Mean lissamine green total score at Baseline 
was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (4.5±2.1  with  NOVA22007  and  4.6±2.1  with  vehicle).  There  was  a 
statistically significant decrease in the lissamine green total score over time in the FAS patients (p<0.001), with 
no statistically significant difference between treatment groups. At the Month 6 visit, the adjusted mean change 
in the lissamine green total score from Baseline was -1.7 with NOVA22007 and -1.4 with vehicle. Similar results 
were found in the PPS.

•  Quality of Life Questionnaires 
National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire 
Mean NEI-VFQ-25 composite score at baseline was similar in both treatment groups (71.9±5.7 with NOVA22007 
vs. 74.0±13.4 with vehicle). Similar results were also found for the 12 individual scale scores. There was an 
increase in the mean NEI-VFQ-25 composite score over time in both treatment groups.  
At Month 6, the mean change in the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score from Baseline was +4.1 with NOVA22007 and 
+4.0 with vehicle, when adjusting for baseline scores. The analysis of the individual scale scores revealed that 
at Baseline 7 out of 11 vision-specific items as well as the item “General health”, which is not vision-specific, 
scored low (i.e. below 75/100 on average) in both treatment groups. All these items improved over 6 months in 
both treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups regarding 
the change from Baseline of any of these scale scores (or any other scale score), adjusted for baseline scores. 
However, a trend was found for a greater improvement with NOVA22007 for the ocular pain dimension: +14.4 
over 6 months (versus +10.0 in the vehicle group). Similar results were found in the PPS. 
The EQ-5D questionnaire 
Mean summary index of the EQ-5D questionnaire at Baseline was similar in both treatment groups (0.66±0.30 
with NOVA22007 and 0.66±0.26 with vehicle). Mean EQ-5D VAS score at Baseline was relatively similar in both 
treatment  groups  (63.9±19.2  with  NOVA22007  and  68.2±17.0  with  vehicle).  There  was  no  change  in  the 
summary  index  or  the  EQ-5D  VAS  score  between  baseline  and  Month  6  in  both  treatment  groups  and  no 
differences between treatments were found. Similar results were found in the PPS. 
Ancillary analyses 
(i) Post-hoc analyses 
•  CFS-OSDI Responders (based on at least 3 grades improvement in CFS) at Month 6 
The CFS-OSDI responder rate was statistically significantly higher (p=0.016) with NOVA22007 than with vehicle 
at Month 6. From a clinical point of view, this difference corresponds to a 3-time higher chance to be a responder 
with  NOVA22007  than  with  vehicle  after  6  months  of  treatment  (odds  ratio: 2.9,  95%  CI  [1.3;  7.7]).These 
results were confirmed when considering observed data.

•  CFS (At least 3 grades improvement) at Month 6 
In the FAS and based on imputed data (according to the randomised treatment group), the CFS (at least 3 
grades improvement) responder rate was statistically significantly higher (p=0.002) with NOVA22007 than with 
vehicle. The chance to be a CFS responder was approximately 3 times higher with NOVA22007 than with vehicle 
(odds ratio: 3.0, 95% CI [1.5;6.3]). 
These results were confirmed when using observed data. A total of 47 patients (35.6%) receiving NOVA22007 
and 12 patients (14.5%) receiving vehicle showed a positive CFS response at Month 6. The difference between 
groups was statistically significant (p=0.001).

c Total sample size for this analysis was 215 (132+83 patients), i.e. there were 30 missing data. 
•  CFS-OSDI responder rate (primary efficacy variable) over time, Repeated Measures Analysis 
Based on observed data, the CFS-OSDI responder rate increased over time in the FAS regardless of treatment 
group (p<0.0001). When considering all study visits, CFS-OSDI responder rate was statistically significantly 
higher with NOVA22007 than with vehicle (p=0.043). This difference between treatments was not confirmed in 
the PPS, although the p value was almost statistically significant (p=0.052). 
•  Worst  Tear  Film  Osmolarity  (Between  Both  Eyes)  in  Patients  with  Elevated  Tear  Film  Osmolarity  at 
Baseline 
At Baseline, 55 patients had at least one eye with a tear film osmolarity higher than 308 mOsms/L including 
34 patients (22.1%) in the NOVA22007 group and 21 patients (23.1%) in the vehicle group. Mean values for 
worst  tear  film  osmolarity  at  baseline  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (331.0±20.2  mOsms/L  with 
NOVA22007 and 321.5±10.5 mOsms/L with vehicle). There was a decrease (i.e. improvement) in worst tear 
film  osmolarity  over  time  in  both  treatment  groups,  whereby  the  NOVA22007  group  showed  a  statistically 
significantly  greater  change  from  Baseline  to  Month  6  than  the  vehicle  group  (p=0.048).  At  Month  6,  the 
adjusted mean change in worst tear film osmolarity from Baseline was -26.7 mOsms/L with NOVA22007 and 
-16.7 mOsms/L with vehicle. Both the mean and median values of worst tear film osmolarity in the NOVA22007 
group  were  lower  than  308  mOsms/L  (i.e.  the  threshold  value  for  defining  an  underlying  inflammation)  at 
Month 6, whereas they remained slightly higher than 308 mOsms/L in the vehicle group.

(ii) Descriptive Efficacy Analyses - Part 2 of SANSIKA (FAS-OPEN) 
Among the 208 patients who completed part 1 of SANSIKA, 207 entered part 2 and all received NOVA22007, 
allowing a descriptive analysis of the long-term efficacy of NOVA22007 over 12 months.  
The CFS-OSDI responder rate continued to increase during the last 6 months of the study in both groups to 
reach  39.1%  at  Month  12  in  the  NOVA22007/NOVA22007  group  (patients  who  received  NOVA22007  for 
12 months) and 38.0% in the vehicle/NOVA22007 group (patients who received the vehicle for 6 month and 
were then switched to NOVA22007).  
The other responder rates (CFS, OSDI, VAS and CFS-VAS) also increased between Month 6 and Month 12, with 
no  marked  differences  between  groups  except  the  CFS  responder  rate  which  was  higher  in  the 
NOVA22007/NOVA22007  group  (65.6%)  compared  to  the  vehicle/NOVA22007  group  (54.4%)  at  Month  12. 
Catching up in the vehicle/NOVA22007 group during the last 6 months was also observed for complete corneal 
clearing (11.4% at Month 12, versus 12.5% in the NOVA22007/NOVA22007 group), the investigator’s global 
evaluation of efficacy at Month 12 (71.7% of patients showing a satisfactory/very satisfactory improvement in 
the  NOVA22007/NOVA22007  group  vs.  69.9%  in  the  vehicle/NOVA22007  group),  and  HLA-DR  expression. 
During  the  last  6  months  of  the  study,  median  HLA-DR  level  of  expression  (AUF)  decreased  in  the 
vehicle/NOVA22007  group  (-5065.5  AUF),  whereas  it  did  not  change  in  the  NOVA22007/NOVA22007  group 
(+314.0 AUF).  
Mean scores of CFS, OSDI and global VAS decreased (i.e. improved) steadily between baseline and Month 12 in 
both  group.  The  improvement  was  greater  during  the  first  6  months  than  during  the  last  6  months.  Mean 
lissamine green total score decreased (i.e. improved) between baseline and Month 6, then remained stable until 
Month 12, in both treatment groups. 
Other variables (Schirmer test, TBUT and NEI-VFQ-25 and EQ-5D) remained relatively stable in both treatment 
groups.  In  addition,  the  percentage  of  HLA-DR+  cells  varied  over  time  but did  not  markedly  differ  between 
baseline and Month 12 in both groups. The analysis of the use of AT and tear film osmolarity was hampered by 
the low sample size for both variables.

2.5.2.1.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A  meta-analysis  of  the  data  from  the  two  Phase  III  trials  SANSIKA  and  SICCANOVE  was  performed  by  the 
applicant. The SICCANOVE study is described in section 2.5.2.3.  
The primary objective of the meta-analysis was to increase the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of the 
treatment effect. The second objective was to deepen the scientific knowledge of the disease in patients with 
Sjögren syndrome, and on HLA-DR expression. 
The meta-analysis used the same endpoint, analysis, and methodology as in the SANSIKA study and focused on 
composite CFS/OSDI response at Month 6: 
• 
• 
In  the  combined  FAS  population  (n=734),  i.e.  all  FAS  SANSIKA  (n=245)  and  SICCANOVE  patients 
(n=489),  to  avoid  the  bias  due  to  the  post-hoc  selection  of  the  most  responsive  patients  from 
SICCANOVE. 
In the population with severe DED only (severe FAS), i.e. those patients with a CFS graded 4 on the 
modified Oxford grading scale, and OSDI ≥23, as included in the SANSIKA study; this patient population 
only  represented  a  subset  of  the  patient  population  included  in  the  SICCANOVE  study  (NOVA22007 
n=39; vehicle n=35). 
A specific meta-analysis model was used for the data analysis. The study effect was included in a logistic model 
to take into account the structure of the data set (test and estimation of heterogeneity between studies). There 
was no adjustment for multiplicity; statistical testing was performed at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05.  
Results 
•  CFS-OSDI response at Month 6 
In the combined FAS population, the rate of responders (patients with an improved CFS ≥2 and an improved 
OSDI  ≥30%)  was  greater  with  NOVA22007  compared  to  vehicle  with  a  statistically  significant  difference 
(p=0.015). A similar significant difference was observed in the severe combined population (p=0.038).

Sjögren patients 
In  the  subgroup  of  Sjögren  patients  with  severe  DED  (CFS  graded  4  and  OSDI ≥ 23,  n=  130),  the  rate  of 
responders  was  23.4%  for  NOVA22007  and  9.4%  for  vehicle  (p=0.036),  resulting  in  an  Odds-Ratio  of  3.04 
[1.13; 9.50]. In the Sjögren All FAS, the rate of responders was 19.2% for NOVA22007 and 11.6% for vehicle 
resulting  in  an  Odd-Ratio  of  1.773  [0.893;  3.657].  The  between-treatment  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant. 
•  HLA-DR expression on the conjunctival cell surface by impression cytology 
Impression cytology was performed in all patients involved in the Phase III SANSIKA pivotal study and in a 
subset (n= 70) of the patients of the Phase III SICCANOVE supportive study. HLA-DR expression was measured 
at  Months  1,  6  and  12  in  SANSIKA,  and  at  Month  6  in  SICCANOVE.  Data  of  the  patients  included  in  the 
meta-analysis were distributed according to the level of disease severity, meaning by CFS grade severity from 
2 to 4 inclusive. Data from Baseline and Month 6 were pooled in the meta-analysis. 
At baseline, inflammation appeared higher in Grade 4 patients as compared to Grade 3 or 2, as shown by the 
mean values of HLA DR expression. At Month 6 and as compared to vehicle, NOVA22007 significantly reduced 
the HLA DR expression (p<0.001). 
2.5.2.2.  Clinical studies in special populations 
In addition to the data included and assessed in the pre-specified meta-analysis (see section 2.5.2.1.), post hoc 
subgroup analyses were performed on a purely descriptive basis. Data were presented for the change in CFS 
score in the All FAS population according to age, gender, menopausal and Sjögren status, age and duration of 
the disease. Results are displayed using a Forest plot (see Figure 5).

2.5.2.3.  Supportive study(ies) 
The  phase  II  studies  N09F0502  and  NVG08B112  (ORA)  are  described  in  section  2.5.1.  A  summary  of  the 
supportive Phase III trial SICCANOVE is given below. 
Study NVG06C103 (SICCANOVE): A Phase III, multicenter, randomised, controlled, double-masked 
trial of NOVA22007 (ciclosporin 0.1%) ophthalmic cationic emulsion versus vehicle in patients with 
moderate to severe dry eye syndrome. 
Study design and objectives:  
The Phase III supportive SICCANOVE study enrolled patients with moderate to severe DED from 61 European 
centres  in  Germany,  Italy,  Czech  Republic,  Spain  and  the  UK.  Apart  from  the  disease  severity, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were broadly comparable to SANSIKA.  
The inclusion criteria are listed below: 
Male or female patients, aged ≥18 years, who had moderate to severe dry eye condition at Baseline persisting 
despite  conventional  management  (which  could  include  artificial  tear  drops,  gels  or  ointments  and  punctual 
occlusion), defined as follows:

Tear break-up time (TBUT) ≤8 seconds, and, 
•  CFS ≥2 and ≤4 (modified Oxford scale, scale 0-5), and, 
•  Schirmer tear test without anaesthesia of ≥2 mm/5 min and <10 mm/5 min, and, 
• 
Lissamine green staining >4 (Van Bijsterveld scale, scale 0-9). 
This study consisted of three phases: Screening, a 2-week wash-out period (between Screening and Baseline 
visits), and a 6-month double-masked treatment phase (Baseline to Month 6 visits). 
The  study  was  designed  to  primarily  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  NOVA22007  0.1%  ophthalmic 
emulsion, administered once daily versus vehicle after a 6-month treatment period (last patient last 
visit on 8 September 2009). Randomisation was centralised and stratified by Sjögren syndrome status.  
Use of artificial tears was allowed but their intake was capped to no more than one drop, six times daily, in each 
eye, during the entire study period. 
The co-primary endpoints of this study were: 
−  Objective parameter: Change in corneal fluorescein staining (modified Oxford scale) from Baseline to 
Day 168. 
−  Subjective  parameter:  Change  in  global  score  of  ocular  discomfort  unrelated  to  study  medication 
instillation (VAS), from Baseline to Day 168. 
Assessment of efficacy was made only with the “worst eligible eye”, which was the eye with the highest modified 
Oxford score for corneal staining at baseline; in case both eyes had the same degree of corneal staining, the 
right eye was considered. 
Analyses were performed on the FAS (all randomised patients except for those who withdrew from the study 
prior to providing any post-treatment efficacy evaluations unless they withdrew for a reason clearly related to 
study treatment) using an ANCOVA model which included treatment with two levels (one for each treatment 
group), Sjögren status (with two levels: Sjögren, non-Sjögren) and the corresponding Baseline score (defined 
as the “main model”). The mean change from Baseline was estimated by the least-squares means (LS means). 
No adjustments for multiplicity were necessary since statistical significance for both co-primary variables at the 
same significance level (5%) was required. Missing data for the primary efficacy variables were to be imputed by 
the  last  available  value  (which  may  have  been  the  Baseline  value).  In  addition,  secondary  analyses  were 
performed in the PP population, based on the ANCOVA model as described above with country effect, using the 
observed data only and with handling of missing data by the best plausible outcome. 
Relevant secondary endpoints are described under results. 
The efficacy variables used in SICCANOVE were largely the same as in SANSIKA (see also section 0).  
Results 
Six hundred (600) patients were screened and 496 patients were enrolled. Of these, 7 patients were excluded 
from  the  FAS  population  and  the  FAS  population  consisted  of  489  patients.  Of  these,  241  patients  received 
NOVA22007 treatment and 248 patients vehicle. There were 142 patients in the FAS population who had a major 
protocol deviation that may have had an impact on the efficacy analysis for the two co-primary endpoints. These 
patients were excluded from the PP population. Thus, the PP population consisted of 347 patients.

Demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  groups. 
Overall, there were 76 male (15.5%) and 413 female (84.5%) patients included in the study. The distribution of 
male  and  female  patients  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  and  the  majority  of  female  patients  were 
post-menopausal  (294/413  [71.2%]).  Patients  had  a  mean  age  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups 
(57.6 years vs. 58.8 years) and age ranged from 20 to 90 years. The majority of patients included in the study 
were Caucasian (98.8%). In addition, the NOVA22007 group included 3/241 Black patients (1.2%); whilst the 
Vehicle group included 2/248 Black patients (0.8%) and 1/248 Asian patient (0.4%). A total of 177/489 patients 
(36.2%)  had  Sjögren’s  syndrome  and  the  distribution  of  Sjögren’s  syndrome  patients  was  similar  between 
treatment groups. 
•  Co-primary efficacy endpoint 
The mean change in CFS from Baseline to Day 168 was -1.05 (NOVA22007) and -0.82 (vehicle). A statistically 
significant  treatment  effect  in  favour  of  NOVA22007  was  shown  using  an  ANCOVA  model  (p=0.009).  These 
findings  were  supported  by  a  non-parametric  analysis  and  in  the  PP  population  and  in  all  the  predefined 
robustness analyses. 
With regards to the country effect, the estimated treatment difference between groups was (not significantly) in 
favour of vehicle only in two countries (Czech Republic and UK), which was suggested to be due to a patient 
population with less severe dry eye syndrome at Baseline (Czech Republic) and the high number of patients with 
blepharitis in the UK, as it has been shown that ciclosporin has merely a modest effect in DED patients with 
blepharitis. The treatment by Sjögren status interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.599). However the 
Sjögren effect (alone) is significant in all models: patients with Sjögren syndrome have an evolution of CFS 
different from the other patients, but independently of their group of treatment. 
The mean change in global ocular discomfort VAS score from Baseline to Day 168 was -12.82 (NOVA22007) and 
-11.21  (Vehicle)  showing  a  noticeable  improvement  in  both  groups.  No  statistically  significant  difference 
between treatment groups was shown using an ANCOVA model (p=0.808) for this subjective endpoint. Similar 
results were shown in the PP population. 
•  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The mean change in CFS score from Baseline to Day 28 was -0.77 and -0.52 for the NOVA22007 and vehicle 
groups, respectively. At Day 84, the mean change from Baseline was -0.92 and -0.70 for the NOVA22007 and 
vehicle groups, respectively. A statistically significant treatment effect in favour of NOVA22007 was shown at 
both Day 28 (p=0.002) and Day 84 (p=0.030), which indicates that the improvement in the objective sign is 
present as early as Month 1 of treatment. 
The change in lissamine green staining (Van Bijsterveld scale) of the interpalpebral conjunctiva from Baseline 
were slightly greater for the NOVA22007 group versus vehicle at Day 28 (-1.52 vs. -1.30), Day 84 (-2.12 vs. 
-1.74) and Day 168 (-2.37 vs. -2.18). A statistically significant treatment effect in favour of NOVA22007 was 
shown for the global effect of treatment, following a repeated measures ANCOVA (p=0.048). 
The percentage of responders in ocular symptoms (defined as a decrease of at least 25% in ocular discomfort 
VAS score) was 40.66% for the NOVA22007 group vs. 39.11% for the vehicle group at Day 28, 48.13% vs. 
45.97% at Day 84, and 50.21% vs. 41.94% at Day 168. The difference in favour of NOVA22007 at Day 168 was 
statistically significant (p=0.048). 
Individually,  ocular  discomfort  symptoms  unrelated  to  study  medication  were  not  statistically  significantly 
different between treatment groups, with the exception of burning/stinging score (p=0.038 in favour of the 
vehicle group). The PP population supported the results of the Full Analysis Set.

Patients with CFS equal to 4 at baseline 
Patients with severe dry eye disease, defined as having a grade 4 at baseline, represented 17% of the overall 
population  at  baseline  (n=85).  Superiority  of  NOVA22007  over  vehicle  was  observed  for  the  change  in  CFS 
compared to Baseline, which was -1.47 (NOVA22007) and -0.69 (vehicle) (p=0.002), as well as with regards to 
the  percentage  of  co-responders  on  both  signs  (improvement  of  at  least  2  grades  in  CFS)  and  symptoms 
(improvement of 30% OSDI score) with 32.56% for IKERVIS versus 7.14% for vehicle (p=0.003). Statistically 
significant  between-group  differences  in  favour  of  NOVA22007  were  furthermore  observed  for  the  following 
clinical parameters: 
•  Change in lissamine green staining (p= 0.003).

responders (i.e. CFS score of “0” on the modified Oxford scale) (p=0.028). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  development programme of  IKERVIS  consisted  of  2  Phase  III  studies,  the  pivotal trial  SANSIKA 
performed in severe DED patients and the supportive study SICCANOVE in moderate to severe DED patients, as 
well as two phase II studies. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of SANSIKA and SICCANOVE was performed, which 
was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  only  in  order  to  provide  supportive  and  exploratory  information  to 
better  estimate  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  in  particular  with  regards  to  the  measurement  of 
anti-inflammatory response (HLA-DR expression) and effect in patients with Sjögren syndrome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 55/82 
  
  
The overall clinical programme was considered by the CHMP adequate to support the application for a marketing 
authorisation for IKERVIS.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the phase III studies were suitable to assure the integrity of the study and 
recruitment of a representative and well-defined population of DED patients, i.e. patients with DED symptoms 
and signs persisting despite the regular use of tear substitutes. The selection of severely affected patients for the 
pivotal SANSIKA study was reasonable, considering the outcome of a post-hoc analysis performed in patients 
with severe DED in the preceding SICCANOVE study, suggesting a greater response in this population.  
Use of vehicle as a comparator is usually recommended for topical formulations and was therefore considered 
acceptable although it is well known that a vehicle has some beneficial effect by its own. 
Signs and symptoms of DED were used as the primary endpoints, as co-variables (in the Phase III SICCANOVE 
supportive study) or in a composite responder variable in the pivotal Phase III SANSIKA study. These endpoints 
had been discussed and agreed with the CHMP as part of a scientific advice prior to this application.  
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups in both 
phase III studies. Both SANSIKA and SICCANOVE enrolled European patients who were generally representative 
of DED patients with respect to demographic and disease characteristics at baseline. As was expected, there 
were more female (≥80%) than male patients enrolled, with a mean age of 60 years or more, which was in line 
with  data  from  large  population-based  epidemiological  studies  (DEWS  report)  for  DED.  Absence  of  data  in 
children  was  acceptable  as  DED  only  very  rarely  occurs  in  the  paediatric  population  and  approval  was  only 
sought in adult patients. 
Prior  and  concomitant  study  medications  in  SICCANOVE  and  SANSIKA  studies  were  as  expected  for  a  DED 
population, balanced between the treatment groups, and similar in both studies; some patients had systemic 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants including systemic ciclosporin (n=5, in SANSIKA study), beta-blockers, 
drugs known to be able to affect DED, but this was allowed by the study protocol since the dose remained stable 
throughout the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
•  Dose selection 
The dose of one drop ciclosporin 1mg/mL (0.1%) QD was chosen on the basis of non-clinical studies, as well as 
an early phase II study and was claimed by the applicant to have been asserted by optimal clinical effects in the 
SICCANOVE study. According to the applicant, the results from the phase IIa study N09F0502 showed a trend 
for improvement for the 0.1% BID group, but not for the 0.05% group. However, in the view of the CHMP, less 
convincing results were obtained from the Phase IIb ORA study, which showed a significant reduction in CFS of 
approximately 0.3 units for the 0.05% QD group relative to vehicle, whereas no reduction in CFS compared to 
vehicle was seen for the 0.01% strength. The applicant suggested that this might be a chance finding due to the 
small sample size and also pointed out that the study population in ORA consisted of mainly mild DED patients.  
Taking into account all available information, the CHMP agreed that the 0.1% dose strength seemed to have 
shown the most consistent improvements. A BID dosing was not expected to provide additional benefit, but may 
lead to compliance issues due to pain and irritation at site instillation.

•  Clinical efficacy  
The pivotal SANSIKA trial failed in its composite primary endpoint of DED sign and symptoms. The CFS-OSDI 
responder rate was 28.6% in the IKERVIS 0.1% QD group and 23.1% in the vehicle group. The small difference 
in favour of IKERVIS (5.5%) was not statistically significant.  
With regards to the secondary endpoints, there was a statistically significant improvement in the CFS score over 
time in favour of IKERVIS. A decrease of corneal staining was observed in both treatment groups at Month 6 
compared  to  Baseline  (-1.76  with  IKERVIS  and  -1.42  with  vehicle).  The  observed  difference  of  0.35 units 
between active and vehicle arm appeared rather modest, but when translating the logarithmic scale into actual 
number of dots of staining, i.e. corneal lesions, the difference represents a ratio of 1.5 in the damaged surface 
area. This means that the vehicle group presented on average with 50% more dots/lesions compared to the 
IKERVIS group, which was considered by the CHMP to be clinically meaningful. The CHMP had previously noted 
that normally an improvement by 1 step in the CFS score would be considered clinical relevant. This was not 
disputed by the applicant at the individual level and therefore responder analyses were performed. There was 
indeed a trend of a benefit of IKERVIS over vehicle in pre-defined responder endpoints associated with corneal 
surface integrity, albeit statistical significance was not reached. The CFS responder rate (improvement of ≥2 
grades) was higher in IKERVIS patients with 51.9% versus 45.1% in the vehicle group and complete corneal 
clearing was achieved within 6 months of treatment  for 6.5% of patients of the IKERVIS group and for 4.4% of 
patients  receiving  vehicle.  Furthermore,  a  number  of  post  hoc  analyses  were  performed  and  results  were 
supportive of a benefit of IKERVIS in improving corneal staining. When using a more stringent criterion for the 
CFS responder rate by increasing the required improvement from at least 2 grades to 3 grades, IKERVIS was 
superior to vehicle at Month 6 (p = 0.001; 35.6% vs. 14.5%).  
A statistically significant difference was furthermore observed in favour of IKERVIS over vehicle in the reduction 
of  HLA-DR  expression  measured  using  impression  cytology.  By  Month  6,  HLA-DR  level  of  expression  (AUF) 
remained elevated in the vehicle group, with a tendency to increase, while it had dropped substantially in the 
IKERVIS  group.  HLA-DR  is  described  in  the  scientific  literature  as  one  of  the  best  evaluation  standards  of 
inflammation in the ocular surface and levels of HLA-DR have been shown to be elevated in patients with DED 
and in particular with Sjögren’s syndrome. Treatment with IKERVIS resulted in a reduction of these elevated 
levels to about 50,000 AUF, which may be considered a high level threshold of normal values. This level was 
maintained during the 6 months extension phase of the study, which supported a sustained anti-inflammatory 
effect of IKERVIS. As inflammation is believed to be central to the cycle of events at the core of the mechanism 
of dry eye disease, being both a consequence as well as a mediator of DED, this finding was considered to be of 
relevance.  
With regards to all other pre-defined endpoints (including OSDI, VAS, Schirmer test, use of concomitant artificial 
tears, investigator’s global evaluation of efficacy, TBUT, lissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear 
osmolarity), the SANSIKA study failed to show superiority of IKERVIS versus vehicle including the pre-defined 
responder endpoints OSDI responder rate, VAS responder rate and CFS-VAS responder rate. Broadly consistent 
results were seen across all efficacy endpoints in that a general improvement was observed in both treatment 
groups over time compared to baseline. The OSDI score had improved by the end of part 1 of the study by -13.6 
with IKERVIS and -14.1 with vehicle. This improvement by itself can be considered clinically relevant, as the 
minimum clinically important difference for OSDI ranges from 4.5 to 7.3 for mild or moderate disease, and from 
7.3 to 13.4 for severe disease (Miller 2010; Guillemin et al, 2012). Similar findings over time were shown for the 
VAS score, Schirmer test, TBUT, lissamine green staining, NEI-VFQ-25, EQ-5D and tear film osmolarity. There 
was also a progressive decrease in the use of artificial tears over time in both treatment groups, but the number 
of missing data was high and no between-group difference was seen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 57/82 
  
  
Amongst  the  post-hoc  analyses,  tear  film  osmolarity  in  patients  with  an  osmolarity  level  >308  mOsms/L  at 
Baseline,  a  threshold  known  to  be  indicative  of  DED,  improved    significantly  more  in  patients  treated  with 
IKERVIS  than  in  the  vehicle  group    (p=0.048).  However,  the  CHMP  noted  the  limited  evidence  that  can  be 
obtained from data derived post-hoc.  
Globally, the results achieved during the first 6 months (part 1 of the SANSIKA study) were either maintained or 
improved further during the last 6 months (part 2).  
With  regards  to  the  supportive  phase  III  study  SICCANOVE  in  moderate  to  severe  DED  patients  preceding 
SANSIKA, the study also failed to demonstrate superiority of IKERVIS over vehicle in the co-primary endpoint. 
A statistically significant treatment effect in favour of IKERVIS was only observed for the co-variable of signs 
(change in CFS) while no difference between treatment groups was seen with regards to improvement in global 
ocular  discomfort  (VAS).  A  post-hoc  analysis  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  severe  dry  eye  disease  (CFS 
grade 4) at Baseline (n=85) showed a more pronounced effect of IKERVIS including superiority of IKERVIS over 
vehicle with regards to the percentage of co-responders on both signs (improvement of at least 2 grades in CFS) 
and symptoms (improvement of 30% OSDI score).  In  fact, based on this result, the applicant designed the 
SANSIKA study with the same patient population (severe DED) and using the co-responder endpoint from the 
post-hoc analysis as composite primary endpoint. It was therefore also not surprising that a meta-analysis of 
both  phase III  studies  was  able  to  show  a  statistically  significant  benefit  of  IKERVIS  over  vehicle  for  the 
CFS-OSDI responder rate. Not only was this outcome driven by the CFS component of the endpoint, but by 
adding the subgroup of severe DED patients from SICCANOVE with a known pronounced effect for IKERVIS to 
the patients in SANSIKA, the results of the meta-analysis were likely to be biased in favour of IKERVIS.  
When  comparing  the  two  studies,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  vehicle  response  was  substantially  greater  in 
SANSIKA compared to SICCANOVE. From the post hoc analysis in severely affected patients in SICCANOVE, an 
effect size of about 7% had been expected in the vehicle group for the CFS-OSDI responder rate. This could not 
be reproduced in SANSIKA where the treatment effect in the vehicle group was much higher with 23%. The 
applicant suggested that this might have been due to various factors, such as the heterogeneity and complexity 
of the disease, the poor correlation between signs and symptoms, the choice of the responder definition, and the 
optimisation  of  the  IKERVIS  formulation.  While  in  SICCANOVE  the  former  BAK  formulation  was  used,  the 
formulation in SANSIKA contained CKC as an excipient. The BAK formulation contained a higher concentration 
of  quaternary  ammonium  compounds  which  might  have  caused  ocular  irritation.  Whether  this  change 
contributed to the difference in the study findings was not clear. Furthermore, it could not be excluded with 
certainty that the ad libitum use of artificial tears in SANSIKA as opposed to the capped use of artificial tears 
allowed in SICCANOVE may have had an impact on the patients’ subjective symptoms even with existing corneal 
erosion, which in turn might have confounded the results towards an increased effect size in patients in the 
vehicle arm in SANSIKA. 
Post hoc subgroup analyses using data from both phase III trials suggested no relevant difference in any of the 
investigated subpopulations, including patients with Sjögren’s syndrome. A general trend in favour of IKERVIS 
could be seen. 
Importantly, the phase III studies did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of IKERVIS compared to vehicle on 
symptoms. This finding was complemented by the lack of a significant effect with regards to use of artificial tears 
and quality of life. However, in order to demonstrate efficacy in DED, generally a significant effect on both signs 
and symptoms or at least a significant effect in signs or symptoms and a strong trend for the other parameter 
would be preferred. The difficulty in establishing such combined effect was acknowledged by the CHMP as it was 
well known that signs and symptoms of DED poorly correlate and that some patients with a low degree of ocular 
surface damage experience severe symptoms, while others with substantial corneal lesions don’t. One reason 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 58/82 
  
  
may be that advanced forms of DED with a high degree of ocular surface damage may cause reduced corneal 
sensation. Another reason could be a delay in the improvement of symptoms. Some support for a lag time effect 
on symptoms was provided by a post-hoc analysis presented by the applicant during an oral explanation. When 
testing the correlation (Spearman) between the change in CFS (signs) and OSDI (symptoms score) over time, 
the correlation increased slightly from month 1 through to month 6, thus suggesting that an improvement in 
signs may indeed with time result in an improvement in symptoms. However, the correlation was overall weak 
and was considered inconclusive. 
Following the suggestion that an effect on symptoms might only evolve over years, the CHMP recommended the 
conduct of a post-authorisation study to further explore long-term effects of IKERVIS treatment on symptoms 
and disease complications. In order to ensure a suitable design, the CHMP furthermore recommended for the 
applicant to seek scientific advice on the study design. 
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified the need for expert input and thus an ad-hoc expert meeting 
was convened including also patient representative on the following questions: 
Question 1.  
In the treatment of severe dry eye disease (DED) (with severe corneal involvement), the experts are asked to 
comment on how a benefit of a medicine is best demonstrated considering effects on signs and symptoms of 
disease. Is an effect on signs of greater relevance than an effect on symptoms, and a sufficient basis upon which 
to approve a medicine alone?  
The expert panel highlighted that DED is a multifactorial disease that, despite different possible triggers and 
aetiologies,  is  based  on  a  common  underlying  vicious  circle  of  factors  including  inflammation,  which  are 
inter-dependent and contribute to disease maintenance and progression. Both an improvement in signs and a 
relief in symptoms are important treatment objectives in DED. However, there is no clear correlation between 
signs and symptoms, in particular in severe forms of DED, where multiple factors including a potential loss in 
ocular surface sensitivity influence the symptomatology and so individual patients may suffer from pronounced 
pain  and  irritation  while  others  experience  less  severe  symptoms.  As  a  result,  it  has  proven  difficult  to 
demonstrate an effect of a medicinal product on both signs and symptoms and no such product is yet available. 
The clinicians also discussed that an improvement in signs could lead to a reduction of symptoms in the longer 
term (possibly several years), once damaged cells and tissues had sufficient time to recover. However, such 
correlation has not been demonstrated to date.   
The  experts  were  of  the  view  that  in  principle,  an  effect  on  signs  only,  if  large  enough,  could  be  of  clinical 
relevance in the context of a benefit-risk assessment, as it would help control the inflammatory process and 
disrupt the vicious disease cycle. Healing of the damaged ocular surface was an important treatment goal to 
prevent  disease  progression.  However,  the  value  of  symptomatic  relief  for  patients  was  not  disputed.  The 
patients confirmed that an improvement of symptoms was what they were looking for. In addition, a reduction 
in the use of artificial tears was considered by the patients of relevance.  
Question 2.  
IKERVIS failed to show efficacy with regard to the primary endpoints in SANSIKA and SICCANOVE studies as 
there was no significant difference relative to vehicle, although there was demonstration of improvement in 
certain secondary endpoints and post-hoc analyses:

Change in Corneal Fluorescein Staining (CFS) score using the Modified Oxford Scale: Over the 6-month 
treatment period in SANSIKA, a global effect of treatment in favour of IKERVIS over vehicle was observed 
(p=0.017). At the end of Part 1 of the study (Month 6 Visit), the adjusted mean change in CFS score from 
baseline was -1.76  with IKERVIS  and -1.42 with vehicle (p=0.037), resulting in a between-treatment 
difference of 0.35. 
The  decrease  in  HLA-DR  level  of  expression  (AUF)  from  baseline  was  greater with  IKERVIS  than  with

development?  
If so, what is the clinical relevance of the demonstrated effect?  
Does a positive treatment effect in these two endpoints outweigh the absence of a treatment effect in the 
other endpoints studied (Ocular Surface Disease Index symptom score, ocular discomfort score, Schirmer 
test, use of concomitant artificial tears, investigator’s global evaluation of efficacy, tear break-up time, 
lissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear osmolarity)?  
Question 2a. 
With regards to the clinical relevance of the observed change in CFS, the experts considered the interpretation 
by the company, including the translation of the logarithmic CFS scale into number of stained dots on the ocular 
surface, which showed that a difference in CFS of 0.35 between IKERVIS and vehicle corresponds to an average 
of 50% more dots with vehicle compared to IKERVIS. During the discussion, some experts expressed their view 
that  such  interpretation  including  the  excess  rate  and  number  needed  to  treat  calculated  for  the  responder 
analysis  was  sound  and  sufficiently  convincing  that  the  observed  difference  represents  a  clinically  relevant 
benefit. The extend of ocular surface damage was considered related to functional outcomes (scattering of light) 
as well as predictive of disease progressions and complications. However, there was an opposing view expressed 
in that the difference was too small to be clinically meaningful in the overall clinical picture.  
As for HLA-DR, it was agreed that it was widely used as an inflammation marker in epithelial cells and in some 
clinics HLA-DR expression is used to control the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drug treatment. However, it was 
not surprising that ciclosporin would reduce HLA-DR expression, as HLA-DR has previously been shown to form 
part of its immunomodulatory pathway. The applicant used this marker in line with a previous scientific advice 
obtained  from  the  CHMP  to  confirm  that  an  immunological  effects  on  the  ocular  surface  is  achieved  with 
IKERVIS. Other inflammatory markers/signs were not investigated and one expert expressed the view that the 
effect on HLA-DR alone, i.e. in the absence of a demonstrated effect for other inflammation markers/signs, was 
not  sufficient  to  conclude  on  a  meaningful  anti-inflammatory  effect  of  IKERVIS.  The  other  experts  however 
considered the observed effect on HLA-DR to be of relevance and sufficient to assume an effect of IKERVIS on 
inflammation. 
Question 2b. and c. 
There was agreement amongst the experts, that effective treatment of severe keratitis and repair of epithelial 
damage,  as  can  be  measured  by  corneal  staining,  can  prevent  serious  complications  in  DED  including 
pronounced and permanent damage of the ocular surface and function. However, the treatment effect would

have to be sufficiently large to prevent worsening of the disease. In line with question 2a, the experts expressed 
different views on the relevance of the observed effects of IKERVIS. 
Question 2d. 
The lack of a treatment effect in all but two pre-defined study endpoints (CFS and HLA-DR) was a concern for 
one  expert  who  was  of  the  view  that  the  observed  limited  effects  of  IKERVIS  in  CFS  and  HLA-DR  were  not 
sufficient  to  outweigh  the  failure  in  all  other  tested  variables  in  particular  with  regards  to  the  absence  of  a 
significant effect on symptoms, use of artificial tears and Quality of Life. However, it was proposed that ocular 
surface damage and inflammation (as measured by CFS and HLA-DR expression, respectively) may be factors at 
the beginning of a chain of relationships between all these variables, whereby effective treatment may result in 
immediate improvement of these two factors, but only in a delayed response within years for all others. Such 
mechanism could explain the study result and experts who had previously considered the observed effects to be 
of clinical relevance, maintained their view.  
Question 3.  
The experts are invited to discuss available treatment options for severe keratitis in patients with DED. In the 
experts’ view, is there an unmet medical need in the treatment of severe DED that could be addressed with 
IKERVIS? 
The  experts  pointed  out  that  treatment  would  depend  on  the  aetiology  of  DED  and  ideally  consists  of  an 
adequate  control  of  the  underlying  disease.  Apart  from  this,  available  treatments  for  DED  include  artificial 
tears/lubricants, which are effective in treating symptoms. Other therapeutic options commonly used in more 
severe forms of the disease include anti-inflammatory agents, i.e. corticosteroids for short-term use and topical 
ciclosporin (compounded or imported). Autologous serum was also considered beneficial.  
None of the medicines used in clinical practice has a demonstrated effect on clinical signs of DED and many 
patients continue to express significant signs and suffer from impaired function as well as pain and irritation, 
requiring frequent use of artificial tears. Thus, there was consensus amongst the experts that there was an 
unmet medical need. This view was shared by the patients.  
Some experts considered that IKERVIS could help address this unmet medical need as it had shown a clinical 
relevant effect on signs and represented a valuable treatment option with limited side effects. However, one 
expert disagreed with this view and considered that a clinically relevant treatment effect has not been shown, in 
particular in absence of a demonstrated effect on symptoms and Quality of Life. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with IKERVIS resulted in an improvement compared to vehicle in the signs of DED as indicated by a 
reduction in the degree of corneal staining reflecting an improvement in corneal surface damage. The difference 
between treatments was moderate, but, taking into account the experts’ view, the difference was considered by 
the CHMP clinically meaningful. Furthermore, IKERVIS reduced ocular inflammation, which was considered of 
relevance as it may help disrupt the vicious disease cycle of DED. The lack of effect on symptoms explained 
largely why both phase III studies failed in their combined primary (co-primary or composite) endpoints.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the available clinical data demonstrated an effect of IKERVIS on the signs of 
DED, which by itself was clinically relevant as it helps control the inflammatory process and prevents disease 
progression. Thus, the available clinical evidence on efficacy was considered sufficient to support the application 
for IKERVIS in the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with DED.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety has been evaluated in four studies, two phase II studies including patients with moderate to severe DED 
or mild to moderate DED, respectively, and 2 phase III studies (SANSIKA and SICCANOVE), including patients 
with moderate to severe DED or severe DED, respectively.  
Safety data were pooled based on the safety populations of each of the individual studies. These included all 
randomised patients who received at least one dose (1 drop once daily) of IKERVIS 0.1%. Two different analysis 
cohorts were used: 
• 
• 
The Double Masked Cohort (n= 396) including all patients from the 6-month double masked phases of 
the SICCANOVE and SANSIKA studies allowing a comparison of the extent of safety issues for IKERVIS 
versus vehicle. 
The All Studies Cohort (n= 520) combining data from the 2 phase III studies (396 patients) including (i) 
the 6 month open label safety follow up, where all patients from the vehicle group (79 patients) received 
IKERVIS 0.1% and (ii) the Phase IIb (ORA) study, taking into account only patients (45 patients) 
exposed to IKERVIS 0.1%, 1 drop once daily. The Phase IIa study was not included in this cohort due to 
the use of a different dose regimen (BID instead of QD). 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 602 patients were exposed to IKERVIS at any dose for up to 12 months in clinical trials (see Table 8). 
Twelve (12) subjects have been exposed to IKERVIS 0.025% for a maximum of 3 months, and 58 to IKERVIS 
0.05% for a maximum of 3 months. In the phase II trials 57 persons were exposed to IKERVIS 0.1% for up to 
three months. In two phase III trials 396 patients were exposed to IKERVIS 0.1% for at least 6 months and 114 
for at least 12 months. 
The mean exposure to IKERVIS 0.1% and vehicle during the double masked period was 153.9 days ± 49.9 and 
158.5 ± 44.8 days, respectively. The mean exposure to IKERVIS 0.1% in the all studies cohort was 191.5 ± 
106.3 days.

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure. 
** Subjects in the phase II studies had a maximum exposure of 3 months. 
Patients receiving IKERVIS 0.1% QD were predominantly female (439; 84.4%), and most of them (71.3%) were 
postmenopausal. The mean age was 59.3 years (±13.3) with about 64.8 % of patients aged less than 65 years 
and  about  12%  being  older  than  75  years.  Regarding  the  severity  of  the  disease,  53.5%  of  patients  (278) 
presented with severe DED, defined by a CFS staining grade of 4 and 5. One third of the patients (34.6%) had 
Sjögren syndrome. The majority of patients were Caucasians. Only 4 Black/Afro-American patients and no Asian 
patients received IKERVIS. 
Adverse events 
In the Double Masked Cohort, (combined phase III studies over a 6 month period), 382 (51.9%) patients had a 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). Of these, 221 patients received IKERVIS 0.1% (55.8%) and 161 
(47.4%) vehicle (see Table 9 for an overview of TEAEs in the Double Masked Cohort). Patients may have had 
more than one TEAE. The percentage of patients with a drug related TEAE was 35.9% for IKERVIS 0.1% and 
20.3% for the vehicle group. A higher rate of patients with a severe drug related TEAE (21.7%) was reported for 
the IKERVIS group compared to the vehicle group (10.6%). 
In the All Studies Cohort, a total of 308 (59.2%) patients had a TEAE and 204 (39.2%) had a TEAE that was 
considered related to study medication. This incidence was comparable as the one observed on the 6-month 
Double-Masked Cohort.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  experienced  by  patients  occurred  mainly  in  the  system  organ  classes  (SOC)  ‘eye 
disorders’ and ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’. The proportion of TEAEs was higher in the 
IKERVIS group compared to vehicle.

•  Ocular TEAEs 
Overall (All Study Cohort), a total of 243 patients (46.7%) experienced ocular TEAEs. Of these, 38.7% (201 
patients) were considered by the investigator as drug related ocular TEAEs and 17.7% (92 patients) experienced 
severe drug related ocular TEAEs.  
When comparing the frequency between treatment groups (Double Masked Cohort), ocular TEAEs were reported 
in a higher proportion of patients treated with IKERVIS (42.7%) than with vehicle (27.6%). Ocular TEAEs were 
considered by the investigator to be treatment related in a higher proportion of patients (35.1%) treated with 
IKERVIS 0.1% than with vehicle (17.6%). Ocular drug related TEAEs, as judged by the investigator, were more 
severe in IKERVIS group (21.7%) than the vehicle group (10%). Two patients (one receiving IKERVIS and the 
other vehicle) reported serious ocular AEs that were considered as drug related. Forty-two (10.6%) patients 
discontinued  to  an  ocular  TEAE  versus  7.1%  of  patients  in  the  vehicle  group.  Of  these,  9.3%  (37  patients) 
discontinued to drug related ocular TEAE versus 5.9% (20 patients) in the vehicle group. The most common AEs 
reported in the vehicle group were eye pain (13 patients, 3.8%), meibomianitis (12 patients, 3.5%) and visual 
acuity reduced (12 patients, 3.5%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  ocular  TEAEs  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  having  at  least  a  possible 
relationship to IKERVIS (All Study Cohort) were instillation site pain (16%), instillation site irritation (9%), eye 
irritation (8.8%), eye pain (3.5%), instillation site lacrimation (2.9%), lacrimation increased (2.1%), instillation 
site erythema (1.9%), ocular hyperaemia (1.9%), conjunctival hyperaemia (1.7%), erythema of eyelid (1.7%), 
eyelid oedema (1.3%), and vision blurred (1.2%). Uncommon ocular TEAEs for which a relationship to IKERVIS 
could  not  be  excluded  were  keratitis  bacterial,  herpes  zoster  ophthalmic,  conjunctival  oedema,  lacrimal 
disorder,  eye  discharge,  eye  pruritus,  conjunctival  irritation,  conjunctivitis,  foreign  body  sensation  in  eyes, 
deposit eye, keratitis, blepharitis, corneal decompensation, chalazion, corneal infiltrates, corneal scar, eyelid 
pruritus, and iridocyclitis as well as instillation site reaction, instillation site discomfort, instillation site pruritus 
and instillation site foreign body sensation. 
•  Systemic TEAEs 
Systemic TEAEs were reported in 146 patients (28.1%) in the All Study Cohort. Systemic TEAEs were reported 
in similar proportions in the IKERVIS 0.1% and vehicle treatment groups (24.5% versus 28.2%, Double-Masked 
Cohort). A total of 3.5% of these events were considered by the investigator drug related systemic TEAEs in the 
IKERVIS group and 4.4% in the vehicle group. Most of the systemic TEAEs were mild to moderate. No serious 
drug  related  systemic  TEAE  was  reported.  The  most  frequently  systemic  drug  related  AEs  reported  were 
headache.  
•  Comparative safety of BAK and CKC formulations 
During the development programme for IKERVIS, the formulation of the drug product was changed in terms of 
excipient  from  benzalkonium  chloride  (BAK,  0.02%  w/w)  to  cetalkonium  chloride  (CKC,  0.005%  w/w).  BAK 
containing product was used in the SICCANOVE study and the phase IIa study. The CKC containing product was 
used in SANSIKA and the phase IIb study.  
In  general  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  were  similar  in  the  SICCANOVE  and  SANSIKA  studies  apart  from  a  lower 
incidence of severe ocular TEAEs in those exposed to CKC (SANSIKA) compared to BAK (SICCANOVE). Rates of 
discontinuation due to ocular TEAEs were similar between the studies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported in any of the studies.  
In the phase III studies (Double-Masked Cohort), 31 (4%) patients had a SAE during the initial 6 months period 
including 15 (3.8%) in the IKERVIS group and 16 (4.7%) in the vehicle group. Two patients (0.3%) had an SAE 
considered to be drug related, of which one was considered related to IKERVIS (epithelial erosion of the cornea). 
The other one was related to the vehicle (reduced visual acuity). The IKERVIS related AE was a case of severe 
epithelial  erosion  of  the  cornea  identified  as  epithelial  decompensation  of  the  cornea  by  the  investigator 
[MedDRA Preferred Term (PT): corneal decompensation] resolved without sequeleae. In the All Studies Cohort 
A  total  of  25 patients  (4.8%)  had  a  SAE  (Table  23).  Only  one  (0.2%)  was  assessed  as  related  to  IKERVIS 
(described above). 
Laboratory findings 
There  was  no  laboratory  findings  reported  other  than  those  related  to  ciclosporin  blood  levels  (see  section 
2.4.2. ). In the phase IIa study, in addition to ciclosporin blood levels, creatinine and transaminases blood levels 
were monitored, but did not reveal any clinically significant findings.  
Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured in both SANSIKA and SICCANOVE at different time-points: 
•  At Baseline, Month 3 and Month 6 in the SICCANOVE study, 
•  At Baseline, Month 6, Month 12 in the SANSIKA study 
IOP had also to be measured at any unscheduled visit and at the Exit visit in case of a premature discontinuation. 
In  both  studies,  mean  IOP  of  both  eyes  remained  stable  over  time,  and  within  the  normal  range,  in  both 
treatment groups. Only a few patients (6/741) had an IOP above the upper limit of physiological fluctuations in 
some occasions, i.e. 6 mmHg. But none of these patients experienced a sustained increase of IOP. 
Safety in special populations 
The  applicant  stated  that  for  both  IKERVIS  and  vehicle  treatment  groups,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the 
frequency of AE reports increased with age, sex or race. The majority of the subjects in the safety populations 
were aged over 65 and female. Pregnant and breast-feeding females were excluded from the study. There were 
no known pregnancies in the clinical studies.  
IKERVIS is only intended for use in adult patients with DED and the PDCO granted a waiver for investigations in 
all subsets of the paediatric population. The frequency and severity of TEAEs in the elderly by age groups is 
summarised in Table 11.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific studies of potential drug interactions were performed. According to the applicant, there were no data 
available in the scientific literature providing evidence for an interaction between ciclosporin containing ocular 
medicinal products and other medicines.  
See also section 2.3.6. for a discussion on the potential PK/PD interactions between ciclosporin and other topical 
medicines. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, 83 (11.2%) patients discontinued from the two phase III studies combined in the first 6 months of 
treatment (Double-Masked Cohort) due to an AE and 60 (8%) of these patients discontinued from the study due 
to a drug related TEAE. The percentage discontinuing was slightly higher for IKERVIS 0.1% than vehicle with 
12.1% (48 patients) versus 10.3% (35 patients) respectively. Thirty-seven patients (9.3%) from the IKERVIS 
group discontinued due to a drug related AE versus 23 patients (6.8%) in the vehicle group.  Most TEAEs giving 
rise to discontinuation were ocular AEs (instillation site pain, eye irritation, conjunctival hyperaemia).  
In the All Studies Cohort (up to 12 months), 53 patients (10.2%) discontinued due to a drug related TEAEs, 
which were mostly ocular AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
There were no post-marketing data for IKERVIS at the time of this application.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall,  602  persons  have  been  exposed  to  IKERVIS  of  varying  strengths,  and  532  have  been  exposed  to 
IKERVIS 0.1%.  A  total  of  114  persons  have  been  exposed  to  IKERVIS  0.1%  for  one  year.  The  population 
covered by the phase II and III studies appeared to be representative of patients suffering from chronic dry eye 
conditions including a spread from mild to severe conditions and older age-groups. Only few patients aged 75 
and older were exposed to IKERVIS including only 3 patients older than 85 years of age. Due to the limited data, 
no firm conclusions on the safety of IKERVIS in this older age range could be drawn. However, from the available 
data, there was no strong evidence for an increased risk of adverse reactions in older patients. The majority of 
study  participants  were  of  Caucasian  origin  and  while  the  lack  of  data  in  other  ethnicities  was  unfortunate, 
overall, the CHMP considered that this was not a major concern. Due to the local route of administration, the 
CHMP considered it unlikely that patients with hepatic or renal impairment required special considerations. As 
use in pregnant and breast-feeding women was not studied, use during pregnancy and in lactating women is 
only recommended if the benefits outweigh the risks and women of childbearing potential are recommended to 
use contraception. Use in pregnant or lactating women was furthermore considered missing information in the 
RMP and thus will be monitored post-approval. Overall, the extent of drug exposure and characteristics of the 
safety  population  were  considered  acceptable  and  sufficient  to  support  the  application  for  IKERVIS  in  the 
treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with DED. 
The majority of TEAEs in both the treatment and vehicle groups were ocular in nature with ocular TEAEs being 
more common in the IKERVIS 0.1% group compared to vehicle. Ocular TEAEs were also more severe in the 
IKERVIS 0.1% group compared to vehicle. Notwithstanding these higher TEAE rates in the IKERVIS 0.1% group, 
discontinuation rates as a result of ocular TEAEs was only slightly commoner in patients receiving IKERVIS 0.1% 
compared to vehicle (Double Masked Cohort). 
Reporting  rates  of  SAE  were  similar  in  the  IKERVIS  0.1%  and  the  vehicle  groups,  the  vast  majority  being 
systemic in nature. One ocular SAE was identified in the IKERVIS 0.1% group (severe epithelial erosion of the 
cornea identified as epithelial decompensation of the cornea) and one in the vehicle group (severe decrease in 
visual acuity). While the patho-physiological mechanism that could have led to epithelial erosion of the cornea 
was not clear, due to the seriousness of the event, it was included in the list of adverse reactions in SmPC section 
4.8 and an important potential risk was included in the RMP for post-marketing monitoring. 
The most frequent TEAEs were related to the instillation of the eye drops, i.e. instillation site pain and instillation 
site irritation. Ciclosporin can cause ocular discomfort, which usually resolves after a short period of time. The 
most common adverse reactions reported as single MedDRA PT terms were instillation site pain (16%), eye 
irritation (9%), instillation site irritation (9%) and eye pain (4%). For the presentation in the SmPC, the CHMP 
considered  that  several  related  terms  should  be  combined,  e.g.  eye  irritation  and  instillation  site  irritation, 
resulting  in  the  most  common  adverse  reactions  being  eye  pain  (19%),  eye  irritation  (17.8%),  lacrimation 
(6.2%), ocular hyperaemia (5.5%) and eyelid erythema (1.7%).  
Temporary blurred vision may occur due to the oil-in-water formulation, which may have a moderate influence 
on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines.  This  information  was  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  use  of 
IKERVIS was recommended at bedtime to reduce the impact of the blurred vision.  
Sustained  decrease  of  visual  acuity  was  only  reported  for  few  patients  and  to  a  comparable  degree  in  the 
IKERVIS and the vehicle arm suggesting that ciclosporin does not increase the risk for vision loss. There was no 
evidence of a sustained rise in IOP above normal physiological limits in neither the IKERVIS nor the vehicle 
group.

There were few cases of opportunistic ocular infections, which were all reported in the two phase III studies, 
including one case each of bacterial keratitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster in patients receiving IKERVIS, and 
one case of hordeolum in the vehicle arm. All cases were moderate in severity and deemed to be possibly related 
to  treatment.  With  the  exception  of  the  hordeolum  case,  all  cases  had  resolved  by  study  end.  Given  the 
immunosuppressive effect of ciclosporin, a causal relationship between the use of IKERVIS and the cases of 
bacterial keratitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster could not be excluded. Both events were added into the list of 
adverse  reactions  in  SmPC  section  4.8.  Section  4.8  furthermore  highlights  the  risk  of  infection  in  patients 
receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as ciclosporin and use of IKERVIS is contraindicated in patients 
with  active  or  suspected  ocular  infection  (SmPC  section  4.3).  As  an  additional  effort  to  mitigate  the  risk  of 
opportunistic infection, development and exacerbation of ocular and peri-ocular infections was included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. The CHMP considered that these measures were adequate. 
Ciclosporin is known to have a carcinogenic potential and the CHMP discussed the risk of ocular malignancies, in 
particular with a view to DED patients who might have an impaired corneal barrier, which may lead to higher 
intraocular levels of ciclosporin compared to healthy eyes. The applicant quoted the result of a study (Böhringer 
et al., 2008), showing that treatment with ciclosporin 1% or 2% over a mean duration of two years did not 
reveal  any  evidence  of  ocular  malignancies.  However,  the  number  of  eyes  included  in  the  study  (76)  was 
relatively small and not sufficient to exclude a risk of malignancy with certainty. In addition, in clinical practice, 
it  is  likely  that  some  patients  may  be  using  ciclosporin  eye  drops  for  more  than  2  years.  Due  to  these 
uncertainties,  peri-ocular  skin  cancer  and  conjunctival  or  corneal  neoplasia  was  included  in  the  RMP  as  an 
important potential risk. This was agreed by the CHMP although the risk was considered to be low at the doses 
used.  
The CHMP also considered the risk of drug-drug interactions taking into account that ciclosporin interacts with 
efflux  transporters  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  some  CYP  and  UGT  enzymes  (see  non-clinical  section  for 
details). As there were no reports for ocular interactions, including in the scientific literature, the CHMP agreed 
that  the  risk  for  drug-drug  interactions  with  IKERVIS  was  likely  to  be  low  (see  section  2.3.6.  for  a  detailed 
discussion). However, in clinical practice concomitant use of corticosteroids may occur.  The  CHMP therefore 
agreed to include a warning in the SmPC that co-administration of steroids could lead to an increased immune 
response. 
During the development of the drug product, the formulation of IKERVIS was changed replacing the surfactant 
BAK  (0.02%  w/w)  with  CKC  (0.005%  w/w)  to  reduce  quaternary  ammonium  toxicity  causing  ocular  cell 
damage. However, when comparing discontinuation rates in the two phase III studies, one of which was using 
the  BAK  formulation  (SICCANOVE)  and  the  other  the  CKC  formulation  (SANSIKA),  the  rates  were  similar, 
suggesting that the tolerability of the two formulations was comparable. 
Systemic TEAEs were less common than ocular TEAEs and the frequency was similar in both treatment groups. 
Few systemic TEAEs were judged to be related to treatment by the investigator. Notwithstanding the fact that 
data was missing for approximately 25% of subjects at the end of part 1 of the SANSIKA trial and about 30% at 
the  end  of  part  2  of  the  trial,  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  significant  systemic  absorption  of  ocular 
ciclosporin (see also section 2.4. for ciclosporin blood levels). Therefore, the CHMP considered it unlikely that 
any of the observed systemic adverse events was causally related to IKERVIS.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the available safety data were sufficient to support the application for 
IKERVIS in the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with DED. The CHMP concluded that the safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 70/82 
  
  
profile of IKERVIS was acceptable with the majority of adverse reactions being eye disorders and related to the 
instillation of the eye drops, while the risk of systemic exposure and adverse reactions was considered low. The 
safety  profile  was  furthermore  considered  adequately  reflected  in  the  product  information  and  all  safety 
concerns were addressed in the RMP (see section 2.8).  
The CHMP was furthermore of the view that the safety profile of IKERVIS was different from other ciclosporin 
products approved in the EU for systemic use, thus justifying a separate review of periodic safety update reports 
(PSURs) after approval. Therefore, the CHMP recommended to update the list of Union reference dates (EURD 
list) to include two separate entries. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling has been submitted by the applicant and has been found 
acceptable by the QRD Group. 
The applicant has requested to omit the pharmaceutical form, the route of administration and the contents from 
the immediate labelling (single-dose container). The Group agreed that all mandatory information is not written 
on the primary packaging, due to its very small size, and also due to the fact that these primary packaging 
should be kept out of light and in a secondary packaging (which has the correct labelling)  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-shaded 
to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the INN on the immediate labelling (single-dose container) has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. 
As per the ‘Compilation of QRD decisions on stylistic matters in product information’ document, the QRD Group 
has accepted the request to use English INN on the immediate labelling because of space constraints issues.  
The national language version of the INN must be used throughout the SmPC and package leaflet together with 
the English name in brackets after the description of the actual substance in section 2 of the SmPC and at the 
beginning (top introductory part) of the package leaflet.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be translated 
in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials will only be 
translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  efficacy  of  IKERVIS  was  mainly  supported  by  two  phase  III  trials  including  the  pivotal  SANSIKA  study 
investigating the use of IKERVIS, 1 drop at bedtime, in 246 patients with severe DED over 6 months (vehicle 
controlled  part  1)  and  12  months  (open  label  part  2).  The  patient  population  investigated  was  considered 
representative  of  the  target  population  of  adult  DED  patients  with  severe  keratitis.  Supportive  data  were 
available from a second phase III study SANSIKA in patients with moderate to severe DED. 
Over the 6-month treatment period in SANSIKA, a global treatment effect in favour of IKERVIS over vehicle was 
observed regarding the change in the corneal fluorescence staining (CFS) score (0.35 units, p=0.017), which 
was considered to be an important secondary endpoint. Statistical significance was reached as early as Month 3 
(p=0.024) and at the end of part 1 of the study (Month 6), the adjusted mean change in CFS score from Baseline 
was -1.76 with IKERVIS and -1.42 with vehicle (p=0.037). The difference between the two groups translated 
into 50% more stained dots, i.e. corneal lesions, in patients treated with vehicle compared to IKERVIS. Based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 73/82 
  
  
the  consultation  of  experts,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this  difference  was  clinically  relevant,  reflecting  an 
improvement in corneal surface damage with IKERVIS that may help prevent disease progression. A beneficial 
effect of IKERVIS on keratitis was further supported by a non-significant trend in the pre-defined CFS responder 
analyses (improvement of at least 2 grades and complete corneal clearing by Month 6) in favour of IKERVIS. 
Post-hoc analysis showed superiority of IKERVIS compared to vehicle when using a more stringent criterion for 
the CFS responder rate of ≥3 grades (35.6% versus 14.5%, p = 0.001). 
Furthermore, a beneficial effect on inflammation was shown for IKERVIS as indicated by the level of expression 
of HLA-DR, an immune-related marker elevated in conjunctival cells of DED patients. While HLA-DR expression 
remained elevated under vehicle, it dropped substantially with IKERVIS treatment over the course of the study. 
The difference between  IKERVIS and  vehicle was statistically significant at Month 1 (p=0.019) and  Month 6 
(p=0.021). While this outcome was not surprising, since HLA-DR is part of the immunomodulatory pathway of 
ciclosporin, it showed that indeed an anti-inflammatory effect on the ocular surface could be assumed to have 
been achieved. Considering that inflammation has a key role in sustaining and worsening of DED, this finding 
was considered of relevance, although it was an exploratory endpoint, which limits the interpretability of the 
finding.  
Limited evidence for an improvement in tear film osmolarity was also available from a post-hoc analysis showing 
that in patients with an elevated osmolarity level >308 mOsms/L at Baseline, tear film osmolarity improved by 
Month 6 significantly more in patients treated with IKERVIS than in the vehicle group (mean change of -26.7 
mOsms/L with IKERVIS compared to -16.7 mOsms/L with vehicle, p=0.048).  
No relevant difference was found in any of the investigated subpopulations, including patients with Sjögren’s 
syndrome.  Globally,  the  treatment  effects  during  the  first  6  months  of  the  study  were  either  maintained  or 
improved further during the last 6 months (12 months in total).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The pivotal study SANSIKA failed with regard to the primary endpoint, a composite responder endpoint for both 
signs  and  symptoms  of  DED  (CFS-OSDI  composite  responders  with  a  change  in  CFS  ≤-2  and  a  change  of 
OSDI ≤-30%),  mainly  because  of  the  lack  of  effect  of  IKERVIS  compared  to  vehicle  on  symptoms  (OSDI). 
IKERVIS furthermore failed to show superiority over vehicle in the majority of the other pre-defined endpoints, 
including  OSDI,  VAS,  Schirmer  test,  use  of  concomitant  artificial  tears,  investigator’s  global  evaluation  of 
efficacy, TBUT, lissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear osmolarity. Broadly consistent results 
were seen across all efficacy endpoints in that a general improvement was observed in both treatment groups 
over time compared to Baseline, but the lack of a significant between-treatment effect in most of the endpoints 
created uncertainty as to the relevance of the treatment effect in two cases only, i.e. the change in CFS and 
HLA-DR expression. Experts who were consulted on this matter, suggested that ocular surface damage  and 
inflammation (as measured by CFS and HLA-DR expression, respectively) may be factors at the beginning of a 
chain of relationships between all the different variables, whereby effective treatment may result in immediate 
improvement of these two factors, but only in a delayed response within years for all others. Such mechanism, 
though hypothetical, could explain the study results. 
Symptoms of patients improved over the time course of the study to a similar degree in both active and vehicle 
groups. However, there was no significant difference between IKERVIS and vehicle neither in any symptoms 
score, nor with regards to use of concomitant artificial tears and quality of life. Compared to SICCANOVE, the 
supportive phase III study preceding SANSIKA, a considerably larger effect size was observed in SANSIKA for 
patients in the vehicle group (23% in SANSIKA compared to 7% in SICCANOVE). No definite reason for this 
difference between the two studies was found, although several possible explanations were discussed including 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 74/82 
  
  
the heterogeneity and complexity of the disease, the change in the IKERVIS formulation and the ad libitum use 
of artificial tears in SANSIKA compared to the capped use allowed in SICCANOVE. 
The question of the impact of the lack of effect on symptoms was referred by the CHMP to an ad-hoc expert 
group. The experts considered both an improvement in signs and a relief in symptoms to be important treatment 
objectives in DED. However, multiple factors including a potential loss in ocular surface sensitivity may influence 
the symptomatology in DED patients and there is no clear correlation between signs and symptoms. As a result, 
it has proven difficult to demonstrate an effect of a medicinal product on both signs and symptoms of DED. An 
improvement in signs could lead to a reduction of symptoms in the longer term, possibly after several years, but 
there is no evidence for such a long-term effect. Overall, the experts believed that an effect on signs alone, 
provided it is large enough, could be of clinical relevance, as it would help prevent disease progression resulting 
in potentially severe and sight-threatening complications.  
Benefits of IKERVIS were also suggested in a number of post hoc analyses as well as a meta-analysis of results 
from  SANSIKA  and  SICCANOVE.  However,  as  the  severe  population  investigated  in  SANSIKA  was  selected 
further to a post hoc subgroup analysis of the overall negative SICCANOVE study, the meta-analysis of the two 
studies would be biased in favour of IKERVIS and the CHMP considered that the best evidence of efficacy was 
provided by the SANSIKA data alone.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Overall 602 persons have been exposed to IKERVIS including 114 patients receiving IKERVIS 0.1% for one year. 
The extent of the exposure and the demographics of the safety population were considered by the CHMP to be 
suitable to enable the safety evaluation of the application for IKERVIS in the treatment of severe keratitis in 
adult patients with DED. 
The majority of adverse reactions reported were ocular in nature with the most frequently reported adverse 
reactions  being  eye  pain  (19%),  eye  irritation  (17.8%),  lacrimation  (6.2%),  ocular  hyperaemia  (5.5%)  and 
eyelid erythema (1.7%). This was not unexpected for an ocular product and considering that ciclosporin was 
known to cause transient ocular discomfort at instillation.  
Two cases of opportunistic ocular infections were reported (bacterial keratitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster) in 
patients receiving IKERVIS and, given the immunosuppressive effect of ciclosporin, the CHMP considered that a 
possible  causal  relationship  could  not  be  excluded.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  use  of  IKERVIS  in 
patients  with  active  or  suspected ocular  infection  should  be  contraindicated and  that  the  risk  of  infection  in 
patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as ciclosporin should be reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
No  significant  absorption  of  ciclosporin  into  the  blood  stream  was  observed  and  the  frequency  of  systemic 
adverse events was similar in both the active treatment and the vehicle groups. Therefore, the CHMP considered 
the risk of systemic side effects to be low. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety population was generally considered representative for the proposed target population of IKERVIS. 
There was some uncertainty regarding the long-term safety of IKERVIS 0.1%, which could be used for several 
years whereas clinical safety data were only available for one year. However, overall, the CHMP considered the 
extend of exposure sufficient to support the application.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 75/82 
  
  
It was furthermore unclear whether patients aged 75 years and older and in particular those aged 85 and more 
were at greater risk of adverse reactions compared to other age groups, as there were too few data available in 
order to draw firm conclusions. However, at the same time there was no strong evidence for an increased risk 
in this age range. Finally, the lack of data in pregnant and lactating women was included in the RMP as missing 
information and will be monitored post-marketing.  
There  was  one  case  of  a  patient  experiencing  epithelial  decompensation  of  the  cornea  reported  as  corneal 
decompensation while using IKERVIS 0.1%. It is unclear what the underlying mechanism for this reaction could 
be or whether certain patients with chronic dry eye are particularly at risk of this adverse reaction. Thus, in light 
of the seriousness of the event, the reaction was reflected in SmPC section 4.8 and an important potential risk 
was included in the RMP for post-marketing monitoring. 
No cases of malignancies were reported and the risk for neoplasia was overall considered by the CHMP to be low. 
However, due to the known carcinogenic potential of ciclosporin and since in clinical practice some patients are 
likely to use IKERVIS over several years, peri-ocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia was included 
as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
While  there  were  no  reports  of  ocular  interactions  between  ophthalmic  ciclosporin  and  other  topically  used 
medicines, the CHMP considered that such interactions could not be excluded given that ciclosporin is known to 
interact with efflux transporters and inhibit certain CYP and UGT enzymes. The CHMP welcomed the applicant’s 
proposal for the conduct of an additional non-clinical study to explore drug-drug interactions at receptor and at 
the  cellular  level  and  recommended  that  the  study  be  conducted  post-approval.  Given  the  totality  of  the 
available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  risk  for  interaction  was  low.  Still,  concomitant  use  of 
corticosteroids may occur in clinical practice and the CHMP considered that a warning should be included in the 
SmPC that co-administration of steroids could lead to an increased immune response. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
DED is a multifactorial disease that, despite different possible triggers and aetiologies, is based on a common 
underlying vicious circle of factors, including inflammation, which are inter-dependent and contribute to disease 
maintenance  and  progression.  DED  patients  with  severe  keratitis  are  at  risk  of  further  complications  and 
conventional management including artificial tear drops, gels or ointments and punctual occlusion are often not 
sufficient to improve the condition. Therefore, these patients represent a suitable target population most likely 
to benefit from ciclosporin treatment.  
The available clinical evidence supported a benefit of IKERVIS on DED signs as shown by an improvement in 
ocular  surface  damage  (reduced  CFS).  Furthermore,  there  was  some  evidence  for  a  prolonged 
anti-inflammatory  effect  of IKERVIS  (reduced  HLA-DR  expression),  which  is  of  relevance  as  inflammation  is 
known to be key in sustaining and worsening of DED. Together, the improvements in keratitis and inflammation 
by IKERVIS were considered by the CHMP to be clinically meaningful even in absence of an effect on symptoms, 
as they help prevent disease progression and worsening.  
Experts consulted during the course of the procedure considered that there was an unmet medical need for DED 
patients, as none of the medicines used in clinical practice to treat DED has a demonstrated effect on clinical 
signs and thus, many patients continue to express significant signs and suffer from impaired visual function as 
well as pain and irritation, requiring frequent use of artificial tears. As IKERVIS had shown a clinical relevant 
effect on signs, it could help address this unmet medical need.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 76/82 
  
  
With regards to safety, there was only one serious ocular adverse reaction associated with use of IKERVIS 0.1% 
and discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar for patients receiving IKERVIS 0.1% compared to 
vehicle. Due to the immunosuppressive effect of IKERVIS, there is a risk of opportunistic ocular infections, but 
this  risk  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  sufficiently  mitigated  by  routine  risk  management,  including  a 
contraindication in patients with active or suspected ocular infection. Overall, IKERVIS was well tolerated with 
the majority of adverse reactions being eye disorders and related to the installation of the eye drops, while the 
risk of systemic exposure and adverse reactions was considered low.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In light of the totality of the evidence and taking into account the experts’ view, the CHMP concluded that the 
benefits of IKERVIS outweighed its risks in the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye 
disease, which has not improved despite treatment with tear substitutes. Thus, the benefit-risk balance was 
considered favourable. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
During the course of the procedure, the CHMP carefully considered the impact of the lack of a demonstrated 
effect of IKERVIS on symptoms as well as for several other pre-defined endpoints compared to the observed 
effect in improving corneal surface damage and inflammation in the overall benefit-risk assessment. An ad-hoc 
expert  group  was  convened  to  help  explore  the  relevance  of  the  benefits  seen  with  IKERVIS  in  the  clinical 
development programme (see section 2.5.3. for details). 
In summary, the experts considered alternative explanations for the lack of effect on symptoms and suggested 
that there might be a lag time whereby improvement in symptoms may occur only years after improvement in 
signs. With regards to the clinical relevance of the observed change in corneal staining, the experts considered 
the results sufficiently convincing and that the observed difference between IKERVIS and vehicle represented a 
clinically relevant benefit. The extent of ocular surface damage was considered predictive of disease progression 
and thus by improving the severity of keratitis, IKERVIS may help to prevent serious complications. The effect 
on HLA-DR as an inflammation marker was considered by the experts to be of relevance and sufficient to assume 
an anti-inflammatory effect of IKERVIS at the ocular surface, which could help to disrupt the vicious disease 
cycle  of  DED.  Furthermore,  while  use  of  artificial  tears  has  been  shown  to  help  improve  symptoms  in  DED 
patients, in the view of the experts there was no available treatment for DED at the time of this report with a 
demonstrated effect on signs.  
During an oral explanation, the applicant further justified the clinical relevance of the benefits of IKERVIS in the 
treatment of severe keratitis in patients with DED based on the improvement of ocular surface damage (reduced 
CFS) and the anti-inflammatory effect (reduced HLA-DR expression). The applicant pointed out that significantly 
more patients had a pronounced improvement in the CFS grade from grade 4 at baseline to at least grade 1 
compared to vehicle, although this analysis was only done post-hoc. 
Overall, taking into account the experts’ view, the CHMP concluded that the available clinical data had shown a 
relevant treatment effect of IKERVIS, that, even in absence of an effect on symptoms, by itself was clinically 
meaningful. The CHMP was of the view that the initially proposed indication should be changed from treatment 
of DED in adult patients with severe keratitis to treatment of severe keratitis in  adult patients with dry eye 
disease, as the latter was considered to be more in line with the demonstrated treatment effect on signs. In this 
population, IKERVIS was considered to represent a valuable treatment option with limited side effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/473489/2014 
Page 77/82 
  
  
Following the suggestion by the experts that an effect on symptoms might only evolve over years, the CHMP 
recommended  the  conduct  of  a  post-authorisation  study  to  further  explore  long-term  effects  of  IKERVIS 
treatment on symptoms and disease complications. The applicant was recommended to seek scientific advice on 
the protocol for this study to ensure a suitable study design. The CHMP furthermore recommended that the 
applicant  pursued  the  proposal  for  the  conduct  of  a  non-clinical  post-approval  study  to  explore  drug-drug 
interactions at receptor and at the cellular level.  
Finally,  the  CHMP  discussed  the  rationale  for  the  dosing  used  in  the  phase  III  trials  and  while  there  were 
conflicting  results  from  phase  II  studies,  overall,  the  0.1%  dose  strength  seemed  to  have  shown  the  most 
consistent improvements while being well tolerated. No advantage of BID dosing compared to QD dosing was 
expected and thus, the CHMP endorsed the dose recommendations. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision that 
the risk-benefit balance of IKERVIS in the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease, 
which has not improved despite treatment with tear substitutes is favourable and therefore recommends the 
granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for IKERVIS for the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry 
eye disease (DED), which has not improved despite treatment with tear substitutes. 
The reason for the divergent opinion was as follows: 
The hypothesis generated by the study SICCANOVE (i.e. IKERVIS worked better in the more severe DED 
patients) was not confirmed by the pivotal trial (SANSIKA). IKERVIS failed to show efficacy with regard to the 
primary endpoints (combined signs and symptoms) as there was no significant difference relative to vehicle. The 
clinical relevance of the limited improvement in certain secondary endpoints and in post-hoc analyses are 
considered highly questionable. Thus, considering that efficacy has not been convincingly shown, the 
benefit-risk balance is considered to be negative.

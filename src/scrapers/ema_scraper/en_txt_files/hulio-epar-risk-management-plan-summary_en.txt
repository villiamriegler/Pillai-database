PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Hulio® (adalimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hulio®. The RMP details important 
risks of Hulio®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Hulio®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Hulio®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hulio® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Hulio® should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Hulio®'s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Hulio®  is  authorised  for  rheumatoid  arthritis,  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  and 
enthesitis-related  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis  and  non-radiographic  axial  spondyloarthritis, 
psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis in adults and children, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease 
in  adults  and  children,  ulcerative  colitis,  and  non-infectious  uveitis  in  adults  and  children  (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains adalimumab as the active substance and it is given by 
subcutaneous injection. 
Further information  about the evaluation of Hulio®’s benefits  can be found in Hulio®’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Hulio®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Hulio®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  Information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Hulio® is not  yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
In the case of Hulio®, these routine measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures, mentioned under relevant risks below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information  
Important  risks  of  Hulio®  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered  to 
patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hulio®. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is  currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient populations etc.);

risk to the medicine 
According to the Humira® SmPC, respiratory tract infections have 
been  reported  to  occur  very  commonly  (≥  1/10).  In  the  clinical 
studies conducted with Hulio® to date, the most common treatment-
related  infections  included  bronchitis,  nasopharyngitis  and  urinary 
tract infection, although the overall number of patients experiencing 
any  serious  infection  was  small  (20  subjects  [3.0%]  receiving 
Hulio®). Serious infections have been classed as an identified risk 
for Hulio® in accordance with the reference product.

risk to the medicine 
According to the Humira® SmPC, respiratory tract infections have 
been  reported  to  occur  very  commonly  (≥  1/10).  TESAEs  that 
occurred in more than 1 patient were: disseminated TB (2 patients, 
1 [0.2%] in each treatment group) and latent TB (2 patients [0.3%], 
both with FKB327). 
No case of pulmonary TB was reported on FKB327 compared to 2 
cases  [0.4%]  on  Humira®.  Tuberculosis  has  been  classed  as  an 
identified  risk  for  Hulio®  in  accordance  with  the  reference

According to the Humira® SmPC, malignancies have been reported 
to  occur  commonly  (≥  1/100  to  <  1/10)  to  uncommonly  (≥ 
1/1,000 to < 1/100). One case (0.2%) of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 
was reported in the clinical studies conducted with FKB327, with 
one case (0.2%) of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported in the 
Humira® treatment group. There have been one case (0.2%) breast 
cancer  and  one  case  (0.2%)  cervix  carcinoma  in  the  FKB327

treatment-related  cases  of  hepatosplenic  T-cell 
lymphoma, 
leukaemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma in the clinical studies 
conducted  with  Hulio®  to  date.  One  treatment-related  case  of 
lymphoma  in  the  FKB327  treatment  group  was  reported  as  post-
study event. Malignancies have been classed as an identified risk 
for Hulio® in accordance with the reference product. 
Risk  factors  and  risk 
Patients with RA have a 10 % increase in overall malignancy risk 
groups 
compared  with  the  general  population.  Furthermore,  the  SIR 
estimates for patients with RA continued to show an increased risk 
of lymphoma and lung cancer as previously observed. Overall, SIR 
estimates  for  colorectal  and  breast  cancers  continued  to  show  a 
decrease  in  risk,  whereas  cervical  cancer,  prostate  cancer  and 
melanoma  appeared  to  show  no  consistent  trend  in  risk  among 
patients with RA compared with the general population.

risk to the medicine 
According to the Humira® SmPC, demyelinating disorders have 
been reported to occur rarely (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). There have 
been  no 
treatment-related  cases  coded  as  a 
recognised 
demyelinating  disorder,  although  one  (0.2%)  treatment-related 
adverse event of hypoaesthesia was reported in the clinical studies 
conducted  with  Hulio®.  Demyelinating  disorders  have  been 
classed  as  an  identified  risk  for  Hulio®  in  accordance  with  the 
reference product. 
Risk  factors  and  risk 
Risk  factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  MS  are  a 
groups 
combination of genetic susceptibility (HLA-DR15 haplotype) and 
environmental  exposures 
(including 
latitude,  vitamin  D 
deficiency,  season  of  birth,  Epstein  Barr  virus  infection,  and 
smoking behaviour) (O’Gorman et al, 2012). These factors appear 
to act synergistically and the risk of MS is increased in individuals 
exposed  to  more  than  one  factor  (Disanto  et  al  2012).  Being 
Caucasian  and  female  increases  risk,  as  does  having  a  family 
relative  with  MS  (http://patient.info/doctor/multiple-sclerosis-
pro). 
Risk  factors  for  GBS  include  male  sex,  prior  infection  (e.g. 
Campylobacter  jejuni,  Epstein  Barr  virus,  cytomegalovirus, 
mycoplasma,  HIV,  and  more  recently  Zika  virus  [Blázquez  & 
 
Important identified risk 4: Demyelinating disorders (including multiple sclerosis [MS],

Hodgkin's 
disease) 
(http://patient.info/doctor/guillain-barre-
syndrome-pro, Ansar & Valadi 2015).  
Risk  factors  for  optic  neuritis  include  female  sex,  race  (more 
frequent  in  white  Caucasians,  genetic  mutations  (as  per  MS), 
bacterial/viral infections, sarcoidosis/lupus and some drugs (e.g. 
quinine 
and

Humira®. There have been no reports of PML in all clinical trials 
with adalimumab. Similarly, there have been no treatment-related 
cases  of  PML  in  the  clinical  studies  conducted  with  Hulio®  to 
date.  PML  has  been  classed  as  a  potential  risk  for  Hulio®  in 
accordance with the reference product. 
Risk 
factors  and 
risk 
PML  primarily  affects  individuals  with  chronically  and

severely  suppressed  immune  systems  and  is  associated 
primarily with HIV patients, haematological malignancies, or 
relapsing–remitting  multiple  sclerosis  patients  treated  with 
natalizumab. 
PML  is  also  associated  with  other  conditions  such  as  organ 
transplantation,  solid  malignancies,  sarcoidosis,  autoimmune 
 
disorders  (e.g.  lupus,  RA),  and  congenital  immune  deficiencies; 
these  populations  individually  contribute  a  relatively  small 
number  of  cases  and  together  account  for  less  than  10%  of  all 
reported PML cases (Pavlovic et al, 2015).

the risk to the medicine 
In all RA trials with adalimumab, the rate of ALS was determined 
as  <  0.1  event  per  100  patient-years  of  exposure.  Although  there 
have been no treatment-related cases of adenocarcinoma of colon 
in  UC  patients  in  the  clinical  studies  conducted  with  Hulio® 
(studies  were  conducted 
in  rheumatoid  arthritis  patients). 
However, adenocarcinoma of colon has been classed as a potential 
risk for Hulio® in accordance with the reference product. 
Risk 
factors  and 
risk 
 Risk factors for colon cancer include extent and duration of UC, 
groups 
primary  sclerosing  cholangitis,  a  family  history  of  sporadic 
colorectal cancer, severity of histologic bowel inflammation, and 
in some studies, young age at onset of colitis (Lakatos & Lakatos, 
2008). The standardised incidence rate (SIR) for colorectal cancer 
was 8.6 (95% CI, 3.8 –19.5) in those of young age and 4.8 (95% 
CI, 3.9 –5.9) in those with extensive colitis. Men with UC had a 
greater risk of colorectal cancer (SIR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.2–3.0) than 
women (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.3) (Jess et al, 2012).

treatment in RA patients in a real life environment, using already existing data from the German 
Biologics Registry (RABBIT). In particular, this registry will address the long-term safety in RA 
with emphasis on TB/other serious infection, malignancies, elevated ALT levels, autoimmune 
hepatitis, and CHF/MI.

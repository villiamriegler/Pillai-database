1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody which binds to both soluble and transmembrane forms 
of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and inhibits TNFα bioactivity. Simponi was authorised in the 
EU on 1 October 2009 for the treatment of adults who have responded inadequately to previous 
therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in combination with MTX; active and 
progressive PsA, alone or in combination with MTX; and severe, active AS.  
The currently approved dose in RA is: 50 mg given once a month, on the same date each month. 
Simponi should be given concomitantly with MTX. For PsA and AS, the approved dose is 50 mg 
given once a month. 
Across all indications, in patients weighing more than 100 kg who do not achieve an adequate 
clinical response after 3 or 4 doses, increasing the dose of golimumab to 100 mg once a month 
may be considered. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after receiving 3 to 4 additional doses of 100 mg. 
Scope of the variation  
With this Type II variation, the applicant proposes the following addition to the indication section 
4.1 (underlined text is the wording applied for in this variation): 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for:  
  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has been 
inadequate.  
  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients not 
previously treated with MTX. 
Simponi has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-
ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.  
The applicant also proposes related additions of study data in section 5.1. 
Available safety data up to at least 2 years are also assessed within the current variation. In 
addition, the MAH has proposed changes to the product information related to the revised SmPC 
guideline and the implementation of the most recent QRD template. Furthermore, an updated EU-
RMP (v.3.0, dated 24 February 2010) has been submitted.

1.2.  Clinical aspects 
General Comments on Compliance with GCP  
The Clinical trials submitted in support of this variation were performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the applicant.  
Furthermore, the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted 
outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 
2001/20/EC. 
1.2.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 heavy chain 
isotype (G1m allotype) and a kappa light chain isotype. Golimumab binds with high affinity to both 
soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha and inhibits TNF bioactivity. 
1.2.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Main studies 
Introduction 
The submitted documentation consists of results from two of the Phase 3 RA studies, (C0524T05 
and C0524T06) including 6- plus 12 month efficacy and safety data (already evaluated in the initial 
submission), new 1-year radiographic data (study C0524T05 and C0524T06), as well as 2 year 
safety data.  
In the response to the 1st RSI, the MAH has provided 104-week radiographic analyses from the RA 
studies C0524T05 and C0524T06. 
In response to the 2nd RSI and to address the major objections still outstanding, the MAH provided 
retrospective efficacy analyses of study C0524T05 in a subset of patients representative of the 
applied for indication (i.e. patients with severe, active and progressive RA). In addition, a 
comparision of golimumab data in this subset of patients with data from another TNF-inhibitor, 
infliximab (Remicade) has been provided.

Study C0524T05 (GO-BEFORE)  
Methods 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study 
with the aim to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical pharmacology of golimumab alone or in 
combination with MTX in MTX-naïve subjects (and no prior treatment with an anti-TNF agent), who 
had RA for at least 3 months.  
Active RA was defined as persistent disease activity with at least 4 swollen and 4 tender joints at 
the time of screening and baseline and met at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: CRP ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, 
ESR ≥28 mm; Morning stiffness of ≥ 30 minutes; Bone erosion by x-ray and/or MRI prior to first 
administration of study agent; anti-CCP antibody-positive or RF-positive at screening. 
The study design excluded subjects with other inflammatory diseases; who had previously been 
treated with anti-TNFα therapy at any time and/or received disease modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs)/systemic immunosuppressives; intra-articular, IM, or IV corticosteroids; or anakinra 
within 4 weeks prior to the first study dose were to be excluded from participation. 
Treatment 
Four treatment groups were used:  
1) Placebo+MTX, 2) Golimumab 100mg+placebo, 3) Golimumab 50mg+MTX or 4) Golimumab 
100mg+MTX. 
Golimumab was administered as sc injection every 4 week. MTX was to be administered orally at a 
dose of 10 mg/week starting at week 0, with dose escalation to 20 mg/week by Week 8. 
Early escape: At Week 28, any subject with <20% improvement from baseline in both swollen and 
tender joint counts could enter early escape in a double-blinded fashion. 
Two distinct periods were applied: 
1) Double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Weeks 0 through 52), including early escape at Week 
28. This period has been completed. 
2) Long-term extension period (Weeks 52 through 268). Open-label after the Week 52. This period 
has been completed through Week 104. 
4 
 
 
 
The primary objective: Efficacy of golimumab in subjects with active RA who have not been 
previously treated with MTX as measured by reduction of the signs and symptoms at Week 24 and 
Inhibition of progression of structural damage at Week 52.  
Two co-primary endpoints were used: 
1) The proportion of subjects achieving ACR 50 response at Week 24.  
2) Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at Week 52.  
ACR 50 response was reached if the following was achieved: 
1. Improvement of ≥  50% from baseline in both the swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender 
joint count (68 joints) and 
2. Improvement of ≥  50% from baseline in ≥ 3 of the following 5 assessments: 
a. Patient’s assessment of pain 
b. Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
c. Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
d. Patient’s assessment of physical function as measured by the HAQ disabilityindex  
e. CRP 
The total vdH-S score is the sum of joint erosion score and joint-space narrowing (JSN) (van der 
Heijde et al, 1992). 
5 
 
 
Joint erosion score:  Each joint is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 
indicating no erosion and 5 indicating extensive loss of bone from more than one half of the 
articulating bone. Therefore, the maximum erosion score for a hand joint is 5 and the total 
maximum erosion score for hands is 160. Because each side of a foot joint is graded on the scale 
of 0 to 5, the maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10 and the total maximum erosion score for 
feet is 120. Thus, the maximal erosion score is 280. 
Joint-space narrowing (JSN) score: The JSN score summarizes the severity of JSN in 30 joints of 
the hands and 12 joints of the feet. Assessment of JSN, including subluxation, is scored from 0 
(normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). 
Therefore, the maximum JSN score for a hand joint as well as a foot joint is 4, and the maximal 
JSN score is 168. The maximal erosion score of 280 combined with the maximal JSN score of 168 
gives worst possible vdH-S score as 448. 
Major secondary endpoint: Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at 
Week 52 in subjects with abnormal CRP at baseline. 
Other secondary endpoints were:  
Major Clinical Response (MCR), i.e. meeting ACR 70 response criteria continuously for 6 month. 
Change from baseline in HAQ (physical function) at week 52 and 104. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive summary statistics, such as n, mean, SD, median, interquartile range, minimum, and 
maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables were used to 
summarize data. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test or chi-square test was to be used as 
appropriate to compare the proportion of subjects responding to treatment. Continuous response 
parameters were to be compared using an analysis of variance on the van der Waerden normal 
scores (Conover, 1980). All statistical tests were 2 sided and performed at α = 0.050. In addition 
to statistical analyses, graphical data displays (eg, line plots) and subject listings were also used to 
summarize or present the data.  
In the analyses of efficacy endpoints, the first test compared the combined golimumab + MTX 
group versus placebo + MTX. If the results were significant, then pairwise comparisons were 
performed between each golimumab treatment group (50 mg + MTX, 100 mg + MTX, and 100 mg 
+ placebo) and placebo + MTX. All statistical testing was 2-tailed, at a significance level of 0.050. 
Dataset for analysis: 
Prespecified efficacy analyses were based on randomized subjects. The primary efficacy and 
selected secondary efficacy analyses were based on all subjects who were randomized at Week 0. 
Subjects were to be included in the efficacy analyses according to their assigned treatment group 
regardless of whether they received the assigned treatment.  
After unblinding the data, an additional analysis was performed. This analysis was conducted to 
evaluate the impact of having included subjects who were randomized but not treated in the 
primary analysis. Accordingly, an analysis similar to the primary analysis was conducted using a 
modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which excluded those subjects who were randomized 
but did not receive treatment. 
A last-observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure was to be used to impute the missing ACR 
components if subjects had data for at least one ACR components at Week 24.  In the primary 
analysis of structural damage data linear extrapolation was used to impute 52 week ratings for 
patients escaping early at 28 weeks, provided that at least two ratings were available. Otherwise, 
6 
 
the imputations were based on median ratings from all patients in the same CRP stratum. In 
alternative sensitivity analyses the LOCF approach and an approach where patients were analysed 
as randomised ignoring the early escape were used. 
Results 
A total of 637 subjects were randomized. The figure below shows subject disposition at Week 54; 
randomized subjects. 
There were 28 (17.5%) subjects who met the criteria for EE at Week 28 in the placebo + MTX 
treatment group. Additionally, 22 (14.0%) subjects in the golimumab 100 mg + placebo and 20 
(12.7%) subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX treatment groups also qualified for EE. 
Through Week 52, discontinuation of SC study agent occurred in 12.6% of randomized subjects 
and discontinuation of oral study agent occurred in 13.2% of randomized subjects. Treatment 
groups were generally well balanced with respect to the overall proportions of subjects who 
discontinued SC and/or oral study agent. The main reason for discontinuation of either the SC or 
oral study agent was AEs for all treatment groups. Golimumab + MTX treatment groups had a 
greater proportion of subjects that discontinued either SC or oral study agent due to AEs. 
7 
 
 
 
 
Study Participants 
Median age was 50 years, the majority of subjects were women (82.9%), and the study population 
was predominantly Caucasian (72.4%). Patients had moderate disease, with most subjects having 
relatively short duration of disease (median from 1.0 to 1.8 years), although some subjects had 
long disease duration. The mean number of swollen joints at baseline ranged from approximately 
15 to 16 and the mean number of tender joints ranged from approximately 27 to 29.  
Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to baseline disease characteristics, 
and similar with respect to the proportion of subjects taking medications for RA at baseline. Oral 
corticosteroids were taken by approximately half of all subjects, with the median prednisone 
equivalent dose ranging from 5.0 to 5.5 mg/day. NSAIDs were taken by about 85% of subjects. 
Week 24 Co-primary endpoint ACR 50 
The statistical analyses were undertaken firstly for the combined 50 and 100 mg golimumab + MTX 
groups compared with MTX, and if significance was reached, pair-wise comparisons for doses were 
done. 
The primary endpoint ACR50 did not reach statistical significance (combined golimumab vs. MTX). 
Non-inferiority testing between the golimumab 100 mg + placebo and placebo + MTX groups was 
preplanned according to the protocol. The results showed that the proportion of subjects who 
achieved an ACR 50 response was similar in the golimumab 100mg+ placebo and placebo + MTX 
groups which suggest that there are no clinical advantages of golimumab monotherapy in 
treatment naïve RA patients. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
ACR 20 Response at Week 24 - secondary endpoint: 
For the endpoint ACR20, statistical significance was reached for the two combination groups but 
not for monotherapy. At week 24 the ACR responders at higher response levels are similar for all 
treated groups. Golimumab monotherapy was similar to MTX monotherapy.  
ACR response at Week 52 - secondary endpoint  
The proportion of subjects who achieved ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses at Week 52 were 
significantly greater in the combined group and in 100 mg golimumab+MTX group, but not for the 
50mg golimumab+MTX. As the approach for imputation of missing values in the analyses of ACR 
data could be anti-conservative (biased in favour of experimental treatment) the MAH was asked to 
present sensitivity analyses counting all discontinuing patients as non-responders. The results of 
9 
 
 
the required sensitivity analyses showed that the number of responders and the difference in 
response rate slightly diminished between the golimumab+MTX groups’ vs. MTX+placebo group. 
However the overall results of these sensitivity analyses are consistent with those of the CSR 
analyses. 
Major Clinical Response - MCR (meeting ACR 70 response criteria continuously for 6 month - 
trough week 52). 
The proportion of subjects who achieved MCR was significantly greater in the golimumab 50 mg + 
MTX treatment group than in the placebo +MTX treatment group, but not for the golimumab 100 
mg + MTX treatment group. 
Change from baseline in HAQ (physical function) at week 52  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The improvement from baseline in HAQ at week 52 is calculated as the baseline score minus the 
week 52 score so that the positive values indicate improvement (i.e. less disability) and negative 
values indicate worsening. 
The mean and median value
s (standard deviation) for improvement from baseline in HAQ score are 
shown below: 
0.625 and 0.57
6 (0.688) for placebo + MTX 
0.500 and 0.658 (0.676) for the golimumab 5
0 mg + MTX treatment group (p = 0.287) 
0.625 and 0.748 (0.673) for the golimumab 100 mg + MTX treatment group (p = 0.023)
D
isease Activity Score, DAS28 (CRP) Response and Remission
In the response to the 1st RSI, the MAH informed that inadvertently C
RP values in mg/dL instead 
of mg/L had been used when originally deriving the DAS28 response and remission values for 
golimumab studies in RA and PsA. As a result, all DAS28-related endpoints were re-analysed and 
submitted with the response. 
The revised results are shown in
 the Table below. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluation of the rate of progression of structural damage 
Radiographic progression is defined as change in the total vdH-S score that is greater than the 
smallest detectable change (SDC) based on the limits of agreement (Lassere et al, 2001). 
Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at Week 52 (Co-
primary endpoint)  
To test the robustness of the co-primary endpoint analysis of change from baseline in van der 
Heijde modified Sharp score at Week 52, four sensitivity analyses were performed. The first 
sensitivity analysis included only those subjects who completed SC study agent administrations 
through Week 52, did not miss any dose, and had no missing data either at baseline or at Week 
52. For the second analysis, LOCF rules were applied. For the third sensitivity analysis, no EE rules 
were applied. The fourth sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of using only data 
from original readers (no adjudication) adjudications were reported. The results of these 4 analyses 
were consistent with that noted for the primary analysis. 
The cumulative probability plot for change in vdH-S score at week 52 is shown below. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similar results were noted for the major secondary endpoint change from baseline in vdH-S score 
in
 subjects with abnormal CRP level (>1.0 mg/dL) at baseline. 
13 
 
 
Radiographic progression based on smallest detectable change 
The Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) is defined as the amount of difference for which any score 
smaller cannot be reliably distinguished from random error in measurement, and is determined by 
the variation of the difference in vdH-S change scores between two readers of the same film.  
The placebo + MTX treatment group had a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects 
w
ith radiographic progression above the level of smallest detectable change (SDC, 3.82) in vdH-S 
score compared with subjects in the golimumab 100 mg + MTX treatment group. The golimumab 
50 mg + MTX treatment group had 9 such subjects but this proportion was not statistically 
different from that of the placebo + MTX treatment group. 
Reduction in the rate of radiographic progression over time
The analyses for the change in the vdH-S score from baseline to Week 28 and from Week 28 to 
Week 52 showed that most progression occurred prior to Week 28. From Week 28 through Week 
52, structural damage continued to progress in subjects in the MTX alone treatment group, 
whereas minimal progression was observed in subjects in both golimumab treatment groups as 
measured by the mean values. Linear extrapolation was used to calculate the vdH-S score for 
subjects who had changed treatment due to early escape 
14 
 
 
Effects on structural damage 
Effects on structural damage was evaluated by determining whether joints with no damage a
t 
baseline began to erode or show joint space narrowing (JSN
), and by determining whether a 
subject had no increase in vdH-S score. In response to the 1st RSI 
the MAH has resubmitted the 
week 52 to clarify the number and type of impuations in the primary analysis. Three kinds of 
imputations have been used: linear extrapolation, LOCF and imputation with the median change.
Overall, the results of the additional analyses are consistent with that of the primary analysis for 
the effect of golimumab on reducing the rate of progression of structural damage through W
eek 
52. 
Data from week 104 has been analysed and presented in a
 similar fashion. 
Subjects with no newly involved joints
A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX treatment group 
compared with MTX alone, had no new erosions in joints that were uninvolved at baseline. The 
proportion of subjects in the golimumab 100mg+MTX group was numerically higher but the 
difference did not reach statistical significance. At least 83.0% of the subjects who had a JSN score 
of 0 at baseline (across all treatment groups) did not have new JSN at Week 52. 
15 
 
 
 
 
Subjects with no change from baseline in vdH-S score at week 52 
There were a significantly greater proportion of subjects without an increase from baseline in total 
vdH-S score in the combined goli
mumab group and golimumab 50 mg + MTX treatment group as 
compared with the placebo + MTX treatment group. The proportion of subjects in the golimuma
100 mg+MTX group was numerically higher but the difference did not reach statistical signific
b 
ance.  
An analysis comparing the proportion of patients with no progression (change in vdH-S score<= 0) 
16 
 
 
 
 
Because sensitivity analysis 2 differs from the primary analysis only in the methods of missing data 
imputation (Table MO2-1), the number of subjects with an imputed score remains the same as for 
the primary analysis. The results of the analyses above are nearly identical to those of the primary 
analysis.

Because the goal of the analysis of Week 104 data was to demonstrate the sustained effect over 
time beyond Week 52 for golimumab-treated subjects, the method for analyzing change from 
baseline in vdH-S score for Week 104 data was different from that of Week 52.

An analysis comparing the proportion of patients with no progression (change in vdH-S score<= 0) 
In the analysis of Week 104 data, scores of 6 of the 131 subjects in the placebo + MTX group and 
3 of the 133 subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX group were imputed. The treatment 
difference between these 2 treatment groups is apparent from the cumulative distribution plot. 
When the data are displayed with the cuts of < 0, = 0, and > 0, the treatment difference between 
the placebo + MTX and golimumab 50 mg + MTX groups is largely driven by the increase in the 
proportion of subjects with change in vdH-S score < 0 in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX. 
19 
 
 
 
 
Ancillary analyses 
To address the concerns that the controlled data on effects on signs and symptoms in MTX-naive 
RA patients (study C0524T05) did not show robust and consistent treatment effects through week 
52, and that the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of golimumab + MTX in the population of 
early RA was questioned, the MAH has provided results from retrospective analyses in a subset of 
patients that who are representative of the patient population for which labeling has been 
proposed, namely patients with severe, active and progressive RA not previously treated with MTX. 
This patient population is expected to derive the most benefit from an early treatment with an 
TNFα blocker in combination with MTX, particularly with regard to prevention of progression of 
structural damage. In addition, safety was also evaluated in a single subset considered 
representative of patients with severe, active, and progressive RA (ie, screening CRP >1.5 mg/dL) 
(see section on clinical safety below). 
The treatment effect of golimumab + MTX on signs and symptoms of disease at week 52 in this 
patient population was assessed using multiple validated outcome measures in several subsets of 
the C0524T05 population. The MAH performed analyses using several baseline disease 
characteristics and multiple outcome measures in order to assess the consistency of treatment 
benefit for golimumab 50 mg + MTX in MTX-naïve subjects with severe, active, and progressive RA 
regardless of how the subset was defined. 
Methods 
O
utcome Measures:
The outcome measures for the new analyses were chosen to provide clinically relevant information 
in the population subsets most representative of subjects with severe, active and progressive 
disease. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria are used to distinguish a 
treatment effect of an active therapy compared with placebo in clinical trials. However, benefit to 
patients should be judged using a variety of outcome measures, especially those that reflect more 
profound responses. Since the CHMP expressed the most concern about the 52-week signs and 
symptoms data, the focus of the analyses presented in the MAH’s responses was on outcomes for 
signs and symptoms measured at 52 weeks. The outcome measures used for the new analyses are 
as follows : 
-  ACR 20/50/70 
-  Major clinical response (MCR; maintenance of ACR 70 response over a continuous 6-month 
period) 
-  Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (CRP) response and remission 
-  Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), improvement from baseline >0.25 
- 
van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score, change from baseline < 0. 
Subsets of Interest:
Since there are no standard definitions for severe active progressive RA, several baseline disease 
characteristics were used to define the subsets of the entire study population most li
ke
ly to have 
severe, active, and progressive RA. These criteria are listed below along with the rationale for 
ch
oosing them. The criteria chosen for analyses are: 
  C-reactive protein (CRP): 
-  >1.5 mg/dL 
-  >3.0 mg/dL 
- 
  Swollen and tender joints: 
- 
swollen joint count (SJC) >10 and tender joint count (TJC) >12 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  SJC>20 and TJC>12 
  DAS28 (using CR
P): 
-  >5.1 
-  >6.5 
  Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positive 
Analyses 
Point estimates of the difference between golimumab 50 mg + MTX group and MTX alone was t
he 
focus in order to demonstrate a robust and clinically relevant treatment effect. No tests for 
statistical significance were performed. 
Of note, study C0524T05 was sized to assess the primary signs and symptoms endpoint at Week 
24. The analysis of data in subsets with
 smaller sample sizes may result in point estimates that are 
unstable (wide confidence intervals).

In order to evaluate the benefit of golimumab 50 mg + MTX compared
 with MTX alone in severe, 
active, and progress
ive subjects, the differences in response rates between the two treatments at 
Week 52 were calcul
ated for each of the subsets. These differences were compared with the 
differences seen in the overall population (Table 2). The difference in ACR50 response between 
golimumab 50 mg + MTX and MTX alone at Week 52 becomes greater for the narrowed subsets, 
and the increasing benefit is consistent across various subsets.

When the same subsets were analysed from the week 24 data, there was a slightly larger degree 
of response in some of the subgroups. For the week 52 data, which was most seriously ques
tioned 
by CHMP (i.e. an observed difference of 6.5 % for ACR50), for nearly a
ll parameters at least a 
doubling i  the degree of response was observed in the different subgroups analysed. Thus,

For the categories of SJC and TJ

 for som

Ho
wever, these results are not 
conce
ntrated in a s

suggesti
ng random variation as a potenti
al cause. In viewing the totality of the data, the treatment 
e
ffect of golimumab 50 mg +MTX was consistently greater than the overall population across 
nearly all outcome measures. 
The number of subjects achieving a major clinical response (maintenance of ACR 70 response over
a continuous 6-month period) was overall relatively few. Thus, when dividing into subgroups,
numbers are very small. There was no consistent pattern of a larger degree of response in the 
more severe subgroups for this particular endpoint, across the different subgroups analysed. 
Comparison with other anti-TNF agent
In addition, to assess whether golimumab treatment effects are in line with other TNF blockers 
approved
 for use in combination with M
TX in the MTX-naïve RA population, the MAH has compared 
golimumab with fliximab in representat

 The data from ASPIRE and C0524T05 were analyzed using similar rules, and the Applicant 
has access to
 the datasets of both products so that some specific subset comparisons can be made 
between infliximab and golimumab. 
Outcome measures analyzed focused on the standard ACR20/50/70 response criteria for baseline 
CRP >3 mg/dL and SJC >20/TJC >12, which are representative of the subsets of subjects with the 
most severe, active and progressive disease in the ASPIRE trial (Smolen et al, 2006). The 
golimumab 50 mg + MTX dose was compared with both the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg doses of 
infliximab in comb
ination with MTX. The treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg + MTX is in line with 
the effect seen with both doses of infliximab + MTX in the subsets in which the comparisons were 
performed. 
Study C0524T06 
This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
active RA despite ongoing MTX. The study population included 444 randomized subjects. We
ek 0-
24 was the placebo-controlled portion. At week 24,  patients given MTX + placebo injecions were 
switched to golimumab 50 mg SC injections and q4wk thereafter through Week 48. Additional 
groups were treated with golimumab 100 mg+placebo MTX, golimumab 50 mg + MTX or 
golimumab 100 mg + MTX. There was an option for early escape after week 16, following the sam
e 
criteria as in T05. Thus, there are only controlled data up to week 24. For further details see
assessment report of initial MAA. 
Reduction in the rate of prog
ression of structural damage
There was minimal progression in structural damage in all treatment groups at Week 24. No 
significant differences in the change from baseline in vdH-S score at Week 24 were observed 
between the golimumab + MTX treatment groups and placebo + MTX. The results at Week 52 w
ere 
similar to what was observed at Week 24.

adiographic progression based on smallest detectable change
At Week 24, the proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC was low 
(3.6% to 5.8%) across all treatment groups. No significant differences between treatment groups 
were observed. 
At Week 52, the proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC was 
assessed by early escape or crossover status. Among golimumab-treated subjects, there was a 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC for those who early 
escaped compared with those who did not early escape. 
- 
Subjects with no newly involved joints 
The proportion of subjects with no newly eroded joints at Week 24 (range 76.7% to 83.2%) and 
the proportion of subjects with no new JSN at Week 24 (range 90.5% to 95.2%) were high in all 
treatment groups, including the placebo + MTX group. There were no significant differences 
observed between the golimumab treatment groups and the placebo + MTX group.  
The proportion of subjects with no newly eroded joints at Week 52 (range 70.3% to 80.7%) and 
the proportion of subjects with no new JSN at Week 52 (range 80.0% to 94.6%) were similar 
between golimumab treatment groups and the placebo + MTX group. 
- 
Subjects with no change from baseline in vdH-S Score 
T
he majority of subjects in the golimumab + MTX treatment groups had a change in vdH-S score of 
< 0 at Week 24 and Week 52. There were no significant differences across treatment groups at 
W
eek 24. During the assessment, the MAH submitted data from the week 104 evaluation of X-ray 
data.  
A plot of the empirical cumulative distribution function of the change from baseline in the total 
vdH-S score at Week 104 is presented in the Figure below, where with missing data were excluded. 
An alternative plot, where missing imputation rules were applies showed a similar picture. Most 
subjects had no change in vdH-S score. Overall, the cumulative probability curves for the placebo 
+ MTX group, the golimumab 50 mg + MTX group, and the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group were 
similar. It should be noted that subjects randomized to the placebo + MTX group began receiving 
golimumab at Week 16/24. At the right tail (> 90%), the cumulative probability curves for the 
golimumab + MTX groups appear slightly separated from the curve for the golimumab 100 mg + 
placebo group, suggesting radiographic progression (positive change in vdH-S score) was less in 
the combination treatment groups. 
25 
 
 
 
The CHMP concludes that there is no difference in terms of progression of structural joint damage 
between the group originally treated with placebo + MTX, compared with the approved golimum
ab 
50 mg + MTX group, which could be due to the fact that all placebo + MTX patients crossed over t
o 
golimumab + MTX treatment by week 16 /24.  
CHMP discussion of clinical efficacy 
Golimumab 50 mg sc once a month, in combination with methotrexate, is approved in the EU in 
adults suffering from moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, who have responded 
inadequately to previous therapy. Several similar biological agents on the EU market have achieved 
approval also for a first line indication in early RA. In this variation, the applicant applies for an 
extended indication in early RA, using the same wording which has previously been accepted for 
other biologics. 
As support, the applicant has submitted study data from a phase III study in MTX naïve RA 
patients (C0524T05). This study data was partly evaluated in the initial application for approval. 
Overall, the study design was considered acceptable, the inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosing and 
administration of the study drugs were considered relevant. The original application contained 24 
weeks data, and subsequently, controlled data on signs and symptoms up to week 52 were 
submitted. At that time point, the study data were not considered sufficient for an approval in early 
RA, mainly due to lack of supportive X-ray data in this population.  
In this variation, efficacy data up to week 52 has initially been evaluated, whereas efficacy data 
beyond week 52 (through week 104) has been evaluated within a parallel variation (II/09) 
concerning claims for maintenance of improvement in sign and symptoms. In its response to the 
26 
 
 
1st RSI for procedure II/08, the MAH has provided 104-week radiographic analyses from studies 
C0524T05 and C0524T06. 
In study T05, golimumab, as monotherapy or in combination with MTX, was tested against MTX 
alone. The increase of the MTX dose is made according to clinical practice However, given the dose 
titration, the concern was raised that the MTX only arm was not on optimal dosage until week 8. In 
the response to the 1st RSI, the MAH has further addressed how this may have impacted efficacy. 
The MAH has adequately described the MTX regimen used in study T05 which included that 
subjects in all treatment groups had their dose of MTX/placebo rapidly escalated to a dose of 20 
mg /week. The dose was then maintained until Week 52. There was no protocol-allowed 
adjustment dependent on clinical response. Further, the median dose of MTX was the same for all 
treatment regimens (except the golimumab monotherapy arm). The CHMP agrees that any delayed 
effect of MTX should be controlled for across all treatment arms, and the issue is therefore 
considered resolved. 
Short-term and long-term efficacy in MTX naive RA patients was evaluated at week 24 and week 
52, using several clinically validated efficacy endpoints, i.e. ACR response, Change from baseline in 
HAQ (physical function), MCR (Major Clinical Response) and DAS (Disease Activity Score) 28 (CRP) 
Response and Remission. From week 28, any subject with <20% improvement from baseline in 
both swollen and tender joint counts could enter early escape in a double-blinded fashion. 
The ACR 50 at week 24 and Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score 
at Week 52 was chosen as co-primary endpoints. ACR 50 represents a higher level of response as 
compared to other studies, which used ACR 20 as primary endpoint. The total vdH-S is an accepted 
parameter for assessment of x-ray data evaluating the rate of progression of structural damage. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (ACR 50) was not reached in the first test, whic
h compared t
he 
combined golimumab + MTX group versus placebo + MTX (p=0.053) at week 24. However, 
comparisons using ACR 20 achieved p-values below 0.05. These results were also supported by a 
post-hoc analysis using a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population which excluded those subjects 
who were randomized but did not receive treatm
ent (n=3). In this analysis statistical significance 
w
as reached. In general, it is dubious to make changes to the statistical analysis plan after 
breaking the randomization code and the suggested sensitivity analysis (“modified ITT”) cannot 
replace the pre-planned analysis. It is, however, considered that the suggested sensitivity analysis 
(“modified ITT”) is reasonable. 
Compared with Week 24, the number of ACR 50 responders has increased somewhat at Week 52
(6% for MTX, <2% for 50 mg+ MTX, about 12% for 100 mg +MTX).  Week 52 data analyse
s for 
ACR 20 and ACR 50 resulted in statistically significantly differences between golimumab combined 
and MTX. However, the 50 mg + MTX dose, which is the dose approved and applied for, was not
statistically different from MTX at any ACR level, and the observed differences were small (ACR 20
7.8%, p=0.16, A
CR 50 6.5%; p=0.24). 
Overall, the submitted study data shows a clear trend of better treatment effect for the 
golimumab+MTX groups as compared with MTX alone. Results for nearly all efficacy endpoints 
show a numerically greater number of responders in the golimumab+MTX groups. However, the 
magnitude of treatment effect is small. The MAH has argued that the overall treatment effect of 
golimumab is comparable to other anti-TNF agents, even though comparison across trials can
 only 
be made with great caution. The MAH argues that the early escape and prespecified analysis rules 
(subjects who were non-responders Week 28 were also considered a
s non-responders in the 52-
week analysis) in study C0524T05 disadvantaged the result for the 50 mg+MTX group and that the 
ACR response rate for the 50 mg+MTX arm may not be a true reflection of response in the 50 mg
dose-group at Week 52. However, the same reasoning regarding disadvantages would apply
 also 
for the MTX+placebo group, in which non-responders also were carried forward to the 52-week 
analysis. Furthermore, the SPC contains a recommendation that for a patient who does not 
27 
 
 
 
 
respond by 14 weeks, continued treatment should be carefully be reconsidered, and thus to 
continue treatment beyond 28 weeks without a response would be questionable.  
To address the CHMP’s major objections, in the response to the 2nd RSI the MAH has submitted a
subgroup analyses of patients belonging to the intended target population (i.e. patients with 
severe, active, progressive RA). These subgroups have been selected retrospectively, and there is 
no established definition of severe, active and progressive disease. However, the MAH has used 
several different parameters for defining severe disease, and it is agreed that the subgroups
 reflect 
such population. As pointed out by the MAH, given e.g. the small numbers in the respective 
subpopulations, these subgroup analyses should be interpreted with some caution. Howev
er, they 
are helpful for review of the overall picture. 
In the new, post-hoc subgroup analyses provided by the MAH during the procedure, a larger 
degree of response is seen with golimumab + MTX than with MTX monotherapy in subgroups 
reflecting the intended tar
get population, than in the overall population in the study. There also 
appears to be a larger difference between golimumab + MTX vs. MTX monotherapy for patients 
with the highest disease activity, within each definition of subgroups (e.g. DAS > 5.1 or DAS > 
6.5; CRP >1.5 mg/dL vs CRP >3.0 mg/dL). These observations support the restriction of the 
indication of anti-TNF agents in the MTX-naïve RA population to the subset with severe, active, an
d 
progressive disease to optimize patient benefit. 
The MAH has submitted subgroup analyses from ASPIRE, the study in MTX naïve subjects with 
Remicade (infliximab). The observed differences between MTX monotherapy and infliximab+ MTX 
in these subgroups are of the same magnitude as seen with golimumab for the same parameters. 
Thus, taken together, there overall picture shows a considerably more convincing, clinically 
meaningful effect based on analyses of data from the patients belonging to the intended target
population. These effects seem to be of a similar magnitude as for infliximab in similar 
subpopulations. 
Structural damage:  
The X-ray data from T05 presented in the initial application (up to week 52) indicated that 
golimumab has a positive effect on progression of structural damage. Statistically significant effects
have been demonstrated for the
 primary x-ray endpoint Change from baseline in van der Heijde 
Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score as well as in different responder analyses based on the change in 
vdH-S score. 
Three kinds of imputations have been used: linear extrapolation, LOCF and imputation with the 
median change. They all tend to underestimate the progression rate since the duration between 
baseline and the first on study treatment radiologic examination seem to be too short to detect a 
real progression of structural damage. Th
e changes calculated based on linear extrapolation or 
LOCF imputation tend to be zero or very small (well within the measurement error) and very 
similar. This explains the almost identical results in the primary analysis with linear extra
polation 
and the LOCF sensitivity analysis (1.37 vs. 0.74 for placebo and golimumab 50 mg and 1.37 vs.
0.75, respectively). In case of insufficient data for linear extrapolation or LOCF, imputation of 
median change (i.e. zero) was used. Thus for the vast majority (75%) of patients escaping early 
no 
change or very small changes have been imputed. 
Since there were more imputations in the placebo group compared to the golimumab 50 mg grou
p 
(43 vs. 37) the primary analysis with linear extrapolation as well as the sensitivity LOCF analysis 
will, if anything, have a tendency to favour the placebo group. This tendency is valid for the mean 
comparison as well as for the comparison of percentage of patients with no progression 
(change<0). Thus the positive effects on structural damage at 52 weeks are considered robust. 
About 16 % units more patients have experienced no change in the golimumab 50 mg group 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to the placebo group. These results are further supported in the responder analysis
counting discontinuing patients as non-responders. 
In addition, week 104 data from T05 have been provided to support the claim of substained effect 
over time beyond week 52; the method for analyzing change from baseline in vdH-S score for
week 104 was different from that of week 52. The 104 week analysis is based on patients with at 
least one radiologic examination after week 52. Patients switching from placebo to golimumab at
week 52 or later are in the analysis kept in the initially randomised treatment. The number of 
imputations (LOCF and median change, i.e. zero) was small (6 on placebo and 3 on golimum
ab 50 
mg). Again, if anything this analysis should be conservative. There are about 10% units more 
patients with no progression in the golimuma
b 50 mg treatment compared with the placebo group. 
This difference remained unchanged in an ITT analysis including all initially randomised patien
ts 
counting patients without radiologic examination after week 52 as having progressed. In the 
responder analysis with patients escaping prior to week 52 counted as non-responders but using 
available week 104 data for patients switching at or after week 52, the difference between 
treatments was 17.4% (95% CI 5.6;29.2). 
In the response to the first RSI, the MAH submitted also week 104 X-ray data from T06. There
 is 
no difference in terms of progression of structural joint damage between the group originally 
treated with placebo + MTX, compared with the 
approved golimumab 50 mg + MTX group, which 
could be due to the fact that all placebo + MTX patients crossed over to golimumab + MTX 
treatment by week 16 /24.  Thus, these data are not helpful for assessing whether golimumab 
reduces the rate of progression of joint damage in the second line population. 
In conclusion, a positive effect on structural damage up to two years has been demonstrate
d. The 
difference in mean change and percentage of patients with no progression cannot be easily 
interpreted in terms of clinical relevance. As for what has been demonstrated for similar products, 
the results should merely be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis that these type of drugs 
have a positive effect on structural
onsidered based on assumptions. Given that with the responses to the 2nd RSI a meaningful 
clinical effect in MTX
-naive patients was observed, it is accepted to include a claim regarding 
 damage. Any conclusions on long-term patient benefit must be 
c
reduction of the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray into section 4.1 o
f the 
SPC. There is sufficient support for this claim from Study C0524T05, in MTX naïve subjects. 
Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The applicant has submitted 2-year cumulative safety data from the 3 ongoing 5-year Phase 3 
studies in RA patients: methotrexate (MTX)-naïve subjects with active RA in C0524T05, subjects
with active RA despite MTX therapy in C0524T06, and subjects with active RA who were previo
usly 
treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents in C0524T11.  
Safety data from these studies up to week 52 was already submitted and evaluated in the initi
al 
procedure. Data from study T05 will again be presented in this AR as it represents key placebo-
controlled safety data, for the population applied for
. Of note is that there was no control group 
after week 24 in T06 and T11 or after week 52 in T05. AEs through 100/104 weeks were 
summarized by the treatment subjects were receiving at the time of an AE.  
In addition, SAE from all ongoing golimumab studies, from the most recent DBL (data base lock) or
cumulatively through 15 may 2009 has also been submitted.

c coma resulting from suicide by insulin 
self-injection (1 subject), tramadol overdose (1 subject), cardiac arrest secondary to intracerebral 
hemorrhage (1 subject), respiratory distress (1 subject), circulatory insufficiency (1 subject), 
fulminant hepatic failure (1 subject), and 
unknown causes (2 subjects; for one of these subjects, a 
further follow up revealed the cause of the death was cardio-respiratory arrest after su

gluteal abscess). 
Adverse events of special interest: 
Serious Infections  
Serious Infections in study T05 through Week 52 
Serious infections and infestations occurred more frequently in subjects who received golimumab 
100 mg + MTX (6.9%) than in the other treatment groups (1.3% to 4.1%). All serious infect
occurred once in each treatment group except for pneumonia (reported for 2 subjects each
 in the 
ions 
placebo + MTX and the golimumab 100 mg + MTX treatment groups) and abscess (reporte
d for 2 
subjects in
 the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group). 
Serious Infections in study T05 through Week 104 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Through Week 104, serious infections occurred more frequently in subjects in golimumab 50 m
g + 
MTX (5.5%) and golimumab 100 mg + MTX (7.7%) treatment groups than in the golimumab 100 
mg + placebo (3.2%) treatment group. The most frequently occurring serious infections were 
pneumonia, pulmonary TB, and sepsis. 
Pneumoni
a occurred in 0.6% (1 subject) of the golimumab 100 mg + placebo group, 1.7% (5 
subjects) of the golimumab 50 mg + MTX group, and 0.6% (2 subj
ects) of the golimumab 100 mg 
+ MTX group
. Pulmonary TB occurred in 0.6% (1 subject) of the golimumab 100 mg + placebo 
group,
 0.3% (1 subject) of the golimumab 50 mg + MTX, and 0.6% (2 subjects) of the golimumab 
100 mg + MTX group. Tuberculosis occurred in 0.3% (1 subject) of the golimumab 50 mg + MTX 
and 0.6% (2 subjects) of the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group. Sepsis occurred in 0.6% (1 
subject) of the golimumab 100 mg + placebo group, 0.3% (1 subject) of the golimumab 50 mg + 
MTX, and 0.3% (1 subject) of the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group. 
Serious Infections in All RA Phase 3 SC studies through Week 100/104 
Through Week 100/104, serious infections were observed in 2.7% placebo subjects, 4.7% of 
subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group and 7.0% of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group, 
with similar types of serious infections occurring with similar frequencies across the individual RA 
studies.  
The most common serious infection reported was pneumonia (occurring in 1.5% of subjects in the 
golimumab 50 mg group and 0.9% of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group), followed by 
sepsis (0.1% in the golimumab 50 mg group and 0.9% in the golimumab 100 mg group). Among 
the serious infections reported were TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) and opportunistic 
infections such as histoplasmosis. 
The incidence of serious infections per 100 subject-years of follow-up was 4.86 (CI: 2.59, 8.31) in 
the placebo group, 5.29 (CI: 3.93, 6.98) in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 6.65 (CI: 5.39, 8.12) 
in the golimumab 100 mg group. 
Tuberculosis in study T05 through Week 104 
Through Week 52, 3 subjects were diagnosed with TB. From Week 52 through Week 104, 
tuberculosis was reported for additionally 8 subjects. Two subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + 
MTX 
treatment group, 4 subjects in the golimumab 100 mg + MTX treatment group, and 2 subjects in 
the golimumab 100 mg + placebo treatment group were diagnosed with TB.

Injection site reaction 
Injection site reaction in study T05 through Week 52 
The proportion of subjects with an injection-site reaction to golimumab through Week 52 was 
greater among those who received golimumab (golimumab 100 mg + placebo: 15.9%; golimumab 
50 mg + MT
X: 5.7%; golimumab 100 mg + MTX: 10.6%; and all golimumab + MTX: 8.2%) than 
the proporti
on of subjects who had an injection-site reaction to placebo in the placebo + MTX 
group (1.3%). The proportion of subjects with an in
jection-site reaction to golimumab in the 
golimumab 100 mg + placebo (15.9%) group was greater than in all other golimumab + MTX 
treatment groups. Injections were generally well tolerated
. The most commonly reported reaction 
to either placebo or golimumab injections were injection site erythema. None of the injection-site 
reactions were severe, serious, or led to permanent discontinuation of study agent administration. 
Injection site reaction in study T05 through Week 104
In the C0524T05 study though Week 104, injection-site reactions to golimumab occurred in the 
following proportion of subjects: Golimumab 100 mg + placebo: 16.6%, Golimumab 50 mg + MTX: 
5.1%, Golimumab 100 mg + MTX: 8.7%, Combined Golimumab + MTX group: 7.6%. 
38 
 
 
 
 
The most commonly reported reaction was injection-site erythema. No injection-site reaction was 
severe. One subject receiving golimumab 100 mg + MTX had a serious injection-site reaction of 
erythema, and due to this AE, discontinued study agent. 
Injection site reaction in All RA Phase 3 SC studies through Week 100/104  
The proportions of subjects with injection-site reactions were higher in the golimumab 100 mg 
group (12.5%) compared with the placebo group (2.9%) and the golimumab 50 mg group (7.3%). 
The majority of the injection-site reactions were of mild intensity.  
Based on the total number of injections, 0.3% of injections in the placebo group, 0.6% of injections 
in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 1.2% of injections the golimumab 100 mg group injections 
resulted in injection-site reactions. 
Serum Sickness-like and Anaphylactic Reactions 
There were no serum sickness-like reactions or anaphylactic reactions in subjects treated with SC 
golimumab in the Phase 3 RA studies through Week 100/104. 
Hepatobiliary Adverse Events 
Hepatobiliary AEs are presented by the applicant based on the following criteria for clinically 
important hepatic AE: 
-Elevated ALT >3 x ULN associated with total bilirubin increase > 2 x ULN irrespective of the 
presence of hepatobiliary system-organ class AEs. 
- Elevated ALT >3 xULN associated with a hepatobiliary system-organ class SAE. 
Based on those criteria, through Week 100/104 in the RA Phase 3 SC studies, there were no 
subjects in the placebo group, 1 subject (0.1%) in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 2 subjects 
(0
.2%) in the golimumab 100 mg group who developed 1 or more clinically important hepatobiliary 
AEs. 
These subjects included: 
- Subject C0524T06-2205-60689 in the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group had an ALT 3 x ULN and 
bilirubin 2 x ULN. This was a subject from Chile who had elevations in liver enzymes and total 
bilirubin due to hepatitis E infection. This case was previously reported in the initial 24-Week d
ata 
submission. 
- Subject C0524T06-5805-60569 in the golimumab 100 mg + placebo group in South Korea had 
elevations in liver enzymes and an SAE of hepatitis (verbatim term was acute hepatic failure). The
subject has died, and the case was previously reported in the initial 24-Week data submission. 
- 
Subject C0524T06-1202-60043 in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX had an elevation in ALT and a 
SAE of cholelithiasis.  
Neoplasm/malignancies 
Introduction 
Increased risk for malignancies is an identified concern with the long-term use of TNF-alpha 
inhibitors.  
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To evaluate the potential impact of golimumab on the risk of malignancy, the applicant has 
analysed the incidence of lymphoma, NMSC (basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers), 
malignancies other than lymphoma and NMSC, and all malignancies in different subpopulations but 
al
so in all subjects treated with golimumab. 
Malignancies in study T05 through Week 52 
Through Week 52, a total of 4 golimumab-treated subjects were reported to have malignancies. 
For notice: the 2 malignancies reported through Week 24 are not presented in the week 
52/104 data submission and is not included in the table below.  
Malignancies were reported for 2 subjects from
 Week 24 through Week 52: 
From Week 52 through Week 104, malignancies were reported for additionally 7 subjects: 
All RA Phase 3 SC studies through Week 100/104   
In the RA Phase 3 SC studies, there were 30 golimumab-treated subjects and 6 placebo-treat
ed 
subjects with malignancies. The incidence of all malignancies per 100 subject-years of follow-up 
was 2.26 in the placebo group compared with the 1.49 in the golimumab 50 mg group and 1.12 in 
the 10
0 mg group. 
T
he incidence of lymphoma per 100 subject-years of follow-up was 0.00 (CI: 0.00, 1.12) in the 
placebo group (0 subjects
) compared with the golimumab 50 mg group (0.00; [CI: 0.00, 0.32]; 0 
subjects) and 100 mg group (0.21; [CI: 0.04, 0.61]; 3 subjects) with the 95% CIs for the 
golimumab groups fully contained within the 95% CI for the placebo group. 
The incidence of NMSC per 100 subject-years of follow up was 1.50 in the placebo group compared
with the 0.53
 in the golimumab 50 mg group and 0.49 in the 100 mg group. 
The incidence of other malignancies per 100 subject-years of follow up was 0.75 (CI: 0.09, 2.70) 
in 
the placebo group compared with the golimumab 50 mg group (0.95; [CI: 0.44, 1.81]) and 100 
mg group (0.42; [CI: 0.15, 0.91]) with the upper bound of the 95% CIs for both golimumab 
groups contained within the 95% CI for the placebo group. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects across all disease indications (excluding healthy subjects), there were 54 golimumab 
treated subjects and 9 placebo-treated subjects with malignancies. The incidence of all 
malignancies per 100 subject-years of follow-up was 1.73 in the total placebo group compared with 
1.17 in the total golimumab group. 
The incidence of lymphoma per 100 subject-years of follow-up was 0.00 (CI: 0.00, 0.57) in the 
total placebo group compared with 0.09 (CI: 0.02, 0.22; 4 subjects) in the total golimumab group. 
41 
 
 
 
The incidence of NMSC per 100 subject-years of follow up was 1.35 in the total placebo group 
compared with 0.50 in the total golimumab group. The incidence of other malignancies per 100 
subject-years of follow up was 0.38 (CI: 0.05, 1.39) in the total placebo group compared with the 
total golimumab group (0.58; [CI: 0.38, 0.85]) with the 95% CI for the total golimumab group 
fully contained within the 95% CI for the total placebo group. 
Lymphoma 
In the initial submission of study data through week 52 an increased incidence for lymphoma was 
observed.  
After the analyses for the Week 100/104 cut-off were performed, the applicant was notified of 3 
new additional cases of lymphoma in the T11 RA study (subjects previously treated with anti-tumor 
necrosis factor alpha agents). All 3 cases occurred in subjects receiving golimumab 100mg+MTX. 
Based on this new data additional analysis was performed using data cutoff date of August 2009 
which is presented below. 
Additional Analysis as of August 2009 (median follow-up of up to 3.1 years): 
In the entire golimumab clinical program, there were 8 cases of lymphoma or possible lymphoma 
reported as of August 2009. Of these 8 cases, 7 were reported in the golimumab RA studies, and 
one case was reported in the severe, persistent asthma study (C0524T03). In the Phase 2b/3 
studies in rheumatologic indications, this resulted in an incidence per 100 subject-years of follow-
u
p (95%CI) of 0.00 (0.00, 0.84) in the placebo group, 0.04 (0.00, 0.24) in the golimumab 50 mg 
g
roup, 0.18 (0.06, 0.38) in the golimumab 100 mg group, and 0.12 (0.05, 0.25) in the combined 
golimumab group, with the 95% CI for the golimumab groups fully contained within the 95% CI fo
r 
the placebo group (Table OC7-3). 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to obtain an independent assessment of the lymphoma data in the golimumab program, 
th
e Applicant consulted external experts in rheumatology, epidemiology, and oncology in the form 
of an Advisory Board meeting held in November 2009. These advisors concluded that based on the 
available data, the lymphomas seen in the golimumab studies do not suggest a pattern different 
from that seen with RA-associated lymphomas, and that a golimumab dose response in the number 
of cases of lymphoma cannot be confirmed or refuted due to multiple confounding factors. 
43 
 
 
 
 
The applicant’s rationale for this conclusion is that Lymphoma is known to occur more frequently in 
subjects with RA and other chronic inflammatory disorders, even in the absence of anti-TNF-alpha 
therapy. According to the applicant, the risk of lymphoma in RA is increased with the observed 
relative risk ranging from 2 to 23 and an odds ratio of 25.8 in patients with high inflammatory 
activity compared with those patients with low disease activity (Mikuls, 2003, Baecklund et al, 
1998). All of the 6 subjects with lymphoma in the RA golimumab program had active disease at 
baseline and long-standing RA (ranging from 4.7 to 31.4 years). Five of the 6 subjects had 
functional Class II or III at baseline indicating physical function impairment, 5 of the 6 subjects 
received concomitant MTX, and 4 of the 6 subjects had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha agents. 
Safety in subgroup of patients with severe, active, progressive disease 
In the new subset efficacy analyses presented in the response to the 2nd RSI, a greater treatment 
effect for golimumab 50 mg + MTX compared with MTX alone in the more severe disease subset of 
the study population has been observed. In order to be able to evaluate the benefit-risk in these 
subsets, additional safety analyses were performed to determine if there were clinically meaningful 
differences in the safety profile of golimumab + MTX compared with MTX alone in subjects with 
severe, active, and progressive RA. The rates of AEs, deaths, SAEs, infections, serious infections, 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, malignancies, and injection-site reactions in 
C0524T05 have been analyzed according to only one measure of baseline disease activity: subject 
screening CRP levels (<1.5 mg/dL or > 1.5 mg/dL). 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the rates of safety events in subjects based upon 
screening CRP levels. The safety profile of the C0524T05 population in a representative subset of 
more severe disease is consistent with the overall safety profile of golimumab. 
Safety in special populations 
Among the 20 pregnancies that occurred in subjects in the golimumab studies, 17 pregnancies 
occurred in subjects who were treated with golimumab or blinded study agent with the following 
outcomes: 
- 2 pregnancies ongoing 
- 7 healthy deliveries 
- 1 premature delivery at 36 weeks of gestation (twin pregnancy) 
- 6 miscarriages in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks of pregnancy), including 1 miscarriage 
whose pathology was suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, a partial molar pregnancy 
- 1 pregnancy with an unknown outcome. 
The remaining 3 pregnancies occurred in subjects in the golimumab studies who did not receive 
golimumab (randomized to placebo or conception occurred prior to the first SC study agent) with 
the following outcomes: 
- 
1 healthy delivery 
- 1 miscarriage in the first trimester 
- 1 elective abortion 
There were no congenital anomalies reported as an outcome among the pregnancies that occurred
in either study subjects or their partners through 15 May 2009. Among the subjects receiving 
golimumab or blinded study agent in the clinical studies, the first trimester miscarriage rate
 (6 out 
44 
 
 
 
of 17 pregnancies, ie, 35%) is comparable to the background incidence (7% to 52%) of 
spontaneous abortions (Wilcox et al, 1999; Speroff and Fritz, 2005). 
CHMP discussion of clinical safety 
In relation to this variation, the MAH has submitted cumulative safety data through approximatel
y 
2 years from the ongoing phase 3 studies with SC golimumab in different subsets of subjects with 
RA. Available data from other studies in rheumatologic and non-reumatologic indications has also 
been presented.  
Since the main scope of this variation is an extension of the RA indication to also
 include MTX naïve 
patients, the safety profile in RA subjects and particularly early RA is of special interest.  
The safety database for the RA Phase 3 SC studies includes 1,475 subjects of which 825 subjects 
were treated with golimumab for approximately 2 years with slightly more subjects exposed to 
golimumab 100 mg than golimumab 50 mg. The number and extent of exposure is still too limited 
to view the total picture of golimumab long term safety but will allow for an acceptable safety 
evaluation at this time point. 
In the initial application for approval, safety data through week 52 was evaluated which sho
wed 
that the short-term safety profile was in line with the safety profile of other anti-TNF agents. 
Additional 2 year data shows an overall similar pictur
e. The increased number of TB cases 
occurring during the second year, as well as the overall number of lymphoma (mainly from the 
study in subjects previously treated with another anti-TNF agent, T011; and thus in RA subjects 
with long duration of disease) are specifically noted.  
A
E occurred in over 80% of golimumab treated subjects with most common AE being infections 
and upper respiratory infection be
ing the most frequently occurring infection. Another AE which 
was more common in the golimumab groups was vascular disorder mainly driven by hypertension. 
This was assessed in depth in the initial application and, hypertension is labeled. The incidence o
f 
SAE increased with higher doses of golimumab and following 2 years occurred in 9.6% of placebo
subjects, 14
.9% of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group and 18.7% of subjects in the 
golimumab 100 mg group, wi
th similar types of SAEs occurring with similar frequencies across the 
individual RA studies. SAE included among others serious infections such as pneumonia and sepsis. 
Types and frequencies
 of AEs and SAE occurred with similar frequencies across the individual RA 
populations. Opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, histopla
smosis and legionella were only 
seen in the golimumab treated subjects and not in the placebo group. 
Serious infections were more common in the golimumab treatment groups as compare
d to the 
placebo group and increased with higher golimumab doses. The percentage of subjects with serious 
infections in the golimumab 100 mg+MTX g
roup stayed on a similar level (approximately 7%) over 
time and was comparable in the different RA populations. 
There are a number of additional TB observed during the second treatment year. This was 
considered somewhat sur
prising since screening for TB and subsequent treatment of positive cases 
were performed prior to study start.
 The applicant was asked to clarify whether these subjects 
were new TB cases or cases with latent TB already identified at treated at study start. In addition, 
a discussion whether there is a need 
for additional risk minimisation activities was requested. In 
the response to the 1
st RSI, the MAH sufficiently clarified the baseline history and the 
circumstances around the detection of new TB cases. It seems that the majority of the cases are 
most likely newly acquired, based on negative screening tests. The Applicant’s proposal to add 
further details to the educational plan addressing monitoring for TB during treatment is endors
ed 
by the CHMP and the issue is considered resolved.

During the placebo controlled phase there was a higher incidence of injection site reaction
associated with golimumab than with placebo. However, for the major
ity of cases were the reaction 
was mil
d. This pattern was consistent over time with the majority of reactions of mild intensity. 
As expected given longer time of follow up,
 the number of deaths has increased since the latest 
data cut-off, from a total of 13 subjects to a 
total of 22 subjects (21 subjects treated with 
golimumab and 1 subject treated with placebo) in all golimumab studies. Of those 22 deaths, 13 
deaths occurred in the combined RA phase III studies (8 subjects in T05, 4 subjects in T06 and 1 
subject in T11). In the 2 year data there appears to be an increase in the number of deaths in the 
highest golimumab
 (100 mg+MTX) dose group, compared with the other dose groups. The 
reported causes of deaths were: malignancies, sepsis or septic shock, hypoglycemic coma resulting 
from suicide by insulin self-injection, tramadol overdose, cardiac arrest secondary to intracerebral 
hemorrhage, respiratory distress, circulatory insufficiency, fulminant hepatic failure and unk
nown 
causes. During the controlled part of T05, there were three deaths for golimumab and none with 
MTX. 
The potential risk for malignancy is a well known concern associated with the use of TNF-alpha 
inhibitors. In the placebo controlled phases of the rheumatologic studies, there was an increase
d 
incidence of lymphoma in goli
mumab treated subjects (0.0 [0.00, 1.25] for placebo and 0.29 
[0.04, 1.05] for golimumab), while the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers (1.25 [0.26, 3.66
] 
for placebo and 0.58 [0.16, 1.49] for golimumab) and other malignancies (0.83 [0.10, 3.00] f
or 
placebo and 0.44 [0.09, 1.28] for golimumab) was increased in the placebo groups. Howev
er, the 
numbers are overall small, and it is therefore difficult to draw a definitive conclusion. Additional 52 
weeks and 104 week data shows a similar picture. With respect to lymphoma, in the entire 
golimumab clinical program, there were 7 cases of lym
phoma or possible lymphoma reported as of 
August 2009. Of these 7 cases, 6 were reported in the golimumab RA studies (1 in C0524T05, 1 i
n 
C0524T06, and 4 in C0524T11), and 1 case was reported in the severe, persistent asthma study 
(C0524T03). For study T05, no table has been found that summarizes all the reported malignancies 
in the different treatment arms, in relation to total subject-years of follow-up, during the placebo 
controlled part of study T05. 
Although lymphoma is known to occur more frequently in subjects with RA and other chron
ic 
inflammatory disorders, the more frequent occurrence of lymphoma in RA subjects exposed to 
golimumab 100 mg and in subjects previously exposed to TNF blockers is of concern. In the 
response, the MAH has submitted more details regarding malignancies/lymphoma in the studies 
with golimumab. The previous picture remains, including that the lymphoma incidences appear 
increased to some extent. One more case has been identified in the upd
ated data, which contains 
more extensive duration of exposure. One additional fatal case (in total 2) has occurred. In the 
SPC, section 4.8, Neoplasms (such as skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanocytic 
naevus); Lymphoma and leukaemia’ are labelled. There are also class warnings related to 
malignancy/lymphoma included in section 4.4 of the SPC. These events are also followed via PSUR 
and the RMP; therefore, the CHMP considers this issue sati
sfactorily addressed. 
To conclude, the safety profile of golimumab is comparable with that already well established for 
anti-TNF agents. The MAH’s conclusion regarding safety is endorsed. There does not appear to be 
any meaningful difference with respect to safety based upon CRP screening levels (>1.5 mg/dL or 
<1.5 mg/dL).  
Risk Management Plan 
A revised version of the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted (v.3.0, dated 24 February
2010) with this variation application in which the ph
armacovigilance and risk minimization plans 
have been updated to include analyses of the cumulative clinical trial safety through approximately 
46 
 
 
 
2 years (Week 100/104) from the ongoing Phase 3 studies with subcutaneous (SC) and ava
ilable 
data from other studies in rheumatologic and non-rheumatologic indications through the end of 
those studies or recently completed data base locks (DBLs). The Applicant stated that the data d
o 
not require a safety update of the PI texts. 
As per EMA guidance, Annex 1 (the interface between EU-RMP and EudraVigilance) will be p
rovided 
separately in electronic format. As per the signed Letter of Undertaking, dated 15 February 2010, 
the Applicant addressed paediatric malignancy, leukaemia and psoriasis (new onset or worsening o
f 
pre-existing) in the new revised risk management plan as appropriate.  
It was noted that during the assessment procedure of variation II/08, the MAH has submitted RMP 
version 3.1 (dated 25 May 2010) together with PSUR 2. The conclusion of the assessment of this 
RMP, which supersedes version 3.0, was adopted by CHMP on 19 August 2010. 
CHMP disc
ussion 
The summary of changes to the RMP has been reviewed and the revisions to the safety 
specification such as inclusion of additional data from both post marketing experience and clinical
trials, updates of frequency of occurrence, and updates of MedDRA PTs used in database searches 
have been noted.  Revisions to the pharmacovigilance plan include status updates of the ongoing 
studies and other minor editorial changes.  Revisions to the risk minimisation plan include 
inclusions of warnings in the SPC related to leukemia and paediatric malignancies  which were 
included in variation II/003 submitted in December 2009. No additional risk minimisation measures 
have been noted to be required. 
OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment 
The applicant has evaluated short-term 
and long-term efficacy in MTX naïve RA patients in study 
C0524T05 using several clinically validated efficacy endpoints (ACR response, HAQ, DAS 28). 
Although the results for the complete study population, particularly at week 52, were questioned
, 
additional subgroup analyses focussed on the target population (severe, active, progressive 
disease) are sufficiently convincing to support a clinically meaningful effect of golimumab 50 mg +
MTX in the applied for indication. 
Two years radiographic data from study T05 have been submitted in support of the indication of 
early RA. These data continue to show a positive effect on progression of structural damage. Thus, 
there is sufficient data to support a general claim for reduction of progression of structural damage.  
Overall the safety profile of golimumab, based on at least 2 years of safety follow up in the ongoing 
clinical studies is in line with the well known safety profile of anti-TNF agents. Ta
ken together, the 
benefit/risk ratio for the extended indication is considered to be positive. 
The following indication is therefore agreed for section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: 
- 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the 
response to disease
-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has 
been inadequate. 
- 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not 
previously treated with MTX. 
47 
 
 
 
 
Simponi, in combination with MTX, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint
damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

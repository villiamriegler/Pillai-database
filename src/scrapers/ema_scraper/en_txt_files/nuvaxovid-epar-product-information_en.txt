CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 12 years of age and older. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Primary vaccination series 
Individuals 12 years of age and older 
Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. It is recommended 
to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose (see section 5.1). 
Interchangeability 
There are no data available on the interchangeability of Nuvaxovid with other COVID-19 vaccines to 
complete the primary vaccination course. Individuals who have received a first dose of Nuvaxovid 
should receive the second dose of Nuvaxovid to complete the vaccination course.

Booster dose 
Booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older 
A booster dose of Nuvaxovid (0.5 mL) may be administered intramuscularly approximately 3 months 
after the primary series of Nuvaxovid in individuals 12 years of age and older (homologous booster 
dose). 
Nuvaxovid may also be given as a booster dose in individuals 18 years of age and older following a 
primary series comprised of an mRNA vaccine or adenoviral vector vaccine (heterologous booster 
dose). The dosing interval for the heterologous booster dose is the same as that authorised for a 
booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Nuvaxovid in children aged less than 12 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Nuvaxovid is for intramuscular injection only, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally. 
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with Nuvaxovid. Appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the 
administration of the vaccine. 
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. An additional dose 
of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to a prior dose of 
Nuvaxovid. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Nuvaxovid. 
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. (see section 4.8).  
Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not 
different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation, or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the vaccine has been assessed in a limited number of 
immunocompromised individuals. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid may be lower in immunosuppressed 
individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, 
vaccination with Nuvaxovid may not protect all vaccine recipients. 
Excipients 
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
‘potassium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Co-administration of Nuvaxovid with inactivated influenza vaccines has been evaluated in a limited 
number of participants in an exploratory clinical trial sub-study, see section 4.8 and section 5.1. 
The binding antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was lower when Nuvaxovid was given concomitantly 
with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
Concomitant administration of Nuvaxovid with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited experience with use of Nuvaxovid in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or 
post-natal development, see section 5.3. 
Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits 
outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-
feeding woman to Nuvaxovid is negligible. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, 
see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nuvaxovid has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile after primary series 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
The safety of Nuvaxovid was evaluated from an interim analysis of pooled data from 5 ongoing 
clinical trials conducted in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and 
Mexico. At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants aged 18 years and older received at 
least one dose of the two-dose primary series of Nuvaxovid (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892). At the 
time of vaccination, the median age was 48 years (range 18 to 95 years). The median duration of 
follow-up was 70 days post-Dose 2, with 32,993 (66%) participants completing more than 2 months 
follow-up post-Dose 2. 
Of the pooled reactogenicity data, which includes participants aged 18 years and older enrolled in the 
two phase 3 studies who received any dose of Nuvaxovid (n=20,055) or placebo (n=10,561), the most 
frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (75%), injection site pain (62%), fatigue 
(53%), myalgia (51%), headache (50%), malaise (41%), arthralgia (24%), and nausea or vomiting 
(15%). Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than or equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following 
vaccination. 
Overall, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of 
injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, and 
nausea or vomiting was higher in adults aged 18 to less than 65 years than in those aged 65 years and 
above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were co-administered to participants on the same day 
as Dose 1 of Nuvaxovid (n=217) or placebo (n=214) in the opposite deltoid muscle of the arm in 431 
participants enrolled in an exploratory Phase 3 (2019nCoV-302) sub-study. The frequency of local and 
systemic adverse reactions in the influenza sub-study population was higher than in the main study 
population following Dose 1 in both Nuvaxovid and placebo recipients. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The safety of Nuvaxovid in adolescents was evaluated in an interim analysis of the paediatric 
expansion portion of an ongoing Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-
controlled study (Study 2019nCoV-301). Safety data were collected in 2,232 participants 12 through 
17 years of age, with and without evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, in United States who 
received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid (n=1,487) or placebo (n=745). Demographic characteristics 
were similar among participants who received Nuvaxovid and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (71%), injection site pain (67%), 
headache (63%), myalgia (57%), fatigue (54%), malaise (43%), nausea or vomiting (23%), arthralgia 
(19%) and pyrexia (17%). Fever was observed more frequently in adolescents aged 12 through to 17 
years compared to adults, with the frequency being very common after the second dose in adolescents. 
Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less than or 
equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following 
vaccination. 
Summary of the safety profile after booster dose 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
In an independent study (CoV-BOOST study, EudraCT 2021-002175-19) evaluating the use of a 
Nuvaxovid booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with an authorised 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine, no new safety concerns were 
identified.  
The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3, 
multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study (Study 2019nCoV-301). Overall, 
12,777 participants received a booster dose of the vaccine at least 6 months after the two-dose primary 
series (median of 11 months between completion of primary series and booster dose). Of the 12,777 
participants who received a booster dose, 39 participants did not receive Nuvaxovid for all three doses. 
The safety analyses included evaluation of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days 
after a booster dose for participants who completed the electronic diary (n=10,137).  
The most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (73%), injection site pain 
(61%), fatigue (52%), muscle pain (51.%), headache (45.%), malaise (40%), and joint pain (26.%). 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The safety of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an interim analysis of an ongoing Phase 
3 study (Study 2019nCoV-301). A total of 1,499 participants received a booster dose approximately 
9 months after receiving Dose 2 of the primary series. A subset of 220 participants who received the 
booster dose were evaluated for solicited adverse reactions within 7 days after the booster dose (Ad 
Hoc Booster Safety Analysis Set), of whom 190 completed the electronic diary.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Solicited adverse reactions occurred at higher frequencies and with higher grade in adolescents 
compared to adults. The most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection site tenderness 
(72%), headache (68%), fatigue (66%), injection site pain (64%), muscle pain (62%), malaise (47%), 
and nausea/vomiting (26%) with a median duration of 1 to 2 days following vaccination. No new 
safety concerns from the time of the booster dose administration through 28 days after administration 
were noted among participants.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Throughout the clinical trials, an increased incidence of hypertension following vaccination with 
Nuvaxovid (n=46, 1.0%) as compared to placebo (n=22, 0.6%) was observed in older adults during 
the 3 days following vaccination. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available.  
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported. In the event of an overdose, monitoring of vital functions and 
possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, protein subunit, ATC code: J07BN04 
Mechanism of action 
Nuvaxovid is composed of purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein that is 
stabilised in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant 
facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S 
protein-specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-cell immune 
responses to the S protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection 
against COVID-19. 
Clinical efficacy 
Primary series 
The clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nuvaxovid is being evaluated in two pivotal, 
placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, Study 1 (2019nCoV-301) conducted in North America and 
Study 2 (2019nCoV-302) conducted in the United Kingdom, and a Phase 2a/b study, Study 3, 
conducted in South Africa. 
Study 1 (2019nCoV-301)  
Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study 
with an adult main study conducted in participants 18 years of age and older in the United States and 
Mexico, and a paediatric expansion occurring in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the United 
States. 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
Upon enrolment in the adult main study, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and ≥ 65 
years) and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded participants 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; had active cancer on 
chemotherapy; received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-
derived products within 90 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; or had a history of laboratory-
confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable underlying comorbidity were 
included as were participants with well-controlled HIV infection. 
Enrolment of adults completed in February 2021. Participants will be followed for up to 24 months 
after the second dose for assessments of safety, and efficacy against COVID-19. Following collection 
of sufficient safety data to support application for emergency use authorisation, initial recipients of 
placebo were invited to receive two injections of Nuvaxovid 21 days apart and initial recipients of 
Nuvaxovid to receive two injections of placebo 21 days apart (“blinded crossover”). All participants 
were offered the opportunity to continue to be followed in the study. 
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Efficacy [PP-EFF] analysis 
set) included 25,452 participants who received either Nuvaxovid (n = 17,312) or placebo (n = 8,140), 
received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at day 21, median 21 days [IQR 21-23], range 14-60), 
did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection through 7 days after the second dose. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and those who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who received 
Nuvaxovid, the median age was 47 years (range: 18 to 95 years); 88% (n = 15,264) were 18 to 
64 years old and 12% (n = 2,048) were aged 65 and older; 48% were female; 94% were from the 
United States and 6% were from Mexico; 76% were White, 11% were Black or African American, 6% 
were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, and 4% were Asian; 22% 
were Hispanic or Latino. At least one pre-existing comorbidity or lifestyle characteristic associated 
with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 was present in 16,493 (95%) participants. Comorbidities 
included: obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2); chronic lung disease; diabetes mellitus type 2, 
cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other high-
risk characteristics included age ≥65 years (with or without comorbidities) or age <65 years with 
comorbidities and/or living or working conditions involving known frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-
2 or to densely populated circumstances. 
COVID-19 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) through a central laboratory. 
Vaccine efficacy is presented in Table 2.

Vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid to prevent the onset of COVID-19 from seven days after Dose 2 was 
90.4% (95% CI 82.9,94.6). No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 17,312 Nuvaxovid 
participants compared with 4 cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 8,140 placebo recipients in the 
PP-EFF analysis set. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates for male 
and female participants and racial groups, and across participants with medical comorbidities 
associated with high risk of severe COVID-19. There were no meaningful differences in overall 
vaccine efficacy in participants who were at increased risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 
or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g., BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic lung 
disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). 
Efficacy results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when strains classified as  
Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest were predominantly circulating in the two countries (US 
and Mexico) where the study was conducted. Sequencing data were available for 61 of the 77 endpoint 
cases (79%). Of these, 48 out of 61 (79%) were identified as Variants of Concern or Variants of 
Interest. The most common Variants of Concern identified were Alpha with 31/61 cases (51%), Beta 
(2/61, 4%) and Gamma (2/61, 4%), while the most common Variants of Interest were Iota with 8/61 
cases (13%), and Epsilon (3/61, 5%). 
Efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The assessment of efficacy and immunogenicity of Nuvaxovid in adolescent participants 12 through 
17 years of age occurred in the United States in the ongoing paediatric expansion portion of the Phase 
3 multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled 2019nCoV-301 study. A total of 
1,799 participants, assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of Nuvaxovid (n=1,205) or placebo 
(n=594) by intramuscular injection 21 days apart, represented the Per Protocol Efficacy population. 
Participants with confirmed infection or prior infection due to SARSCoV-2 at the time of 
randomisation were not included in the primary efficacy analysis.  
Enrolment of adolescents completed in June 2021. Participants were followed for up to 24 months 
after the second dose for assessments of safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity against COVID-19. 
Following a 60-day safety follow-up period, initial adolescent recipients of placebo were invited to 
receive two injections of Nuvaxovid 21 days apart and initial recipients of Nuvaxovid to receive two 
injections of placebo 21 days apart (“blinded crossover”). All participants were offered the opportunity 
to continue to be followed in the study.  
COVID-19 was defined as first episode of PCR-confirmed mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with 
at least one or more of the predefined symptoms within each severity category. Mild COVID-19 was 
defined as fever, new onset cough or at least 2 or more additional COVID-19 symptoms.  
There were 20 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild COVID-19 (Nuvaxovid, n=6 [0.5%]; 
placebo, n=14 [2.4%]) resulting in a point estimate of efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI: 46.8%, 92.1%).  
At the time of this analysis, the Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages) variant of concern (VOC) was the 
predominant variant circulating in the US and accounted for all cases from which sequence data are 
available (11/20, 55%).  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age  
An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 14 days after Dose 2 (Day 35) was 
conducted in adolescent participants seronegative to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and PCR-
negative at baseline. Neutralising antibody responses were compared with those observed in 
seronegative/PCR-negative adult participants aged 18 through 25 years from the adult main study (Per 
Protocol Immunogenicity (PP-IMM) Analysis Set) as shown in Table 3. Noninferiority required that 
the following three criteria were met: lower bound of two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of geometric 
mean titers (GMTs) (GMT 12 through 17 years/GMT 18 through 25 years) > 0.67; point estimate of 
the ratio of GMTs ≥ 0.82; and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for difference of 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seroconversion rates (SCRs) (SCR 12 through 17 years minus SCR 18 through 25 years) > -10%.

Study 2 (2019nCoV-302)  
Study 2 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 
participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified 
by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded 
participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; current 
diagnosis or treatment for cancer; autoimmune disease/condition; received chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; 
bleeding disorder or continuous use of anticoagulants; history of allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis; 
were pregnant; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with 
clinically stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or 
hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 4 weeks before enrolment were included. Participants 
with known stable infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) were not 
excluded from enrolment. 
Enrolment was completed in November 2020. Participants were followed for up to 12 months after the 
primary vaccination series for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 14,039 participants who received either 
Nuvaxovid (n=7,020) or placebo (n=7,019), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at median 
21 days (IQR 21-23), range 16-45, did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not 
have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid, median age was 56.0 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 72% (n=5,067) were 18 to 
64 years old and 28% (n=1,953) were aged 65 to 84; 49% were female; 94% were White; 3% were

These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant 
was circulating in the UK. Identification of the Alpha variant was based on S gene target failure by 
PCR. Data were available for 95 of the 106 endpoint cases (90%). Of these, 66 out of 95 (69%) were 
identified as the Alpha variant with the other cases classified as non-Alpha. 
No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 7,020 Nuvaxovid participants compared with 4 
cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 7,019 placebo recipients in the PP-EFF analysis set. 
Licensed seasonal influenza vaccine co-administration sub-study 
Overall, 431 participants were co-vaccinated with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines; 217 sub-
study participants received Nuvaxovid and 214 received placebo. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and participants who 
received placebo. In the per-protocol immunogenicity (PP-IMM) analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid (n=191), median age was 40 years (range: 22 to 70 years); 93% (n=178) were 18 
to 64 years old and 7% (n=13) were aged 65 to 84; 43% were female; 75% were White; 23% were 
multiracial or from ethnic minorities; and 27% had at least one comorbid condition. Co-administration 
resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by hemagglutination 
inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to Nuvaxovid was noted as assessed by 
an anti-spike IgG assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did not receive 
concomitant influenza vaccine (see section 4.5 and section 4.8).  
Study 3 (2019nCoV-501) 
Study 3 was a  Phase 2a/b, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 
HIV-negative participants 18 to 84 years of age and people living with HIV (PLWH) 18 to 64 years of 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
age in South Africa. PLWH were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), receiving highly 
active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV-1 viral load of < 1000 copies/mL. 
Enrolment was completed in November 2020. 
The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 2,770 participants who received either 
Nuvaxovid (n=1,408) or placebo (n=1,362), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 on day 21), 
did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection through 7 days after the second dose. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid, median age was 28 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 40% were female; 91% were 
Black/African American; 2% were White; 3% were multiple races, 1% were Asian; and 2% were 
Hispanic or Latino; and 5.5% were HIV-positive. 
A total of 147 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases among all adult participants, 
seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, were accrued for the complete analysis (PP-EFF Analysis 
Set) of the primary efficacy endpoint, with 51 (3.62%) cases for Nuvaxovid versus 96 (7.05%) cases 
for placebo. The resultant vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). 
These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.351 (Beta) variant 
was circulating in South Africa.  
Booster dose 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older  
Study 2019nCoV-101, Part 2 
The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 
randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study administered as a single booster dose 
(Study 2019nCoV-101, Part 2) in healthy adult participants aged 18 to 84 years of age who were 
seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. A total of 254 participants (Full Analysis Set) received two 
doses of Nuvaxovid (0.5 mL, 5 micrograms 3 weeks apart) as the primary vaccination series. A subset 
of 104 participants received a booster dose of Nuvaxovid approximately 6 months after receiving 
Dose 2 of the primary series. A single booster dose of Nuvaxovid induced an. approximate 96-fold 
increase in neutralising antibodies from a GMT of 63 pre-booster (Day 189) to a GMT of 6,023 post-
booster (Day 217) and an approximate 4.1-fold increase from a peak GMT (14 days post-Dose 2) of 
1,470. 
Study 2019nCoV-501 
In Study 3, a Phase 2a/b randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study, the safety and 
immunogenicity of booster dose was evaluated in healthy HIV-negative adult participants 18 to 
84 years of age and medically stable PLWH 18 to 64 years of age who were seronegative to SARS-
CoV-2 at baseline. A total of 1,173 participants (PP-IMM Analysis Set) received a booster dose of 
Nuvaxovid approximately 6 months after completion of the primary series of Nuvaxovid (Day 201). 
An approximate 52-fold increase in neutralising antibodies was shown from a GMT of 69 pre-booster 
(Day 201) to a GMT of 3,600 post-booster (Day 236) and an approximate 5.2-fold increase from a 
peak GMT (14 days post-Dose 2) of 694. 
Safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines given as booster doses following completion of a 
primary vaccination series with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated in an 
independent study in the UK.  
The independent, multicentre, randomised, controlled, Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (CoV-
BOOST, EudraCT 2021-002175-19) investigated the immunogenicity of a booster in adults aged 30 
years and older with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nuvaxovid was 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
administered at least 70 days after completion of a ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) primary 
vaccination series or at least 84 days after completion of a BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) primary 
vaccination series. Neutralising antibody titers measured by a wild-type assay were assessed 28 days 
post-booster dose. Within the group assigned to receive Nuvaxovid, 115 participants received a two-
dose primary series of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and 114 participants received a two-dose primary series of 
BNT162b2, prior to receiving a single booster dose (0.5 mL) of Nuvaxovid. Nuvaxovid demonstrated 
a booster response regardless of the vaccine used for primary vaccination.  
Booster dose in Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The effectiveness of booster doses of Nuvaxovid in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age is inferred 
from data gathered for booster doses of the vaccine in adults in studies 2019nCoV-101 and 2019nCoV-
501, as Nuvaxovid has been shown to induce a comparable immune response and effectiveness after 
the primary series in adolescents as in adults, and the ability to boost the vaccine-induced immune 
response was shown in adults.  
Elderly population 
Nuvaxovid was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid was 
consistent between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger individuals (18 to 64 years) for the primary series. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Nuvaxovid in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19, see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat-dose 
toxicity, local tolerance and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
In vitro genotoxicity studies were conducted with the Matrix-M adjuvant. The adjuvant was shown to 
be non-genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed. Carcinogenicity is not expected. 
Reproductive toxicity 
A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rats administered four 
intramuscular doses (two prior to mating; two during gestation) of 5 micrograms SARS-CoV-2 rS 
protein (approximately 200-fold excess relative to the human dose of 5 micrograms on a weight-
adjusted basis) with 10 micrograms Matrix-M adjuvant (approximately 40-fold excess relative to the 
human dose of 50 micrograms on a weight-adjusted basis). No vaccine-related adverse effects on 
fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring through post-natal 
Day 21 were observed.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-
CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is administered intramuscularly as a single dose (0.5 mL) for individuals 12 years 
of age and older regardless of previous vaccination status.  
For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 
should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Immunocompromised individuals 
Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in 
accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 in children aged less than 12 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is for intramuscular injection only, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper 
arm. 
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally. 
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with Nuvaxovid. Appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the 
administration of the vaccine. 
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. An additional dose 
of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to a prior dose of 
Nuvaxovid. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis  
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Nuvaxovid. 
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. (see section 4.8).  
Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not 
different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention 
if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.  
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation, or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the vaccine has been assessed in a limited number of 
immunocompromised individuals. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 may be lower in 
immunosuppressed individuals. 
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, 
vaccination with Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. 
Excipients 
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Co-administration of Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) with inactivated influenza vaccines has been 
evaluated in a limited number of participants in an exploratory clinical trial sub-study, see section 4.8 
and section 5.1. 
The binding antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was lower when Nuvaxovid was given concomitantly 
with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited experience with use of Nuvaxovid in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or 
post-natal development, see section 5.3. 
Administration of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential 
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is excreted in human milk. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-
feeding woman to Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is negligible. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, 
see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, 
some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use 
machines.

Summary of the safety profile after primary series 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
The safety of Nuvaxovid was evaluated from an interim analysis of pooled data from 5 ongoing 
clinical trials conducted in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and 
Mexico. At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants aged 18 years and older received at 
least one dose of the two-dose primary series of Nuvaxovid (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892). At the 
time of vaccination, the median age was 48 years (range 18 to 95 years). The median duration of 
follow-up was 70 days post-Dose 2, with 32,993 (66%) participants completing more than 2 months 
follow-up post-Dose 2. 
Of the pooled reactogenicity data, which includes participants aged 18 years and older enrolled in the 
two phase 3 studies who received any dose of Nuvaxovid (n=20,055) or placebo (n=10,561), the most 
frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (75%), injection site pain (62%), fatigue 
(53%), myalgia (51%), headache (50%), malaise (41%), arthralgia (24%), and nausea or vomiting 
(15%). Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less 
than or equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following 
vaccination. 
Overall, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of 
injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, and 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nausea or vomiting was higher in adults aged 18 to less than 65 years than in those aged 65 years and 
above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were co-administered to participants on the same day 
as Dose 1 of Nuvaxovid (n=217) or placebo (n=214) in the opposite deltoid muscle of the arm in 431 
participants enrolled in an exploratory Phase 3 (2019nCoV-302) sub-study. The frequency of local and 
systemic adverse reactions in the influenza sub-study population was higher than in the main study 
population following Dose 1 in both Nuvaxovid and placebo recipients. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The safety of Nuvaxovid in adolescents was evaluated in an interim analysis of the paediatric 
expansion portion of an ongoing Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-
controlled study (Study 2019nCoV-301). Safety data were collected in 2,232 participants 12 through 
17 years of age, with and without evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, in United States who 
received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid (n=1,487) or placebo (n=745). Demographic characteristics 
were similar among participants who received Nuvaxovid and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (71%), injection site pain (67%), 
headache (63%), myalgia (57%), fatigue (54%), malaise (43%), nausea or vomiting (23%), arthralgia 
(19%) and pyrexia (17%). Fever was observed more frequently in adolescents aged 12 through to 17 
years compared to adults, with the frequency being very common after the second dose in adolescents. 
Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less than or 
equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following 
vaccination. 
Summary of the safety profile after booster dose 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
In an independent study (CoV-BOOST study, EudraCT 2021-002175-19) evaluating the use of a 
Nuvaxovid booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with an authorised 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine, no new safety concerns were 
identified.  
The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3, 
multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study (Study 2019nCoV-301). Overall, 
12,777 participants received a booster dose of the vaccine at least 6 months after the two-dose primary 
series (median of 11 months between completion of primary series and booster dose). Of the 12,777 
participants who received a booster dose, 39 participants did not receive Nuvaxovid for all three doses. 
The safety analyses included evaluation of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days 
after a booster dose for participants who completed the electronic diary (n=10,137).  
The most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (73%), injection site pain 
(61%), fatigue (52%), muscle pain (51.%), headache (45.%), malaise (40%), and joint pain (26.%). 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The safety of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an interim analysis of an ongoing Phase 
3 study (Study 2019nCoV-301). A total of 1,499 participants received a booster dose approximately 
9 months after receiving Dose 2 of the primary series. A subset of 220 participants who received the 
booster dose were evaluated for solicited adverse reactions within 7 days after the booster dose (Ad 
Hoc Booster Safety Analysis Set), of whom 190 completed the electronic diary.  
Solicited adverse reactions occurred at higher frequencies and with higher grade in adolescents 
compared to adults. The most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection site tenderness 
(72%), headache (68%), fatigue (66%), injection site pain (64%), muscle pain (62%), malaise (47%), 
and nausea/vomiting (26%) with a median duration of 1 to 2 days following vaccination. No new 
safety concerns from the time of the booster dose administration through 28 days after administration 
were noted among participants.

Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 (Omicron-adapted Nuvaxovid) 
The safety of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is inferred from the safety data of the Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan 
strain) vaccine and the safety data from the adapted Omicron BA.5 vaccine. 
A booster dose of the Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 and bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 
vaccines were evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 study in participants 18 years of age and older 
(2019nCoV-311 Part 2). In this study, 251 participants received a Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) 
booster dose, 254 received a monovalent Omicron BA.5 booster dose, and 259 participants received a 
Nuvaxovid bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 booster dose. Median follow-up time since the initial 
booster vaccination was 48 days through the data cutoff date of 31 May 2023.  
The overall safety profile for the Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 booster doses was 
similar to that seen after the Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) booster dose. The most 
frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (> 50%), injection site pain (> 30%), 
fatigue (> 30%), headache (> 20%), myalgia (> 20%), and malaise (> 10%). No new adverse 
reactions were identified for the Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 booster doses. In 
2019nCoV-311 Part 2 the frequency of local as well as systemic reactogenicity events was  
greater in women than in men, for all the vaccine constructs that were tested.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Throughout the clinical trials, an increased incidence of hypertension following vaccination with 
Nuvaxovid (n=46, 1.0%) as compared to placebo (n=22, 0.6%) was observed in older adults during 
the 3 days following vaccination. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available.  
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported. In the event of an overdose, monitoring of vital functions and 
possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, protein subunit, ATC code: J07BN04 
Mechanism of action 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is composed of purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.5 recombinant 
spike (S) protein that is stabilised in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin-based 
Matrix-M adjuvant facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the 
magnitude of the S protein-specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-
cell immune responses to the S protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to 
protection against COVID-19.

Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 (Omicron-adapted Nuvaxovid)  
The efficacy of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is inferred from the efficacy data of the Nuvaxovid (Original, 
Wuhan strain) vaccine and immunogenicity data from the adapted vaccine of the Omicron BA.5 strain. 
In study 2019nCoV-311 Part 2, a total of 694 participants 18 years of age and older, who were 
evaluated for immunogenicity and previously received 3 or more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received 1 of the following as a booster dose: 
Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain), Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 vaccine or Nuvaxovid 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 vaccine. The booster doses were administered a median of 11 – 13 
months after the last vaccination, respectively. GMRs and seroresponse rates were evaluated at 1 
month after vaccination. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority with respect to level of pseudovirus 
neutralizing antibody titer (ID50) and non-inferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti-
Omicron BA.5 immune response induced by a dose of the Nuvaxovid bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 
vaccine relative to the response elicited by a dose of Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain), and to 
assess non-inferiority with respect to level of ID50 for the original SAR-CoV-2 strain for the 
Nuvaxovid bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 vaccine compared to Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan 
strain). 
Superiority of the anti-Omicron BA.5 ID50 for the Nuvaxovid bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 vaccine 
relative to Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) was demonstrated, as the lower bound of the two-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) for GMR was >1. Non-inferiority of the anti-Original ID50 for the 
Nuvaxovid bivalent Original/Omicron BA.5 vaccine  relative to Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) 
was met, as the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67.  
Non-inferiority of the seroresponse rate to the Omicron BA.5 variant for the Nuvaxovid bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.5 vaccine relative to Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) was met, as the lower 
limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse was 
>-5%. For more details see Table 2. 
Exploratory immunogenicity analyses included an assessment of the ID50 GMT ratio and difference in 
seroresponse rates for the Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 vaccine compared to Nuvaxovid 
(Original, Wuhan strain). The GMT ratio following the booster dose with Nuvaxovid monovalent 
Omicron BA.5 vaccine compared with the booster dose of Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) was 
2.5 (two-sided 95% CIs: 2.10, 2.94). The difference in seroresponse rates between the booster dose 
with Nuvaxovid monovalent Omicron BA.5 vaccine and the booster dose with Nuvaxovid (Original, 
Wuhan strain) was 33.2% (two-sided 95% CIs: 25.4%, 40.7%). While not formally assessed, these 
responses would have met the three success criteria for the study.

1 Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to booster vaccination. 
2 The 95% CI for GMT and GMFR were calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-transformed values then back 
transformed to the original scale for presentation. 
3 An ANCOVA with vaccine group and age group (18-54, ≥ 55 years) as fixed effects and baseline value (Day 0) as covariate 
was performed that included all vaccine groups to estimate the adjusted GMT for all vaccine groups. Each pairwise compar-
ison included the data from two groups only to estimate the adjusted GMTR between the two vaccine groups. The mean 
difference between vaccine groups and the corresponding CI limits was then exponentiated to obtain the ratio of ID50 GMTs 
and the corresponding 95% CIs. 
4 The SRR was defined as percentage of participants at each post vaccination visit with a titer ≥ 4-fold rise in ID50 level from 
baseline if the baseline value is equal or above LLOQ or ≥ 4-fold times the LLOQ if the baseline value is below the LLOQ 
and calculated based on n2 as the denominator. 
5 The 95% CI for SRR was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.  
6 95% CI for the difference in SRR was calculated based on the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Nuvaxovid (Original, Wuhan strain) 
Clinical efficacy 
Primary series 
The clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nuvaxovid is being evaluated in two pivotal, 
placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, Study 1 (2019nCoV-301) conducted in North America and 
Study 2 (2019nCoV-302) conducted in the United Kingdom, and a Phase 2a/b study, Study 3, 
conducted in South Africa. 
Study 1 (2019nCoV-301)  
Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study 
with an adult main study conducted in participants 18 years of age and older in the United States and 
Mexico, and a paediatric expansion occurring in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the United 
States. 
Participants 18 years of age and older  
Upon enrolment in the adult main study, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and ≥ 65 
years) and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded participants 
who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; had active cancer on 
chemotherapy; received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-
derived products within 90 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; or had a history of laboratory-
confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable underlying comorbidity were 
included as were participants with well-controlled HIV infection. 
Enrolment of adults completed in February 2021. Participants will be followed for up to 24 months 
after the second dose for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. Following collection 
of sufficient safety data to support application for emergency use authorisation, initial recipients of 
placebo were invited to receive two injections of Nuvaxovid 21 days apart and initial recipients of 
Nuvaxovid to receive two injections of placebo 21 days apart (“blinded crossover”). All participants 
were offered the opportunity to continue to be followed in the study. 
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Efficacy [PP-EFF] analysis 
set) included 25,452 participants who received either Nuvaxovid (n = 17,312) or placebo (n = 8,140), 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at day 21, median 21 days [IQR 21-23], range 14-60), 
did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection through 7 days after the second dose. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and those who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who received 
Nuvaxovid, the median age was 47 years (range: 18 to 95 years); 88% (n = 15,264) were 18 to 
64 years old and 12% (n = 2,048) were aged 65 and older; 48% were female; 94% were from the 
United States and 6% were from Mexico; 76% were White, 11% were Black or African American, 6% 
were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, and 4% were Asian; 22% 
were Hispanic or Latino. At least one pre-existing comorbidity or lifestyle characteristic associated 
with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 was present in 16,493 (95%) participants. Comorbidities 
included: obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2); chronic lung disease; diabetes mellitus type 2, 
cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other high-
risk characteristics included age ≥65 years (with or without comorbidities) or age <65 years with 
comorbidities and/or living or working conditions involving known frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-
2 or to densely populated circumstances. 
COVID-19 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) through a central laboratory. 
Vaccine efficacy is presented in Table 3.

4 Met primary efficacy endpoint criterion for success with a lower bound confidence interval (LBCI) > 30%. at the planned 
primary confirmatory analysis 
Vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid to prevent the onset of COVID-19 from seven days after Dose 2 was 
90.4% (95% CI 82.9,94.6). No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 17,312 Nuvaxovid 
participants compared with 4 cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 8,140 placebo recipients in the 
PP-EFF analysis set. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates for male 
and female participants and racial groups, and across participants with medical comorbidities 
associated with high risk of severe COVID-19. There were no meaningful differences in overall 
vaccine efficacy in participants who were at increased risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 
or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g., BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic lung 
disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). 
Efficacy results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when strains classified as  
Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest were predominantly circulating in the two countries (US 
and Mexico) where the study was conducted. Sequencing data were available for 61 of the 77 endpoint

cases (79%). Of these, 48 out of 61 (79%) were identified as Variants of Concern or Variants of 
Interest. The most common Variants of Concern identified were Alpha with 31/61 cases (51%), Beta 
(2/61, 4%) and Gamma (2/61, 4%), while the most common Variants of Interest were Iota with 8/61 
cases (13%), and Epsilon (3/61, 5%). 
Efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The assessment of efficacy and immunogenicity of Nuvaxovid in adolescent participants 12 through 
17 years of age occurred in the United States in the ongoing paediatric expansion portion of the Phase 
3 multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled 2019nCoV-301 study. A total of 
1,799 participants, assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of Nuvaxovid (n=1,205) or placebo 
(n=594) by intramuscular injection 21 days apart, represented the Per Protocol Efficacy population. 
Participants with confirmed infection or prior infection due to SARSCoV-2 at the time of 
randomisation were not included in the primary efficacy analysis.  
Enrolment of adolescents completed in June 2021. Participants were followed for up to 24 months 
after the second dose for assessments of safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity against COVID-19. 
Following a 60-day safety follow-up period, initial adolescent recipients of placebo were invited to 
receive two injections of Nuvaxovid 21 days apart and initial recipients of Nuvaxovid to receive two 
injections of placebo 21 days apart (“blinded crossover”). All participants were offered the opportunity 
to continue to be followed in the study.  
COVID-19 was defined as first episode of PCR-confirmed mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with 
at least one or more of the predefined symptoms within each severity category. Mild COVID-19 was 
defined as fever, new onset cough or at least 2 or more additional COVID-19 symptoms.  
There were 20 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild COVID-19 (Nuvaxovid, n=6 [0.5%]; 
placebo, n=14 [2.4%]) resulting in a point estimate of efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI: 46.8%, 92.1%).  
At the time of this analysis, the Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages) variant of concern (VOC) was the 
predominant variant circulating in the US and accounted for all cases from which sequence data are 
available (11/20, 55%).  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age  
An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 14 days after Dose 2 (Day 35) was 
conducted in adolescent participants seronegative to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and PCR-
negative at baseline. Neutralising antibody responses were compared with those observed in 
seronegative/PCR-negative adult participants aged 18 through 25 years from the adult main study (Per 
Protocol Immunogenicity (PP-IMM) Analysis Set) as shown in Table 4. Noninferiority required that 
the following three criteria were met: lower bound of two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of geometric 
mean titers (GMTs) (GMT 12 through 17 years/GMT 18 through 25 years) > 0.67; point estimate of 
the ratio of GMTs ≥ 0.82; and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for difference of 
seroconversion rates (SCRs) (SCR 12 through 17 years minus SCR 18 through 25 years) > -10%. 
These noninferiority criteria were met.

Study 2 (2019nCoV-302)  
Study 2 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 
participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified 
by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded 
participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; current 
diagnosis or treatment for cancer; autoimmune disease/condition; received chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; 
bleeding disorder or continuous use of anticoagulants; history of allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis; 
were pregnant; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with 
clinically stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or 
hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 4 weeks before enrolment were included. Participants 
with known stable infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) were not 
excluded from enrolment. 
Enrolment was completed in November 2020. Participants were followed for up to 12 months after the 
primary vaccination series for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 
The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 14,039 participants who received either 
Nuvaxovid (n=7,020) or placebo (n=7,019), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at median 
21 days (IQR 21-23), range 16-45, did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not 
have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose (Table 5). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid, median age was 56.0 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 72% (n=5,067) were 18 to 
64 years old and 28% (n=1,953) were aged 65 to 84; 49% were female; 94% were White; 3% were 
Asian; 1% were multiple races, <1% were Black or African American; and <1% were Hispanic or 
Latino; and 45% had at least one comorbid condition.

been confirmed at the interim analysis. 
4 Based on the Clopper-Pearson model (due to few events), 95% CIs calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact binomial 
method adjusted for the total surveillance time. 
These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant 
was circulating in the UK. Identification of the Alpha variant was based on S gene target failure by 
PCR. Data were available for 95 of the 106 endpoint cases (90%). Of these, 66 out of 95 (69%) were 
identified as the Alpha variant with the other cases classified as non-Alpha. 
No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 7,020 Nuvaxovid participants compared with 4 
cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 7,019 placebo recipients in the PP-EFF analysis set. 
Licensed seasonal influenza vaccine co-administration sub-study 
Overall, 431 participants were co-vaccinated with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines; 217 sub-
study participants received Nuvaxovid and 214 received placebo. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and participants who 
received placebo. In the per-protocol immunogenicity (PP-IMM) analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid (n=191), median age was 40 years (range: 22 to 70 years); 93% (n=178) were 18 
to 64 years old and 7% (n=13) were aged 65 to 84; 43% were female; 75% were White; 23% were 
multiracial or from ethnic minorities; and 27% had at least one comorbid condition. Co-administration 
resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by hemagglutination 
inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to Nuvaxovid was noted as assessed by 
an anti-spike IgG assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did not receive 
concomitant influenza vaccine (see section 4.5 and section 4.8).  
Study 3 (2019nCoV-501)  
Study 3 was a Phase 2a/b, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 
HIV-negative participants 18 to 84 years of age and people living with HIV (PLWH) 18 to 64 years of 
age in South Africa. PLWH were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), receiving highly 
active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV-1 viral load of < 1000 copies/mL. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enrolment was completed in November 2020. 
The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 2,770 participants who received either 
Nuvaxovid (n=1,408) or placebo (n=1,362), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 on day 21), 
did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection through 7 days after the second dose. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received 
Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who 
received Nuvaxovid, median age was 28 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 40% were female; 91% were 
Black/African American; 2% were White; 3% were multiple races, 1% were Asian; and 2% were 
Hispanic or Latino; and 5.5% were HIV-positive. 
A total of 147 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases among all adult participants, 
seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, were accrued for the complete analysis (PP-EFF Analysis 
Set) of the primary efficacy endpoint, with 51 (3.62%) cases for Nuvaxovid versus 96 (7.05%) cases 
for placebo. The resultant vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). 
These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.351 (Beta) variant 
was circulating in South Africa.  
Booster dose 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older  
Study 2019nCoV-101, Part 2 
The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Nuvaxovid was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 
randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study administered as a single booster dose 
(Study 2019nCoV-101, Part 2) in healthy adult participants aged 18 to 84 years of age who were 
seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. A total of 254 participants (Full Analysis Set) received two 
doses of Nuvaxovid (0.5 mL, 5 micrograms 3 weeks apart) as the primary vaccination series. A subset 
of 104 participants received a booster dose of Nuvaxovid approximately 6 months after receiving 
Dose 2 of the primary series. A single booster dose of Nuvaxovid induced an. approximate 96-fold 
increase in neutralising antibodies from a GMT of 63 pre-booster (Day 189) to a GMT of 6,023 post-
booster (Day 217) and an approximate 4.1-fold increase from a peak GMT (14 days post-Dose 2) of 
1,470. 
Study 2019nCoV-501 
In Study 3, a Phase 2a/b randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study, the safety and 
immunogenicity of booster dose was evaluated in healthy HIV-negative adult participants 18 to 
84 years of age and medically stable PLWH 18 to 64 years of age who were seronegative to SARS-
CoV-2 at baseline. A total of 1,173 participants (PP-IMM Analysis Set) received a booster dose of 
Nuvaxovid approximately 6 months after completion of the primary series of Nuvaxovid (Day 201). 
An approximate 52-fold increase in neutralising antibodies was shown from a GMT of 69 pre-booster 
(Day 201) to a GMT of 3,600 post-booster (Day 236) and an approximate 5.2-fold increase from a 
peak GMT (14 days post-Dose 2) of 694. 
Safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines given as booster doses following completion of a 
primary vaccination series with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated in an 
independent study in the UK.  
The independent, multicentre, randomised, controlled, Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (CoV-
BOOST, EudraCT 2021-002175-19) investigated the immunogenicity of a booster in adults aged 30 
years and older with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nuvaxovid was 
administered at least 70 days after completion of a ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) primary 
vaccination series or at least 84 days after completion of a BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) primary 
vaccination series. Neutralising antibody titers measured by a wild-type assay were assessed 28 days 
post-booster dose. Within the group assigned to receive Nuvaxovid, 115 participants received a two-
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose primary series of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and 114 participants received a two-dose primary series of 
BNT162b2, prior to receiving a single booster dose (0.5 mL) of Nuvaxovid. Nuvaxovid (Original, 
Wuhan strain) demonstrated a booster response regardless of the vaccine used for primary vaccination. 
Booster dose in Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The effectiveness of booster doses of Nuvaxovid in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age is inferred 
from data gathered for booster doses of the vaccine in adults in studies 2019nCoV-101 and 2019nCoV-
501, as Nuvaxovid has been shown to induce a comparable immune response and effectiveness after 
the primary series in adolescents as in adults, and the ability to boost the vaccine-induced immune 
response was shown in adults.  
Elderly population 
Nuvaxovid was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid was 
consistent between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger individuals (18 to 64 years) for the primary series. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Nuvaxovid in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19, see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat-dose 
toxicity, local tolerance and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
In vitro genotoxicity studies were conducted with the Matrix-M adjuvant. The adjuvant was shown to 
be non-genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed. Carcinogenicity is not expected. 
Reproductive toxicity 
A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rats administered four 
intramuscular doses (two prior to mating; two during gestation) of 5 micrograms SARS-CoV-2 rS 
protein (approximately 200-fold excess relative to the human dose of 5 micrograms on a weight-
adjusted basis) with 10 micrograms Matrix-M adjuvant (approximately 40-fold excess relative to the 
human dose of 50 micrograms on a weight-adjusted basis). No vaccine-related adverse effects on 
fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring through post-natal 
Day 21 were observed.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection 
COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) 
This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you. 
•  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
•  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
•  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Nuvaxovid is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid 
3.  How Nuvaxovid is given 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Nuvaxovid 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1. What Nuvaxovid is and what it is used for 
Nuvaxovid is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
Nuvaxovid is given to individuals 12 years of age and older. 
The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and 
specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection against COVID-19. None 
of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19. 
2. What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid 
Nuvaxovid should not be given  
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid if: 
•  you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Nuvaxovid in the past, 
•  you have ever fainted following any needle injection, 
•  you have a high fever (over 38°C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if 
you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold, 
•  you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots, 
•  your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or 
cancer medicines). 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Nuvaxovid (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days.  
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.   
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
you are given Nuvaxovid. 
As with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of Nuvaxovid may not fully protect all those who 
receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children 
Nuvaxovid is not recommended for children aged below 12 years. Currently, there is no information 
available on the use of Nuvaxovid in children younger than 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Nuvaxovid 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the side effects of Nuvaxovid listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
reduce your ability to drive and use machines (for example, feeling faint or lightheaded or feeling very 
tired).  
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Nuvaxovid contains sodium and potassium  
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. How Nuvaxovid is given 
Individuals 12 years of age and older  
Nuvaxovid will be given to you as two separate 0.5 mL injections. 
Your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle, usually in your upper arm.  
It is recommended that you receive the second dose of Nuvaxovid 3 weeks after your first dose to 
receive the full course of this vaccine. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A booster dose of Nuvaxovid may be given approximately 3 months after the second dose in 
individuals 12 years of age and older. 
During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will watch over you 
for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. 
If you miss an appointment for your second injection of Nuvaxovid ask your doctor or nurse for 
advice. If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID-19. 
4. Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side 
effects go away within a few days of appearing. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse. 
As with other vaccines, you may feel pain or discomfort at the injection site, or you may see some 
redness and swelling at this site. However, these reactions usually clear up within a few days.

1. What Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is given to individuals 12 years of age and older. 
The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and 
specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection against COVID-19. None 
of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19. 
2. What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 should not be given  
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 if: 
•  you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Nuvaxovid or Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 in the past, 
•  you have ever fainted following any needle injection, 
•  you have a high fever (over 38°C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if 
you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold, 
•  you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots, 
•  your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or 
cancer medicines).

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Nuvaxovid (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days.  
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
you are given Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5. 
As with any vaccine, a single dose of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who receive 
it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children 
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is not recommended for children aged below 12 years. Currently, there is no 
information available on the use of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 in children younger than 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the side effects of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may 
temporarily reduce your ability to drive and use machines (for example, feeling faint or lightheaded or 
feeling very tired).  
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 contains sodium and potassium  
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. How Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 is given 
Individuals 12 years of age and older  
Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 will be given to you as a single dose 0.5 mL injection. 
If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle, usually in your upper arm.

for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. 
Additional doses (0.5 mL) of Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5 may be administered at the discretion of your 
physician, taking into consideration your clinical conditions in line with national recommendations.  
Immunocompromised individuals 
If your immune system does not work properly additional doses may be administered in line with 
national recommendations.

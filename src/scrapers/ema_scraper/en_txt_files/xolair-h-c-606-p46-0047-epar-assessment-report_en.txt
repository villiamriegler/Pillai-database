Introduction 
On Aug 15 2015, the MAH submitted the study CIGE025AIN01 including pediatric subjects for 
Xolair, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal 
products for paediatric use.  
Study CIGE025AIN01 was an open-label, noncomparative, clinical decision based post marketing 
surveillance study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with severe 
asthma.  
Xolair is approved as add-on therapy to children 6-12 years of age to improve asthma control in 
patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to 
a perennial aeroallergen and frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have 
had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. A similar indication is approved for 
adolescents and adults. It is also indicated for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above) 
with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to standard of care. 
A short critical expert overview has been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CIGE025AIN01 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Xolair, as approved in India was used in this study.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Study CIGE025AIN01 (last patient last visit on 28-Dec-2014) was an open-label, post marketing 
surveillance study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with severe 
asthma. This study was conducted at 27 centers across India, and enrolled male and female 
patients ≥12 and ≤75 years of age. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study CIGE025AIN01 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect in asthma control and if any reduction in 
medication requirement occurred in patients having inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe 
persistent allergic asthma (GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma), Stage IV) treated with omalizumab 
(Xolair® ).

Primary objectives 
• 
Evaluation of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma at the end of 16, 28 and 52 weeks. 
Secondary objectives 
•  Reduction in OCS use in patients at baseline and 16, 28 and 52 weeks. 
•  Number of days missed in work or college, at baseline and 16, 28 and 52 weeks. 
•  Use of other asthma maintenance medication / rescue medication at baseline and 16, 28 
and 52 weeks. 
•  Worsening of asthma symptoms i.e. hospitalization, emergency room visits and 
unscheduled doctor visits, at 16, 28 and 52 weeks. 
• 
• 
Lung function tests (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC) at screening, 16, 28 and 52 weeks. 
Improvement in Asthma Control Score Questionnaire (ACQ) (all visits). 
Study design 
This was a multi-center, open-label, non-comparative, clinical decision based postmarketing 
surveillance (PMS) study. Selection of patients for the study was at discretion of treating physician 
which was based on the inclusion & exclusion criterion. 
The potential patients were screened 2 weeks prior to initiation of treatment, and during this period 
tests like spirometry, Serum IgE, serum allergy test, physical examination, pregnancy test  
(for female patients), Asthma Control Score Questionnaire (ACQ-5) were conducted. Patients 
inform written consent was obtained before the screening process. Patient’s were given a patient 
diary where he/she was required to fill his/her day-to-day details like whether he has taken 
medicine (morning and evening, what dose?, did he require any rescue medication, if yes which 
one did he take, at what dosage?, Did he miss day at work or college?, did he had any 
exacerbation? Was he hospitalized? Physician’s/attending clinician’s later asked them about these 
details during filling up data in CRF. 
At the end of the 16 week period, patients were evaluated for primary and secondary outcomes. 
Those patients who responded to omalizumab therapy at week 16 were included in the next phase, 
which continued to week 28. Patients who responded at 28 weeks based on primary and secondary 
outcome continued to receive the same dose of omalizumab until week 52. 
CHMP comment: 
It is unclear from the clinical study report how the primary endpoint is evaluated. Two weeks 
before entrance in the study seems to be a short period of historical baseline data to be able to 
make efficacy conclusions in a 52 week long study.  
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 127 patients enrolled in this trial. Ninety-four patients completed 16 weeks follow-up,  
54 patients completed 28 weeks follow up, and 39 completed 52 weeks follow up. The primary 
reason for early discontinuation at 16 weeks was withdrawal of informed consent. More male 
patients enrolled than females (61% vs 39%) and the mean age was 48.39 years. Seven pediatric 
patients enrolled in this trial (5 males and 2 females), ranging in age from 12-17 years old.

The number of patients having asthma exacerbations decreased from 44.44% at baseline to 8.70% 
after 16 weeks (p<0.0001) and to 2.63% at the end of the 52 weeks (p<0.0001). At baseline 52 
exacerbations were reported out of 117 patients. Improvement in exacerbations was observed in 
44 (84.62%) patients after 16 weeks and 51 (98.08%) patients after 52 weeks. Patients were 
considered responders at 16 weeks if they met 7 pre-defined responder criteria. Out of the 94 
patients who were evaluated at 16 weeks, 91 patients responded to omalizumab therapy (96.81% 
response rate) based on meeting these responder criteria. The number of days of missed 
college/work due to asthma exacerbations was reduced from 45.30% of patients at baseline to 
5.43% of patients at week 16 and this was further reduced to 2.63% of patients at 52 weeks after 
starting omalizumab therapy.

The mean ACQ composite score reduced significantly (p=0.0001) from 12.87 (5.19) at baseline to 
9.07 (5.30) after 16 weeks, a reduction in 40.10% from baseline. Further therapy with omalizumab 
reduced the mean ACQ score to 5.59 (5.64), a reduction by 63.10% after 52 weeks (p<0.0001). 
Overall reduction in OCS use with omalizumab therapy was observed in 70.93% patients at week 
16 and 82.56% patients at 52 weeks. 
CHMP comment: 
A significant effect was seen in the primary endpoint in this open study. However, only patients 
responding on treatment continued in the study after week 16 and week 28. The mean ACQ score 
was reduced and there were trends towards response in the secondary endpoints but no p-values 
are given. It is doubtful if it is possible to draw any efficacy conclusions from this study since it 
seems that the historic period for comparison is only two weeks. At least this is unclear because of 
scarce information from the MAH. 
Safety results 
A total of 21 (16.54%) patients developed AEs, which included 2 patients suffering from SAEs  
(one patient was hospitalized due to chest pain and another patient suffered diarrhea) while taking 
omalizumab. In both events, the causality was reported as “Not-Assessable” and the outcome of 
these events were “Improving Condition.” 
Fourteen (11.02%) patients each had cough and dyspnea. All these events were non-serious and 
causality for 22 patients was reported as “Not Suspected” and “Not Suspected/Not assessable” 
for 6 patients. Eleven (8.66%) patients had asthma exacerbations that were nonserious (causality 
for 8 of these patients was not suspected, 2 were not assessable/not suspected and 1 remaining 
was not assessable). 
No patients reported AEs that met the criteria of AESI. 
CHMP comment:  
No new or unexpected safety events were identified. 
Pediatric summary 
As noted above, 7 pediatric patients were enrolled in this trial, ranging in age from 12-17 years. 
There was no separate analysis of pediatric patients in this study. According to the study database, 
one patient suffered 3 AEs during the study. These events were rhinitis, breathlessness, and cough. 
Rhinitis resolved after 6 days and breathlessness and cough were continuing at the time the patient 
completed the trial. None of these events were serious and no further details were provided. 
CHMP comment: 
No separate analyses or listing of the paediatric patients could be found by the CHMP in the clinical 
study report. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study CIGE025AIN01 was an open-label, noncomparative, post marketing study performed in 
India. There was no separate analysis of the seven pediatric patients in the study. This is a 
weakness of the submitted material. Moreover, the clinical study report was very short and detailed 
information about the study was lacking. However, no unexpected findings were noted. The effect

of omalizumab (Xolair®) in patients with asthma was as expected and no unexpected safety issues 
occurred.

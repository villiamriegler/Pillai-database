SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Xeljanz in the approved indications remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
• 
Important safety issues have been identified: 
Signal of increased all-cause mortality identified by the 
MAH in completed study A3921133 (which is classified as 
“closed” by the MAH for the purposes of the renewal). 
The MAH reopened the signal “all-cause mortality” after 
completion of the clinical study A3921133. However, based 
on the information provided (a short summary of MAH’s 
Page 6/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment of their reopened signal) no final conclusions 
can be drawn by the PRAC on the signal of all-cause 
mortality as not all data of the completed study have been 
provided. The PRAC does not support the MAH’s conclusion 
that the signal of all-cause mortality can be refuted. The 
final study report was expected to be submitted for 
assessment in August 2021, however the MAH did not 
submit this yet and therefore has classified the A3921133 
study as on-going for the purposes of this renewal. 
Complete data on the final study results are necessary for 
proper assessment. With submission of the final study 
report, KM curves for all-cause mortality, CV death and 
death associated with infections should be also provided. 
Further, a tabulated list of individual causes of death (e.g. 
CV mortality should be further specified) should be also 
provided as well as assessment of possible risk factors for 
death. The final study report of study A3921133 is awaited 
and once available, the results will then be further 
assessed. No further action within the scope of the renewal 
is required. The conclusions of the renewal procedure are 
without prejudice to the conclusions of the ongoing 
assessment of the final study report of study A3921133.

tofacitinib-treated patients that, at 12 months treatment, 
had D-dimer level ≥2× ULN versus those with D-dimer 
level <2× ULN; this was not evident in TNF inhibitor 
treated patients. Interpretation is limited by the low 
number of VTE events and restricted D dimer test 
availability (only assessed at Baseline, Month 12, and at 
the end of the study). In patients who did not have a VTE 
during the study, mean D-dimer levels were significantly 
reduced at Month 12 relative to Baseline across all 
treatment arms. However, D-dimer levels ≥2× ULN at 
Month 12 were observed in approximately 30% of patients 
without subsequent VTE events, indicating limited 
specificity of D Dimer testing in this study. 
Therefore, for patients with RA with known risk factors for 
VTE, it is recommended to consider testing D-dimer levels 
after approximately 12 months of treatment. If D-dimer 
test result is ≥ 2× ULN and confirm that clinical benefits 
outweigh risks prior to a decision on treatment continuation 
with tofacitinib. 
Information on VTE in the Guide for Healthcare 
professional, and prescriber treatment maintenance 
checklist have also been updated in addition to the 
prescribing information to include information regarding 
testing D-dimer levels after approximately 12 months of 
treatment in patients with RA with known risk factors for 
VTE. This is reflected in annex IID of the product

order to include the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to 
a prior disease modifying antirheumatic drug 
therapy; as an alternative to the immediate release 
film-coated tablets; Section 4.2 of Xeljanz film-
coated tablets is also updated to include switching 
with the prolonged-release tablet in the treatment of 
PsA. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The RMP version 13.1 has also been submitted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
the treatment of PsA patients was based on extrapolation 
from the immediate release (IR) formulation data by means 
of an exposure-response (E/R) based bridging approach, 
given that the efficacy of the prolonged release formulation 
was previously established as similar to that of IR in RA 
patients, using both interventional and non-interventional 
data.  
Based on the demonstrated bioequivalence between PR and 
IR formulations in terms of AUC and Cmax, and considering 
the 29% lower Cmin for PR 11 mg QD compared to IR 5 mg 
BID, the fluctuation in exposure with the PR formulation 
has no impact on the efficacy that is substantially driven by 
the overall exposure expressed in terms of AUC or Cavg. 
The Longitudinal E/R analysis confirmed that although 
Page 10/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data 
Cmin, Cmax and Cavg have a similar impact in terms of 
predictability of a clinical response, both in PsA and PsO 
patients, Cmin has a lower ability to predict efficacy. 
Moreover, as already demonstrated in RA patients, the 
onset of clinical response in PsA patients in terms of ACR 
20, 50 and 70 needs a longer time period (10-13 weeks for 
ACR20/50 and 15-19 weeks for ACR70) than time to reach 
steady-state (5-10 days), confirming that the efficacy 
outcome depends on the maintained exposure over time. 
Overall, the data presented demonstrated that 11 mg 
prolonged-release formulation once a day can be used in 
PsA patients. 
No new safety signals emerged from the submitted 
analysis: a comparison between PsA and RA patients who 
were treated with the IR formulation (5 and 10 mg BID) 
across the different clinical trials. The safety profile seems 
to be consistent between RA and PsA indications, with even 
a tendency towards more unfavourable effects of treatment 
in the RA population regardless of the formulations, likely 
attributable to the nature of disease and longer drug 
exposure. However, the increased incidence of serious 
infections noted in the Corrona registry with the PR 
formulation was noted and reflected in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC as follows: Data from a non-interventional post 
approval safety study that evaluated tofacitinib in RA 
patients from a registry (US Corrona) showed that a 
numerically higher incidence rate of serious infection was 
observed for the 11 mg prolonged-release tablet 
administered once daily than the 5 mg film-coated tablet 
administered twice daily. Crude incidence rates (95% CI) 
(i.e., not adjusted for age or sex) from availability of each 
formulation at 12 months following initiation of treatment 
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were 3.45 (1.93, 5.69) and 2.78 (1.74, 4.21) and at 36 
months were 4.71 (3.08, 6.91) and 2.79 (2.01, 3.77) 
patients with events per 100 patient-years in the 11 mg 
prolonged-release tablet once daily and 5 mg film-coated 
tablet twice daily groups, respectively. The unadjusted 
hazard ratio was 1.30 (95% CI: 0.67, 2.50) at 12 months 
and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.15, 3.24) at 36 months for the 11 mg 
prolonged-release once daily dose compared to the 5 mg 
film-coated twice daily dose. Data is based on a small 
number of patients with events observed with relatively 
large confidence intervals and limited follow up time.

PASS US Corrona RA Registry. This observational study 
conducted in the US, included patients with RA and 
compared the safety of tofacitinib with bDMARDs. Based on 
the result of this study no update to the product 
information was required. In RMP version 10.1 the 
information regarding category 3 PASS US Corrona RA 
Registry has been updated to reflect that this study has 
been completed. All corresponding sections of the RMP 
have been updated accordingly.

The study results showed that overall adverse events,

arthritis (PsA), listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. An updated RMP version 11.1 has also been 
venous thromboembolism, malignancy, major adverse 
cardiac events, hepatic events, and laboratory abnormality

treated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects. As expected,

update the milestones for study A3921347 (US UC 
active surveillance study) in the RMP.

tofacitinib 10 mg BID ("bis in die" twice a day) dose 
showed worse safety profile than to the 5 mg BID dose. 
Mortality rate was low and no death event was judged by 
the investigator to be associated with tofacitinib. 
Tofacitinib’s safety profile in PsA subjects was consistent 
with that of RA subjects, with slightly lower rates in the PsA 
dataset possibly related to shorter tofacitinib exposure in 
this setting. Overall, no new safety signals were observed. 
Tofacitinib’s safety profile is adequately reflected and risks 
can be mitigated or managed as described in the SmPC and 
RMP. Data support long term 5 mg BID tofacitinib use for 
PsA treatment in adult subjects and are appropriately 
reflected in the current version of the SmPC.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Liumjev 
insulin lispro 
On 30 January 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Liumjev, 
intended for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. 
The applicant for this medicinal product is Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. 
Liumjev will be available as solution for injection (100 units/ml and 200 units/ml). The active substance of 
Liumjev is insulin lispro, a fast-acting insulin analogue (ATC code: A10AB04) which is absorbed more rapidly 
by the body and can therefore act faster than injected human insulin. 
The benefits with Liumjev are its ability to control blood glucose levels. The most common side effect is 
hypoglycaemia. 
The full indication is: “Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults”.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

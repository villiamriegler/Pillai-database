RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for CYD dengue Vaccine (Dengue tetravalent 
vaccine [live, attenuated]) 
This is a summary of risk management plan (RMP) for CYD dengue vaccine. The RMP details 
important risks of CYD dengue vaccine, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about CYD dengue vaccine’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
CYD dengue vaccine’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) 
give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how CYD dengue 
vaccine should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for CYD dengue vaccine should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of CYD 
dengue vaccine’s RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
CYD dengue vaccine is authorized for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus 
serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in individuals 6 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection 
confirmed by a test. Previous dengue infection has to be confirmed by a test, either document in 
medical history or performed prior to vaccination. In non-endemic areas or low transmission 
settings, testing performed prior to vaccination should be limited to individuals who have been in 
potential contact with dengue virus (eg, individuals who lived before or had recurrent stay in 
endemic areas) and who are likely to be exposed to dengue in the future. For information on 
local endemicity refer to official information. Endemic areas are defined as areas where the 
disease is present over the majority of time during the year in the native population with 
documented outbreaks or epidemics. The use of DENGVAXIA should be in accordance with 
official local recommendations (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains CYD dengue 
vaccine as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the 
upper arm in the region of deltoid. 
Further information about the evaluation of CYD dengue vaccine’s benefits can be found in 
CYD dengue vaccine’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of CYD dengue vaccine, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about CYD dengue vaccine’s risks, are outlined in the next 
sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of CYD dengue vaccine, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of CYD dengue vaccine is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of CYD dengue vaccine are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of CYD dengue vaccine. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing 
and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important Potential risk: Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine  
The dengue vaccine has been made using some parts of the YF vaccine therefore 
viscerotropism is considered as theoretical risks for dengue vaccine. This risk is 
known to occur very rarely following YF vaccination.  
From all these sources regarding the use of CYD dengue vaccine, there was no case 
of YEL-AVD reported.  
Risk factors and risk groups   The risk of developing signs and symptoms of YEL-AVD was considered to be 
associated with advanced age (over 60 years of age) and history of diseases of the 
thymus. 
However, as described in a recent publication on postmarketing safety surveillance of 
YF vaccine STAMARIL, the risk of YEL-AVD after vaccination does not appear to be 
higher in adults older than 60 years, compared with younger adults.

DNG15 Cohort Event Monitoring study 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety profile of CYD dengue vaccine when used in the 
real-world immunization setting.  
The secondary objective is to identify risk factors for hospitalized dengue disease (severe or not) among subjects 
vaccinated with CYD dengue vaccine and to describe the frequency of hospitalized dengue disease and/or other SAEs 
or selected AEs according to the number of CYD dengue vaccine doses and/or interval between doses. The 
exploratory objective is to describe, by country, the population vaccinated with DENGVAXIA in the real-world 
immunization setting, according to age, gender, number of doses received and interval between doses, dengue test 
performed before vaccination, comorbidities including immunosuppression, co-vaccination, history of recent 
vaccination, history of dengue, misuse (eg, use outside of approved age groups, use in pregnancy and lactation. 
DNG16 Pregnancy registry 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of CYD-Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in pregnant 
women and their offsprings inadvertently exposed during pregnancy or up to 30 days preceding their last menstrual 
period with regards to maternal, pregnancy, birth, neonatal and infant outcomes.  
Hospitalized dengue cases in infants will be collected up to 1 year after birth. 
CYD69 and DNG10042 Effectiveness studies 
Purpose of the study:  
CYD69 and DNG10042:The objective is to assess the vaccine effectiveness at the community level, as well as 
effectiveness at reducing frequency of hospitalization and severe forms of dengue disease. In addition, these studies 
will provide a platform to identify a potential increase in disease severity and a potential waning of protection over time. 
CYD65 Dose schedule and booster study 
Purpose of the study: The studies evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Given in 1-, 
2-, or 3-Dose Schedules Followed by a Single Booster 
CYD50 Exposure in HIV+ population 
Purpose of the study: Immunogenicity and safety in HIV+ adult subjects with stable clinical condition under antiretroviral 
therapy

Purpose of the study: A cross-sectional survey to evaluate vaccinator’s knowledge and understanding of the safety 
messages following DENGVAXIA PI updates in Europe.
